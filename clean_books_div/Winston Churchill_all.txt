a far country by <name> churchill book 1 .
i .
my name is <name> paret .
i was a corporation lawyer , but by no means a typical one , the choice of my profession being merely incidental , and due , as <name> be seen , to the accident of environment .
the book i am about to write might aptly be called the autobiography of a <unk> .
in that sense , if in no other , i have been a typical american , regarding my country as the happy <unk> of enlightened self-interest , as a function of my desires .
whether or not i have completely got rid of this romantic <unk> i must leave to those the aim of whose existence is to eradicate it from our literature and our life .
a somewhat <unk> task !
i have been impelled therefore to make an attempt at setting forth , with what frankness and sincerity i may , with those powers of selection of which i am capable , the life i have lived in this modern <name> ; the passions i have known , the evils i have done .
i endeavour to write a biography of the inner life ; but in order to do this i shall have to relate those <unk> experiences of the outer existence that take place in the world of space and time , in the four walls of the home , in the school and university , in the noisy streets , in the realm of business and politics .
i shall try to set down , impartially , the motives that have impelled my actions , to reveal in some degree the amazing mixture of good and evil which has made me what i am to-day : to avoid the tricks of memory and resist the inherent <name> to present myself other and better than i am .
your american <unk> is a sentimental spoiled child who believes in miracles , whose needs are mostly <unk> , whose desires are dreams .
expediency is his motto .
innocent of a knowledge of the principles of the universe , he lives in a state of ceaseless activity , admitting no limitations , impatient of all restrictions .
what he wants , he wants very badly indeed .
this wanting things was the <unk> of my character , and i believe that the science of the future <name> bear me out when i say that it might have been differently built upon .
certain it is that the system of education in vogue in the 70 's and 80 's never contemplated the search for natural <unk> .
at all events , when i look back upon the boy i was , i see the beginnings of a real person who fades little by little as manhood arrives and advances , until suddenly i am aware that a stranger has taken his place ... .
i lived in a city which is now some twelve hours distant from the atlantic seaboard .
a very different city , too , it was in youth , in my grandfather 's day and my father 's , even in my own boyhood , from what it has since become in this most material of ages .
there is a book of my photographs , preserved by my mother , which i have been looking over lately .
first is presented a plump child of two , gazing in smiling <unk> upon a world of <name> ; later on a <name> boy in <unk> <unk> , whose wavy , <unk> hair has been most carefully parted on the side by <name> , his nurse .
the face is still childish .
then appears a youth of fourteen or <unk> in long trousers and the queerest of short jackets , standing beside a marble table against a classic background ; he is smiling still in undiminished <name> and trust , despite increasing vexations and crossings , meaningless lessons which had to be learned , <unk> to rack an aspiring soul , and long , uncomfortable hours in the stiff pew of the first presbyterian church .
associated with this torture is a peculiar <name> smell and the faint rustling of silk dresses .
i can see the stern black figure of dr .
pound , who made interminable statements to the lord .
" oh , lord , " i can hear him say , " thou knowest ... " these pictures , though <unk> and faded , suggest vividly the being i once was , the feelings that possessed and animated me , love for my playmates , vague impulses struggling for expression in a world forever <unk> them .
i recall , too , innocent dreams of a future <unk> , dreams from which i emerged vibrating with an energy that was lost for lack of a definite objective : yet it was constantly being renewed .
i often wonder what i might have become if it could have been harnessed , directed !
speculations are vain .
<unk> , though it had begun to make <unk> , was still a force in those days , <unk> to spontaneity and human instincts .
and when i think of <unk> i see , not dr .
pound , who preached it , but my father , who practised and embodied it .
i loved him , but he made of righteousness a stern and terrible thing implying not <name> , but punishment , the suppression rather than the expansion of aspirations .
his religion seemed woven all of <unk> , contained no shining threads to catch my eye .
dreams , to him , were matters for suspicion and distrust .
i sometimes ask myself , as i gaze upon his portrait now , the duplicate of the one painted for the bar association , whether he ever could have felt the secret , hot thrills i knew and did not identify with religion .
his religion was real to him , though he failed utterly to make it comprehensible to me .
the apparent calmness , <unk> of his life awed me .
a successful lawyer , a respected and trusted citizen , was he lacking somewhat in <unk> , vitality ?
i can not judge him , even to-day .
i never knew him .
there were times in my youth when the curtain of his unfamiliar spirit was withdrawn a little : and once , after i had passed the crisis of some childhood disease , i awoke to find him bending over my bed with a tender expression that surprised and puzzled me .
he was well educated , and from his portrait a shrewd observer might divine in him a genteel taste for literature .
the fine features bear witness to the influence of an american environment , yet suggest the intellectual englishman of <name> <name> 's time .
the face is distinguished , <unk> , the chestnut hair lighter and thinner than my own ; the side whiskers are not too <unk> , the eyes <unk> .
there is a large black cravat crossed and held by a <unk> pin , and the coat has odd , narrow <unk> .
his habits of mind were english , although he <unk> well enough with the manners and traditions of a city whose inheritance was <unk> ; and he invariably drank tea for breakfast .
one of my earliest recollections is of the silver breakfast service and <unk> which my great-grandfather brought with him from <unk> to philadelphia shortly after the revolution .
his son , dr. <name> moreton paret , after whom i was named , was the best known physician of the city in the decorous , second bank days .
my mother was <name> breck .
hers was my <unk> side .
old <name> breck , her grandfather , undaunted by sea or wilderness , had come straight from belfast to the little log settlement by the great river that <unk> then the mantle of primeval forest on the hills .
so much for chance .
he kept a store with a side porch and <unk> windows , where hams and sides of bacon and sugar loaves in blue glazed paper <name> beside ploughs and calico prints , barrels of flour , of molasses and rum , all of which had been somehow marvellously transported over the passes of those forbidding mountains ,  passes we <unk> thread to-day in dining cars and compartment sleepers .
behind the store were moored the barges that floated down on the swift current to the ohio , carrying goods to even remoter settlements in the western wilderness .
<name> , in addition to his emigrant 's leather box , brought with him some of that pigment that was to dye the locality for generations a deep blue .
i refer , of course , to his <unk> .
and in order the better to ensure to his progeny the <unk> of this dye , he married the granddaughter of a famous divine , celebrated in the annals of new england ,  no doubt with some injustice ,  as a staunch advocate on the doctrine of infant damnation .
my cousin <name> breck had old <unk> portrait , which has since gone to the <unk> 's .
heaven knows who painted it , though no great <name> were needed to suggest on canvas the tough fabric of that <unk> , who was more <name> than scotch .
the heavy stick he holds might , with a slight stretch of the imagination , be a <unk> ; his head looks capable of <unk> many blows ; his hand of giving many .
and , as i gazed the other day at this picture hanging in the shabby suburban parlour , i could only contrast him with his <unk> descendants who possessed the likeness .
between the children of poor <name> <unk> ,  cousin <name> 's daughter , and the hardy stock of the old country there is a gap indeed !
<name> breck made the foundation of a fortune .
it was his son who built on the second bank the wide , <unk> mansion in which to house comfortably his eight children .
there , two tiers above the river , lived my paternal grandfather , dr. paret , the breck 's physician and friend ; the <unk> and the <unk> , <unk> ; the <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> ,  breck connections ,  the <unk> and <unk> ; in short , everyone of importance in the days between the <unk> and the civil war .
theirs were generous houses surrounded by shade trees , with glorious back yards  i have been told  where apricots and pears and peaches and even nectarines grew .
the business of breck and company , wholesale <unk> , descended to my mother 's first cousin , <name> breck , who lived at <unk> .
the very sound of that word once sufficed to give me a shiver of delight ; but the <unk> i knew has disappeared as completely as <unk> , and the place is now a suburb ( hateful word ! )
cut up into building lots and connected with boyne street and the business section of the city by trolley lines .
then it was " the country , " and fairly saturated with romance .
cousin <name> , when he came into town to spend his days at the store , brought with him some of this romance , i had almost said of this aroma .
he was no <unk> , but rural to the backbone , professing a most proper contempt for dwellers in towns .
every summer day that dawned held <unk> as a possibility .
and such was my capacity for <name> that my appetite would depart completely when i heard my mother say , questioningly and with proper <unk> respect  " if you 're really going off on a business trip for a day or two , mr. paret " ( she generally addressed my father thus formally ) , " i think i'll go to <name> 's and take <name> . "
" shall i tell <name> to pack , mother , " i would exclaim , starting up .
" we 'll see what your father thinks , my dear . "
" remain at the table until you are excused , <name> , " he would say .
released at length , i would rush to <name> , who always rejoiced with me , and then to the wire fence which marked the boundary of the peters domain next door , eager , with the refreshing lack of consideration characteristic of youth , to announce to the <unk>  who were to remain at home the news of my good fortune .
there would be <name> and <name> and <name> and <name> and little <name> with her <unk> knees , faring forth to seek the adventures of a new day in the shady western yard .
<name> was too young not to look wistful at my news , but the others pretended indifference , seeking to lessen my triumph .
and it was <name> who invariably retorted " we can go out to uncle <name> 's farm whenever we want to .
ca n't we , <name> ? " ...
no journey ever taken since has equalled in ecstasy that leisurely trip of thirteen miles in the <unk> railroad that wound through hot fields of nodding corn tassels and between delicious , <unk> woods to <unk> .
no silent palace " sleeping in the sun , " no edifice decreed by <unk> khan could have worn more glamour than the house of cousin <name> breck .
it stood half a mile from the drowsy village , deep in its own grounds amidst lawns splashed with shadows , with gravel paths edged  in barbarous fashion , if you please with shells .
there were flower beds of equally barbarous design ; and two iron deer , which , like the figures on keats 's grecian urn , were ever ready poised to flee ,  and yet never fled .
for cousin <name> was <name> , as riches went in those days : not only <name> , but comfortable .
stretching behind the house were sweet meadows of hay and red clover basking in the heat , orchards where the cows cropped beneath the trees , <unk> where purple clusters of <unk> <name> beneath warm leaves : there were woods beyond , into which , under the guidance of <name> breck , i made adventurous excursions , and in the autumn gathered <unk> and walnuts .
the house was a rambling , wooden mansion painted grey , with red <unk> on its porches and horsehair furniture inside .
oh , the smell of its darkened interior on a midsummer day !
like the flavour of that choicest of tropical fruits , the <unk> , it <unk> analysis , and the nearest i can come to it is a mixture of matting and <unk> , with another element too subtle to define .
the hospitality of that house !
one would have thought we had arrived , my mother and i , from the ends of the earth , such was the welcome we got from cousin <name> , cousin <name> 's wife , from <name> and <name> with the <unk> <unk> , from <name> , whom i recall as permanently without shoes or stockings .
met and embraced by cousin <name> at the station and driven to the house in the <unk> surrey , the moment we arrived she and my mother would put on the <unk> i associated with hot weather , and sit sewing all day long in <unk> at the <unk> end of the piazza .
the women of that day scorned lying down , except at night , and as evening came on they donned <unk> dresses ; i recall in particular one my mother wore , with little vertical stripes of black and white , and a full skirt .
and how they talked , from the beginning of the visit until the end !
i have often since wondered where the topics came from .
it was not until nearly seven o'clock that the train arrived which brought home my cousin <name> .
he was a big man ; his features and even his ample moustache gave a disconcerting impression of rugged integrity , and i remember him chiefly in an alpaca or <unk> coat .
though much less formal , more democratic  in a word  than my father , i stood in awe of him for a different reason , and this i know now was because he possessed the penetration to discern the flaws in my youthful character ,  flaws that persisted in manhood .
none so quick as cousin <name> to detect <unk> which were hidden from my mother .
his hobby was <unk> , and he had a little shop beside the stable filled with shining tools which <name> and i , in spite of their attractions , were forbidden to touch .
<name> , by dire experience , had learned to keep the law ; but on one occasion i stole in alone , and promptly cut my finger with a chisel .
my mother and cousin <name> accepted the fiction that the injury had been done with a flint <unk> that <name> had given me , but when cousin <name> came home and saw my bound hand and heard the story , he gave me a certain look which sticks in my mind .
" wonderful people , those indians were ! "
he observed .
" they could make <unk> as sharp as <unk> . "
i was most uncomfortable ... .
he had a strong voice , and spoke with a rising inflection and a marked accent that still remains peculiar to our locality , although it was much modified in my mother and not at all noticeable in my father ; with an odd nasal alteration of the burr our <unk> ancestors had brought with them across the seas .
for instance , he always called my father mr. <unk> .
he had an admiration and respect for him that seemed to forbid the <unk> of " <name> . "
it was shared by others of my father 's friends and relations .
" <name> , " cousin <name> would say to my mother , " you 're <unk> that boy , you ought to <unk> him oftener .
hand him over to me for a couple of months  i 'll put him through his paces ... .
so you 're going to send him to college , are you ?
he 's too good for old <name> 's grocery business . "
he was very fond of my mother , though he lectured her soundly for her weakness in indulging me .
i can see him as he sat at the head of the supper table , carving liberal <unk> which <name> and <name> and <name> devoured with country appetites , watching our plates .
" what 's the matter , <name> ?
you have n't eaten all your lamb . "
" he does n't like fat , <name> , " my mother explained .
" i 'd teach him to like it if he were my boy . "
" well , <name> , he is n't your boy , " cousin <name> would remind him ... . his bark was worse than his bite .
like many kind people he made use of <unk> to hide an inner tenderness , and on the train he was hail fellow well met with every <name> , <name> and <name> that <unk> ,  although the word was not invented in those days ,  and the conductor and brakeman too .
but he had his standards , and held to them ... .
mine was not a questioning childhood , and i was willing to accept the scheme of things as presented to me entire .
in my <unk> years , when i had broken one of the commandments on my father 's tablet ( there were more than ten ) , and had , on his home-coming , been sent to bed , my mother would come softly upstairs after supper with a book in her hand ; a book of selected bible stories on which dr .
pound had set the seal of his approval , with a glazed picture cover , representing <name> in the <unk> den and an <name> standing beside him .
on the somewhat <unk> plea that holy writ might have a <unk> effect , she was permitted to minister to me in my shame .
the amazing adventure of shadrach , <unk> and <unk> particularly appealed to an imagination needing little <unk> .
it never occurred to me to doubt that these gentlemen had triumphed over <unk> laws .
but out of my window , at the back of the second <unk> , i often saw a sudden , crimson glow in the sky to the southward , as though that part of the city had caught fire .
there were the big <unk> , my mother told me , belonging to mr. durrett and mr. hambleton , the father of <name> hambleton and the grandfather of hambleton durrett , my schoolmates at miss <name> 's .
i invariably connected the glow , not with hambleton and <name> , but with shadrach , <unk> and <unk> !
later on , when my father took me to the <unk> , and i beheld with awe a huge pot filled with molten metal that ran out of it like water , i asked him  if i leaped into that stream , could god save me ?
he was shocked .
miracles , he told me , didn't happen any more .
" when did they stop ? "
i demanded .
" about two thousand years ago , my son , " he replied gravely .
" then , " said i , " no matter how much i believed in god , he would n't save me if i jumped into the big kettle for his sake ? "
for this i was properly rebuked and silenced .
my boyhood was filled with <unk> desires .
if god , for example , had cast down , out of his abundant store , manna and quail in the desert , why could n't he fling me a little pocket money ?
a paltry quarter of a dollar , let us say , which to me represented wealth .
to avoid the reproach of the pharisees , i went into the closet of my bed-chamber to pray , requesting that the quarter should be dropped on the north side of <unk> street , between <unk> and <unk> ; in short , as conveniently near home as possible .
then i issued forth , not feeling <unk> , but hoping .
<name> peters , leaning over the ornamental cast-iron fence which separated his front yard from the street , presently spied me scanning the sidewalk .
" what are you looking for , <name> ? "
he demanded with interest .
" oh , something i dropped , " i answered uneasily .
" what ? "
naturally , i refused to tell .
it was a broiling , midsummer day ; <name> and <name> , who had been warned to stay in the shade , but who were engaged in the experiment of throwing the yellow cat from the top of the lattice fence to see if she would alight on her feet , were presently attracted , and joined in the search .
the mystery which i threw around it added to its interest , and i was not <unk> annoyed .
suppose one of them were to find the quarter which god had intended for me ?
would that be justice ?
" it 's nothing , " i said , and pretended to abandon the quest  to be renewed later .
but this ruse failed ; they continued obstinately to search ; and after a few minutes <name> , with a shout , picked out of a hot crevice between the bricks  a nickel !
" it 's mine ! "
i cried fiercely .
" did you lose it ? "
demanded <name> , the canny one , as <name> was about to give it up .
my lying was generally reserved for my elders .
" n-no , " i said hesitatingly , " but it 's mine all the same .
it was  sent to me . "
" sent to you ! "
they exclaimed , in a chorus of protest and derision .
and how , indeed , was i to make good my claim ?
the <unk> , when assembled , were a clan , led by <name> and in matters of controversy , moved as one .
how was i to tell them that in answer to my prayers for twenty-five cents , god had deemed five all that was good for me ?
" some  somebody dropped it there for me . "
" who ? "
demanded the chorus .
" say , that 's a good one ! "
tears suddenly blinded me .
overcome by chagrin , i turned and flew into the house and upstairs into my room , locking the door behind me .
an interval ensued , during which i nursed my sense of wrong , and it pleased me to think that the money would bring a curse on the peters family .
at length there came a knock on the door , and a voice calling my name .
" <name> !
<name> ! "
it was <name> .
" hughie , wo n't you let me in ?
i want to give you the nickel . "
" keep it ! "
i shouted back .
" you found it . "
another interval , and then more knocking .
" open up , " he said <unk> .
" i  i want to talk to you . "
i relented , and let him in .
he pressed the coin into my hand .
i refused ; he pleaded .
" you found it , " i said , " it 's yours . "
" but  but you were looking for it . "
" that makes no difference , " i declared <unk> .
curiosity overcame him .
" say , hughie , if you did n't drop it , who on earth did ? "
" nobody on earth , " i replied <unk> ... .
naturally , i declined to reveal the secret .
nor was this by any means the only secret i held over the peters family , who never quite knew what to make of me .
they were not troubled with imaginations .
<name> was a little older than <name> and had a sharp tongue , but over him i exercised a distinct fascination , and i knew it .
literal himself , good-natured and <unk> , the gift i had of <unk> life with romance ( to put the thing <unk> ) , of creating kingdoms out of back yards  at which <name> and <name> sniffed  held his allegiance firm .
ii .
i must have been about twelve years of age when i realized that i was possessed of the bard 's inheritance .
a momentous journey i made with my parents to boston about this time not only stimulated this gift , but gave me the advantage of which other travellers before me have likewise availed themselves  of being able to take certain poetic liberties with a distant land that my friends at home had never seen .
often during the heat of summer <unk> when we were assembled under the big <name> beside the lattice fence in the peters ' yard , the spirit would move me to relate the most amazing of adventures .
our train , for instance , had been held up in the night by a band of robbers in black masks , and rescued by a traveller who bore a striking resemblance to my cousin <name> breck .
he had shot two of the robbers .
these <unk> , once started , flowed from me with ridiculous ease .
i experienced an unwonted exhilaration , exaltation ; i began to believe that they had actually occurred .
in vain the astute <name> asserted that there were no train robbers in the east .
what had my father done ?
well , he had been very brave , but he had had no pistol .
had i been frightened ?
no , not at all ; i , too , had wished for a pistol .
why had n't i spoken of this before ?
well , so many things had happened to me i could n't tell them all at once .
it was plain that <name> , though often fascinated against her <name> , deemed this sort of thing distinctly immoral .
i was a boy divided in two .
one part of me dwelt in a fanciful realm of his own weaving , and the other part was a commonplace and protesting inhabitant of a world of lessons , disappointments and discipline .
my instincts were not vicious .
ideas bubbled up within me continually from an apparently inexhaustible spring , and the very strength of the longings they set in motion puzzled and troubled my parents : what i seem to see most distinctly now is a young mind engaged in a ceaseless struggle for <unk> , for <unk> , against the <unk> of a tradition of which my father was the embodiment .
he was an enigma to me then .
he sincerely loved me , he cherished ambitions concerning me , yet thwarted every natural , budding growth , until i grew unconsciously to regard him as my enemy , although i had an affection for him and a pride in him that flared up at times .
instead of confiding to him my aspirations , vague though they were , i became more and more secretive as i grew older .
i knew instinctively that he regarded these aspirations as evidences in my character of serious moral flaws .
and i would sooner have suffered many afternoons of his favourite punishment  solitary confinement in my room  than reveal to him those occasional fits of creative fancy which caused me to neglect my lessons in order to put them on paper .
loving literature , in his way , he was characteristically incapable of recognizing the literary instinct , and the symptoms of its early stages he mistook for inherent frivolity , for lack of respect for the truth ; in brief , for original sin .
at the age of fourteen i had begun secretly ( alas , how many things i did secretly ! )
to write stories of a sort , stories that never were finished .
he regarded reading as duty , not pleasure .
he laid out books for me , which i neglected .
he was part and parcel of that american environment in which literary ambition was regarded as sheer madness .
and no one who has not experienced that environment can have any <name> of the pressure it exerted to <unk> originality , to thrust the new generation into its religious and commercial moulds .
shall we ever , i wonder , develop the enlightened education that <name> know how to take advantage of such initiative as was mine ?
that <name> be on the watch for it , sympathize with it and guide it to <unk> ?
i was conscious of still another creative need , that of <unk> my ideas , of converting them into action .
and this need was to lead me farther than ever afield from the path of righteousness .
the concrete realization of ideas , as many geniuses <name> testify , is an expensive undertaking , requiring a little pocket money ; and i have already touched upon that subject .
my father did not believe in pocket money .
a sea story that my cousin <name> <unk> gave me at christmas inspired me to compose one of a somewhat different nature ; incidentally , i deemed it a vast improvement on cousin <name> 's book .
now , if i only had a boat , with the assistance of ham durrett and <name> peters , <name> hollister and <name> blackwood and other friends , this story of mine might be <unk> .
there were , however , as usual , certain seemingly insuperable difficulties : in the first place , it was <name> time ; in the second , no facilities existed in the city for operations of a nautical character ; and , lastly , my christmas money amounted only to five dollars .
it was my father who pointed out these and other objections .
for , after a careful perusal of the price lists i had sent for , i had been forced to appeal to him to supply additional funds with which to purchase a row-boat .
incidentally , he read me a lecture on extravagance , referred to my last month 's report at the academy , and finished by declaring that he would not permit me to have a boat even in the highly improbable case of somebody 's presenting me with one .
let it not be imagined that my ardour or my determination were extinguished .
shortly after i had retired from his presence it occurred to me that he had said nothing to forbid my making a boat , and the first thing i did after school that day was to procure , for twenty-five cents , a second-hand book on boat construction .
the woodshed was chosen as a <unk> establishment .
it was convenient  and my father never went into the back yard in cold weather .
inquiries of <unk> developing the disconcerting fact that four dollars and seventy-five cents was inadequate to buy the material itself , to say nothing of the cost of steaming and bending the ribs , i reluctantly abandoned the ideal of the graceful craft i had sketched , and compromised on a flat bottom .
observe how the ways of deception lead to transgression : i recalled the cast-off lumber pile of <name> , the carpenter , a good-natured englishman , coarse and fat : in our neighbourhood his reputation for <unk> was so well known to mothers that i had been forbidden to go near him or his shop .
grits <name> , his son , who had inherited the talent , was also <unk> .
i can see now the huge bulk of the elder <name> as he stood in the melting , <unk> snow in front of his shop , and hear his comments on my pertinacity .
" if you ever wants another man 's missus when you grows up , my lad , gawd 'elp 'im ! "
" why should i want another man 's wife when i do n't want one of my own ? "
i demanded , indignant .
he laughed with his customary lack of moderation .
" you mind what old <name> says , " he cried .
" what you wants , you gets . "
i did get his boards , by sheer <unk> .
no doubt they were not very valuable , and without question he more than made up for them in my mother 's <name> .
i also got something else of equal value to me at the moment ,  the assistance of grits , the <unk> ; daily , after school , i smuggled him into the shed through the alley , acquiring likewise the services of <name> peters , which was more of a triumph than it would seem .
<name> always had to be " worked up " to participation in my ideas , but in the end he almost invariably succumbed .
the notion of building a boat in the dead of <name> , and so far from her native element , naturally struck him at first as ridiculous .
where in <unk> was i going to sail it if i ever got it made ?
he much preferred to throw snowballs at innocent wagon drivers .
all that <name> saw , at first , was a dirty , <unk> shed with dim recesses , for it was lighted on one side only , and its temperature was somewhere below freezing .
surely he could not be blamed for a tempered enthusiasm !
but for me , all the dirt and cold and discomfort were blotted out , and i beheld a gallant craft manned by sturdy seamen forging her way across blue water in the south seas .
treasure island , alas , was as yet unwritten ; but among my father 's books were two old volumes in which i had hitherto taken no interest , with crude engravings of palms and <name> reefs , of naked savages and tropical mountains covered with jungle , the adventures , in brief , of one captain cook .
i also discovered a book by a later traveller .
spurred on by a mysterious motive power , and to the great neglect of the <unk> <unk> and the staple products of the southern states , i gathered an amazing amount of information concerning a remote portion of the globe , of <unk> and poisoned stakes , of <unk> , of queer <unk> that crept up on you while you were <unk> galleons , when desperate hand-to-hand encounters ensued .
little by little as i wove all this into personal adventures soon to be realized , <name> forgot the snowballs and the maddened <unk> who chased him around the block ; while grits would occasionally stop sawing and cry out :  " ah , <unk> ! "
frequently adding that he would be g  d  d. the cold woodshed became a <unk> on the new england coast , the alley the wintry sea soon to embrace our ship , the <unk>  which stood between a <unk> on one side and unused stalls filled with rubbish and kindling on the other  the ways ; the yard behind the lattice fence became a <unk> , the flapping clothes the sails of ships that took refuge there  on <unk> and <unk> .
even my father was <unk> with unparalleled audacity as a watchful government which had , up to the present , no inkling of our <unk> intentions !
the cook and the housemaid , though <unk> against the presence of grits , were friendly confederates ; likewise old <unk> , the darkey who , from my earliest memory , carried coal and wood and blacked the shoes , washed the windows and scrubbed the steps .
one afternoon <name> went to work ... .
the history of the building of the good ship petrel is similar to that of all created things , a story of trial and error and waste .
at last , one march day she stood ready for launching .
she had even been <unk> ; for grits , from an unknown and unquestionably dubious source , had procured a bucket of tar , which we heated over afire in the alley and smeared into every crack .
it was natural that the news of such a feat as we were accomplishing should have leaked out , that the " yard " should have been visited from time to time by interested friends , some of whom came to admire , some to scoff , and all to speculate .
among the <unk> , of course , was <name> hambleton , who stood with his hands in his pockets and cheerfully predicted all sorts of dire calamities .
<name> was always a superior boy , tall and a trifle <unk> and cynical , with an amazing self-confidence not wholly due to the wealth of his father , the <unk> .
he was older than i .
" she wo n't float five minutes , if you ever get her to the water , " was his comment , and in this he was supported on general principles by <name> and <name> peters .
<name> would have none of the petrel , or of the south seas either ; but he wanted ,  so he said ,  " to be in at the death . "
the <unk> were one of the few families who at that time went to the sea for the summer , and from a practical knowledge of craft in general <name> was not slow to point out the defects of ours .
<name> and i defended her passionately .
<name> was not a <unk> .
he was a born leader , <unk> at organized games , exercising over boys the sort of fascination that comes from doing everything better and more easily than others .
it was only during the progress of such enterprises as this affair of the petrel that i succeeded in winning their allegiance ; bit by bit , as <name> 's had been won , fanning their enthusiasm by <unk> at once achilles and <name> , recruiting while relating the <unk> of the expedition in glowing colours .
<name> always scoffed , and when i had no scheme on foot they went back to him .
having surveyed the boat and predicted calamity , he departed , leaving a circle of quaint and youthful figures around the petrel in the shed : <name> hollister , <unk> inclined , yet somewhat hampered by a strict parental supervision ; <name> 's cousin ham durrett , who was even then a rather fat boy , good-natured but selfish ; <name> and <name> <unk> , my second cousins ; <name> and <name> willett and <name> and <unk> mcalery .
<name> was a <unk> , not to be denied , and <unk> her shadow .
we held a council , the all-important question of which was how to get the petrel to the water , and what water to get her to .
the river was not to be thought of , and <unk> lake some six miles from town .
finally , <name> 's mill-pond was decided on ,  a muddy sheet on the outskirts of the city .
but how to get her to <name> 's mill-pond ?
<unk> was at length consulted .
it turned out that he had a coloured friend who went by the impressive name of <name> <name> taliaferro ( pronounced <unk> ) , who was in the express business ; and who , after surveying the boat with some misgivings ,  for she was ten feet long ,  finally consented to transport her to " <unk> " for the sum of two dollars .
but it proved that our combined resources only amounted to a dollar and seventy-five cents .
ham durrett never contributed to anything .
on this sum <name> <name> compromised .
saturday dawned clear , with a stiff march wind catching up the dust into eddies and whirling it down the street .
no sooner was my father safely on his way to his office than <name> <name> was reported to be in the alley , where we assembled , surveying with some misgivings <name> <name> 's steed , whose ability to haul the petrel two miles seemed somewhat doubtful .
other difficulties developed ; the door in the back of the shed proved to be too narrow for our ship 's beam .
but men embarked on a desperate enterprise are not to be stopped by such trifles , and the problem was solved by sawing out two adjoining boards .
these were afterwards replaced with skill by the ship 's carpenter , able seaman grits <name> .
then the petrel by heroic efforts was got into the wagon , the seat of which had been removed , old <name> <name> perched himself <unk> in the bow and <unk> gathered up his <unk> reins .
" folks 'll <unk> i'se plum crazy , drivin ' dis yere boat , " he declared , observing with concern that some four feet of the stern projected over the <unk> .
" ef she <unk> , i 'll git to heaven <unk> a bullet . "
when one is <unk> , however ,  in the hands of buccaneers ,  it is too late to withdraw .
six shoulders upheld the rear end of the petrel , others shoved , and <name> <name> 's rickety horse began to move forward in spite of himself .
an expression of sheer terror might have been observed on the old negro 's <unk> face , but his voice was drowned , and we swept out of the alley .
scarcely had we travelled a block before we began to be joined by all the boys along the line of march ; marbles , tops , and even incipient baseball games were abandoned that saturday morning ; people ran out of their houses , <unk> halted their carts .
the breathless excitement , the exaltation i had felt on leaving the alley were now tinged with other feelings , <unk> , but not wholly lacking in delectable quality ,  concern and awe at these unforeseen forces i had raised , at this ever growing and enthusiastic body of volunteers springing up like dragon 's teeth in our path .
after all , was not i the hero of this triumphal procession ?
the thought was consoling , exhilarating .
and here was <name> marching at my side , a little subdued , perhaps , but unquestionably admiring and realizing that it was i who had created all this .
<name> , who was the <unk> of pupils , the most loyal of followers , though i did not yet value her devotion at its real worth , because she was a girl .
her imagination kindled at my touch .
and on this eventful occasion she carried in her arms a parcel , the contents of which were unknown to all but ourselves .
at length we reached the muddy shores of <name> 's pond , where two score eager hands volunteered to assist the petrel into her native element .
alas !
that the reality never attains to the vision .
i had beheld , in my dreams , the petrel about to take the water , and <name> willett standing very straight making a little speech and crashing a bottle of wine across the bows .
this was the content of the mysterious parcel ; she had stolen it from her father 's cellar .
but the number of <unk> spectators , which had not been foreseen , considerably modified the programme ,  as the newspapers would have said .
they pushed and crowded around the ship , and made <name> and even brutal remarks as to her <unk> ; even <name> , inured though she was to the masculine sex , had fled to the heights , and it looked at this supreme moment as though we should have to fight for the petrel .
an attempt to muster her doughty buccaneers failed ; the gunner too had fled ,  <name> hollister ; ham durrett and the <unk> were nowhere to be seen , and a muster revealed only <name> , the <unk> <unk> , and grits <name> .
" ah , <unk> ! "
he exclaimed in the teeth of the menacing hordes .
" stand back , car n't <name> ?
i 'll <unk> <name> face in , <name> .
whose boat is this ? "
shall it be whispered that i regretted his <unk> ?
here , in truth , was the drama <unk> ,  my drama , had i only been able to realize it .
the good ship beached , the <unk> <unk> us in on all sides , the scene prepared for one of those struggles against frightful odds which i had so <unk> related as an essential part of our adventures .
" let 's roll the cuss in the fancy collar , " proposed one of the <unk> ,  meaning me .
" i 'll stove <name> slats if <name> touch him , " said grits , and then resorted to appeal .
" i <unk> , car n't <name> stand back and let a chap 'ave a <unk> ? "
the <unk> only jeered .
and what shall be said of the captain in this moment of peril ?
shall it be told that his heart was beating wildly ?  bumping were a better word .
he was trying to remember that he was the captain .
otherwise , he must admit with shame that he , too , should have fled .
so much for romance when the test comes .
<name> he remain to fall fighting for his ship ?
like <unk> , he glanced up at the hill , where , instead of the porch of the home where he would fain have been , he beheld a wisp of a girl standing alone , her hat on the back of her head , her hair flying in the wind , gazing intently down at him in his danger .
the <unk> crew was nowhere to be seen .
there are those who demand the presence of a woman in order to be heroes ... . " give us a chance , ca n't you ? "
he cried , repeating grits 's appeal in not quite such a <unk> tone as he would have liked , while his hand trembled on the gunwale .
<name> peters , it must be acknowledged , was much more of a <unk> when it was a question of deeds , for he planted himself in the way of the <unk> chief of the <unk> ( who spoke with a decided <unk> ) .
" get out of the way ! "
said <name> , with a little squeak in his voice .
yet there he was , and he deserves a tribute .
an unlooked-for diversion saved us from annihilation , in the shape of one who had a talent for creating them .
we were <unk> aware of a girlish figure amongst us .
" you cowards ! "
she cried .
" you cowards ! "
lithe , and fairly quivering with passion , it was <name> who showed us how to face the <unk> .
they gave back .
they would have been brave indeed if they had not retreated before such an intense little nucleus of energy and indignation ! ...
" ah , give 'em a chanst , " said their chief , after a moment ... .
he even helped to push the boat towards the water .
but he did not volunteer to be one of those to man the petrel on her maiden voyage .
nor did <name> 's pond , that wild march day , greatly resemble the south seas .
nevertheless , my eye on <name> , i stepped proudly aboard and seized an " oar . "
grits and <name> followed ,  when suddenly the petrel sank considerably below the <unk> as her builders had estimated it .
ere we fully realized this , the now friendly <unk> had given us a shove , and we were off !
the captain , who should have been waving good-bye to his <name> love from the poop , sat down abruptly ,  the crew likewise ; not , however , before she had <unk> to the scuppers , and a <unk> of iced water had run it .
<unk> were mere daily episodes in grits 's existence , but water ...
he muttered something in cockney that sounded like a prayer ... .
the wind was rapidly driving us toward the middle of the pond , and something cold and <unk> was <unk> through the seats of our trousers .
we sat like statues ... .
the bright scene <unk> itself in my memory  the bare brown slopes with which the pond was bordered , the <name> <unk> , the <unk> with red flannel shirts snapping in the biting wind ; <name> motionless on the bank ; the group behind her , silent now , impressed in spite of itself at the sight of our <unk> .
the petrel was sailing stern first ... . would any of us , indeed , ever see home again ?
i thought of my father 's wrath turned to sorrow because he had refused to gratify a son 's natural wish and present him with a real rowboat ... . out of the corners of our eyes we watched the water creeping around the gunwale , and the very <unk> of it seemed to enhance its coldness , to make the horrors of its depths more mysterious and hideous .
the voice of grits startled us .
" o gawd , " he was saying , " we 're a-going to sink , and i car n't swim !
the <unk> tar 's give way back here . "
" is she leaking ? "
i cried .
" she 's <unk> up like a bath tub , " he lamented .
slowly but perceptibly , in truth , the bow was rising , and above the whistling of the wind i could hear his chattering as she settled ... . then several things happened simultaneously : an agonized cry behind me , distant shouts from the shore , a sudden upward lunge of the bow , and the torture of being submerged , inch by inch , in the icy , yellow water .
despite the splashing behind me , i sat as though paralyzed until i was waist deep and the boards turned under me , and then , with a spasmodic contraction of my whole being i struck out  only to find my feet on the muddy bottom .
such was the <unk> end of the good ship petrel !
for she went down , with all hands , in little more than half a fathom of water ... .
it was not until then i realized that we had been blown clear across the pond !
figures were running along the shore .
and as <name> and i emerged dragging grits between us ,  for he might have been drowned there <unk> in the shallows ,  we were met by a stout and <unk> <unk> whose scanty hair , i remember , was drawn into a tight knot behind her head ; and who seized us , all three , as though we were a bunch of carrots .
" come along wid ye ! "
she cried .
shivering , we followed her up the hill , the spectators of the tragedy , who by this time had come around the pond , trailing after .
<name> was not among them .
inside the shanty into which we were thrust were two small children crawling about the floor , and the place was filled with steam from a <unk> against the wall and a boiler on the stove .
with a vigorous injunction to make themselves scarce , the <unk> slammed the door in the faces of the curious and ordered us to remove our clothes .
grits was put to bed in a corner , while <name> and i , provided with various garments , huddled over the stove .
there fell to my lot the red flannel shirt which i had seen on the <unk> .
she gave us hot coffee , and was back at her <unk> in no time at all , her entire comment on a proceeding that seemed to <name> and me to have certain elements of gravity being , " by 's <name> be by 's ! "
the final ironical touch was given the <unk> when our <unk> turned out to be the mother of the chief of the <unk> himself !
he had lingered perforce with his brothers and sister outside the cabin until dinner time , and when he came in he was meek as <name> .
thus the ready hospitality of the poor , which passed over the heads of <name> and me as we ate bread and onions and potatoes with a ravenous hunger .
it must have been about two o'clock in the afternoon when we bade good-bye to our preserver and departed for home ... . at first we went at a <unk> , but presently slowed down to discuss the future looming <unk> ahead of us .
since entire concealment was now impossible , the question was ,  how complete a confession would be necessary ?
our cases , indeed , were dissimilar , and <name> 's incentive to hold back the facts was not nearly so great as mine .
it sometimes seemed to me in those days unjust that the <unk> were able on the whole to keep out of criminal difficulties , in which i was more or less continuously involved : for it did not strike me that their sins were not those of the imagination .
the method of <name> 's father was the slipper .
he and <name> understood each other , while between my father and myself was a great gulf fixed .
not that <name> yearned for the slipper ; but he regarded its occasional applications as being as inevitable as changes in the weather ; lying did not come easily to him , and left to himself he much preferred to confess and have the matter over with .
i have already suggested that i had cultivated lying , that weapon of the weaker party , in some degree , at least , in self-defence .
<name> was loyal .
moreover , my conviction would probably deprive him for six whole afternoons of my company , on which he was more or less dependent .
but the defence of this case presented unusual difficulties , and we stopped several times to thrash them out .
we had been absent from dinner , and doubtless by this time <name> had informed <name> 's mother of the expedition , and anyone could see that our clothing had been wet .
so i lingered in no little anxiety behind the peters stable while he made the investigation .
our spirits rose considerably when he returned to report that <name> had unexpectedly been a trump , having quieted his mother by the surmise that he was spending the day with his aunt <name> .
so far , so good .
the problem now was to decide upon what to admit .
for we must both tell the same story .
it was agreed that we had fallen into <name> 's pond from a raft : my suggestion .
well , said <name> , the petrel had n't proved much better than a raft , after all .
i was in no mood to defend her .
this designation of the petrel as a " raft " was my first legal quibble .
the question to be decided by the court was , what is a raft ?
just as the supreme tribunal of the land has been required , in later years , to decide , what is whiskey ?
the thing to be concealed if possible was the building of the " raft , " although this information was already in the possession of a number of persons , whose fathers might at any moment see fit to congratulate my own on being the parent of a genius .
it was a risk , however , that had to be run .
and , secondly , since grits <name> was <unk> , nothing was to be said about him .
i have not said much about my mother , who might have been likened on such occasions to a grand jury compelled to <unk> , yet torn between loyalty to an oath and sympathy with the defendant .
i went through the peters yard , climbed the wire fence , my object being to discover first from <name> , the housemaid , or <name> , the cook , how much was known in high quarters .
it was <name> who , as i opened the kitchen door , turned at the sound , and set down the <unk> she was scouring .
" is it home ye are ?
<name> to goodness ! "
( this on beholding my shrunken costume ) " <name> be to god you 're not drownded !
and your mother <unk> her heart out !
so it 's into the wather ye were ? "
i admitted it .
" <name> ? "
i said softly .
" what then ? "
" does mother know  about the boat ? "
" now do n't ye be <unk> ' . "
i managed to discover , however , that my mother did not know , and surmised that the best reason why she had not been told had to do with <name> 's criminal acquiescence concerning the operations in the shed .
i ran into the front hall and up the stairs , and my mother heard me coming and met me on the landing .
" <name> , where have you been ? "
as i emerged from the semi-darkness of the stairway she caught sight of my dwindled garments , of the trousers well above my ankles .
suddenly she had me in her arms and was kissing me passionately .
as she stood before me in her grey , belted skirt , the familiar <unk> <unk> at her throat , her heavy hair parted in the middle , in her eyes was an odd , appealing look which i know now was a sign of mother love struggling with a presbyterian conscience .
though she inherited that conscience , i have often thought she might have succeeded in casting it off  or at least some of it  had it not been for the fact that in spite of herself she worshipped its incarnation in the shape of my father .
her voice trembled a little as she <name> me to the sofa beside the window .
" tell me about what happened , my son , " she said .
it was a terrible moment for me .
for my affections were still <unk> alive in those days , and i loved her .
i had for an instant an instinctive impulse to tell her the whole story ,  south sea islands and all !
and i could have done it had i not beheld looming behind her another figure which represented a stern and unsympathetic authority , and somehow made her , suddenly , of small account .
not that she would have understood the romance , but she would have comprehended me .
i knew that she was powerless to save me from the wrath to come .
i wept .
it was because i hated to lie to her ,  yet i did so .
fear gripped me , and  like some respectable criminals i have since known  i understood that any confession i made would <unk> be used against me ... .
i wonder whether she knew i was lying ?
at any rate , the case appeared to be a grave one , and i was presently <unk> to my room to be held over for trial ... . vividly , as i write , i recall the misery of the hours i have spent , while awaiting sentence , in the little chamber with the honeysuckle <unk> and steel engravings of happy but <unk> children romping in the fields and groves .
on this particular march afternoon the weather had become <unk> , as the french say ; and i looked down sadly into the grey back yard which the wind of the morning had strewn with chips from the petrel .
at last , when shadows were gathering in the corners of the room , i heard footsteps .
<name> appeared , prim and virtuous , yet a little <unk> .
my father wished to see me , downstairs .
it was not the first time she had brought that summons , and always her manner was the same !
the scene of my trials was always the sitting room , lined with grim books in their walnut cases .
and my father sat , like a judge , behind the big desk where he did his work when at home .
oh , the distance between us at such an hour !
i entered as delicately as <unk> , and the expression in his eye seemed to convict me before i could open my mouth .
" <name> , " he said , " your mother tells me that you have confessed to going , without permission , to <name> 's pond , where you embarked on a raft and fell into the water . "
the slight emphasis he contrived to put on the word raft sent a colder shiver down my spine than the iced water had done .
what did he know ?
or was this mere suspicion ?
too late , now , at any rate , to plead guilty .
" it was a sort of a raft , sir , " i stammered .
" a sort of a raft , " repeated my father .
" where , may i ask , did you find it ? "
" i  i did n't exactly find it , sir . "
" ah ! "
said my father .
( it was the moment to glance meaningly at the jury . )
the prisoner gulped .
" you did n't exactly find it , then .
<name> you kindly explain how you came by it ? "
" well , sir , we  i  put it together . "
" have you any objection to stating , <name> , in plain english , that you made it ? "
" no , sir , i suppose you might say that i made it . "
" or that it was intended for a row-boat ? "
here was the time to appeal , to force a decision as to what constituted a row-boat .
" perhaps it might be called a row-boat , sir , " i said <unk> .
" or that , in direct opposition to my wishes and commands in forbidding you to have a boat , to spend your money foolishly and wickedly on a whim , you constructed one secretly in the woodshed , took out a part of the back partition , thus destroying property that did , not belong to you , and had the boat carted this morning to <name> 's pond ? "
i was silent , utterly undone .
evidently he had specific information ... .
there are certain expressions that are , at times , more than mere figures of speech , and now my father 's wrath seemed literally towering .
it added visibly to his stature .
" <name> , " he said , in a voice that penetrated to the very corners of my soul , " i utterly fail to understand you .
i can not imagine how a son of mine , a son of your mother who is the very soul of truthfulness and honour  can be a liar . "
( oh , the terrible emphasis he put on that word ! )
" nor is it as if this were a new tendency  i have punished you for it before .
your mother and i have tried to do our duty by you , to <unk> into you <name> teaching .
but it seems wholly useless .
i confess that i am at a less how to proceed .
you seem to have no conscience whatever , no <name> of what you owe to your parents and your god .
you not only persistently disregard my wishes and commands , but you have , for many months , been leading a double life , facing me every day , while you were secretly and continually disobeying me .
i shudder to think where this determination of yours to have what you <name> at any price <name> lead you in the future .
it is just such a <name> that distinguishes wicked men from good . "
i <name> not linger upon a scene the very remembrance of which is painful to this day ... .
i went from my father 's presence in disgrace , in an agony of spirit that was overwhelming , to lock the door of my room and drop face downward on the bed , to sob until my muscles twitched .
for he had , indeed , put into me an awful fear .
the greatest horror of my boyish imagination was a wicked man .
was i , as he had declared , utterly depraved and doomed in spite of myself to be one ?
there came a knock at my door  <name> with my supper .
i refused to open , and sent her away , to fall on my knees in the darkness and pray wildly to a god whose attributes and character were sufficiently confused in my mind .
on the one hand was the stern , despotic monarch of the westminster catechism , whom i addressed out of habit , the father who condemned a portion of his children from the cradle .
was i one of those who he had decreed before i was born must suffer the tortures of the flames of hell ?
putting two and two together , what i had learned in <name> school and gathered from parts of dr .
pound 's sermons , and the intimation of my father that wickedness was within me , like an incurable disease ,  was not mine the logical conclusion ?
what , then , was the use of praying ? ...
my supplications ceased abruptly .
and my ever ready imagination , stirred to its depths , beheld that awful scene of the last day : the darkness , such as sometimes creeps over the city in <name> , when the <unk> smoke falls down and we read at noonday by <unk> .
i beheld the tortured faces of the wicked gathered on the one side , and my mother on the other amongst the blessed , gazing across the gulf at me with yearning and compassion .
strange that it did not strike me that the sight of the condemned whom they had loved in life would have marred if not destroyed the happiness of the chosen , about to receive their crowns and <unk> !
what a theology  that made the creator and preserver of all mankind thus illogical !
iii .
although i was imaginative , i was not <unk> <unk> , and by the end of the first day of my <unk> my interest in that solution had waned .
at times , however , i actually yearned for someone in whom i could confide , who could suggest a solution .
i repeat , i would not for worlds have asked my father or my mother or dr .
pound , of whom i had a wholesome fear , or perhaps an unwholesome one .
except at morning bible reading and at church my parents never mentioned the name of the deity , save to instruct me formally .
intended or no , the effect of my religious training was to make me ashamed of discussing spiritual matters , and naturally i failed to perceive that this was because it laid its emphasis on personal salvation ... .
i did not , however , become an <unk> , for i was not of a nature to contemplate with <unk> a godless universe ... . my sufferings during these series of afternoon <unk> did not come from remorse , but were the result of a vague sense of injury ; and their effect was to generate within me a strange motive power , a <name> to do something that would <unk> my father and eventually wring from him the confession that he had misjudged me .
to be sure , i should have to wait until early manhood , at least , for the accomplishment of such a coup .
might it not be that i was an embryonic literary genius ?
many were the books i began in this ecstasy of <unk> , only to abandon them when my confinement came to an end .
it was about this time , i think , that i experienced one of those shocks which have a permanent effect upon character .
it was then the custom for ladies to spend the day with one another , bringing their sewing ; and sometimes , when i unexpectedly entered the sitting-room , the voices of my mother 's visitors would drop to a whisper .
one afternoon i returned from school to pause at the head of the stairs .
cousin <name> <unk> and mrs. mcalery were discussing with my mother an affair that i judged from the awed tone in which they spoke might prove interesting .
" poor <name> , " mrs. mcalery was saying , " i imagine she 's paid a heavy penalty .
no man alive <name> be faithful under those circumstances . "
i stopped at the head of the stairs , with a delicious , guilty feeling .
" have they ever heard of her ? "
cousin <name> asked .
" it is thought they went to spain , " replied mrs. mcalery , solemnly , yet not without a certain zest .
" mr. <name> hollister <name> not have her name mentioned in his presence , you know .
and <unk> chased them as far as new york with a <unk> in his pocket .
the report is that he got to the dock just as the ship sailed .
and then , you know , he went to live somewhere out west ,  in iowa , i believe . "
" did he ever get a divorce ? "
cousin <name> inquired .
" he was too good a church member , my dear , " my mother reminded her .
" well , i 'd have got one quick enough , church member or no church member , " declared cousin <name> , who had in her elements of daring .
" not that i mean for a moment to excuse her , " mrs. mcalery put in , " but <name> <unk> did have a frightful temper , and he was awfully strict with her , and he was old enough , anyhow , to be her father .
<name> hollister was the last woman in the world i should have suspected of doing so hideous a thing .
she was so sweet and simple . "
" <unk> was very attractive , " said my cousin <name> .
" i do n't think i ever saw a handsomer man .
now , if he had looked at me  " the sentence was never finished , for at this crucial moment i dropped a grammar ... .
i had heard enough , however , to excite my curiosity to the highest pitch .
and that evening , when i came in at five o'clock to study , i asked my mother what had become of <name> hollister 's aunt .
" she went away , <name> , " replied my mother , looking greatly troubled .
" why ? "
i persisted .
" it is something you are too young to understand . "
of course i started an investigation , and the next day at school i asked the question of <name> hollister himself , only to discover that he believed his aunt to be dead !
and that night he asked his mother if his aunt <name> were really alive , after all ?
whereupon complications and explanations ensued between our parents , of which we saw only the surface signs ... . my father accused me of <unk> ( which i denied ) , and sentenced me to an afternoon of solitary confinement for repeating something which i had heard in private .
i have reason to believe that my mother was also <unk> .
it must not be supposed that i permitted the matter to rest .
in addition to grits <name> , there was another <unk> among my acquaintances , namely , <name> pound , the <unk> son of the reverend doctor pound .
<name> had an <unk> mind , especially well stocked with the kind of knowledge i now desired ; first and last he taught me much , which i would better have got in another way .
to him i appealed and got the story , my worst suspicions being confirmed .
mrs. <unk> 's house had been across the alley from that of mr. <unk> , but no one knew that anything was " going on , " though there had been signals from the windows  the neighbours afterwards remembered ... .
i listened <unk> .
" but , " i cried , " they were both married ! "
" what difference does that make when you love a woman ? "
<name> replied grandly .
" i could tell you much worse things than that . "
this he proceeded to do .
fascinated , i listened with a sickening sensation .
it was a mild afternoon in spring , and we stood in the deep limestone gutter in front of the <unk> , a little gothic wooden house set in a gloomy yard .
" i thought , " said i , " that people could n't love any more after they were married , except each other . "
<name> looked at me <unk> .
" you 'll get over that notion , " he assured me .
thus another <unk> entered my character .
denied its food at home , good food , my soul eagerly consumed and made part of itself the <unk> stuff that <name> pound so willing distributed .
and it was <unk> stuff .
let us see what it did to me .
working slowly but surely , it changed for me the dawning mystery of sex into an evil instead of a holy one .
the knowledge of the tragedy of <name> hollister started me to seeking restlessly , on <unk> and elsewhere , for a secret that forever eluded me , and forever led me on .
the word <unk> aptly describes the process begun , suggesting as it does something closed up , away from air and sunlight , continually working in secret , <unk> forces that fascinated , yet inspired me with fear .
undoubtedly this <unk> of our elders was due to the pernicious <unk> of their orthodox christianity , in which love was <unk> and therefore evil , and the flesh not the gracious soil of the spirit , but something to be deplored and condemned , <unk> and transformed by the miracle of <name> .
now love had become a terrible power ( gripping me ) whose enchantment drove men and women from home and friends and kindred to the uttermost parts of the earth ... .
it was long before i got to sleep that night after my talk with <name> pound .
i <unk> between the horror and the romance of the story i had heard , supplying for myself the details he had omitted : i beheld the signals from the windows , the clandestine meetings , the sudden and desperate flight .
and to think that all this could have happened in our city not five blocks from where i lay !
my consternation and horror were concentrated on the man ,  and yet i recall a curious <unk> .
instead of experiencing that automatic righteous indignation which my father and mother had felt , which had animated old mr. <name> hollister when he had sternly forbidden his daughter 's name to be mentioned in his presence , which had made these people outcasts , there welled up within me an intense sympathy and pity .
by an instinctive process somehow linked with other experiences , i seemed to be able to enter into the feelings of these two outcasts , to understand the fearful yet fascinating nature of the impulse that had led them to elude the vigilance and probity of a world with which i myself was at odds .
i pictured them in a remote land , shunned by mankind .
was there something within me that might eventually draw me to do likewise ?
the <name> in me to which my father had referred , which would <name> no opposition , which twisted and squirmed until it found its way to its object ?
i recalled the words of <name> , the carpenter , that if i ever set my heart on another man 's wife , god help him .
god help me !
a wicked man !
i had never beheld the handsome and fascinating mr. <unk> , but i <unk> him now ; dark , like all villains , with a black moustache and snapping black eyes .
he carried a cane .
i always associated canes with villains .
whereupon i arose , groped for the matches , lighted the gas , and gazing at myself in the mirror was a little reassured to find nothing sinister in my countenance ... . next to my father 's <name> in a moral governor of the universe was his belief in the tariff and the republican party .
and this belief , among others , he handed on to me .
on the cinder playground of the academy we republicans used to wage , during campaigns , pitched battles for the tariff .
it did not take a great deal of courage to be a republican in our city , and i was brought up to believe that democrats were irrational , inferior , and  with certain exceptions like the <unk>  dirty beings .
there was only one degree lower , and that was to be a <unk> .
it was no wonder that the <unk> were democrats , for they had a queer streak in them ; owing , no doubt , to the fact that old mr. <name> hollister 's mother had been a <unk> .
he looked like a frenchman , by the way , and always wore a <unk> .
i remember one autumn afternoon having a violent quarrel with <name> hollister that bade fair to end in blows , when he suddenly demanded :  " i 'll bet you anything you do n't know why you 're a republican . "
" it 's because i 'm for the tariff , " i replied triumphantly .
but his next question floored me .
what , for example , was the tariff ?
i tried to bluster it out , but with no success .
" do you know ? "
i cried finally , with sudden inspiration .
it turned out that he did not .
" are n't we darned idiots , " he asked , " to get fighting over something we do n't know anything about ? "
that was <name> 's french blood , of course .
but his question <unk> .
and how was i to know that he would have got as little satisfaction if he had hurled it into the marching ranks of those imposing <unk> processions which sometimes passed our house at night , with drums beating and fifes screaming and torches waving ,  thousands of citizens who were for the tariff for the same reason as i : to wit , because they were republicans .
yet my father lived and died in the firm belief that the united states of <name> was a democracy !
resolved not to be caught a second time in such a humiliating position by a democrat , i asked my father that night what the tariff was .
but i was too young to understand it , he said .
i was to take his word for it that the country would go to the dogs if the democrats got in and the tariff were taken away .
here , in a <unk> , though neither he nor i realized it , was the political instruction of the marching hordes .
theirs not to reason why .
i was too young , they too ignorant .
such is the method of authority !
the <unk> of mr. durrett and mr. hambleton , he continued , would be forced to shut down , and thousands of workmen would starve .
this was just a sample of what would happen .
prosperity would cease , he declared .
that word , prosperity , made a deep impression on me , and i recall the certain <unk> emphasis he laid on it .
and while my solicitude for the workmen was not so great as his and mr. durrett 's , i was concerned as to what would happen to us if those twin gods , the tariff and prosperity , should take their departure from the land .
knowing my love for the good things of the table , my father intimated , with a rare humour i failed to appreciate , that we should have to live henceforth in spartan simplicity .
after that , like the intelligent workman , i was firmer than ever for the tariff .
such was the <unk> plane on which  and from a good man  i received my first political instruction !
and for a long time i connected the <unk> of the republican party with the continuation of manna and quails , in other words , with nothing that had to do with the spiritual welfare of any citizen , but with clothing and food and material comforts .
my education was progressing ... .
though my father revered plato and aristotle , he did not , apparently , take very seriously the contention that that government alone is good " which seeks to attain the permanent interests of the governed by evolving the character of its citizens . "
to put the matter brutally , politics , despite the lofty sentiments on the <unk> in torchlight processions , had only to do with the belly , not the soul .
politics and government , one perceives , had nothing to do with religion , nor education with any of these .
a <unk> and disjointed world !
our leading citizens , learned in the classics though some of them might be , paid no heed to the <unk> of the greek <unk> , who was more practical than they would have supposed .
" the man who does not <name> his city within his heart is a spiritual <unk> . "
one evening , a year or two after that tariff campaign , i was pretending to study my lessons under the student lamp in the sitting-room while my mother sewed and my father wrote at his desk , when there was a ring at the door-bell .
i welcomed any interruption , even though the visitor proved to be only the druggist 's boy ; and there was always the possibility of a telegram announcing , for instance , the death of a relative .
such had once been the case when my uncle <name> paret had died in new york , and i was taken out of school for a blissful four days for the funeral .
i went tiptoeing into the hall and peeped over the <unk> while <name> opened the door .
i heard a voice which i recognized as that of <name> blackwood 's father asking for mr. paret ; and then to my astonishment , i saw filing after him into the parlour some ten or twelve persons .
with the exception of mr. ogilvy , who belonged to one of our old families , and mr. watling , a lawyer who had married the youngest of <name> hollister 's aunts , the visitors entered stealthily , after the manner of burglars ; some of these were <unk> , and all had an air of mystery that raised my curiosity and excitement to the highest pitch .
i caught hold of <name> as she came up the stairs , but she tore herself free , and announced to my father that mr. <name> blackwood and other gentlemen had asked to see him .
my father seemed puzzled as he went downstairs ... . a long interval elapsed , during which i did not make even a pretence of looking at my arithmetic .
at times the low hum of voices rose to what was almost an uproar , and on occasions i distinguished a marked <name> <unk> .
" i wonder what they want ? "
said my mother , nervously .
at last we heard the front door shut behind them , and my father came upstairs , his usually serene face wearing a disturbed expression .
" who in the world was it , mr .
paret ? "
asked my mother .
my father sat down in the arm-chair .
he was clearly making an effort for self-control .
" blackwood and ogilvy and watling and some city politicians , " he exclaimed .
" politicians ! "
she repeated .
" what did they want ?
that is , if it's anything you can tell me , " she added apologetically .
" they wished me to be the republican candidate for the mayor of this city . "
this tremendous news took me off my feet .
my father mayor !
" of course you did n't consider it , mr. paret , " my mother was saying .
" consider it ! "
he echoed <unk> .
" i ca n't imagine what ogilvy and watling and <name> blackwood were thinking of !
they are out of their heads .
i as much as told them so . "
this was more than i could bear , for i had already pictured myself telling the news to envious schoolmates .
" oh , father , why did n't you take it ? "
i cried .
by this time , when he turned to me , he had regained his usual expression .
" you do n't know what you 're talking about , <name> , " he said .
" accept a political office !
that sort of thing is left to politicians . "
the tone in which he spoke warned me that a continuation of the conversation would be unwise , and my mother also understood that the discussion was closed .
he went back to his desk , and began writing again as though nothing had happened .
as for me , i was left in a palpitating state of excitement which my father 's self-control or <unk> only served to irritate and enhance , and my head was fairly spinning as , covertly , i watched his pen steadily covering the paper .
how could he  how could any man of flesh and blood sit down calmly after having been offered the highest honour in the gift of his community !
and he had spurned it as if mr. blackwood and the others had <unk> insulted him !
and how was it , if my father so revered the republican party that he would not suffer it to be mentioned <unk> in his presence , that he had refused contemptuously to be its mayor ? ...
the next day at school , however , i managed to let it be known that the offer had been made and declined .
after all , this seemed to make my father a bigger man than if he had accepted it .
naturally i was asked why he had declined it .
" he would n't take it , " i replied scornfully .
" <unk> should be left to politicians . "
<name> hambleton , with his precocious and cynical knowledge of the world , <unk> my triumph by declaring that he would rather be his grandfather , <name> durrett , than the mayor of the biggest city in the country .
politicians , he said , were <unk> and thieves , and the only reason for holding office was that it enabled one to steal the <unk> ' money ... . as i have intimated , my vision of a future literary career waxed and waned , but a belief that i was going to be somebody rarely deserted me .
if not a literary lion , what was that somebody to be ?
such an environment as mine was <unk> lacking in heroic figures to satisfy the romantic soul .
in view of the experience i have just related , it is not surprising that the notion of becoming a statesman did not appeal to me ; nor is it to be wondered at , despite the somewhat exaggerated respect and awe in which <name> 's grandfather was held by my father and other influential persons , that i failed to be stirred by the elements of greatness in the grim personality of our first citizen , the <unk> .
for he possessed such elements .
he lived alone in <unk> street in an uncompromising mansion i always associated with the sabbath , not only because i used to be taken there on decorous <name> visits by my father , but because it was the very <unk> of <unk> .
the moment i entered its " <unk> "  as mr. hawthorne appropriately would have called them  my spirit was overwhelmed and suffocated by its formality and <unk> .
within its stern walls <name> durrett had made a model universe of his own , such as the deity of the westminster confession had no doubt meant his greater one to be if man had not rebelled and <unk> him ... .
it was a world from which i was determined to escape at any cost .
my father and i were always ushered into the gloomy library , with its high ceiling , with its long windows that reached almost to the <unk> cornice , with its cold marble mantelpiece that reminded me of a tombstone , with its interminable book shelves filled with yellow <unk> .
on the centre table , in addition to a ponderous bible , was one of those old-fashioned <unk> of red glass tipped with blue surmounted by a tumbler of blue tipped with red .
behind this table mr. durrett sat reading a volume of sermons , a really handsome old man in his black tie and <unk> shirt ; tall and spare , straight as a ramrod , with a finely moulded head and straight nose and <unk> hands the colour of mulberry stain .
he called my father by his first name , an immense compliment , considering how few dared to do so .
" well , <name> , " the old man would remark , after they had discussed dr .
pound 's latest flight on the nature of the <name> or the depravity of man , or horticulture , or the republican party , " do you have any better news of <name> at school ? "
" i regret to say , mr. durrett , " my father would reply , " that he does not yet seem to be aroused to a sense of his opportunities . "
whereupon mr. durrett would <unk> me with a blue eye that lurked beneath grizzled brows , quite as painful a proceeding as if he used an iron tool .
i almost pity myself when i think of what a forlorn stranger i was in their company .
they two , indeed , were of one kind , and i of another sort who could never understand them ,  nor they me .
to what depths of despair they reduced me they never knew , and yet they were doing it all for my good !
they only managed to convince me that my love of folly was ineradicable , and that i was on my way head first for perdition .
i always looked , during these excruciating and personal moments , at the coloured glass bottle .
" it grieves me to hear it , <name> , " mr. durrett invariably declared .
" you 'll never come to any good without study .
now when i was your age ... " i knew his history by heart , a common one in this country , although he made an honourable name instead of a <unk> one .
and when i contrast him with those of his successors whom i was to know later ... !
but i shall not anticipate .
american genius had not then evolved the false entry method of <unk> .
a thrilling history , mr. durrett 's , could i but have entered into it .
i did not reflect then that this stern old man must have throbbed once ; nay , fire and energy still remained in his bowels , else he could not have continued to <unk> a city .
nor did it occur to me that the great <unk> that lighted the southern sky were the result of a passion , of dreams similar to those possessing me , but which i could not express .
he had founded a family whose position was virtually hereditary , gained riches which for those days were great , compelled men to speak his name with a certain awe .
but of what use were such riches as his when his religion and morality compelled him to banish from him all the joys in the power of riches to bring ?
no , i did n't want to be an <unk> .
but it may have been about this time that i began to be impressed with the power of wealth , the <unk> and reverence it commanded , the importance in which it clothed all who shared in it ... .
the private school i attended in the company of other boys with whom i was brought up was called <unk> academy , a large , square building of a then hideous <unk> , built of smooth , <unk> bricks with threads of black mortar between them .
one reads of happy school days , yet i fail to recall any really happy hours spent there , even in the yard , which was covered with black cinders that cut you when you fell .
i think of it as a penitentiary , and the memory of the barred lower windows gives substance to this impression .
i suppose i learned something during the seven years of my <unk> .
all of value , had its teachers known anything of youthful psychology , of natural bent , could have been put into me in three .
at least four <unk> wasted years , to say nothing of the <unk> and <unk> effect of that old system of education !
chalk and <unk> !
the mediterranean a tinted portion of the map , italy a man's boot which i <name> painfully , with many <unk> ; history no glorious epic revealing as it <unk> the meaning of things , no revelation of that wondrous <unk> of the spirit of man , but an endless marching and <unk> up and down the map , weary columns of figures to be learned by <unk> instantly to be forgotten again .
" on <name> the 7th general so-and-so proceeded with his whole army  " where ?
what does it matter ?
one little chapter of carlyle , illuminated by a teacher of understanding , were worth a million such text-books .
alas , for the hatred of <name> !
" paret " ( a shiver ) , " begin at the one hundred and thirtieth line and translate ! "
i can hear myself droning out in detestable english a meaningless portion of that endless journey of the pious <unk> ; can see <name> hollister , with <unk> glances of despair , stumbling through <name> <unk> in an <unk> room with <unk> <unk> and heavy odours of ink and stale lunch .
and i graduated from <unk> academy , the best school in our city , in the 80 's , without having been taught even the rudiments of citizenship .
knowledge was presented to us as a corpse , which bit by bit we painfully dissected .
we never glimpsed the living , growing thing , never experienced the spirit , the same spirit that was able magically to waft me from a wintry <unk> street to the south seas , the <unk> , <unk> spirit of true achievement , of life , of god himself .
little by little its flames were smothered until in manhood there seemed no spark of it left alive .
many years were to pass ere it was to revive again , as by a miracle .
i travelled .
awakening at <name> , i saw , framed in a <unk> , <unk> <unk> set in a living blue that paled the sapphire ; the seas <name> had sailed , and the company of the <unk> .
my soul was steeped in <unk> colour , and in the memory of one rapturous instant is gathered what i was soon to see of greece , is focussed the meaning of history , poetry and <name> .
i was to stand one evening in spring on the mound where heroes sleep and gaze upon the plain of marathon between darkening mountains and the blue thread of the strait peaceful now , flushed with pink and white blossoms of fruit and almond trees ; to sit on the <unk> whence a persian king had looked down upon a salamis fought and lost ... .
in that <unk> glimpse a themistocles was revealed , a socrates , a <name> and a phidias , an <unk> , and a pericles ; yes , and a <name> brooding revelations on his <unk> rock as twilight falls over the waters ... .
i saw the <name> empire , that <name> woman whose sands were dyed crimson with blood to appease her <unk> , whose ships were laden with treasures from the immutable east , grain from the valley of the nile , spices from arabia , precious purple stuffs from tyre , tribute and spoil , slaves and jewels from conquered nations she absorbed ; and yet whose very emperors were the unconscious instruments of a progress they wot not of , preserved to the west by marathon and salamis .
with <unk> legions its message went forth across <unk> to the cliffs of the wild western ocean , through <unk> forests to tribes that dwelt where great rivers roll up their bars by <name> , northern seas , and even to <unk> fastnesses beyond the wall ... . iv .
in and out of my early memories like a dancing <name> of sunlight flits the spirit of <name> .
i was always fond of her , but in extreme youth i accepted her incense with masculine complacency and took her allegiance for granted , never seeking to fathom the nature of the spell i exercised over her .
naturally other children teased me about her ; but what was worse , with that charming lack of self-consciousness and consideration for what in after life are called the finer feelings , they teased her about me before me , my presence <unk> them not at all .
i can see them hopping around her in the peters yard crying out :  " <name> 's in love with <name> !
<name> 's in love with <name> ! "
a sufficiently thrilling pastime , this , for <name> could take care of herself .
i was a <unk> beside her when it came to retaliation , and not the least of her attractions for me was her capacity for anger : fury would be a better term .
she would fly at them  even as she flew at the <unk> when the petrel was <unk> ; and she could run like a deer .
woe to the unfortunate victim she overtook !
masculine strength , exercised apologetically , availed but little , and i have seen <name> peters and <name> hollister retire from such encounters humiliated and weeping .
she never caught <name> ; his methods of torture were more intelligent and subtle than <name> 's and <name> 's , but she was his equal when it came to a question of tongues .
" i know what 's the matter with you , <name> hambleton , " she would say .
" you 're jealous . "
an accusation that invariably put him on the defensive .
" you think all the girls are in love with you , do n't you ? "
these scenes i found somewhat embarrassing .
not so <name> .
after <unk> her <unk> , or wounding and scattering them , she would return to my side ... .
in spite of her frankly expressed preference for me she had an <unk> that made a continual appeal to my imagination .
she was never obvious or commonplace , and long before i began to experience the discomforts and sufferings of youthful love i was fascinated by a nature eloquent with contradictions and <unk> .
she was a <unk> , yet her own sex was enhanced rather than overwhelmed by contact with the other : and no matter how many trees she climbed she never seemed to lose her <unk> .
it was innate .
she could , at times , be surprisingly demure .
these impressions of her <unk> and <unk> are particularly vivid in a picture my memory has retained of our walking together , unattended , to <name> <unk> birthday party .
she must have been about twelve years old .
it was the first time i had escorted her or any other girl to a party ; mrs. willett had smiled over the proceeding , but <name> and i took it most seriously , as symbolic of things to come .
i can see powell street , where <name> lived , at four o'clock on a mild and cloudy december afternoon , the decorous , retiring houses , <name> on one side of the pavement by the iron fences and i on the other by the tree boxes .
i ca n't remember her dress , only the exquisite sense of her <unk> and <unk> comes back to me , of her dark hair in a long braid tied with a red ribbon , of her slender legs clad in black stockings of shining silk .
we felt the occasion to be somehow too significant , too eloquent for words ... .
in silence we climbed the flight of stone steps that led up to the blackwood mansion , when suddenly the door was opened , letting out sounds of music and revelry .
mr. blackwood 's coloured butler , <name> , beamed at us hospitably , inviting us to enter the brightness within .
the shades were drawn , the carpets were covered with <unk> canvas , the folding doors between the square rooms were flung back , the prisms of the big chandeliers flung their light over animated groups of matrons and children .
mrs. watling , the mother of the watling twins  too young to be present was directing with vivacity the game of " king <name> was king <name> 's son , " and mrs. mcalery was playing the piano .
" now choose you east , now choose you west , now choose the one you love the best ! "
<name> peters , in a <name> suit and consequently very miserable , refused to embrace <name> hollister ; while the scornful <name> lurked in a corner : nothing would induce her to enter such a foolish game .
i experienced a novel discomfiture when <name> kissed <name> ... .
afterwards came the feast , from which ham durrett , in a pink paper cap with streamers , was at length forcibly removed by his mother .
thus early did he betray his love for the flesh pots ... .
it was not until i was sixteen that a player came and touched the keys of my soul , and it awoke , bewildered , at these first tender notes .
the music quickened , tripping in ecstasy , to change by subtle phrases into themes of exquisite suffering hitherto <unk> .
i knew that i loved <name> .
with the advent of longer dresses that reached to her shoe tops a change had come over her .
the <unk> , the willing <unk> who loved me and was <unk> , were gone forever , and a mysterious , transfigured being , neither girl nor woman , had magically been evolved .
could it be possible that she loved me still ?
my complacency had vanished ; suddenly i had become the aggressor , if only i had known how to " <unk> " ; but in her presence i was seized by an accursed shyness that paralyzed my tongue , and the things i had planned to say were left <unk> .
it was something  though i did not realize it  to be able to feel like that .
the time came when i could no longer keep this thing to myself .
the need of an outlet , of a confidant , became imperative , and i sought out <name> peters .
it was in february ; i remember because i had ventured  with incredible daring  to send <name> an elaborate , <name> <name> ; written on the back of it in a handwriting all too thinly disguised was the following verse , the triumphant result of much hard thinking in school hours :  should you of this the <unk> guess without another sign , would you repent , and rest content to be his <name> i grew hot and cold by turns when i thought of its possible effects on my chances .
one of those useless , <unk> afternoons , i took <name> for a walk that led us , as dusk came on , past <name> 's house .
only by painful degrees did i succeed in overcoming my <unk> ; but <name> , when at last i had blurted out the secret , was most sympathetic , although the ailment from which i suffered was as yet outside of the realm of his experience .
i have used the word " ailment " <unk> , since he evidently put my trouble in the same category with diphtheria or <name> fever , remarking that it was " darned hard luck . "
in vain i sought to explain that i did not regard it as such in the least ; there was suffering , i admitted , but a degree of bliss none could comprehend who had not felt it .
he refused to be envious , or at least to betray envy ; yet he was curious , asking many questions , and i had reason to think before we parted that his admiration for me was increased .
was it possible that he , too , didn't love <name> ?
no , it was funny , but he did n't .
he failed to see much in girls : his tone remained <unk> , yet he began to take an interest in the progress of my suit .
for a time i had no progress to report .
out of consideration for those members of our weekly dancing class whose parents were <unk> the meetings were <unk> during lent , and to call would have demanded a courage not in me ; i should have become an object of ridicule among my friends and i would have died rather than face <name> 's mother and the members of her household .
i set about making ingenious plans with a view to encounters that might appear casual .
<name> 's school was dismissed at two , so was mine .
by walking fast i could reach salisbury street , near st. <name> 's seminary for young ladies , in time to catch her , but even then for many days i was doomed to disappointment .
she was either in company with other girls , or else she had taken another route ; this i surmised led past <unk> mcalery 's house , and i enlisted <name> as a confederate .
he was to make straight for the mcalery 's on elm while i followed powell , two short blocks away , and if <name> went to <unk> 's and left there alone he was to announce the fact by a <unk> signal .
through long and persistent practice he had acquired a whistle shrill enough to wake the dead , accomplished by placing a finger of each hand between his teeth ;  a gift that was the envy of his acquaintances , and the subject of much discussion as to whether his teeth were peculiar .
<name> insisted that they were ; it was an added distinction .
on this occasion he came up behind <name> as she was leaving <unk> 's gate and immediately sounded the alarm .
she leaped in the air , dropped her <unk> and whirled on him .
" <name> peters !
how dare you frighten me so ! "
she cried .
<name> regarded her in sudden dismay .
" i  i did n't mean to , " he said .
" i did n't think you were so near . "
" but you must have seen me . "
" i was n't paying much attention , " he <unk> ,  a remark not calculated to appease her anger .
" why were you doing it ? "
" i was just practising , " said <name> .
" practising ! "
exclaimed <name> , scornfully .
" i should n't think you needed to practise that any more . "
" oh , i 've done it louder , " he declared , " listen ! "
she seized his hands , snatching them away from his lips .
at this critical moment i appeared around the corner considerably out of breath , my heart beating like a watchman 's rattle .
i tried to feign nonchalance .
" hello , <name> , " i said .
" hello , <name> .
what 's the matter ? "
" it 's <name>  he frightened me out of my senses . "
dropping his wrists , she gave me a most disconcerting look ; there was in it the suspicion of a smile .
" what are you doing here , <name> ? "
" i heard <name> , " i explained .
" i should think you might have .
where were you ? "
" over in another street , " i answered , with deliberate <unk> .
<name> had suddenly become demure .
i did not dare look at her , but i had a most uncomfortable notion that she suspected the plot .
meanwhile we had begun to walk along , all three of us , <name> , obviously ill at ease and discomfited , lagging a little behind .
just before we reached the corner i managed to kick him .
his departure was by no means graceful .
" i 've got to go ; " he announced abruptly , and turned down the side street .
we watched his sturdy figure as it receded .
" well , of all queer boys ! "
said <name> , and we walked on again .
" he 's my best friend , " i replied warmly .
" he does n't seem to care much for your company , " said <name> .
" oh , they have dinner at half past two , " i explained .
" are n't you afraid of missing yours , <name> ? "
she asked wickedly .
" i 've got time .
i 'd  i 'd rather be with you . "
after making which audacious remark i was seized by a spasm of apprehension .
but nothing happened .
<name> remained demure .
she did n't remind me that i had reflected upon <name> .
" that 's nice of you , <name> . "
" oh , i 'm not saying it because it 's nice , " i faltered .
" i 'd rather be with you than  with anybody . "
this was indeed the acme of daring .
i could n't believe i had actually said it .
but again i received no rebuke ; instead came a remark that set me palpitating , that i treasured for many weeks to come .
" i got a very nice <name> , " she informed me .
" what was it like ? "
i asked thickly .
" oh , beautiful !
all pink lace and  and <unk> , and the picture of a young man and a young woman in a garden . "
" was that all ? "
" oh , no , there was a verse , in the <unk> handwriting .
i wonder who sent it ? "
" perhaps <name> , " i hazarded <unk> .
" <name> could n't write poetry , " she replied <unk> .
" besides , it was very good poetry . "
i suggested other possible authors and admirers .
she rejected them all .
we reached her gate , and i lingered .
as she looked down at me from the stone steps her eyes shone with a soft light that filled me with radiance , and into her voice had come a questioning , shy note that thrilled the more because it revealed a new <name> of whom i had not dreamed .
" perhaps i 'll meet you again  coming from school , " i said .
" perhaps , " she answered .
" you 'll be late to dinner , <name> , if you don't go ... . " i was late , and unable to eat much dinner , somewhat to my mother's alarm .
love had taken away my appetite ... . after dinner , when i was wandering aimlessly about the yard , <name> appeared on the other side of the fence .
" do n't ever ask me to do that again , " he said gloomily .
i did meet <name> again coming from school , not every day , but nearly every day .
at first we pretended that there was no arrangement in this , and we both feigned surprise when we encountered one another .
it was <name> who possessed the courage that i lacked .
one afternoon she said :  " i think i 'd better walk with the girls to-morrow , <name> . "
i protested , but she was firm .
and after that it was an understood thing that on certain days i should go directly home , feeling like an exile .
<unk> mcalery had begun to complain : and i gathered that <unk> was <name> 's <unk> .
the other girls had begun to gossip .
it was <name> who conceived the brilliant idea  the more delightful because she said nothing about it to me  of making use of <unk> .
she would leave school with <unk> , and i waited on the corner near the mcalery house .
poor <unk> !
she was always of those who piped while others danced .
in those days she had two <unk> <unk> , and her plain , faithful face is before me as i write .
she never betrayed to me the excitement that filled her at being the accomplice of our romance .
gossip raged , of course .
far from being disturbed , we used it , so to speak , as a handle for our <unk> , which was carried on in an <unk> rather than a direct fashion .
were they saying that we were lovers ?
delightful !
we laughed at one another in the <name> ... . at last we achieved the great adventure of a clandestine meeting and went for a walk in the afternoon , avoiding the houses of our friends .
i've forgotten which of us had the boldness to propose it .
the <unk> and tulips had broken the black mould , the flower beds in the front yards were beginning to blaze with <name> and yellow , the lawns had turned a living green .
what did we talk about ?
the substance has vanished , only the flavour remains .
one awoke of a morning to the <unk> of birds , to walk to school amidst delicate , <unk> shadows of great trees <unk> with old gold : the buds lay curled like <name> feathers on the pavements .
suddenly the shade was dense , the sunlight white and glaring , the odour of lilacs heavy in the air , spring in all its fulness had come ,  spring and <name> .
just so subtly , yet with the same seeming suddenness had <unk> and come to leaf and flower a perfect understanding , which nevertheless remained undefined .
this , i had no doubt , was my fault , and due to the incomprehensible shyness her presence continued to inspire .
although we did not altogether abandon our secret <unk> , we began to meet in more natural ways ; there were garden parties and picnics where we strayed together through the woods and fields , pausing to tear off , one by one , the petals of a <name> , " she loves me , she loves me not . "
i never ventured to kiss her ; i always thought afterwards i might have done so , she had seemed so willing , her eyes had shone so expectantly as i sat beside her on the grass ; nor can i tell why i desired to kiss her save that this was the traditional thing to do to the <name> one loved .
to be sure , the very touch of her hand was galvanic .
paradoxically , i saw the human side of her , the yielding gentleness that always amazed me , yet i never overcame my awe of the divine ; she was a being <unk> .
whether this idealism were innate or the result of such romances as i had read i can not say ... .
i got , indeed , an <unk> of a sort .
the weekly dancing classes having begun again , on one occasion when she had <unk> twice with <name> hollister i protested .
" do n't be silly , <name> , " she whispered .
" of course i like you better than anyone else  you ought to know that . "
we never got to the word " love , " but we knew the feeling .
one cloud alone flung its shadow across these <unk> days .
before i was fully aware of it i had drawn very near to the first great <unk> of my life , my graduation from <unk> academy .
we were to " change cars , " in the language of principal <unk> .
well enough for the fortunate ones who were to continue the <unk> journey , which implied a postponement of the serious business of life ; but month after month of the last term had passed without a hint from my father that i was to change cars .
again and again i almost succeeded in screwing up my courage to the point of mentioning college to him ,  never quite ; his manner , though kind and calm , somehow strengthened my suspicion that i had been judged and found wanting , and doomed to " business " : galley slavery , i deemed it , <unk> , <unk> , degrading !
when i thought of it at night i experienced almost a frenzy of <unk> .
my father couldn't intend to do that , just because my monthly reports had n't always been what he thought they ought to be !
<name> hollister 's were no better , if as good , and he was going to princeton .
was i , <name> paret , to be denied the distinction of being a college man , the delights of university existence , cruelly separated and set apart from my friends whom i loved !
held up to the world and especially to <name> willett as good for nothing else !
the thought was unbearable .
characteristically , i hoped against <name> .
i have mentioned garden parties .
one of our annual institutions was mrs. willett 's children 's party in may ; for the willett house had a garden that covered almost a quarter of a block .
mrs. willett loved children , the greatest regret of her life being that providence had denied her a large family .
as far back as my memory goes she had been something of an invalid ; she had a sweet , sad face , and delicate hands so thin as to seem almost transparent ; and she always sat in a chair under the great tree on the lawn , smiling at us as we soared to dizzy heights in the swing , or played croquet , or <unk> through the paths , and in and out of the latticed summer-house with shrieks of laughter and terror .
it all ended with a feast at a long table made of <unk> and boards covered with a white cloth , and when the cake was cut there was wild excitement as to who would get the ring and who the thimble .
we were more decorous , or rather more awkward now , and the party began with a formal period when the boys gathered in a group and pretended indifference to the girls .
the girls were <unk> at it , and actually achieved the impression that they were indifferent .
we kept an eye on them , uneasily , while we talked .
to be in <name> 's presence and not alone with <name> was agonizing , and i wondered at a <unk> beyond my power to achieve , accused her of coldness , my sufferings being the greater because she seemed more beautiful , <unk> , more <unk> than i had ever seen her .
even at that early age she gave evidence of the social gift , and it was due to her efforts that we forgot our best clothes and our newly born self-consciousness .
when i begged her to slip away with me among the currant bushes she whispered :  " i ca n't , <name> .
i 'm the hostess , you know . "
i had gone there in a flutter of anticipation , but nothing went right that day .
there was dancing in the big rooms that looked out on the garden ; the only girl with whom i cared to dance was <name> , and she was busy finding partners for the backward members of both sexes ; though she was my partner , to be sure , when it all wound up with a <name> reel on the lawn .
then , at supper , to cap the climax of untoward incidents , an animated discussion was begun as to the relative merits of the various colleges , the girls , too , taking sides .
<name> willett , <name> 's cousin , was going to yale , <name> hollister to princeton , the <unk> boys to our state university , while <name> blackwood and <name> hambleton and ham durrett were destined for harvard ; <name> peters , also , though he was not to graduate from the academy for another year .
i might have known that <name> would have suspected my misery .
he sat triumphantly next to <name> herself , while i had been told off to entertain the faithful <unk> .
noticing my silence , he demanded wickedly :  " where are you going , <name> ? "
" harvard , i think , " i answered with as bold a front as i could muster .
" i have n't talked it over with my father yet . "
it was intolerable to admit that i of them all was to be left behind .
<name> looked at me in surprise .
she was always downright .
" oh , <name> , does n't your father mean to put you in business ? "
she exclaimed .
a hot flush spread over my face .
even to her i had not betrayed my apprehensions on this painful subject .
perhaps it was because of this very reason , knowing me as she did , that she had divined my fate .
could my father have spoken of it to anyone ?
" not that i know of , " i said angrily .
i wondered if she knew how deeply she had hurt me .
the others laughed .
the colour rose in <name> 's cheeks , and she gave me an appealing , almost tearful look , but my heart had hardened .
as soon as supper was over i left the table to wander , nursing my wrongs , in a far corner of the garden , <name> shouts and laughter still echoing in my ears .
i was <unk> , even my pathetic subterfuge had been detected and cruelly ridiculed by these friends whom i had always loved and sought out , and who now were so absorbed in their own prospects and happiness that they cared nothing for mine .
and <name> !
i had been betrayed by <name> ! ...
twilight was coming on .
i remember glancing down miserably at the new blue suit i had put on so hopefully for the first time that afternoon .
separating the garden from the street was a high , smooth board fence with a little gate in it , and i had my hand on the latch when i heard the sound of hurrying steps on the gravel path and a familiar voice calling my name .
" <name> !
<name> ! "
i turned .
<name> stood before me .
" <name> , you 're not going ! "
" yes , i am . "
" why ? "
" if you do n't know , there 's no use telling you . "
" just because i said your father intended to put you in business !
oh , <name> , why are you so foolish and so proud ?
do you suppose that anyone  that i  think any the worse of you ? "
yes , she had read me , she alone had entered into the source of that <unk> , the complex feelings from which it sprang .
but at that moment i could not forgive her for humiliating me .
i hugged my grievance .
" it was true , what i said , " i declared hotly .
" my father has not spoken .
it is true that i 'm going to college , because i 'll make it true .
i may not go this year . "
she stood staring in sheer surprise at sight of my sudden , quivering passion .
i think the very intensity of it frightened her .
and then , without more ado , i opened the gate and was gone ... . that night , though i did not realize it , my journey into a far country was begun .
the misery that followed this incident had one compensating factor .
although too late to <unk> <unk> and principal <unk> with my <unk> , i was determined to go to college now , somehow , sometime .
i would show my father , these companions of mine , and above all <name> herself the stuff of which i was made , compel them sooner or later to admit that they had misjudged me .
i had been possessed by similar resolutions before , though none so strong , and they had a way of sinking below the surface of my consciousness , only to rise again and again until by sheer pressure they achieved realization .
yet i might have returned to <name> if something had not occurred which i would have thought unbelievable : she began to show a marked preference for <name> hambleton .
at first i regarded this affair as the most obvious of <unk> .
she , likewise , had pride .
gradually , however , a feeling of uneasiness crept over me : as pretence , her performance was altogether too realistic ; she threw her whole soul into it , danced with <name> as often as she had ever danced with me , took walks with him , deferred to his opinions until , in spite of myself , i became convinced that the preference was genuine .
i was a curious mixture of self-confidence and <unk> , and never had his superiority seemed more patent than now .
his air of satisfaction was maddening .
how well i remember his triumph on that hot , <name> morning of our graduation from <unk> , a triumph he had apparently achieved without labour , and which he seemed to despise .
a fitful breeze blew through the chapel at the top of the building ; we , the graduates , sat in two rows next to the platform , and behind us the wooden benches <unk> by many knives  were filled with sisters and mothers and fathers , some anxious , some proud and some sad .
so brief a span , like that summer 's day , and youth was gone !
would the time come when we , too , should sit by the waters of babylon and sigh for it ?
the world was upside down .
we read the one hundred and third <unk> .
then principal <unk> , in his long " <name> <name> " and a ridiculously inadequate collar that emphasized his scrawny neck , reminded us of the sacred associations we had formed , of the peculiar responsibilities that rested on us , who were the privileged of the city .
" we had crossed to-day , " he said , " an invisible threshold .
some were to go on to higher institutions of learning .
others ... " i gulped .
quoting the scriptures , he complimented those who had made the most of their opportunities .
and it was then that he called out , impressively , the name of <name> <unk> hambleton .
<unk> cum <unk> !
suddenly i was seized with passionate , vehement regrets at the sound of the applause .
i might have been the prize scholar , instead of <name> , if i had only worked , if i had only realized what this <unk> day of graduation meant !
i might have been a marked individual , with people murmuring words of admiration , of speculation concerning the brilliancy of my future ! ...
when at last my name was called and i rose to receive my diploma it seemed as though my <unk> had been proclaimed to the world ... that evening i stood in the narrow gallery of the <unk> gymnasium and watched <name> dancing with <name> .
i let her go without protest or reproach .
a mysterious <unk> seemed to have taken place , i felt astonished and relieved , yet i was heavy with sadness .
my emancipation had been bought at a price .
something hitherto spontaneous , warm and living was withering within me .
v. it was true to my father 's character that he should have waited until the day after graduation to discuss my future , if discussion be the proper word .
the next evening at supper he informed me that he wished to talk to me in the sitting-room , whither i followed him with a sinking heart .
he seated himself at his desk , and sat for a moment gazing at me with a curious and <unk> expression , and then the blow fell .
" <name> , i have spoken to your cousin <name> breck about you , and he has kindly consented to give you a trial . "
" to give me a trial , sir ! "
i exclaimed .
" to employ you at a small but reasonable salary . "
i could find no words to express my dismay .
my dreams had come to this , that i was to be made a clerk in a grocery store !
the fact that it was a wholesale grocery store was little consolation .
" but father , " i faltered , " i do n't want to go into business . "
" ah ! "
the sharpness of the exclamation might have betrayed to me the pain in which he was , but he recovered himself instantly .
and i could see nothing but an inexorable justice closing in on me mechanically ; a blind justice , in its inability to read my soul .
" the time to have decided that , " he declared , " was some years ago , my son .
i have given you the best schooling a boy can have , and you have not shown the least appreciation of your advantages .
i do not enjoy saying this , <name> , but in spite of all my efforts and of those of your mother , you have remained undeveloped and irresponsible .
my <name> , as you know , was to have made you a professional man , a lawyer , and to take you into my office .
my father and grandfather were professional men before me .
but you are wholly lacking in ambition . "
and i had burned with it all my life !
" i have ambition , " i cried , the tears forcing themselves to my eyes .
" ambition  for what , my son ? "
i hesitated .
how could i tell him that my longings to do something , to be somebody in the world were never more keen than at that moment ?
<name> <name> had not then written his definition of god as the stream of tendency by which we fulfil the laws of our being ; and my father , at any rate , would not have acquiesced in the definition .
dimly but passionately i felt then , as i had always felt , that i had a mission to perform , a service to do which ultimately would be revealed to me .
but the hopelessness of explaining this took on , now , the proportions of a tragedy .
and i could only gaze at him .
" what kind of ambition , <name> ? "
he repeated sadly .
" i  i have sometimes thought i could write , sir , if i had a chance .
i like it better than anything else .
i  i have tried it .
and if i could only go to college  " " literature ! "
there was in his voice a scandalized note .
" why not , father ? "
i asked weakly .
and now it was he who , for the first time , seemed to be at a loss to express himself .
he turned in his chair , and with a sweep of the hand indicated the long rows of <unk> volumes .
" here , " he said , " you have had at your disposal as <unk> a small library as the city contains , and you have not availed yourself of it .
yet you talk to me of literature as a profession .
i am afraid , <name> , that this is merely another indication of your <name> to shun hard work , and i must tell you frankly that i fail to see in you the least qualification for such a career .
you have not even inherited my taste for books .
i venture to say , for instance , that you have never even read a paragraph of plutarch , and yet when i was your age i was completely familiar with the lives .
you <name> not read <name> or dickens . "
the impeachment was not to be denied , for the classics were hateful to me .
naturally i was afraid to make such a damning admission .
my father had succeeded in presenting my ambition as the height of absurdity and presumption , and with something of the despair of a shipwrecked mariner my eyes rested on the green expanses of those <unk> , <unk> standard library !
nor did it occur to him or to me that one might be great in literature without having read so much as a gritty <name> of them ... .
he finished his argument by reminding me that worthless persons sought to enter the arts in the search for a fool 's paradise , and in order to satisfy a reprehensible craving for notoriety .
the implication was clear , that imaginative production could not be classed as hard work .
and he assured me that literature was a profession in which no one could afford to be second class .
a longfellow , a <name> beecher <unk> , or nothing .
this was a practical age and a practical country .
we had indeed produced <unk> and <unk> , but the future of american letters was , to say the least , <unk> .
we were a <unk> people who would never create a great literature , and he reminded me that the days of the romantic and the picturesque had passed .
he gathered that i desired to be a novelist .
well , novelists , with certain exceptions , were fantastic fellows who blew iridescent <unk> and who had no morals .
in the face of such a philosophy as his i was mute .
the world appeared a dreary place of musty offices and smoky <unk> , of coal dust , of labour without a spark of inspiration .
and that other , the world of my dreams , simply did not exist .
incidentally my father had condemned cousin <name> 's wholesale grocery business as a refuge of the lesser of intellect that could not achieve the professions ,  an inference not calculated to stir my ambition and liking for it at the start .
i began my business career on the following monday morning .
at breakfast , held earlier than usual on my account , my mother 's sympathy was the more eloquent for being unspoken , while my father wore an air of unwonted cheerfulness ; charging me , when i departed , to give his kindest remembrances to my cousin <name> breck .
with a sense of martyrdom somehow deepened by this attitude of my parents i boarded a <unk> and went down town .
early though it was , the narrow streets of the wholesale district <unk> with the rattle of trucks and echoed with the shouts of drivers .
the day promised to be scorching .
at the door of the warehouse of breck and company i was greeted by the ineffable smell of groceries in which the suggestion of parched coffee prevailed .
this is the sharpest remembrance of all , and even to-day that odour affects me somewhat in the manner that the interior of a ship affects a person prone to seasickness .
my cousin <name> , in his well-worn alpaca coat , was already seated at his desk behind the clouded glass partition next the alley at the back of the store , and as i entered he gazed at me over his <unk> spectacles with that same disturbing look of <unk> i have already mentioned as one of his characteristics .
the grey eyes were quizzical , and yet seemed to express a little commiseration .
" well , <name> , you 've decided to honour us , have you ? "
he asked .
" i 'm much obliged for giving me the place , cousin <name> , " i replied .
but he had no use for that sort of politeness , and he saw through me , as always .
" so you 're not too <name> for the grocery business , eh ? "
" oh , no , sir . "
" it was good enough for old <name> breck , " he said .
" well , i 'll give you a fair trial , my boy , and no <unk> on account of relationship , any more than to <name> . "
his strong voice resounded through the store , and presently my cousin <name> appeared in answer to his summons , the same <name> who used to lead me , on mischief bent , through the barns and woods and fields of <unk> .
he was barefoot no longer , though freckled still , grown lanky and tall ; he wore a coarse blue apron that fell below his knees , and a pencil was stuck behind his ear .
" get an apron for <name> , " said his father .
<name> 's grin grew wider .
" i 'll fit him out , " he said .
" start him in the shipping department , " directed cousin <name> , and turned to his letters .
i was forthwith provided with an apron , and introduced to the slim and <unk> but cheerful <name> hedges , the shipping clerk , hard at work in the alley .
secretly i looked down on my <unk> , as one destined for a higher mission , made out of better stuff ,  finer stuff .
despite my attempt to hide this sense of superiority they were swift to discover it ; and perhaps it is to my credit as well as theirs that they did not resent it .
curiously enough , they seemed to acknowledge it .
before the week was out i had earned the nickname of <name> <unk> .
" say , <name> , " <name> hedges would ask , when i appeared of a morning , " what happened in the great world last night ? "
i had an affection for them , these <unk> , and i often wondered at their contentment with the drab lives they led , at their <unk> for " having a job " at breck and company 's .
" you do n't mean to say you like this kind of work ? "
i exclaimed one day to <name> hedges , as we sat on barrels of <unk> flour looking out at the hot sunlight in the alley .
" it ai n't a question of liking it , <name> , " he rebuked me .
" it 's all very well for you to talk , since your father 's a millionaire " ( a fiction so firmly embedded in their heads that no amount of denial affected it ) , " but what do you think would happen to me if i was fired ?
i couldn't go home and take it easy  you bet not .
i just want to shake hands with myself when i think that i 've got a home , and a job like this .
i know a feller  a hard worker he was , too who walked the pavements for three months when the <unk> failed , and could n't get nothing , and took to drink , and the last i heard of him he was sleeping in police stations and walking the ties , and his wife 's a <unk> at a cheap hotel .
don't you think it 's easy to get a job . "
i was momentarily sobered by the earnestness with which he brought home to me the <unk> of our civilization .
it seemed incredible .
i should have learned a lesson in that store .
barring a few discordant days when the orders came in too fast or when we were short handed because of sickness , it was a veritable hive of happiness ; morning after morning clerks and porters arrived , pale , yet smiling , and laboured with cheerfulness from eight o'clock until six , and departed as cheerfully for modest homes in obscure <unk> that seemed to me areas of exile .
they were troubled with no visions of better things .
when the travelling men came in from the " road " there was great hilarity .
important personages , these , looked up to by the city clerks ; jolly , reckless , <unk> rovers , who had tasted of the wine of <name>  and of other wines with the ineradicable lust for the road in their blood .
no more routine for <name> <unk> , who was king of them all .
i shudder to think how much of my knowledge of life i owe to this <name> , whose stories would have filled a quarto volume , but could on no account have been published ; for a self-respecting post-office would not have allowed them to pass through the mails .
as it was , <name> gave them circulation enough .
i can still see his round face , with the nose just indicated , his wicked , twinkling little eyes , and i can hear his husky voice fall to a whisper when " the boss " passed through the store .
<name> , when visiting us , always had a group around him .
his audacity with women amazed me , for he never passed one of the " <name> clerks " without some form of caress , which they resented but invariably laughed at .
one day he imparted to me his code of morality : he never made love to another man 's wife , so he assured me , if he knew the man !
the secret of life he had discovered in laughter , and by laughter he sold quantities of cousin <name> 's groceries .
mr. <unk> boasted of a catholic acquaintance in all the cities of his district , but before venturing forth to conquer these he had learned his own city by heart .
my cousin <name> was not aware of the fact that mr. <unk> " showed " the town to certain customers .
he even desired to show it to me , but an <unk> strain in my nature held me back .
<name> hedges went with him occasionally , and <name> <unk> , the <name> clerk , and i listened eagerly to their experiences , afterwards confiding them to <name> ... .
there were times when , driven by an overwhelming curiosity , i ventured into certain strange streets , alone , shivering with cold and excitement , gripped by a fascination i did not comprehend , my eyes now averted , now irresistibly raised toward the white streaks of light that outlined the windows of dark houses ... . one <name> evening as i was going home , i encountered at the <unk> a young woman who shot at me a queer , twisted smile .
i stood still , as though stunned , looking after her , and when halfway across the <unk> street she turned and smiled again .
prodigiously excited , i followed her , fearful that i might be seen by someone who knew me , nor was it until she reached an unfamiliar street that i ventured to overtake her .
she confounded me by facing me .
" get out ! "
she cried fiercely .
i halted in my tracks , overwhelmed with shame .
but she continued to regard me by the light of the street lamp .
" you did n't want to be seen with me on second street , did you ?
you're one of those sneaking swells . "
the shock of this sudden onslaught was tremendous .
i stood frozen to the spot , trembling , convicted , for i knew that her accusation was just ; i had wounded her , and i had a <name> to make amends .
" i 'm sorry , " i faltered .
" i did n't mean  to offend you .
and you smiled  " i got no farther .
she began to laugh , and so loudly that i glanced anxiously about .
i would have fled , but something still held me , something that belied the harshness of her laugh .
" you 're just a kid , " she told me .
" say , you get along home , and tell your mamma i sent you . "
whereupon i departed in a state of humiliation and <unk> i had never before known , wandering about aimlessly for a long time .
when at length i arrived at home , late for supper , my mother 's solicitude only served to deepen my pain .
she went to the kitchen herself to see if my <unk> were hot , and served me with her own hands .
my father remained at his place at the head of the table while i tried to eat , smiling <unk> at her ministrations .
" oh , a little hard work wo n't hurt him , <name> , " he said .
" when i was his age i often worked until eleven o'clock and never felt the worse for it .
business must be pretty good , eh , <name> ? "
i had never seen him in a more relaxing mood , a more approving one .
my mother sat down beside me ... .
words seem useless to express the complicated nature of my suffering at that moment ,  my remorse , my sense of deception , of hypocrisy ,  yes , and my terror .
i tried to talk naturally , to answer my father 's questions about affairs at the store , while all the time my eyes rested upon the objects of the room , familiar since childhood .
here were warmth , love , and safety .
why could i not be content with them , thankful for them ?
what was it in me that drove me from these sheltering walls out into the dark places ?
i glanced at my father .
had he ever known these wild , destroying desires ?
oh , if i only could have confided in him !
the very idea of it was preposterous .
such <unk> as theirs would never understand the nature of my temptations , and i pictured to myself their horror and despair at my revelation .
in imagination i beheld their figures receding while i drifted out to sea , alone .
would the tide  which was somehow within me  <name> me out and out , in spite of all i could do ?
" give me that man that is not passion 's slave , and i <name> wear him in my heart 's core ... . " i did not shirk my tasks at the store , although i never got over the feeling that a fine instrument was being employed where a coarser one would have done equally well .
there were moments when i was almost overcome by surges of <unk> and of impotent anger : for instance , i was once driven out of a shop by an incensed <name> grocer whom i had asked to settle a <unk> account .
yet the days passed , the daily grind absorbed my energies , and when i was not collecting , or tediously going over the stock in the dim recesses of the store , i was running errands in the wholesale district , treading the burning brick of the pavements , dodging heavy trucks and drays and perspiring clerks who flew about with memorandum pads in their hands , or awaiting the pleasure of bank <unk> .
save <name> , the venerable <name> , i was the last to leave the store in the evening , and i always came away with the taste on my palate of breck and company 's mail , it being my final duty to " lick " the whole of it and deposit it in the box at the corner .
the gum on the envelopes tasted of <unk> .
my cousin <name> was somewhat astonished at my application .
" we 'll make a man of you yet , <name> , " he said to me once , when i had performed a commission with unexpected despatch ... . business was his <unk> , and he had an undisguised contempt for higher education .
to send a boy to college was , in his opinion , to run no inconsiderable risk of ruining him .
what did they amount to when they came home , strutting like peacocks , full of <unk> and fancies , and much too good to associate with decent , hard-working citizens ?
nevertheless when autumn came and my friends departed with <unk> for the east , i was desperate indeed !
even the contemplation of <name> breck did not console me , and yet here , in truth , was a life which might have served me as a model .
his store was his castle ; and his reputation for integrity and square dealing as wide as the city .
often i used to watch him with a certain envy as he stood in the doorway , his hands in his pockets , and greeted <unk> and banker with his genuine and dignified directness .
this man was his own master .
they all called him " <name> , " and they made it clear by their manner that they knew they were addressing one who fulfilled his obligations and asked no favours .
<unk> old <name> durrett once declared that when you bought a <name> of goods from <name> breck you did not have to check up the <unk> or employ a chemist .
here was a character to mould upon .
if my ambition could but have been bounded by breck and company , i , too , might have come to stand in that doorway content with a tribute that was greater than caesar 's .
i had been dreading the christmas holidays , which were indeed to be no holidays for me .
and when at length they arrived they brought with them from the east certain heroes <unk> clad , citizens now of a larger world than mine .
these former companions had become superior beings , they could not help showing it , and their presence destroyed the balance of things .
for alas , i had not wholly <unk> the feminine sex after all !
and from being a somewhat important factor in the lives of <name> hollister and other young women i suddenly became of no account .
new interests , new rivalries and <unk> had arisen in which i had no share ; i must perforce busy myself with <unk> of flour and coffee and canned fruits while sleigh rides and coasting and skating expeditions to <unk> lake followed one another day after day ,  for the irony of circumstances had decreed a <name> uncommonly cold .
there were evening parties , too , where i felt like an alien , though my friends were guilty of no conscious neglect ; and had i been able to accept the situation simply , i should not have suffered .
the principal event of those holidays was a play given in the old hambleton house ( which later became the boyne club ) , under the direction of the lively and talented mrs. watling .
i was invited , indeed , to participate ; but even if i had had the <name> i could not have done so , since the <unk> were carried on in the daytime .
<name> was the leading <name> .
i have neglected to mention that she too had been away almost continuously since our misunderstanding , for the summer in the mountains ,  a sojourn recommended for her mother 's health ; and in the autumn she had somewhat abruptly decided to go east to boarding-school at <unk> .
during the brief months of her absence she had marvellously acquired maturity and <unk> , a <unk> of manner and a certain frivolity that seemed to put those who surrounded her on a lower plane .
she was only seventeen , yet she seemed the woman of thirty whose role she played .
first there were murmurs , then sustained applause .
i scarcely recognized her : she had taken wings and soared far above me , suggesting a sphere of power and luxury hitherto <unk> and beyond the scope of the world to which i belonged .
her triumph was genuine .
when the play was over she was immediately surrounded by enthusiastic admirers eager to congratulate her , to dance with her .
i too would have gone forward , but a sense of inadequacy , of <unk> , of an inability to cope with her , held me back , and from a corner i watched her sweeping around the room , holding up her train , and leaning on the arm of <name> <unk> , a <unk> whom <name> had brought home from harvard .
then it was <name> 's turn : that affair seemed still to be going on .
my feelings were a strange medley of despondency and <unk> ... . our eyes met .
her partner now was ham durrett .
capriciously releasing him , she stood before me , " <name> , you have n't asked me to dance , or even told me what you thought of the play . "
" i thought it was splendid , " i said lamely .
because she refrained from replying i was farther than ever from understanding her .
how was i to divine what she felt ?
or whether any longer she felt at all ?
here , in this costume of a woman of the world , with the string of pearls at her neck to give her the final touch of brilliancy , was a strange , new creature who baffled and silenced me ... . we had not gone halfway across the room when she halted abruptly .
" i 'm tired , " she exclaimed .
" i do n't feel like dancing just now , " and led the way to the big , rose <unk> , one of the <unk> ' most cherished possessions .
glancing up at me over the glass of lemonade i had given her she went on : " why have n't you been to see me since i came home ?
i 've wanted to talk to you , to hear how you are getting along . "
was she trying to make amends , or reminding me in this subtle way of the cause of our quarrel ?
what i was aware of as i looked at her was an attitude , a vantage point apparently gained by contact with that mysterious outer world which thus <unk> had laid its spell on me ; i was tremendously struck by the thought that to achieve this attitude meant emancipation , <unk> against the aches and pains which otherwise our <unk> had the power to give us ; mastery over life ,  the ability to choose calmly , as from a height , what were best for one 's self , untroubled by loves and hates .
untroubled by loves and hates !
at that very moment , paradoxically , i loved her madly , but with a love not of the old quality , a love that demanded a vantage point of its own .
even though she had made an advance  and some <unk> in her manner led me to doubt it i could not go to her now .
i must go as a conqueror ,  a conqueror in the lists she herself had chosen , where the prize is power .
" oh , i 'm getting along pretty well , " i said .
" at any rate , they don't complain of me . "
" somehow , " she ventured , " somehow it 's hard to think of you as a business man . "
i took this for a reference to the boast i had made that i would go to college .
" business is n't so bad as it might be , " i assured her .
" i think a man ought to go away to college , " she declared , in what seemed another tone .
" he makes friends , learns certain things ,  it gives him finish .
we are very provincial here . "
provincial !
i did not stop to reflect how recently she must have acquired the word ; it summed up precisely the <unk> at which i had arrived .
the sting went deep .
before i could think of an effective reply <name> was being carried off by the young man from the east , who was clearly infatuated .
he was not provincial .
she smiled back at me brightly over his shoulder ... .
in that instant were fused in one resolution all the discordant elements within me of aspiration and discontent .
it was not so much that i would show <name> what i intended to do  i would show myself ; and i felt a sudden elation , and accession of power that enabled me momentarily to despise the <unk> with whom she danced ... . from this mood i was awakened with a start to feel a hand on my shoulder , and i turned to confront her father , mcalery willett ; a gregarious , <unk> , <unk> gentleman who made only a pretence of business , having inherited an ample fortune from his father , unique among his generation in our city in that he paid some attention to fashion in his dress ; good living was already beginning to affect his figure .
his mellow voice had a way of breaking an octave .
" do n't worry , my boy , " he said .
" you stick to business .
these college fellows are cocks of the walk just now , but some day you 'll be able to snap your fingers at all of 'em . "
the next day was dark , overcast , smoky , <unk> soft , unwholesome dampness that follows a spell of hard frost .
i spent the morning and afternoon on the gloomy third floor of breck and company , making a list of the stock .
i remember the place as though i had just stepped out of it , the freight elevator at the back , the <name> , iron columns , the continuous piles of cases and bags and barrels with narrow aisles between them ; the dirty windows , spotted and <unk> , that looked down on second street .
i was determined now to escape from all this , and i had my plan in mind .
no sooner had i swallowed my supper that evening than i set out at a swift pace for a modest residence district ten blocks away , coming to a little frame house set back in a yard ,  one of those houses in which the ringing of the front door-bell produces the greatest commotion ; children 's voices were excitedly raised and then hushed .
after a brief silence the door was opened by a <unk> , <unk> man , who stood staring at me in surprise .
his hair was <unk> , he wore an old house coat with a hole in the elbow , and with one finger he kept his place in the book which he held in his hand .
" <name> paret ! "
he exclaimed .
he ushered me into a little parlour lighted by two lamps , that bore every evidence of having been recently vacated .
its features somehow <unk> a struggle for existence ; as though its occupants had worried much and loved much .
it was a room best described by the word " home "  home made more precious by a certain <unk> .
toys and <unk> strewed the floor , a <unk> and apron lay across the sofa , and in one corner was a <unk> desk of varnished oak .
the seats of the chairs were comfortably depressed .
so this was where mr. wood lived !
mr. wood , instructor in latin and greek at <unk> academy .
it was now borne in on me for the first time that he did live and have his ties like any other human being , instead of just appearing magically from nowhere on a platform in a <unk> room at nine every morning , to vanish again in the afternoon .
i had formerly stood in awe of his presence .
but now i was suddenly possessed by an embarrassment , and ( shall i say it ? )
by a commiseration bordering on contempt for a man who would consent to live thus for the sake of being a <unk> .
how strange that civilization should set such a high value on education and treat its <unk> with such neglect !
mr. wood 's surprise at seeing me was genuine .
for i had never shown a particular interest in him , nor in the knowledge which he strove to impart .
" i thought you had forgotten me , <name> , " he said , and added <unk> : " most boys do , when they graduate . "
i felt the reproach , which made it the more difficult for me to state my errand .
" i knew you sometimes took pupils in the evening , mr .
wood . "
" pupils ,  yes , " he replied , still eyeing me .
suddenly his eyes twinkled .
he had indeed no reason to suspect me of <unk> for learning .
" but i was under the impression that you had gone into business , <name> . "
" the fact is , sir , " i explained somewhat painfully , " that i am not satisfied with business .
i feel  as if i ought to know more .
and i came to see if you would give me lessons about three nights a week , because i want to take the harvard examinations next summer . "
thus i made it appear , and so persuaded myself , that my ambition had been prompted by a craving for knowledge .
as soon as he could recover himself he reminded me that he had on many occasions declared i had a <name> .
" your father must be very happy over this decision of yours , " he said .
that was the point , i told him .
it was to be a surprise for my father ; i was to take the examinations first , and inform him afterwards .
to my intense relief , mr. wood found the scheme wholly laudable , and entered into it with zest .
he produced examinations of preceding years from a <unk> in his desk , and inside of half an hour the arrangement was made , the price of the lessons settled .
they were well within my salary , which recently had been raised ... .
when i went down town , or collecting bills for breck and company , i took a text-book along with me in the <unk> .
now at last i had behind my studies a driving force .
algebra , latin , greek and history became worth while , means to an end .
i astonished mr. wood ; and sometimes he would tilt back his chair , take off his spectacles and pull his beard .
" why in the name of all the sages , " he would demand , " could n't you have done this well at school ?
you might have led your class , instead of <name> hambleton . "
i grew very fond of mr. wood , and even of his thin little wife , who occasionally flitted into the room after we had finished .
i fully intended to keep up with them in after life , but i never did .
i forgot them completely ... . my parents were not wholly easy in their minds concerning me ; they were bewildered by the new aspect i presented .
for my lately acquired motive was strong enough to compel me to restrict myself socially , and the evenings i spent at home were given to study , usually in my own room .
once i was caught with a latin grammar : i was just " looking over it , " i said .
my mother sighed .
i knew what was in her mind ; she had always been secretly disappointed that i had not been sent to college .
and presently , when my father went out to attend a trustee 's meeting , the impulse to confide in her almost overcame me ; i loved her with that affection which goes out to those whom we feel understand us , but i was learning to restrain my feelings .
she looked at me wistfully ... .
i knew that she would insist on telling my father , and thus possibly <unk> my plans .
that i was not discovered was due to a certain quixotic twist in my father 's character .
i was working now , and though not actually earning my own living , he no longer felt justified in prying into my affairs .
when <name> arrived , however , my tutor began to show signs that his conscience was troubling him , and one night he delivered his ultimatum .
the joke had gone far enough , he implied .
my intentions , indeed , he found praiseworthy , but in his opinion it was high time that my father were informed of them ; he was determined to call at my father 's office .
the next morning was blue with the presage of showers ; blue , too , with the presage of fate .
an interminable morning .
my tasks had become utterly distasteful .
and in the afternoon , so when i sat down to make out <unk> , i wrote automatically the names of the familiar customers , my mind now exalted by <name> , now depressed by anxiety .
the result of an interview perhaps even now going on would determine whether or no i should be immediately released from a slavery i detested .
would mr. wood persuade my father ?
if not , i was prepared to take more desperate measures ; remain in the grocery business i would not .
in the evening , as i hurried homeward from the corner where the boyne street car had dropped me , i halted suddenly in front of the peters house , absorbing the scene where my childhood had been spent : each of these spreading maples was an old friend , and in these yards i had played and dreamed .
an unaccountable sadness passed over me as i walked on toward our gate ; i entered it , gained the doorway of the house and went upstairs , glancing into the sitting room .
my mother sat by the window , sewing .
she looked up at me with an ineffable expression , in which i read a trace of tears .
" <name> ! "
she exclaimed .
i felt very uncomfortable , and stood looking down at her .
" why did n't you tell us , my son ? "
in her voice was in truth reproach ; yet mingled with that was another note , which i think was pride .
" what has father said ? "
i asked .
" oh , my dear , he <name> tell you himself .
i  i do n't know  he <name> talk to you . "
suddenly she seized my hands and <name> me down to her , and then held me away , gazing into my face with a passionate questioning , her lips smiling , her eyes wet .
what did she see ?
was there a <unk> relationship between our natures than i guessed ?
did she understand by some instinctive power the riddle within me ?
divine through love the force that was driving me on she knew not whither , nor i ?
at the sound of my father 's step in the hall she released me .
he came in as though nothing had happened .
" well , <name> , are you home ? "
he said ... . never had i been more impressed , more bewildered by his self-command than at that time .
save for the fact that my mother talked less than usual , supper passed as though nothing had happened .
whether i had shaken him , disappointed him , or gained his reluctant approval i could not tell .
gradually his outward calmness turned my suspense to irritation ... .
but when at length we were alone together , i gained a certain <unk> .
his manner was not severe .
he hesitated a little before beginning .
" i must confess , <name> ; that i scarcely know what to say about this proceeding of yours .
the thing that strikes me most forcibly is that you might have confided in your mother and myself . "
<name> flashed up within me , like an explosion .
" i  i wanted to surprise you , father .
and then , you see , i thought it would be wiser to find out first how well i was likely to do at the examinations . "
my father looked at me .
unfortunately he possessed neither a sense of humour nor a sense of tragedy sufficient to meet such a situation .
for the first time in my life i beheld him at a disadvantage ; for i had , somehow , managed at length to force him out of position , and he was puzzled .
i was quick to play my trump card .
" i have been thinking it over carefully , " i told him , " and i have made up my mind that i want to go into the law . "
" the law ! "
he exclaimed sharply .
" why , yes , sir .
i know that you were disappointed because i did not do sufficiently well at school to go to college and study for the bar . "
i felt indeed a momentary pang , but i remembered that i was fighting for my freedom .
" you seemed satisfied where you were , " he said in a puzzled voice , " and your cousin <name> gives a good account of you . "
" i 've tried to do the work as well as i could , sir , " i replied .
" but i do n't like the grocery business , or any other business .
i have a feeling that i 'm not made for it . "
" and you think , now , that you are made for the law ? "
he asked , with the faint hint of a smile .
" yes , sir , i believe i could succeed at it .
i 'd like to try , " i replied modestly .
" you 've given up the idiotic notion of wishing to be an author ? "
i implied that he himself had convinced me of the futility of such a wish .
i listened to his next words as in a dream .
" i must confess to you , <name> , that there are times when i fail to understand you .
i <name> it is as you say , that you have arrived at a settled conviction as to your future , and that this is not another of those caprices to which you have been subject , nor a <name> to shirk honest work .
mr. wood has made out a strong case for you , and i have therefore determined to give you a trial .
if you pass the examinations with credit , you may go to college , but if at any time you fail to make good progress , you come home , and go into business again .
is that thoroughly understood ? "
i said it was , and thanked him effusively ... .
i had escaped ,  the prison doors had flown open .
but it is written that every happiness has its sting ; and my <name> , intense though it was , had in it a core of remorse ... .
i went downstairs to my mother , who was sitting in the hall by the open door .
" father says i may go ! "
i said .
she got up and took me in her arms .
" my dear , i am so glad , although we shall miss you dreadfully ... .
<name> ? "
" yes , mother . "
" oh , <name> , i so want you to be a good man ! "
her cry was a little incoherent , but fraught with a meaning that came home to me , in spite of myself ... . a while later i ran over to announce to the amazed <name> peters that i was actually going to harvard with him .
he stood in the <unk> hallway , his hands in his pockets , blinking at me .
" <name> , you 're a wonder ! "
he cried .
" how in <unk> did you work it ? " ...
i lay long awake that night thinking over the momentous change so soon to come into my life , wondering <unk> what <name> willett would say now .
i was not one , at any rate , to be despised or neglected .
<name> .
the following <name> <name> peters and i went east together .
in the early morning boston broke on us like a mecca as we rolled out of the old albany station , joint lords of a " <unk> . "
how sharply the smell of the <unk> east wind and its penetrating coolness come back to me !
i seek in vain for words to express the exhilarating effect of that <unk> coolness on my imagination , and of the visions it summoned up of the newer , larger life into which i had marvellously been transported .
we alighted at the <name> house , full-fledged men of the world , and tried to act as though the breakfast of which we partook were merely an incident , not an event ; as though we were seniors , and not freshmen , assuming an indifference to the beings by whom we were surrounded and who were <unk> , too ,  although the <unk> ones with fresh faces and trim clothes were all undoubtedly <unk> .
the better to proclaim our nonchalance , we seated ourselves on a lounge of the <unk> lobby and smoked cigarettes .
this was <name> indeed !
at length we departed for cambridge , in another <unk> .
boston !
could it be possible ?
everything was so different here as to give the place the aspect of a dream : the <unk> state house , the decorous shops , the still more decorous dwellings with the <unk> windows facing the common ; back bay , still boarded up , <unk> , suggestive of a mysterious and delectable existence .
we crossed the <name> river , <unk> and still that morning ; traversed a nondescript district , and at last found ourselves gazing out of the windows at the <unk> , <unk> bricks of the university buildings ... . all at once our exhilaration evaporated as the <unk> rumbled into a side street and backed up before the door of a <unk> , <unk> house with a queer extension on top .
its steps and vestibule were , however , immaculate .
the <name> was answered by a plainly overworked servant girl , of whom we inquired for mrs. bolton , our landlady .
there followed a period of waiting in a parlour from which the light had been almost wholly banished , with slippery horsehair furniture and a marble-topped table ; and mrs. bolton , when she appeared , dressed in <name> black , <unk> perfectly with the funereal gloom .
she was a tall , <unk> , severe <name> with a peculiar <unk> complexion that somehow reminded one of the <unk> rocks of her native new england soil .
" you want to see your rooms , i suppose , " she remarked <unk> when we had introduced ourselves , and as we mounted the stairs behind her <name> , in a whisper , <unk> her " granite face . "
presently she left us .
" hospitable soul ! "
said <name> , who , with his hands in his pockets , was gazing at the bare walls of our sitting-room .
" we 'll have to go into the <unk> business , hughie .
i vote we do n't linger here to-day  we 'll get <unk> . "
outside , however , the sun was shining brightly , and we departed immediately to explore cambridge and announce our important <unk> to the proper authorities ... . we went into boston to dine ... .
it was not until nine o'clock in the evening that we returned and the bottom suddenly dropped out of things .
he who has tasted that first , acute homesickness of college <name> know what i mean .
it usually comes at the opening of one 's trunk .
the sight of the top tray gave me a pang i shall never forget .
i would not have believed that i loved my mother so much !
these articles had been packed by her hands ; and in one corner , among the <unk> on which she had neatly sewed my initials , lay the new bible she had bought .
" <name> moreton paret , from his mother .
<name> , 1881 . "
i took it up ( <name> was not looking ) and tried to read a passage , but my eyes were blurred .
what was it within me that pressed and pressed until i thought i could bear the pain of it no longer ?
i pictured the sitting-room at home , and my father and mother there , thinking of me .
yes , i must acknowledge it ; in the bitterness of that moment i longed to be back once more in the <unk> space on the floor of breck and company , writing <unk> ... .
presently , as we went on silently with our <unk> , we became aware of someone in the doorway .
" hello , you fellows ! "
he cried .
" we 're classmates , i guess . "
we turned to behold an ungainly young man in an <unk> blue suit .
his face was <unk> , his eyes a <unk> blue , his yellow hair <unk> , his naturally large mouth was made larger by a friendly grin .
" i 'm hermann krebs , " he announced simply .
" who are you ? "
we replied , i regret to say , with a distinct coolness that did not seem to bother him in the least .
he advanced into the room , holding out a large , red , and serviceable hand , evidently it had never dawned on him that there was such a thing in the world as <unk> .
but <name> and i had been " <unk> " by <name> hambleton and <name> blackwood , warned to be careful of our friendships .
there was a reason !
in any case mr. krebs would not have appealed to us .
in answer to a second question he was informed what city we hailed from , and he proclaimed himself likewise a native of our state .
" why , i 'm from elkington ! "
he exclaimed , as though the fact sealed our future relationships .
he seated himself on <name> 's trunk and added : " welcome to old harvard ! "
we felt that he was scarcely qualified to speak for " old harvard , " but we did not say so .
" you look as if you 'd been <unk> for somebody , " was his next observation .
to this there seemed no possible reply .
" you fellows are pretty well fixed here , " he went on , <unk> , gazing about a room which had seemed to us the <unk> of desolation .
" your folks must be <name> .
i 'm up under the skylight . "
even this failed to touch us .
his father  he told us with undiminished <unk>  had been a <name> emigrant who had come over in <unk> , after the cause of <name> had been lost in the old country , and made <unk> and opera glasses .
there had n't been a fortune in it .
he , hermann , had worked at various occupations in the summer time , from <unk> to farming , until he had saved enough to start him at harvard .
<name> , who had been bending over his bureau drawer , straightened up .
" what did you want to come here for ? "
he demanded .
" say , what did you ? "
mr. krebs retorted genially .
" to get an education , of course . "
" an education ! "
echoed <name> .
" is n't harvard the oldest and best seat of learning in <name> ? "
there was an exaltation in krebs 's voice that arrested my attention , and made me look at him again .
a troubled chord had been struck within me .
" sure , " said <name> .
" what did you come for ? "
mr. krebs persisted .
" to sow my wild oats , " said <name> .
" i expect to have something of a crop , too . "
for some reason i could not fathom , it suddenly seemed to <name> on mr. krebs , as a result of this statement , that he was n't wanted .
" well , so long , " he said , with a new dignity that curiously belied the <unk> of his farewell .
an interval of silence followed his departure .
" well , he 's got a crust ! "
said <name> , at last .
my own feeling about mr. krebs had become more complicated ; but i took my cue from <name> , who dealt with situations simply .
" he 'll come in for a few <unk> , " he declared .
" here 's to old harvard , the greatest institution of learning in <name> !
oh , gee ! "
our visitor , at least , made us temporarily forget our homesickness , but it returned with redoubled intensity when we had put out the lights and gone to bed .
before we had left home it had been mildly hinted to us by <name> and <name> blackwood that scholarly eminence was not absolutely necessary to one 's welfare and happiness at cambridge .
the hint had been somewhat superfluous ; but the question remained , what was necessary ?
with a view of getting some light on this delicate subject we paid a visit the next evening to our former friends and schoolmates , whose advice was conveyed with a masterly <unk> that impressed us both .
there are some things that may not be discussed directly , and the conduct of life at a modern university  which is a reflection of life in the greater world  is one of these .
<name> blackwood and ham did most of the talking , while <name> , characteristically , lay at full length on the window-seat , interrupting with an occasional terse and cynical remark very much to the point .
as a sophomore , he in particular seemed lifted immeasurably above us , for he was  as might have been expected already a marked man in his class .
the rooms which he shared with his cousin made a tremendous impression on <name> and me , and seemed palatial in comparison to our quarters at mrs. bolton 's , eloquent of the freedom and luxury of <unk> existence ; their note , perhaps , was struck by the profusion of <name> sofa pillows , then something of an innovation .
the heavy , expensive furniture was of a pattern new to me ; and on the mantel were three or four photographs of ladies in the alluring costume of the musical stage , in which <name> evinced a particular interest .
" did grandfather send 'em ? "
he inquired .
" they 're ham 's , " said <name> , and he contrived somehow to get into those two words an <unk> of his cousin 's character .
ham was <unk> , and his clothes were more striking , more obviously expensive than ever ... . on our way homeward , after we had walked a block or two in silence , <name> exclaimed :  " do n't make friends with the friendless !  eh , hughie ?
we knew enough to begin all right , did n't we ? " ...
have i made us out a pair of deliberate , calculating <unk> ?
well , after all it must be remembered that our bringing up had not been of sufficient liberality to include the <unk> of this world .
we did not , indeed , spend much time in choosing and weighing those whom we should know and those whom we should avoid ; and before the first term of that freshman year was over <name> had become a favourite .
he had the gift of making men feel that he delighted in their society , that he wished for nothing better than to sit for hours in their company , content to listen to the arguments that raged about him .
once in a while he would make a droll observation that was greeted with fits of laughter .
he was always referred to as " old <name> , " or " good old <name> " ; presently , when he began to pick out chords on the banjo , it was discovered that he had a good tenor voice , though he could not always be induced to sing ... .
somewhat to the <unk> of the <unk> standard that my father expected me to sustain , our rooms became a rendezvous for many <unk> souls whose maudlin , midnight attempts at <name> often set the cocks crowing .
" free from care and despair , what care we ?
't is wine , 't is wine that makes the <unk> . "
as a matter of truth , on these occasions it was more often beer ; beer transported thither in <name> 's new valise ,  given him by his mother ,  and stuffed with snow to keep the bottles cold .
sometimes granite face , adorned in a sky-blue wrapper , would suddenly appear in the doorway to declare that we were a disgrace to her respectable house : the university authorities should be informed , etc. , etc .
poor woman , we were outrageously inconsiderate of her ... . one evening as we came through the hall we caught a glimpse in the dimly lighted parlour of a young man holding a shy and pale little girl on his lap , <name> , mrs. <unk> daughter : on the face of our landlady was an expression i had never seen there , like a light .
i should scarcely have known her .
<name> and i paused at the foot of the stairs .
he clutched my arm .
" darned if it was n't our friend krebs ! "
he whispered .
while i was by no means so popular as <name> , i got along fairly well .
i had escaped from <unk> , from the obscure purgatory of the wholesale grocery business ; new vistas , exciting and stimulating , had been opened up ; nor did i offend the <unk> and prejudices of the new friends i made , but gave a hearty consent to a code i found congenial .
i recognized in the social system of <unk> life at harvard a reflection of that of a greater world where i hoped some day to shine ; yet my ambition did not prey upon me .
mere conformity , however , would not have taken me very far in a sphere from which i , in common with many others , desired not to be excluded ... . one day , in an idle but inspired moment , i <unk> a song from " <unk> , " applying it to a college <unk> , and the brief and lively vogue it enjoyed was sufficient to indicate a future usefulness .
i had " found myself . "
this was in the last part of the freshman year , and later on i became a sort of amateur , class <unk> .
many were the <unk> i composed , and <name> sang them ... . during that freshman year we often encountered hermann krebs , whistling merrily , on the stairs .
" got your themes done ? "
he would inquire cheerfully .
and <name> would always mutter , when he was out of earshot : " he has got a crust ! "
when i thought about krebs at all ,  and this was seldom indeed ,  his manifest happiness puzzled me .
our cool politeness did not seem to bother him in the least ; on the contrary , i got the impression that it amused him .
he seemed to have made no friends .
and after that first evening , memorable for its homesickness , he never ventured to repeat his visit to us .
one <name> november day i spied his somewhat ludicrous figure striding ahead of me , his trousers above his ankles .
i was bundled up in a new ulster ,  of which i was secretly quite proud ,  but he wore no overcoat at all .
" well , how are you getting along ? "
i asked , as i overtook him .
he made clear , as he turned , his surprise that i should have addressed him at all , but immediately recovered himself .
" oh , fine , " he responded .
" i 've had better luck than i expected .
i'm correspondent for two or three newspapers .
i began by washing windows , and doing odd jobs for the professors ' wives . "
he laughed .
" i guess that does n't strike you as good luck . "
he showed no resentment at my patronage , but a <unk> that made my sympathy seem superfluous , giving the impression of an inner <name> and content that surprised me .
" i need n't ask how you 're getting along , " he said ... . at the end of the freshman year we abandoned mrs. bolton 's for more desirable quarters .
i shall not go deeply into my college career , recalling only such incidents as , seen in the retrospect , appear to have had significance .
i have mentioned my knack for <unk> ; but it was not , i think , until my <name> year there was startlingly renewed in me my youthful <name> to write , to create something worth while , that had so long been dormant .
the inspiration came from <name> cheyne , instructor in english ; a remarkable teacher , in spite of the <unk> <unk> which <name> imitated .
and when , in reading aloud certain magnificent passages , he forgot his <unk> , he managed to arouse cravings i thought to have deserted me forever .
was it possible , after all , that i had been right and my father wrong ?
that i might yet be great in literature ?
a mere hint from <name> cheyne was more highly prized by the <unk> than <unk> praise from another teacher .
and to his credit it should be recorded that the <unk> were the only ones he treated with any seriousness ; he took pains to answer their questions ; but towards the rest of us , the chosen , he showed a thinly veiled contempt .
none so quick as he to detect a <unk> interest , or a wily effort to make him ridiculous ; and few tried this a second time , for he had a <unk> gift of <unk> that transfixed the offender like a moth on a pin .
he had a way of eyeing me at times , his glasses in his hand , a queer smile on his lips , as much as to imply that there was one at least among the lost who was made for better things .
not that my work was poor , but i knew that it might have been better .
out of his classes , however , beyond the immediate , disturbing influence of his personality i would relapse into indifference ... .
returning one evening to our quarters , which were now in the " yard , " i found <name> seated with a blank sheet before him , thrusting his hand through his hair and biting the end of his <unk> to a pulp .
in his muttering , which was mixed with the curious , <unk> profanity of which he was master , i caught the name of cheyne , and i knew that he was facing the crisis of a <unk> theme .
the subject assigned was a narrative of some personal experience , and it was to be handed in on the morrow .
my own theme was already , written .
" i 've been holding down this chair for an hour , and i ca n't seem to think of a thing . "
he rose to fling himself down on the lounge .
" i wish i was in canada . "
" why canada ? "
" trout fishing with uncle <name> at that club of his where he took me last summer . "
<name> gazed dreamily at the ceiling .
" whenever i have some darned foolish theme like this to write i want to go fishing , and i want to go like the devil .
i 'll get uncle <name> to take you , too , next summer . "
" i wish you would . "
" say , that 's living all right , hughie , up there among the <unk> and <unk> ! "
and he began , for something like the thirtieth time , to relate the adventures of the trip .
as he talked , the idea presented itself to me with sudden fascination to use this incident as the subject of <name> 's theme ; to write it for him , from his point of view , imitating the droll style he would have had if he had been able to write ; for , when he was interested in any matter , his oral narrative did not lack vividness .
i began to ask him questions : what were the trees like , for instance ?
how did the <unk> guides talk ?
he had the gift of mimicry : aided by a partial knowledge of french i wrote down a few sentences as they sounded .
the canoe had upset and he had come near drowning .
i made him describe his sensations .
" i 'll write your theme for you , " i exclaimed , when he had finished .
" gee , not about that ! "
" why not ?
it 's a personal experience . "
his gratitude was pathetic ... . by this time i was so full of the subject that it fairly clamoured for expression , and as i wrote the hours flew .
once in a while i paused to ask him a question as he sat with his chair tilted back and his feet on the table , reading a detective story .
i sketched in the scene with bold strokes ; the desolate bois <unk> on the mountain side , the polished <name> surface of the pool broken here and there with the circles left by rising fish ; i pictured <name> , the guide , his pipe between his teeth , holding the canoe against the current ; and i seemed to smell the sharp <unk> of the <unk> , to hear the roar of the rapids below .
then came the sudden <unk> of the big trout , <unk> oaths from <name> , <unk> , <unk> , darkness , confusion ; a <unk> feeling , a brief glimpse of green things and sunlight , and then <unk> , or what seemed like it ; <unk> , the sense of being picked up and hurled by a terrific force whither ?
a blinding whiteness , in which it was impossible to breathe , one sharp , almost unbearable pain , then another , then oblivion ... .
finally , awakening , to be confronted by a much worried uncle <name> .
by this time the detective story had fallen to the floor , and <name> was huddled up in his chair , asleep .
he arose obediently and wrapped a wet towel around his head , and began to write .
once he paused long enough to mutter :  " yes , that 's about it ,  that 's the way i felt ! "
and set to work again , mechanically ,  all the praise i got for what i deemed a literary achievement of the highest order !
at three o'clock , a.m. , he finished , pulled off his clothes automatically and tumbled into bed .
i had no <name> for sleep .
my <name> was racing madly , like an engine without a governor .
i could write !
i could write !
i repeated the words over and over to myself .
all the <unk> of my present life were blotted out , and i beheld only the long , sweet vista of the career for which i was now convinced that nature had intended me .
my immediate fortunes became unimportant , immaterial .
no juice of the grape i had ever tasted made me half so drunk ... . with the morning , of course , came the reaction , and i suffered the after sensations of an <unk> , awaking to a world of necessity , cold and grey and <unk> , and necessity alone made me rise from my bed .
my experience of the night before might have taught me that happiness lies in the trick of transforming necessity , but it did not .
the vision had faded ,  temporarily , at least ; and such was the distraction of the succeeding days that the subject of the theme passed from my mind ... . one morning <name> was later than usual in getting home .
i was writing a letter when he came in , and did not notice him , yet i was vaguely aware of his standing over me .
when at last i looked up i gathered from his expression that something serious had happened , so mournful was his face , and yet so utterly ludicrous .
" say , <name> , i 'm in the deuce of a mess , " he announced .
" what 's the matter ? "
i inquired .
he sank down on the table with a groan .
" it 's <name> , " he said .
then i remembered the theme .
" what  what 's he done ? "
i demanded .
" he says i must become a writer .
think of it , me a writer !
he says i 'm a young shakespeare , that i 've been lazy and hid my light under a bushel !
he says he knows now what i can do , and if i do n't keep up the quality , he 'll know the reason why , and write a personal letter to my father .
oh , hell ! "
in spite of his evident anguish , i was seized with a convulsive laughter .
<name> stood staring at me moodily .
" you think it 's funny ,  do n't you ?
i guess it is , but what 's going to become of me ?
that 's what i want to know .
i 've been in trouble before , but never in any like this .
and who got me into it ?
you ! "
here was gratitude !
" you 've got to go on writing 'em , now . "
his voice became desperately pleading .
" say , <name> , old man , you can temper 'em down  temper 'em down gradually .
and by the end of the year , let 's say , they 'll be about normal again . "
he seemed actually shivering .
" the end of the year ! "
i cried , the predicament striking me for the first time in its fulness .
" say , you 've got a crust ! "
" you 'll do it , if i have to hold a gun over you , " he announced grimly .
mingled with my anxiety , which was real , was an exultation that would not down .
nevertheless , the idea of developing <name> into a shakespeare ,  <name> , who had not the slightest <name> to be one i was appalling , besides having in it an element of useless self-sacrifice from which i recoiled .
on the other hand , if <name> should discover that i had written his theme , there were penalties i did not care to dwell upon ... . with such a cloud hanging over me i passed a restless night .
as luck would have it the very next evening in the level light under the elms of the square i beheld sauntering towards me a <unk> figure which i recognized as that of mr. cheyne himself .
as i saluted him he gave me an amused and most disconcerting glance ; and when i was congratulating myself that he had passed me he stopped .
" fine weather for march , paret , " he observed .
" yes , sir , " i agreed in a strange voice .
" by the way , " he remarked , contemplating the bare branches above our heads , " that was an excellent theme your <unk> handed in .
i had no idea that he possessed such  such genius .
did you , by any chance , happen to read it ? "
" yes , sir ,  i read it . "
" were n't you surprised ? "
inquired mr. cheyne .
" well , yes , sir  that is  i mean to say he talks just like that , sometimes  that is , when it 's anything he cares about . "
" indeed ! "
said mr. cheyne .
" that 's interesting , most interesting .
in all my experience , i do not remember a case in which a gift has been developed so rapidly .
i do n't want to give the impression  ah that there is no room for improvement , but the thing was very well done , for an <unk> .
i must confess i never should have suspected it in peters , and it 's most interesting what you say about his cleverness in conversation . "
he twirled the head of his stick , apparently lost in reflection .
" i may be wrong , " he went on presently , " i have an idea it is you  " i must literally have jumped away from him .
he paused a moment , without apparently noticing my panic , " that it is you who have influenced peters . "
" sir ? "
" i am wrong , then .
or is this merely commendable modesty on your part ? "
" oh , no , sir . "
" then my hypothesis falls to the ground .
i had greatly hoped , " he added meaningly , " that you might be able to throw some light on this mystery . "
i was dumb .
" paret , " he asked , " have you time to come over to my rooms for a few minutes this evening ? "
" certainly , sir . "
he gave me his number in <unk> street ... . like one running in a nightmare and making no progress i made my way home , only to learn from <unk> ,  who lived on the same floor ,  that <name> had <unk> gone to boston for the evening , with four other weary spirits in search of relaxation !
avoiding our club table , i took what little nourishment i could at a modest restaurant , and restlessly paced the moonlit streets until eight o'clock , when i found myself in front of one of those <unk> colonial houses which , on less <unk> occasions , had exercised a great charm on my imagination .
my hand <name> for an instant over the <name> ... .
i must have rung it violently , for there appeared almost immediately an old <name> in a lace cap , who greeted me with gentle courtesy , and knocked at a little door with glistening panels .
the latch was lifted by mr. cheyne himself .
" come in , paret , " he said , in a tone that was unexpectedly hospitable .
i have rarely seen a more inviting room .
a wood fire burned brightly on the brass <unk> , flinging its glare on the big , white beam that crossed the ceiling , and reddening the square panes of the windows in their <unk> recesses .
between these were rows of books ,  attractive books in chased <unk> , red and blue ; books that appealed to be taken down and read .
there was a table covered with reviews and magazines in neat piles , and a lamp so shaded as to throw its light only on the white <unk> of the pad .
two easy chairs , covered with flowered <unk> , were ranged before the fire , in one of which i sank , much bewildered , upon being urged to do so .
i utterly failed to recognize " <name> " in this new atmosphere .
and he had , moreover , dropped the subtly sarcastic manner i was wont to associate with him .
" jolly old house , is n't it ? "
he observed , as though i had casually dropped in on him for a chat ; and he stood , with his hands behind him stretched to the blaze , looking down at me .
" it was built by a certain colonel <unk> , who fought at <unk> , and afterwards fled to england at the time of the revolution .
he could n't stand the patriots , i 'm not so sure that i blame him , either .
are you interested in colonial things , mr .
paret ? "
i said i was .
if the question had concerned <unk> relics my answer would undoubtedly have been the same .
and i watched him , <unk> , while he took down a silver <unk> from the shallow mantel shelf .
" it 's not a revere , " he said , in a slightly apologetic tone as though to <unk> a comment , " but it 's rather good , i think .
i picked it up at a sale in <unk> .
but i have never been able to identify the coat of arms . "
he showed me a <unk> , with the names of " <name> and <name> simpson " engraved quaintly thereon , and took down other articles in which i managed to feign an interest .
finally he seated himself in the chair opposite , crossed his feet , putting the tips of his fingers together and gazing into the fire .
" so you thought you could fool me , " he said , at length .
i became aware of the ticking of a great clock in the corner .
my mouth was dry .
" i am going to forgive you , " he went on , more gravely , " for several reasons .
i do n't flatter , as you know .
it 's because you carried out the thing so perfectly that i am led to think you have a gift that may be cultivated , paret .
you wrote that theme in the way peters would have written it if he had not been  what shall i say ?  <unk> inarticulate .
and i trust it may do you some good if i say it was something of a literary achievement , if not a moral one . "
" thank you , sir , " i faltered .
" have you ever , " he inquired , <unk> a little into his <unk> manner , " seriously thought of literature as a career ?
have you ever thought of any career seriously ? "
" i once wished to be a writer , sir , " i replied tremulously , but refrained from telling him of my father 's opinion of the profession .
ambition  a purer ambition than i had known for years  leaped within me at his words .
he , <name> cheyne , had detected in me the <unk> fire !
i sat there until ten o'clock talking to the real mr. cheyne , a human mr. cheyne unknown in the <unk> .
nor had i suspected one in whom <unk> and distrust of <unk> ( of my sort ) seemed so <unk> , of such idealism .
he did not pour it out in preaching ; delicately , <unk> and on the whole rather <unk> he managed to present to me in a most <unk> light that <name> of the university held by me and my intimate associates .
after i had left him i walked the quiet streets to behold as through dissolving mists another harvard , and there trembled in my soul like the <unk> of a flame something of the vision later to be <unk> by st. <unk> , the spirit of harvard responding to the spirit of the republic  to the call of <name> , who voiced it .
the place of that bronze at the corner of boston common was as yet empty , but i have since stood before it to gaze in wonder at the light shining in darkness on mute , uplifted faces , black faces !
at harvard 's son leading them on that the light might live and prevail .
i , too , longed for a cause into which i might fling myself , in which i might lose myself ...
i halted on the sidewalk to find myself staring from the opposite side of the street at a familiar house , my old landlady 's , mrs. bolton 's , and summoned up before me was the tired , smiling face of hermann krebs .
was it because when he had once spoken so <unk> of the university i had seen the reflection of her spirit in his eyes ?
a light still burned in the extension roof  krebs 's light ; another shone dimly through the ground glass of the front door .
obeying a sudden impulse , i crossed the street .
mrs. bolton , in the sky-blue wrapper , and looking more forbidding than ever , answered the <name> .
life had taught her to be indifferent to surprises , and it was i who became abruptly embarrassed .
" oh , it 's you , mr. paret , " she said , as though i had been a frequent <unk> .
i had never once darkened her threshold since i had left her house .
" yes , " i answered , and hesitated ... . " is mr. krebs in ? "
" well , " she replied in a lifeless tone , which nevertheless had in it a touch of bitterness , " i guess there 's no reason why you and your friends should have known he was sick . "
" sick ! "
i repeated .
" is he very sick ? "
" i calculate he 'll pull through , " she said .
" <name> the doctor gave him up .
and no wonder !
he has n't had any proper food since he 's be'n here ! "
she paused , eyeing me .
" if you 'll excuse me , mr. paret , i was just going up to him when you rang . "
" certainly , " i replied awkwardly .
" would you be so kind as to tell him  when he 's well enough  that i came to see him , and that i 'm sorry ? "
there was another pause , and she stood with a hand <unk> clutching the knob .
" yes , i 'll tell him , " she said .
with a sense of having been baffled , i turned away .
walking back toward the yard my attention was attracted by a slowly approaching cab whose occupants were disturbing the quiet of the night with song .
" <unk>  't is wine , 't is wine , that <unk>  <unk> . "
the vehicle <name> up in front of a new and commodious building ,  i believe the first of those designed to house <unk> who were willing to pay for private <unk> and other modern luxuries ; out of one window of the cab protruded a pair of shoeless feet , out of the other a hatless head i recognized as belonging to <name> peters ; hence i surmised that the feet were his also .
the driver got down from the box , and a lively argument was begun inside  for there were other occupants  as to how mr. peters was to be disembarked ; and i gathered from his frequent references to the " <unk> obelisk " that the engineering problem presented struck him as similar to the unloading of <name> 's needle .
" careful , careful ! "
he cautioned , as certain <unk> movements began from within , " easy , ham , you <unk> , keep the door shut , y 'll break me . "
" now , <name> , all heave <unk> ! "
exclaimed a voice from the blackness of the interior .
" <name> ye wait a minute , mr. durrett , sir ? "
implored the <unk> .
" you 'll be after ruining me cab entirely . "
( loud roars and vigorous resistance from the obelisk , the cab rocking violently . )
" this <unk> " ( meaning me ) " <name> have him by the head , and i 'll get hold of his feet , sir . "
which he did , after a severe kick in the stomach .
" <unk> all right , <name> . "
" to be sure it is , mr. peters .
now <name> ye rest <unk> awhile , sir ? "
" i 'm <unk> , " cried another voice from the darkness , the <unk> voice of <name> kyme , our <unk> .
" get the <unk> under him ! "
came forth in commanding tones from <unk> .
in the meantime many windows had been raised and much gratuitous advice was being given .
the three occupants of the cab 's seat who had previously clamoured for mr. peters ' removal , now <unk> resisted it ; suddenly he came out with a jerk , and we had him fairly upright on the pavement minus a collar and tie and the buttons of his evening waistcoat .
those who remained in the cab engaged in a riotous game of hunt the slipper , while <name> peered into the dark interior , observing gravely the progress of the sport .
first flew out an overcoat and a <unk> hat , finally the pumps , all of which in due time were adjusted to his person , and i started home with him , with much parting counsel from the other three .
" <unk> were you , hughie ? "
he inquired .
" hunted all over for you .
had a <unk> ' good time .
went to <unk> 's  had champagne  then to see <unk> in  th '  woods .
ham knows one of the <unk> had supper with four of 'em .
nice <unk> ! "
" for heaven 's sake do n't step on me again ! "
i cried .
" <unk> , old man .
but y'know i 'm <name> <unk> .
<unk> do what i <unk> . "
he halted in the middle of the street and recited dramatically :  " 'not marble , nor th ' gilded monuments of <unk> sh 'll outlive m ' powerful rhyme . ' "
" how 's that , <unk> , <unk> ? "
" where did you learn it ? "
i demanded , momentarily forgetting his condition .
" <unk> 'm <name> , " he replied , " says i wrote it .
ca n't remember ... . " after i had got him to bed ,  a service i had learned to perform with more or less proficiency ,  i sat down to consider the events of the evening , to attempt to get a proportional view .
the intensity of my disgust was not hypocritical as i gazed through the open door into the bedroom and recalled the times when i , too , had been in that condition .
<name> peters drunk , and sleeping it off , was deplorable , without doubt ; but <name> paret drunk was detestable , and had no excuse whatever .
nor did i mean by this to set myself on a higher ethical plane , for i felt nothing but despair and humility .
in my state of <unk> i perceived that he was a better man , than i , and that his lapses proceeded from a love of liquor and the transcendent sense of good-fellowship that liquor brings .
vii .
the crisis through which i passed at cambridge , inaugurated by the events i have just related , i find very difficult to portray .
it was a religious crisis , of course , and my most pathetic memory concerning it is of the vain attempts to connect my <unk> and <unk> with the theology i had been taught ; i began in secret to read my bible , yet nothing i hit upon seemed to point a way out of my present predicament , to give any definite clew to the solution of my life .
i was not mature enough to reflect that orthodoxy was a <name> religion unrelated to a world whose wheels were turned by the motives of self-interest ; that it consisted of ideals not deemed practical , since no attempt was made to put them into practice in the only logical manner ,  by <unk> civilization to conform with them .
the implication was that the christ who had preached these ideals was not practical ... .
there were undoubtedly men in the faculty of the university who might have helped me had i known of them ; who might have given me , even at that time , a clew to the modern , logical explanation of the bible as an immortal record of the thoughts and acts of men who had sought to do just what i was seeking to do ,  connect the religious impulse to life and make it fruitful in life : an explanation , by the way , a <unk> more spiritual than the old .
but i was hopelessly entangled in the <unk> of the mystic , the miraculous and supernatural .
if i had analyzed my <unk> , i might have realized that i wanted to renounce the life i had been leading , not because it was sinful , but because it was aimless .
i had not learned that the greek word for sin is " a missing of the <name> . "
just <unk> !
i had been stirred with the <name> to perform some service for which the world would be grateful : to write great literature , perchance .
but it had never been suggested to me that such <unk> of the soul are religious , that religion is that kind of feeling , of motive power that drives the writer and the scientist , the statesman and the sculptor as well as the priest and the prophet to serve mankind for the <name> of serving : that religion is creative , or it is nothing : not mechanical , not a force imposed from without , but a driving power within .
the " religion " i had learned was salvation from sin by miracle : sin a deliberate rebellion , not a pathetic missing of the <name> of life ; useful service of man , not the wandering of <unk> souls who had not been shown the way .
i felt religious .
i wanted to go to church , i wanted to maintain , when it was on me , that exaltation i dimly felt as communion with a higher power , with god , and which also was identical with my <name> to write , to create ... .
i bought books , sets of wordsworth and keats , of <name> and <name> and shakespeare , and hid them away in my bureau drawers lest <name> and my friends should see them .
these too i read secretly , making excuses for not joining in the usual amusements .
once i walked to mrs. bolton 's and inquired rather <unk> for hermann krebs , only to be informed that he had gone out ... .
there were lapses , of course , when i went off on the old excursions ,  for the most part the usual <unk> follies , though some were of a more serious nature ; on these i do not care to dwell .
sex was still a mystery ... .
always i awoke afterwards to bitter <unk> and despair ... .
but my work in english improved , and i earned the commendation and friendship of mr. cheyne .
with a wisdom for which i was grateful he was careful not to give much sign of it in classes , but the fact that he was " getting soft on me " was evident enough to be regarded with suspicion .
indeed the state into which i had fallen became a matter of increasing concern to my companions , who tried every means from ridicule to sympathy , to discover its cause and shake me out of it .
the theory most accepted was that i was in love .
" come on now , hughie  tell me who she is .
i wo n't give you away , " <name> would beg .
once or twice , indeed , i had imagined i was in love with the sisters of boston classmates whose dances i attended ; to these parties <name> , not having overcome his diffidence in respect to what he called " social life , " never could be induced to go .
it was <name> who detected the true cause of my discontent .
typical as no other man i can recall of the code to which we had dedicated ourselves , the code that moulded the important part of the <unk> world and defied authority , he regarded any <unk> from it in the light of treason .
an instructor , in a fit of impatience , had once referred to him as the <unk> of his class ; he had fatal attractions , and a remarkable influence .
his favourite pastime was the capricious exercise of his <name> on weaker characters , such as his cousin , ham durrett ; if they " swore off , " <name> made it his business to get them drunk again , and having accomplished this would proceed himself to administer a new oath and see that it was kept .
alcohol seemed to have no effect whatever on him .
though he was in the class above me , i met him frequently at a club to which i had the honour to belong , then a suite of rooms over a shop furnished with a pool and a billiard table , <unk> and a bar .
it has since achieved the dignity of a house of its own .
we were having , one evening , a " religious " argument , <unk> , <unk> and myself and some others .
i ca n't recall how it began ; i think <unk> had attacked the institution of compulsory chapel , which nobody defended ; there was something <unk> wrong , he maintained , with a religion to which men had to be driven against their wills .
somewhat to my surprise i found myself defending a christianity out of which i had been able to extract but little comfort and solace .
neither <unk> nor <unk> , however , were for <unk> it : although they took the other side of the discussion of a subject of which none of us knew anything , their attacks were but <unk> ; like me , they were still under the spell exerted by a youthful training .
we were all of us aware of <name> , who sat at some distance looking over the pages of an english sporting weekly .
presently he flung it down .
" have n't you found out yet that man created god , hughie ? "
he inquired .
" and even if there were a personal god , what reason have you to think that man would be his especial concern , or any concern of his whatever ?
the discovery of evolution has knocked your christianity into a cocked hat . "
i do n't remember how i answered him .
in spite of the <unk> of his own arguments , which i was not learned enough to detect , i was <unk> routed .
<name> had kicked over the bucket , and that was all there was to it ... . after we had left the club both <unk> and <unk> admitted they were somewhat disturbed , declaring that <name> had gone too far .
i spent a miserable night , recalling the <unk> assertions he had made so glibly , asking myself again and again how it was that the religion to which i so vainly clung had no greater effect on my actions and on my <name> , had not prevented me from lapses into degradation .
and i hated myself for having argued upon a subject that was still sacred .
i believed in christ , which is to say that i believed that in some inscrutable manner he existed , continued to <unk> the world and had suffered on my account .
to whom should i go now for a confirmation of my wavering beliefs ?
one of the results  it <name> be remembered of religion as i was taught it was a pernicious shyness , and even though i had found a mentor and <unk> , i might have hesitated to <unk> myself .
this would be different from arguing with <name> hambleton .
in my predicament , as i was wandering through the yard , i came across a notice of an evening talk to students in holder chapel , by a clergyman named phillips <name> .
this was before the time , let me say in passing , when his sermons at harvard were attended by crowds of <unk> .
well , i stood staring at the notice , debating whether i should go , trying to screw up my courage ; for i recognized clearly that such a step , if it were to be of any value , must mean a distinct departure from my present mode of life ; and i recall thinking with a certain revulsion that i should have to " turn good . "
my presence at the meeting would be known the next day to all my friends , for the idea of attending a religious gathering when one was not forced to do so by the authorities was unheard of in our set .
i should be classed with the despised " pious ones " who did such things regularly .
i shrank from the ridicule .
i had , however , heard of mr. <name> from <name> <unk> , who was by no means of the pious type , and whose parents attended mr. <name> 's church in boston ... .
i left my decision in abeyance .
but when evening came i stole away from the club table , on the plea of an engagement , and made my way rapidly toward holder chapel .
i had almost reached it  when i caught a glimpse of <unk> and of some others approaching ,  and i went on , to turn again .
by this time the meeting , which was in a room on the second floor , had already begun .
palpitating , i climbed the steps ; the door of the room was slightly ajar ; i looked in ; i recall a distinct sensation of surprise ,  the atmosphere of that meeting was so different from what i had expected .
not a " pious " atmosphere at all !
i saw a very tall and heavy gentleman , dressed in black , who sat , wholly at ease , on the table !
one hand was in his pocket , one foot swung clear of the ground ; and he was not preaching , but talking in an easy , conversational tone to some forty young men who sat intent on his words .
i was too excited to listen to what he was saying , i was making a vain attempt to classify him .
but i remember the thought , for it struck me with force ,  that if christianity were so thoroughly discredited by evolution , as <name> hambleton and other <unk> would have one believe , why should this remarkably sane and <unk> person be standing up for it as though it were still an established and <unk> fact ?
he had not , certainly , the air of a dupe or a <unk> , but inspired confidence by his very personality .
<unk> , i watched him narrowly for flaws , for <unk> tricks , for all kinds of <unk> symptoms .
again i was near the secret ; again it escaped me .
the argument for christianity lay not in assertions about it , but in being it .
this man was christianity ... .
i must have felt something of this , even though i failed to <unk> it .
and unconsciously i contrasted his strength , which reinforced the atmosphere of the room , with that of <name> hambleton , who was , a greater influence over me than i have recorded , and had come to sway me more and more , as he had swayed others .
the strength of each was impressive , yet this mr. <name> seemed to me the bodily <unk> of a set of values which i would have kept constantly before my eyes ... .
i felt him drawing me , overcoming my hesitation , <unk> my fear of ridicule .
i began gently to open the door  when something happened ,  one of those little things that may change the course of a life .
the door made little noise , yet one of the men sitting in the back of the room chanced to look around , and i recognized hermann krebs .
his face was still sunken from his recent illness .
into his eyes seemed to leap a sudden appeal , an appeal to which my soul responded yet i hurried down the stairs and into the street .
instantly i regretted my retreat , i would have gone back , but lacked the courage ; and i strayed unhappily for hours , now haunted by that look of krebs , now wondering what the remarkably <unk> and informal clergyman whose presence dominated the little room had been talking about .
i never learned , but i did live to read his biography , to discover what he might have talked about ,  for he if any man believed that life and religion are one , and preached consecration to life 's task .
of little use to speculate whether the message , had i learned it then , would have fortified and transformed me !
in spite of the fact that i was unable to relate to a satisfying <name> of religion my new-born determination , i made up my mind , at least , to renounce my tortuous ways .
i had promised my father to be a lawyer ; i would keep my promise , i would give the law a fair trial ; later on , perhaps , i might demonstrate an ability to write .
all very praiseworthy !
the season was lent , a fitting time for <unk> and resolves .
although i had more than once fallen from <name> , i believed myself at last to have settled down on my true course  when something happened .
the devil interfered subtly , as usual  now in the person of <name> kyme .
it should be said in justice to <name> that he did not look the part .
he had <unk> , curly hair , mischievous blue eyes with long lashes , and he <unk> no respect whatever for any individual or institution , sacred or profane ; he possessed , however , a shrewd sense of his own value , as many innocent and unsuspecting souls discovered as early as our freshman year , and his method of putting down the presumptuous was both effective and unique .
if he liked you , there could be no mistake about it .
one evening when i was engaged in composing a theme for mr. cheyne on no less a subject than the interpretation of the work of <name> wordsworth , i found myself unexpectedly sprawling on the floor , in my descent kicking the table so vigorously as to send the <unk> a foot or two toward the ceiling .
this , be it known , was a typical proof of <name> 's esteem .
for he had entered noiselessly , jerking the back of my chair , which chanced to be tilted , and stood with his hands in his pockets , surveying the ruin he had wrought , watching the ink as it trickled on the carpet .
then he picked up the book .
" poetry , you darned old grind ! "
he exclaimed <unk> .
" say , parry , i do n't know what 's got into you , but i want you to come home with me for the <name> holidays .
it 'll do you good .
we 'll be on the hudson , you know , and we 'll manage to make life <unk> somehow . "
i forgot my irritation , in sheer surprise .
" why , that 's mighty good of you , <name>  " i began , struggling to my feet .
" oh , rot ! "
he exclaimed .
" i should n't ask you if i did n't want you . "
there was no denying the truth of this , and after he had gone i sat for a long time with my pen in my mouth , reflecting as to whether or not i should go .
for i had the instinct that here was another cross-roads , that more depended on my decision than i cared to admit .
but even then i knew what i should do .
ridiculous not to  i told myself .
how could a week or ten days with <name> possibly affect my <unk> , resolve ?
yet the prospect , now , of a visit to the <unk> ' was by no means so glowing as it once would have been .
for i had seen visions , i had dreamed dreams , beheld a delectable country of my very own .
a year ago  nay , even a month ago  how such an invitation would have glittered ! ...
i returned at length to my theme , over which , before <name> 's arrival , i had been working feverishly .
but now the glamour had gone from it .
presently <name> came in .
" anyone been here ? "
he demanded .
" <name> , " i told him .
" what did he want ? "
" he wanted me to go home with him at <name> . "
" you 're going , of course . "
" i do n't know .
i have n't decided . "
" you 'd be a fool not to , " was <name> 's comment .
it voiced , <unk> , a prevailing opinion .
it was the conclusion i arrived at in my own mind .
but just why i had been chosen for the honour , especially at such a time , was a riddle .
<name> 's invitations were <unk> given , and valued accordingly ; and more than once , at our table , i had felt a twinge of envy when <unk> or someone else had remarked , with the proper nonchalance , in answer to a question , that they were going to <unk> .
such was the name of the kyme place ... .
i shall never forget the impression made on me by the decorous luxury of that big house , standing amidst its old trees , halfway up the gentle slope that rose steadily from the historic highway where poor <name> was captured .
i can see now the heavy stone pillars of its portico <unk> in a flush of tenderest green , the tulips just beginning to flame forth their <name> colours in the well-kept beds , the stately , <unk> evergreens , the vivid lawns , the clipped hedges .
and like an overwhelming wave of emotion that swept all before it , the impressiveness of wealth took possession of me .
for here was a kind of wealth i had never known , that did not exist in the west , nor even in the still puritan environs of boston where i had visited .
it took itself for granted , proclaimed itself complacently to have solved all problems .
by ignoring them , perhaps .
but i was too young to guess this .
it was order <unk> , gaining effect at every turn by a multitude of details too trivial to mention were it not for the fact that they entered deeply into my consciousness , until they came to represent , collectively , the very flower of achievement .
it was a wealth that accepted tribute calmly , as of inherent right .
law and tradition defended its sanctity more effectively than troops .
literature descended from her high altar to lend it dignity ; and the long , silent library displayed row upon row of the masters , appropriately clad in morocco or calf ,  <unk> , macaulay , gibbon , richardson , <unk> , <name> , dickens , <name> and <unk> , as though each had striven for a tablet here .
<name> had denied herself that her canvases might be <name> on these walls ; and even the church , on that first <name> of my visit , forgot the blood of her martyrs that she might adorn an appropriate niche in the setting .
the clergyman , at one of the dinner parties , gravely asked a blessing as upon an institution that included and absorbed all other institutions in its being ... .
the note of that house was a tempered gaiety .
guests arrived from new york , spent the night and departed again without disturbing the even tenor of its ways .
unobtrusive servants <unk> to their wants ,  and to mine ... . <unk> was there , and two classmates from boston , and we were treated with the amiable tolerance accorded to college youths and intimates of the son of the house .
one night there was a dance in our honour .
nor have i forgotten <name> 's sister , <name> , whom i had met at class days , a slim and <unk> , exotic young <name> of the <unk> type , with a crown of burnished hair , yet more suggestive of a hothouse than of spring .
she spoke english with a french accent .
capricious , impulsive , she captured my interest because she put a high value on her favour ; she drove me over the hills , informing me at length that i was <unk>  different from the rest ; in short , she emphasized and intensified what i may call the <unk> environment , stirred up in me new and vague aspirations that troubled yet excited me .
then there was mrs. kyme , a pretty , light-hearted <name> , still young , who seemed to have no intention of growing older , who romped and played songs for us on the piano .
the daughter of an old but now <unk> <unk> family , she had been born to adorn the position she held , she was adapted by nature to wring from it the utmost of the joys it offered .
from her , rather than from her husband , both of the children seemed to have inherited .
i used to watch mr. <unk> kyme as he sat at the end of the dinner-table , dark , preoccupied , <unk> , symbolical of a wealth new to my experience , and which had about it a certain fabulous quality .
it toiled not , neither did it spin , but grew as if by magic , day and night , until the very <name> of it was overpowering .
what must it be to have had ancestors who had been clever enough to sit still until a <unk> and discontented europe had begun to pour its thousands and hundreds of thousands into the gateway of the western world , until that gateway had become a metropolis ?
ancestors , of course , possessing what now suddenly appeared to me as the most desirable of gifts  since it <unk> so dazzling a <unk> foresight .
from time to time these ancestors had continued to buy desirable corners , which no amount of persuasion had availed to make them relinquish .
lease them , yes ; sell them , never !
by virtue of such a system wealth was as inevitable as human necessity ; and the thought of human necessity did not greatly bother me .
mr. kyme 's problem of life was not one of making money , but of investing it .
one became automatically a personage ... .
it was due to one of those singular coincidences  so interesting a subject for speculation  that the man who revealed to me this golden romance of the kyme family was none other than a resident of my own city , mr. <name> watling , now become one of our most important and influential citizens ; a corporation lawyer , new and stimulating qualification , suggesting as it did , a <unk> ex <unk> of great affairs .
that he , of all men , should come to <unk> astonished me , since i was as yet to make the connection between that finished , decorous , secluded existence and the source of its being .
the evening before my departure he arrived in company with two other gentlemen , a mr. talbot and a mr. <unk> , whose names were spoken with respect in a sphere of which i had hitherto taken but little <unk> street .
<unk> informed me that they were " <unk> , " ... we were sitting in the drawing-room at tea , when they entered with mr. watling , and no sooner had he spoken to mrs. kyme than his quick eye singled me out of the group .
" why , <name> ! "
he exclaimed , taking my hand .
" i had no idea i should meet you here  i saw your father only last week , the day i left home . "
and he added , turning to mrs. kyme , " <name> is the son of mr. <name> paret , who has been the leader of our bar for many years . "
the recognition and the tribute to my father were so graciously given that i warmed with gratitude and pride , while mr. kyme smiled a little , remarking that i was a friend of <name> 's .
<name> watling , for being here , had suddenly assumed in my eyes a considerable consequence , though the note he struck in that house was a strange one .
it was , however , his own note , and had a certain distinction , a ring of independence , of the knowledge of <unk> .
dinner at <unk> we youngsters had usually found rather an oppressive ceremony , with its shaded lights and precise ritual over which mr. kyme presided like a high priest ; conversation had been restrained .
that night , as <name> <unk> afterwards expressed it , " things loosened up , " and mr. watling was responsible for the loosening .
taking command of the kyme dinner table appeared to me to be no mean achievement , but this is just what he did , without being vulgar or noisy or <unk> .
<unk> in <unk> , <unk> in re .
if , as i watched him there with a <unk> pride and loyalty , i had paused to reconstruct the idea that the mention of his name would formerly have evoked , i suppose i should have found him falling short of my notion of a gentleman ; it had been my father 's opinion ; but mr. watling 's marriage to <name> hollister 's aunt had given him a standing with us at home .
he possessed <unk> , vitality in a remarkable degree , yet some elusive quality that was neither tact nor delicacy  though related to these differentiated him from the commonplace , self-made man of ability .
he was just off the type .
to <unk> him to a clothing store model of a well-built , broad-shouldered man with a firm neck , a handsome , rather square face not lacking in colour and a conventional , drooping moustache would be <unk> ; yet he did suggest it .
suggesting it , he redeemed it : and the middle western burr in his voice was rather attractive than otherwise .
he had not so much the air of belonging there , as of belonging anywhere  one of those <unk> american citizens of the world who go abroad and make intimates of princes .
before the meal was over he had inspired me with loyalty and pride , enlisted the admiration of <name> and <unk> and <name> <unk> ; we followed him into the smoking-room , sitting down in a row on a leather lounge behind our elders .
here , now that the gentlemen were alone , there was an inspiring <unk> in their talk that fired the imagination .
the subject was investments , at first those of coal and iron in my own state , for mr. watling , it appeared , was counsel for the boyne iron works .
" it <name> pay you to keep an eye on that company , mr. kyme , " he said , knocking the ashes from his cigar .
" now that old mr. durrett 's gone  " " you do n't mean to say <name> durrett 's dead ! "
said mr. kyme .
the lawyer nodded .
" the old regime passed with him .
adolf scherer succeeds him , and you may take my word for it , he 's a coming man .
mr. durrett , who was a judge of men , recognized that .
scherer was an emigrant , he had ideas , and rose to be a foreman .
for the last few years mr. durrett threw everything on his shoulders ... . " little by little the scope of the discussion was enlarged until it ranged over a continent , touching lightly upon lines of railroad , built or projected , across the great west our pioneers had so lately succeeded in <unk> from the savages , upon mines of copper and gold hidden away among the mountains , and millions of acres of forest and grazing lands which a complacent government would relinquish provided certain technicalities were met : touching lightly , too , very lightly ,  upon senators and <unk> at washington .
and for the first time i learned that not the least of the functions of these representatives of the people was to act as the medium between capital and investment , to facilitate the handing over of the republic 's resources to those in a position to develop them .
the emphasis was laid on development , or rather on the resulting prosperity for the country : that was the justification , and it was taken for granted as supreme .
nor was it new to me ; this cult of prosperity .
i recalled the <unk> processions of the tariff <unk> of my childhood days , my father 's championship of the republican party .
he had not <unk> politicians , either .
for the american , politics and ethics were strangers .
thus i listened with increasing fascination to these gentlemen in evening clothes calmly treating the united states as a melon patch that existed largely for the purpose of being divided up amongst a limited and favored number of persons .
i had a feeling of being among the initiated .
where , it may be asked , were my ideals ?
let it not be supposed that i believed myself to have lost them .
if so , the impression i have given of myself has been wholly inadequate .
no , they had been <unk> , that is all , <unk> by the <unk> of <unk> , by the personality of <name> watling into brighter visions .
my eyes rarely left his face ; i <name> on his talk , which was interspersed with native humour , though he did not always join in the laughter , sometimes gazing at the fire , as though his keen mind were <unk> with a problem suggested .
i noted the respect in which his opinions were held , and my imagination was fired by an impression of the power to be achieved by successful men of his profession , by the evidence of their <unk> to capital itself ... . at last when the gentlemen rose and were leaving the room , mr. watling lingered , with his hand on my arm .
" of course you 're going through the law school , <name> , " he said .
" yes , sir , " i replied .
" good ! "
he exclaimed emphatically .
" the law , to-day , is more of a career than ever , especially for a young man with your <unk> and advantages , and i know of no city in the united states where i would rather start practice , if i were a young man , than ours .
in the next twenty years we shall see a tremendous growth .
of course you 'll be going into your father 's office .
you could n't do better .
but i 'll keep an eye on you , and perhaps i 'll be able to help you a little , too . "
i thanked him gratefully .
a famous artist , who started out in youth to embrace a military career and who failed to pass an examination at west point , is said to have remarked that if <unk> had been a gas he would have been a soldier .
i am afraid i may have given the impression that if i had not gone to <unk> and encountered mr. watling i might not have been a lawyer .
this impression would be misleading .
and while it is certain that i have not exaggerated the intensity of the spiritual experience i went through at cambridge , a somewhat belated consideration for the truth compels me to register my belief that the mood would in any case have been <unk> .
the poison generated by the struggle of my nature with its environment had sunk too deep , and the very education that was supposed to make a practical man of me had turned me into a <unk> .
i became , as <name> be seen , anything but a practical man in the true sense , though the world in which i had been brought up and continued to live deemed me such .
my father was greatly pleased when i wrote him that i was now more than ever convinced of the wisdom of choosing the law as my profession , and was satisfied that i had come to my senses at last .
he had still been prepared to see me " go off at a <unk> , " as he expressed it .
on the other hand , the powerful effect of the appeal made by <unk> and mr. watling must not be <unk> .
here in one object lesson was emphasized a host of suggestions each of which had made its impression .
and when i returned to cambridge <name> cheyne knew that he had lost me ... .
i pass over the rest of my college course , and the years i spent at the harvard law school , where were <unk> into me without difficulty the <unk> that the law was the most important of all professions , that those who entered it were a <unk> class set aside to guard from profanation that ark of the covenant , the constitution of the united states .
in short , i was taught law precisely as i had been taught religion ,  scriptural infallibility over again ,  a static law and a static theology ,  a set of <unk> that were supposed to be equal to any problems civilization would have to meet until the <unk> .
what we are wont to call wisdom is often naively innocent of impending change .
it has no <unk> properties .
i shall content myself with relating one incident only of this period .
in the <name> of my last year i went with a party of young men and girls to stay over <name> at <name> farms , where mrs. <unk>  a young boston matron had opened her cottage for the occasion .
this " cottage , " a roomy , <unk> structure , stood on a <name> , at the foot of which roared the wintry atlantic , while we danced and popped corn before the open fires .
during the daylight hours we drove about the country in sleighs , or made ridiculous attempts to walk on <unk> .
on <name> afternoon , left temporarily to my own devices , i wandered along the <name> , crossing into the adjoining property .
the wind had fallen ; the waves , much subdued , broke <unk> against the rocks ; during the night a new mantle of snow had been spread , and the clouds were still low and menacing .
as i strolled i became aware of a motionless figure ahead of me ,  one that seemed oddly familiar ; the set of the shabby overcoat on the stooping shoulders , the unconscious pose contributed to a certain sharpness of individuality ; in the act of challenging my memory , i halted .
the man was gazing at the <unk> , and his very absorption gave me a sudden and unfamiliar thrill .
the word absorption precisely expresses my meaning , for he seemed indeed to have become a part of his surroundings ,  an harmonious part .
presently he swung about and looked at me as though he had expected to find me there  and greeted me by name .
" krebs ! "
i exclaimed .
he smiled , and flung out his arm , indicating the scene .
his eyes at that moment seemed to reflect the sea ,  they made the gaunt face suddenly beautiful .
" this reminds me of a japanese print , " he said .
the words , or the tone in which he spoke , curiously transformed the picture .
it was as if i now beheld it , anew , through his vision : the grey water stretching eastward to melt into the grey sky , the massed , black trees on the hillside , powdered with white , the snow in rounded , fantastic patches on the huge boulders at the foot of the <name> .
krebs did not seem like a stranger , but like one whom i had known always ,  one who stood in a peculiar relationship between me and something greater i could not define .
the impression was fleeting , but real ... .
i remember wondering how he could have known anything about japanese prints .
" i did n't think you were still in this part of the country , " i remarked awkwardly .
" i 'm a reporter on a boston newspaper , and i 've been sent up here to interview old mr. dome , who lives in that house , " and he pointed to a roof above the trees .
" there is a rumour , which i <name> to verify , that he has just given a hundred thousand dollars to the university . "
" and  wo n't he see you ? "
" at present he 's taking a nap , " said krebs .
" he comes here occasionally for a rest . "
" do you like interviewing ? "
i asked .
he smiled again .
" well , i see a good many different kinds of people , and that's interesting . "
" but  being a reporter ? "
i persisted .
this continued patronage was not a conscious expression of superiority on my part , but he did not seem to resent it .
he had aroused my curiosity .
" i 'm going into the law , " he said .
the quiet confidence with which he spoke aroused , suddenly , a twinge of antagonism .
he had every right to go into the law , of course , and yet ! ...
my query would have made it evident to me , had i been <unk> in those days , that the germ of the ideal of the profession , implanted by mr. watling , was expanding .
were not influential friends necessary for the proper kind of career ?
and where were krebs 's ?
in spite of the history of <name> webster and a long line of american tradition , i felt an <unk> in my <unk> aspiration .
and as he stood there , gaunt and undoubtedly hungry , his eyes kindling , i must vaguely have classed him with the <unk> of all the ages ; must have felt in him , instinctively , a menace to the stability of that order with which i had thrown my fortunes .
and yet there were comparatively poor men in the law school itself who had not made me feel this way !
he had impressed me against my <name> , taken me by surprise , commiseration had been mingled with other feelings that sprang out of the memory of the night i had called on him , when he had been sick .
now i resented something in him which <name> peters had called " crust . "
" the law ! "
i repeated .
" why ? "
" well , " he said , " even when i was a boy , working at odd jobs , i used to think if i could ever be a lawyer i should have reached the top notch of human dignity . "
once more his smile disarmed me .
" and now " i asked curiously .
" you see , it was an ideal with me , i suppose .
my father was responsible for that .
he had the <name> temperament of <unk> , and when he fled to this country , he expected to find <unk> . "
the smile emerged again , like the sun shining through clouds , while fascination and antagonism again struggled within me .
" and then came frightful troubles .
for years he could get only enough work to keep him and my mother alive , but he never lost his <name> in <name> .
'it is man , ' he would say , 'man has to grow up to it  to <name> . '
without the struggle , <name> would be worth nothing .
and he used to tell me that we must all do our part , we who had come here , and not expect everything to be done for us .
he had made that mistake .
if things were bad , why , put a shoulder to the wheel and help to make them better .
" that helped me , " he continued , after a moment 's pause .
" for i 've seen a good many things , especially since i 've been working for a newspaper .
i 've seen , again and again , the power of the law turned against those whom it was intended to protect , i 've seen lawyers who care a great deal more about winning cases than they do about justice , who <unk> their profession to profit making ,  profit making for themselves and others .
and they are often the respectable lawyers , too , men of high standing , whom you would not think would do such things .
they are on the side of the powerful , and the best of them are all retained by <name> men and corporations .
and what is the result ?
one of the worst evils , i think , that can befall a country .
the poor man goes less and less to the courts .
he is getting bitter , which is bad , which is dangerous .
but men wo n't see it . "
it was on my tongue to refute this , to say that everybody had a chance .
i could indeed recall many arguments that had been drilled into me ; quotations , even , from court decisions .
but something prevented me from doing this ,  something in his manner , which was neither <unk> nor <unk> .
" that 's why i am going into the law , " he added .
" and i intend to stay in it if i can keep alive .
it 's a great chance for me  for all of us .
are n't you at the law school ? "
i nodded .
once more , as his <name> glance fell upon me , came that suggestion of a subtle , inexplicable link between us ; but before i could reply , steps were heard behind us , and an elderly servant , bareheaded , was seen coming down the path .
" are you the reporter ? "
he demanded somewhat impatiently of krebs .
" if you want to see mr. dome , you 'd better come right away .
he 's going out for a drive . "
for a while , after he had shaken my hand and departed , i stood in the snow , looking after him ... . viii on the wednesday of that same week the news of my father 's sudden and serious illness came to me in a telegram , and by the time i arrived at home it was too late to see him again alive .
it was my first experience with death , and what perplexed me continually during the following days was an inability to feel the loss more deeply .
when a child , i had been easily shaken by the spectacle of sorrow .
had i , during recent years , as a result of a discovery that emotions arising from human relationships lead to discomfort and suffering , deliberately been forming a shell , until now i was incapable of natural feelings ?
of late i had seemed closer to my father , and his letters , though formal , had given evidence of his affection ; in his repressed fashion he had made it clear that he looked forward to the time when i was to practise with him .
why was it then , as i gazed upon his fine features in death , that i experienced no intensity of sorrow ?
what was it in me that would not break down ?
he seemed worn and tired , yet i had never thought of him as weary , never attributed to him any yearning .
and now he was released .
i wondered what had been his private thoughts about himself , his private opinions about life ; and when i reflect now upon my lack of real knowledge at five and twenty , i am amazed at the futility of an expensive education which had failed to impress upon me the simple , <unk> fact that life was struggle ; that either development or <unk> is the fate of all men , that characters are never completely made , but always in the making .
i had merely a disconcerting glimpse of this truth , with no powers of <unk> , as i sat beside my mother in the bedroom , where every article evoked some childhood scene .
here was the <unk> in the walnut <unk> of the bed made , one wintry day , by the impact of my box of blocks ; the big arm-chair , covered with i know not what stiff embroidery , which had served on countless occasions as a chariot driven to victory .
i even remembered how every wednesday morning i had been banished from the room , which had been so large a part of my childhood universe , when <name> , the housemaid , had flung open all its windows and crowded its furniture into the hall .
the thought of my wanderings since then became poignant , almost terrifying .
the room , with all its memories , was unchanged .
how safe i had been within its walls !
why could i not have been , content with what it represented ?
of tradition , of custom ,  of religion ?
and what was it within me that had lured me away from these ?
i was miserable , indeed , but my misery was not of the kind i thought it ought to be .
at moments , when my mother relapsed into weeping , i glanced at her almost in wonder .
such sorrow as hers was incomprehensible .
once she surprised and discomfited me by lifting her head and gazing fixedly at me through her tears .
i recall certain impressions of the funeral .
there , among the <unk> , was my cousin <name> breck , tears in the furrows of his cheeks .
had he loved my father more than i ?
the sight of his grief moved me suddenly and strongly ... .
it seemed an age since i had worked in his store , and yet here he was still , coming to town every morning and returning every evening to <unk> , loving his friends , and mourning them one by one .
was this , the spectacle presented by my cousin <name> , the reward of earthly existence ?
were there no other prizes save those known as greatness of character and depth of human affections ?
cousin <name> looked worn and old .
the other <unk> , men of weight , of long standing in the community , were aged , too ; mr. blackwood , and mr. <name> hollister ; and out of place , somehow , in this new church building .
it came to me abruptly that the old order was gone ,  had slipped away during my absence .
the church i had known in boyhood had been torn down to make room for a business building on boyne street ; the edifice in which i sat was expensive , gave forth no distinctive note ; seemingly <unk> with its hybrid interior , its shiny oak and blue and red <unk> , <unk> a compromised and weakened <name> .
nondescript , likewise , seemed the new minister , mr. <unk> , as he prayed <unk> in front of the flowers massed on the platform .
i vaguely resented his <unk> references to my father .
the old church , with its severity , had actually stood for something .
it was the westminster catechism in wood and stone , and dr .
pound had been the human incarnation of that catechism , the fit representative of a <unk> god , a militant shepherd who had guarded with vigilance his respectable flock , who had protested vehemently against the sins of the world by which they were surrounded , against the " dogs , and <unk> , and <unk> , and murderers and <unk> , and whosoever <unk> and maketh a lie . "
how dr .
pound would have put the emphasis of the everlasting into those words !
against what was mr. <unk> protesting ?
my glance wandered to the pews which held the committees from various organizations , such as the chamber of commerce and the bar association , which had come to do honour to my father .
and there , differentiated from the others , i saw the spruce , alert figure of <name> watling .
he , too , represented a new type and a new note ,  this time a forceful note , a secular note that had not belonged to the old church , and seemed likewise <unk> in the new ... . during the long , slow journey in the carriage to the cemetery my mother did not raise her veil .
it was not until she reached out and seized my hand , convulsively , that i realized she was still a part of my existence .
in the days that followed i became aware that my father 's death had removed a <unk> element , that i was free now to take without criticism or opposition whatever course in life i might <name> .
it may be that i had apprehended even then that his professional ideals would not have <unk> with my own .
mingled with this sense of emancipation was a curious feeling of regret , of mourning for something i had never valued , something fixed and <unk> for which he had stood , a rock and a refuge of which i had never availed myself ! ...
when his <name> was opened it was found that the property had been left to my mother during her lifetime .
it was larger than i had thought , four hundred thousand dollars , shrewdly invested , for the most part , in city real estate .
my father had been very secretive as to money matters , and my mother had no interest in them .
three or four days later i received in the mail a typewritten letter signed by <name> watling , expressing sympathy for my bereavement , and asking me to drop in on him , down town , before i should leave the city .
in contrast to the somewhat dingy offices where my father had practised in the blackwood block , the quarters of watling , fowndes and ripon on the eighth floor of the new durrett building were modern to a degree , finished in oak and floored with marble , with a <unk> space where young women with nimble fingers played ceaselessly on <unk> .
one of them informed me that mr. watling was busy , but on reading my card added that she would take it in .
meanwhile , in company with two others who may have been clients , i waited .
this , then , was what it meant to be a lawyer of importance , to have , like a chesterfield , an ante-room where clients cooled their heels and awaited one 's pleasure ...
the young woman returned , and led me through a corridor to a door on which was painted mr. wailing .
i recall him tilted back in his chair in a <unk> manner beside his polished desk , the hint of a smile on his lips ; and leaning close to him was a yellow , <unk> person whose eyes , as they turned to me , gave the impression of having stared for years into hard , artificial lights .
mr. watling rose briskly .
" how are you , <name> ? "
he said , the warmth of his greeting tempered by just the note of <unk> suitable to my black clothes .
" i 'm glad you came .
i wanted to see you before you went back to cambridge .
i must introduce you to judge bering , of our state supreme court .
judge , this is mr. paret 's boy . "
the judge looked me over with a certain slow impressiveness , and gave me a soft and fleshy hand .
" glad to know you , mr. paret .
your father was a great loss to our bar , " he declared .
i detected in his tone and manner a slight reservation that could not be called precisely judicial dignity ; it was as though , in these few words , he had gone to the limit of <unk> with a stranger  a striking contrast to the confidential attitude towards mr. watling in which i had surprised him .
" judge , " said mr. watling , sitting down again , " do you recall that time we all went up to mr. paret 's house and tried to induce him to run for mayor ?
that was before you went on the lower bench . "
the judge nodded gloomily , caressing his watch chain , and suddenly rose to go .
" that <name> be all right , then ? "
mr. watling inquired <unk> , with a smile .
the other made a barely perceptible inclination of the head and departed .
mr. watling looked at me .
" he 's one of the best men we have on the bench to-day , " he added .
there was a trace of apology in his tone .
he talked a while of my father , to whom , so he said , he had looked up ever since he had been admitted to the bar .
" it would be a pleasure to me , <name> , as well as a matter of pride , " he said cordially , but with dignity , " to have <name> paret 's son in my office .
i suppose you <name> be wishing to take your mother somewhere this summer , but if you care to come here in the autumn , you <name> be welcome .
you <name> begin , of course , as other young men begin ,  as i began .
but i am a believer in blood , and i 'll be glad to have you .
mr. fowndes and mr. ripon feel the same way . "
he escorted me to the door himself .
everywhere i went during that brief visit home i was struck by change , by the crumbling and decay of institutions that once had held me in thrall , by the <unk> of a new order that as yet had assumed no definite character .
some of the old landmarks had disappeared ; there were new and aggressive office buildings , new and aggressive residences , new and aggressive citizens who lived in them , and of whom my mother spoke with gentle <unk> .
even <unk> , that paradise of my childhood , had grown shrivelled and shabby , even tawdry , i thought , when we went out there one <name> afternoon ; all that once represented the magic word " country " had vanished .
the old flat piano , made in philadelphia ages ago , the horsehair chairs and sofa had been replaced by a nondescript furniture of the sort displayed behind plate-glass windows of the city 's stores : <unk> on stands , <unk> in <unk> colours , their coiled springs only half hidden by tassels , and " ornamental " electric fixtures , instead of the polished <unk> lamps .
cousin <name> had grown white , <name> was a staid bachelor , <name> an old maid , while <name> had married a tall , <unk> young man with glasses , <name> <unk> , whom cousin <name> had taken into the store .
as i contemplated the <unk> odd questions suggested themselves : did honesty and <unk> necessarily accompany a lack of artistic taste ?
and was virtue its own reward , after all ?
they <name> my mother into the house , took off her wraps , set her down in the most comfortable <unk> , and insisted on making her a cup of tea .
i was touched .
i loved them still , and yet i was conscious of reservations concerning them .
they , too , seemed a little on the defensive with me , and once in a while <name> was caustic in her remarks .
" i guess nothing but new york <name> be good enough for <name> now .
he 'll be taking cousin <name> away from us . "
" not at all , my dear , " said my mother , gently , " he 's going into mr. watling 's office next autumn . "
" <name> watling ? "
demanded cousin <name> , pausing in his carving .
" yes , <name> .
mr. watling has been good enough to say that he would like to have <name> .
is there anything  ? "
" oh , i 'm out of date , <name> , " cousin <name> replied , vigorously <unk> the leg of the turkey .
" these modern lawyers are too smart for me .
watling 's no worse than the others , i suppose ,  only he 's got more ability . "
" i 've never heard anything against him , " said my mother in a pained voice .
" only the other day mcalery willett congratulated me that <name> was going to be with him . "
" you must n't mind <name> , <name> , " put in cousin <name> ,  a remark reminiscent of other days .
" dad has a notion that his generation is the only honest one , " said <name> , laughingly , as she passed a plate .
i had gained a sense of superiority , and i was quite indifferent to cousin <name> 's opinion of mr. watling , of modern lawyers in general .
more than once a wave of <unk> surged through me that i had possessed the foresight and initiative to get out of the wholesale grocery business while there was yet time .
i looked at <name> , still freckled , still literal , still a <unk> , at <name> <unk> , and i thought of the <unk> of their lives ; at cousin <name> himself as he sat smoking his cigar in the <unk> on that dark february day , and suddenly i pitied him .
the suspicion struck me that he had not prospered of late , and this deepened to a conviction as he talked .
" the republican party is going to the dogs , " he asserted .
" it used to be an honourable party , but now it is no better than the other .
politics are only conducted , now , for the purpose of making unscrupulous men <name> , sir .
for years i furnished this city with good groceries , if i do say it myself .
i took a pride in the fact that the inmates of the hospitals , yes , and the dependent poor in the <unk> institutions , should have honest food .
you can get anything out of the city if you are willing to pay the politicians for it .
i lost my city contracts .
why ?
because i refused to deal with scoundrels .
<unk> and company and other unscrupulous <unk> are willing to do so , and poison the poor and the sick with <unk> groceries !
the first thing i knew was that the city auditor was holding back my bills for supplies , and paying <unk> 's .
that 's what politics and business , yes , sir , and the law , have come to in these days .
if a man wants to succeed , he must turn into a rascal . "
i was not shocked , but i was silent , uncomfortable , wishing that it were time to take the train back to the city .
cousin <name> 's face was more worn than i had thought , and i contrasted him inevitably with the forceful person who used to stand , in his worn alpaca coat , on the pavement in front of his store , greeting with <unk> content his fellow merchants of the city .
<name> breck , too , was silent , and <name> <unk> took off his glasses and wiped them .
in the meanwhile <name> had left the group in which my mother sat , and , approaching us , laid her hands on her father 's shoulders .
" now , dad , " she said , in affectionate remonstrance , " you 're excited about politics again , and you know it is n't good for you .
and besides , they 're not worth it . "
" you 're right , <name> , " he replied .
under the pressure of her hands he made a strong effort to control himself , and turned to address my mother across the room .
" i 'm getting to be a <unk> old man , " he said .
" it 's a good thing i have a daughter to remind me of it . "
" it is a good thing , <name> , " said my mother .
during the rest of our visit he seemed to have recovered something of his former spirits and poise , taking refuge in the past .
they talked of their own youth , of families whose houses had been landmarks on the second bank .
" i 'm worried about your cousin <name> , <name> , " my mother confided to me , when we were at length seated in the train .
" i 've heard rumours that things are not so well at the store as they might be . "
we looked out at the <name> landscape , so different from that one which had thrilled every fibre of my being in the days when the railroad on which we travelled had been a winding narrow gauge .
the orchards  those that remained  were bare ; stubble pricked the frozen ground where tassels had once waved in the hot , summer wind .
we flew by row after row of <unk> , suburban houses built on " villa plots , " and i read in large letters on a hideous <unk> , " <unk> park . "
" <name> , have you ever heard anything against  mr .
watling ? "
" no , mother , " i said .
" so far as i knew , he is very much looked up to by lawyers and business men .
he is counsel , i believe , for mr. <unk> street car line on boyne street .
and i told you , i believe , that i met him once at mr .
kyme 's . "
" poor <name> ! "
she sighed .
" i suppose business trouble does make one bitter ,  i 've seen it so often .
but i never imagined that it would overtake <name> , and at his time of life !
it is an old and respected firm , and we have always had a pride in it . " ...
that night , when i was going to bed , it was evident that the subject was still in her mind .
she clung to my hand a moment .
" i , too , am afraid of the new , <name> , " she said , a little tremulously .
" we all grow so , as age comes on . "
" but you are not old , mother , " i protested .
" i have a feeling , since your father has gone , that i have lived my life , my dear , though i 'd like to stay long enough to see you happily married  to have grandchildren .
i was not young when you were born . "
and she added , after a little while , " i know nothing about business affairs , and now  now that your father is no longer here , sometimes i 'm afraid  " " afraid of what , mother ? "
she tried to smile at me through her tears .
we were in the old sitting-room , surrounded by the books .
" i know it 's foolish , and it is n't that i do n't trust you .
i know that the son of your father could n't do anything that was not honourable .
and yet i am afraid of what the world is becoming .
the city is growing so fast , and so many new people are coming in .
things are not the same .
<name> is right , there .
and i have heard your father say the same thing .
<name> , promise me that you <name> try to remember always what he was , and what he would wish you to be ! "
" i <name> , mother , " i answered .
" but i think you would find that cousin <name> <unk> a little , makes things seem worse than they really are .
customs change , you know .
and politics were never well  <name> schools . "
i , too , smiled a little .
" father knew that .
and he would never take an active part in them . "
" he was too fine ! "
she exclaimed .
" and now , " i continued , " cousin <name> has happened to come in contact with them through business .
that is what has made the difference in him .
before , he always knew they were corrupt , but he rarely thought about them . "
" <name> , " she said suddenly , after a pause , " you must remember one thing ,  that you can afford to be independent .
i thank god that your father has provided for that ! "
i was duly admitted , the next autumn , to the bar of my own state , and was assigned to a desk in the offices of watling , fowndes and ripon .
<name> weed was my immediate senior among the apprentices , and <name> was a <unk> .
i can see him now .
he suggested a <unk> as he sat in the little room we shared in common , his arms <unk> over a law book , his little legs doubled under him , his round , eyes fixed expectantly on the doorway .
and even if i had not been aware of my good fortune in being connected with such a firm as <name> watling 's , <name> would shortly have brought it home to me .
during those weeks when i was making my first desperate attempts at <unk> up the law i was sometimes interrupted by his exclamations when certain figures went by in the corridor .
" say , <name> , do you know who that was ? "
" no . "
" miller gorse . "
" who 's he ? "
" do you mean to say you never heard of miller gorse ? "
" i 've been away a long time , " i would answer apologetically .
a person of some importance among my contemporaries at harvard , i had looked forward to a residence in my native city with the complacency of one who has seen something of the world ,  only to find that i was the least in the new kingdom .
and it was a kingdom .
<name> opened up to me something of the significance and extent of it , something of the identity of the men who controlled it .
" miller gorse , " he said impressively , " is the counsel for the railroad . "
" what railroad ?
you mean the  " i was adding , when he interrupted me <unk> .
" after you 've been here a while you 'll find out there 's only one railroad in this state , so far as politics are concerned .
the <unk> and northern , the lake shore and the others do n't count . "
i refrained from asking any more questions at that time , but afterwards i always thought of the railroad as spelled with a capital .
" miller gorse is n't forty yet , " <name> told me on another occasion .
" that 's doing pretty well for a man who comes near running this state . "
for the sake of acquiring knowledge , i endured mr. weed 's patronage .
i inquired how mr. gorse ran the state .
" oh , you 'll find out soon enough , " he assured me .
" but mr. <unk> 's president of the railroad . "
" sure .
once in a while they take something up to him , but as a rule he leaves things to gorse . "
whereupon i resolved to have a good look at mr. gorse at the first opportunity .
one day mr. watling sent out for some papers .
" he 's in there now ; " said <name> .
" you take 'em . "
" in there " meant mr. watling 's sanctum .
and in there he was .
i had only a glance at the great man , for , with a kindly but preoccupied " thank you , <name> , " mr. watling took the papers and dismissed me .
<unk> , blackness and <unk> ,  these were the impressions of mr. gorse which i carried away from that first meeting .
the very solidity of his flesh seemed to suggest the solidity of his position .
such , say the <unk> , is the effect of prestige .
i remember well an old-fashioned picture puzzle in one of my boyhood books .
the scene depicted was to all appearances a sylvan , peaceful one , with two happy lovers seated on a log beside a <name> ; but presently , as one gazed at the picture , the head of an animal stood forth among the branches , and then the body ; more animals began to appear , bit by bit ; a tiger , a bear , a lion , a jackal , a fox , until at last , whenever i looked at the <name> , i did not see the sylvan scene at all , but only the predatory beasts of the forest .
so , one by one , the figures of the real rulers of the city superimposed themselves for me upon the simple and democratic design of mayor , council , board of aldermen , police force , etc. , that filled the eye of a naive and trusting <unk> which fondly imagined that it had something to say in government .
miller gorse was one of these rulers behind the screen , and adolf scherer , of the boyne iron works , another ; there was <name> dickinson of the corn national bank ; <name> grierson , becoming wealthy in city real estate ; judah b. tallant , who , though <unk> socially , was deferred to as the owner of the morning <name> ; and even <name> hambleton , rapidly <unk> the elderly and conservative mr. lord , who had hitherto managed the great hambleton estate .
<name> seemed to have become , in a somewhat <unk> manner , a full-fledged financier .
not having studied law , he had been home for four years when i became a legal <unk> , and during the early days of my apprenticeship i was beholden to him for many " eye <unk> " concerning the conduct of great affairs .
i remember him sauntering into my room one morning when <name> weed had gone out on an errand .
" hello , hughie , " he said , with his air of having nothing to do .
" grinding it out ?
where 's watling ? "
" is n't he in his office ? "
" no . "
" well , what can we do for you ? "
i asked .
<name> grinned .
" perhaps i 'll tell you when you 're a little older .
you 're too young . "
and he sank down into <name> weed 's chair , his long legs protruding on the other side of the table .
" it 's a matter of taxes .
some time ago i found out that dickinson and tallant and others i could mention were paying a good deal less on their city property than we are .
we don't propose to do it any more  that 's all . "
" how can mr. watling help you ? "
i inquired .
" well , i do n't mind giving you a few tips about your profession , hughie .
i 'm going to get watling to fix it up with the city hall gang .
old lord does n't like it , i 'll admit , and when i told him we had been contributing to the city long enough , that i proposed swinging into line with other property holders , he began to blubber about disgrace and what my grandfather would say if he were alive .
well , he is n't alive .
a good deal of water has flowed under the bridges since his day .
it 's a mere matter of business , of getting your respectable firm to retain a city hall attorney to fix it up with the <unk> . "
" how about the penitentiary ? "
i ventured , not too seriously .
" i <name> n't go to the penitentiary , neither <name> watling .
what i do is to pay a lawyer 's fee .
there is n't anything criminal in that , is there ? "
for some time after <name> had departed i sat reflecting upon this new knowledge , and there came into my mind the bitterness of cousin <name> breck against this city hall gang , and his remarks about lawyers .
i recalled the tone in which he had referred to mr. watling .
but <unk> philosophy easily triumphed .
why not be practical , and become master of a situation which one had not made , and could not alter , instead of being overwhelmed by it ?
needless to say , i did not mention the conversation to mr. watling , nor did he <unk> in my estimation .
these necessary transactions did not interfere in any way with his personal relationships , and his days were filled with kindnesses .
and was not mr. ripon , the <name> partner , one of the <unk> lights of the community , conducting advanced bible classes every week in the church of the redemption ? ...
the unfolding of mysteries kept me alert .
and i understood that , if i was to succeed , certain <unk> knowledge must be acquired , as it were , unofficially .
i kept my eyes and ears open , and applied myself , with all industry , to the routine tasks with which every young man in a large legal firm is familiar .
i recall distinctly my pride when , the board of aldermen having passed an ordinance lowering the water rates , i was intrusted with the responsibility of going before the court in behalf of mr. ogilvy 's water company , obtaining a temporary <unk> order preventing the ordinance from going at once into effect .
here was an affair in point .
were it not for lawyers of the calibre of watling , fowndes and ripon , <unk> private property would soon be confiscated by the <unk> horde .
once in a while i was made aware that mr. watling had his eye on me .
" well , <name> , " he would say , " how are you getting along ?
that 's right , stick to it , and after a while we 'll hand the drudgery over to somebody else . "
he possessed the supreme quality of a leader of men in that he took pains to inform himself concerning the work of the least of his subordinates ; and he had the gift of putting fire into a young man by a word or a touch of the hand on the shoulder .
it was not difficult for me , therefore , to comprehend <name> weed 's <unk> , the loyalty of other members of the firm or of those occupants of the office whom i have not mentioned .
my first impression of him , which i had got at <name> kyme 's , deepened as time went on , and i readily shared the belief of those around me that his legal talents easily surpassed those of any of his contemporaries .
i can recall , at this time , several noted cases in the city when i sat in court listening to his arguments with thrills of pride .
he made us all feel  no matter how humble may have been our contributions to the preparation  that we had a share in his triumphs .
we remembered his manner with judges and <unk> , and strove to <unk> it .
he spoke as if there could be no question as to his being right as to the law and the facts , and yet , in some subtle way that bated analysis , managed not to <unk> the court .
victory was in the air in that office .
i do not mean to say there were not defeats ; but frequently these defeats , by <unk> , by a <unk> spirit , by a consummate knowledge , not only of the law , but of other things at which i have hinted , were turned into ultimate victories .
we fought cases from one court to another , until our opponents were worn out or the decision was reversed .
we won , and that spirit of winning got into the blood .
what was most impressed on me in those early years , i think , was the discovery that there was always a path  if one were clever enough to find it  from one terrace to the next higher .
staying power was the most prized of all the virtues .
one could always , by adroitness , compel a legal opponent to fight the matter out all over again on new ground , or at least on ground partially new .
if the court of appeals should fail one , there was the supreme court ; there was the opportunity , also , to shift from the state to the federal courts ; and likewise the <unk> device known as a change of <unk> , when a judge was supposed to be " prejudiced . "
ix .
as my apprenticeship advanced i grew more and more to the inhabitants of our city into two kinds , the who were served , and the inefficient , who were separate efficient , neglected ; but the mental process of which the classification was the result was not so deliberate as may be supposed .
sometimes , when an important client would get into trouble , the affair took me into the police court , where i saw the <unk> of the city penned up , waiting to have justice <unk> out to them : weary women who had spent the night in cells , indifferent now as to the front they presented to the world , the finery <unk> that they had tended so carefully to catch the eyes of men on the darkened streets ; brazen young girls , who blazed forth defiance to all order ; derelict men , sodden and hopeless , with <unk> beards ; shifty looking burglars and <unk> .
all these i beheld , at first with <unk> of pity , later to mass them with the ugly and inevitable with whom society had to deal somehow .
lawyers , after all , must be practical men .
i came to know the <unk> of these police courts , as well as other judges .
and underlying my acquaintance with all of them was the knowledge  though not on the threshold of my consciousness  that they depended for their living , every man of them , those who were appointed and those who were elected , upon a political organization which derived its sustenance from the element whence came our clients .
thus by degrees the sense of belonging to a special <unk> had grown on me .
i recall an experience with that same mr. <name> .
<unk> , the wholesale grocer of whose commerce with the city hall my cousin <name> breck had so bitterly complained .
late one afternoon mr. <unk> 's carriage ran over a child on its way <unk> through one of the poorer districts .
the parents , naturally , were frantic , and the coachman was arrested .
this was late in the afternoon , and i was alone in the office when the telephone rang .
hurrying to the police station , i found mr. <unk> in a state of excitement and abject fear , for an ugly crowd had gathered outside .
" could not mr. watling or mr. fowndes come ? "
demanded the grocer .
with an inner contempt for the layman 's state of mind on such occasions i assured him of my <unk> to handle the case .
he was impressed , i think , by the sergeant 's deference , who knew what it meant to have such an office as ours interfere with the affair .
i called up the prosecuting attorney , who sent to <unk> 's saloon , close by , and procured a release for the coachman on his own <unk> , one of many signed in blank and left there by the justice for privileged cases .
the coachman was hustled out by a back door , and the crowd dispersed .
the next morning , while a score or more of <unk> sat in the anxious seats , justice <name> recognized me and gave me precedence .
and mr. <unk> , with a sigh of relief , paid his fine .
" mr. paret , is it ? "
he asked , as we stood together for a moment on the sidewalk outside the court .
" you have managed this well .
i <name> remember . "
he was sued , of course .
when he came to the office he insisted on discussing the case with mr. watling , who sent for me .
" that is a bright young man , " mr. <unk> declared , shaking my hand .
" he <name> get on . "
" some day , " said mr. watling , " he may save you a lot of money , <unk> . "
" when my friend mr. watling is united states senator ,  eh ? "
mr. watling laughed .
" before that , i <name> .
i advise you to compromise this suit , <unk> , " he added .
" how would a thousand dollars strike you ?
i 've had paret look up the case , and he tells me the little girl has had to have an operation . "
" a thousand dollars ! "
cried the grocer .
" what right have these people to let their children play on the streets ?
it 's an outrage . "
" where else have the children to play ? "
mr. watling touched his arm .
" <unk> , " he said gently , " suppose it had been your little girl ? "
the grocer pulled out his handkerchief and mopped his bald forehead .
but he rallied a little .
" you fight these damage cases for the street railroads all through the courts . "
" yes , " mr. watling agreed , " but there a principle is involved .
if the railroads once got into the way of paying damages for every careless employee , they would soon be bankrupt through blackmail .
but here you have a child whose father is a poor janitor and ca n't afford sickness .
and your coachman , i imagine , <name> be more particular in the future . "
in the end mr. <unk> made out a cheque and departed in a good humour , convinced that he was well out of the matter .
here was one of many instances i could cite of mr. watling 's tenderness of heart .
i felt , moreover , as if he had done me a personal favour , since it was i who had recommended the compromise .
for i had been to the hospital and had seen the child on the cot ,  a dark little thing , lying still in her pain , with the bewildered look of a wounded animal ... . not long after this incident of mr. <unk> 's damage suit i obtained a more or less definite promotion by the departure of <name> weed .
he had suddenly developed a weakness of the lungs .
mr. watling got him a place in <name> , and paid his expenses west .
the first six or seven years i spent in the office of wading , fowndes and ripon were of importance to my future career , but there is little to relate of them .
i was absorbed not only in learning law , but in acquiring that <unk> knowledge at which i have hinted  not to be had from my seniors and which i was convinced was indispensable to a successful and lucrative practice .
my former comparison of the organization of our city to a picture puzzle wherein the dominating figures become visible only after long study is rather inadequate .
a better analogy would be the human anatomy : we lawyers , of course , were the brains ; the financial and industrial interests the body , helpless without us ; the city hall politicians , the stomach that must continually be fed .
all three , law , politics and business , were <unk> , united by a nervous system too complex to be developed here .
in these years , though i worked hard and often late , i still found time for <unk> , for social <unk> , yet little by little without realizing the fact , i was losing zest for the companionship of my former intimates .
my mind was becoming polarized by the contemplation of one object , success , and to it human ties were unconsciously being sacrificed .
<name> peters began to feel this , even at a time when i believed myself still to be genuinely fond of him .
considering our respective temperaments in youth , it is curious that he should have been the first to fall in love and marry .
one day he astonished me by announcing his engagement to <name> blackwood .
" that ends the liquor , hughie , " he told me , <unk> .
" i promised her i 'd eliminate it . "
he did eliminate it , save for mild <unk> on festive occasions .
a more seemingly incongruous marriage could scarcely be imagined , and yet it was a success from the start .
from a slim , silent , <unk> girl <name> had grown up into a tall , rather <unk> and energetic young woman .
she was what we called in those days " intellectual , " and had gone in for <unk> , and after her marriage she turned out to be excessively domestic ; practising her theories , with entire success , upon a family that showed a tendency to increase at an alarming rate .
<name> , needless to say , did not become intellectual .
he settled down  prematurely , i thought  into what is known as a family man , curiously content with the income he derived from the commission business and with life in general ; and he developed a somewhat critical view of the tendencies of the civilization by which he was surrounded .
<name> held it also , but she said less about it .
in the comfortable but unpretentious house they rented on cedar street we had many discussions , after the babies had been put to bed and the door of the living-room closed , in order that our voices might not reach the nursery .
<name> blackwood , now <name> 's brother-in-law , was often there .
he , too , had lapsed into what i thought was an odd <unk> .
old <name> , his father , being dead , he occupied himself mainly with looking after certain family interests , among which was the boyne street car line .
among " business men " he was already getting the reputation of being a little difficult to deal with .
i was often the subject of their banter , and presently i began to suspect that they regarded my career and beliefs with some concern .
this gave me no uneasiness , though at <unk> i lost my temper .
i realized their affection for me ; but privately i regarded them as lacking in ambition , in force , in the fighting qualities necessary for achievement in this modern age .
perhaps , unconsciously , i pitied them a little .
" how is judah b. to-day , hughie ? "
<name> would inquire .
" i hear you 've put him up for the boyne club , now that mr. watling has got him out of that libel suit . "
" <name> ives is dead , " <name> would add , sarcastically , " let bygones be bygones . "
it was well known that mr. tallant , in the early days of his newspaper , had <unk> mr. ives out of some hundred thousand dollars .
and that this , more than any other act , stood in the way , with certain <unk> gentlemen , of his highest ambition , membership in the boyne .
" the trouble with you fellows is that you refuse to deal with conditions as you find them , " i retorted .
" we did n't make them , and we ca n't change them .
tallant 's a factor in the business life of this city , and he has to be counted with . "
<name> would shake his head <unk> .
" why do n't you get after <name> ? "
i demanded .
" he does n't <unk> tallant , either . "
" <name> 's hopeless , " said <name> .
" he was born a pirate , you were n't , hughie .
we think there 's a chance for his salvation , do n't we , <name> ? "
i refused to accept the remark as flattering .
another object of their assaults was <name> grierson , who by this time had emerged from obscurity as a small dealer in real estate into a <unk> of blocks and corners .
" i suppose you think it 's a lawyer 's business to demand an ethical <name> of health of every client , " i said .
" i wo n't stand up for all of tallant 's career , of course , but mr. wading has a clear right to take his cases .
as for grierson , it seems to me that 's a matter of giving a dog a bad name .
just because his people were n't known here , and because he has worked up from small beginnings .
to get down to <unk> , you fellows do n't believe in democracy ,  in giving every man a chance to show what 's in him . "
" democracy is good ! "
exclaimed <name> .
" if the kind of thing we 're coming to is democracy , god save the state ! " ...
on the other hand i found myself drawing closer to <name> hambleton , sometimes present at these debates , as the only one of my boyhood friends who seemed to be able to " deal with conditions as he found them . "
indeed , he gave one the impression that , if he had had the making of them , he would not have changed them .
" what the deuce do you expect ? "
i once heard him inquire with good-natured contempt .
" business is n't <name> , it 's war .
" there are certain things , " maintained <name> , stoutly , " that gentlemen wo n't do . "
" gentlemen ! "
exclaimed <name> , stretching his slim six feet two : we were sitting in the boyne club .
" it 's <unk> to kill , or burn a town or sink a ship , but we keep armies and navies for the purpose .
for a man with a good mind , <name> , you show a surprising inability to think things , out to a logical conclusion .
what the deuce is competition , when you come down to it ?
christianity ?
not by a long shot !
if our nations are slaughtering men and starving populations in other countries ,  are carried on , in fact , for the sake of business , if our churches are filled with business men and our sky pilots pray for the government , you ca n't expect heathen individuals like me to do business on a <name> basis ,  if there is such a thing .
you can make rules for croquet , but not for a game that is based on the natural law of the survival of the fittest .
the darned fools in the <unk> try it occasionally , but we all know it 's a <unk> to the <unk> people . '
ask hughie here if there ever was a law put on the statute books that his friend watling couldn't get 'round ' ?
why , you 've got competition even among the churches .
yours , where i believe you teach in the <name> school , would go bankrupt if it proclaimed real christianity .
and you 'll go bankrupt if you practise it , <name> , my boy .
some early , wide-awake , <unk> , <unk> bird <name> relieve you of the boyne street car line . "
it was one of this same new and " fittest " species who had already relieved poor mr. mcalery willett of his fortune .
mr. willett was a trusting soul who had never known how to take care of himself or his money , people said , and now that he had lost it they blamed him .
some had been saved enough for him and <name> to live on in the old house , with careful economy .
it was <name> who managed the economy , who accomplished remarkable things with a sum they would have deemed poverty in former days .
her mother had died while i was at cambridge .
reverses did not subdue mr. willett 's spirits , and the fascination modern " business " had for him seemed to grow in proportion to the misfortunes it had caused him .
he moved into a <name> office in the durrett building , where he appeared every morning about half-past ten to occupy himself with heaven knows what short cuts to wealth , with <unk> of companies in mexico or central <name> or some other distant place : once , i remember , it was a tea , company in which he tried to interest his friends , to raise in the south a product he maintained would surpass orange <unk> .
in the afternoon between three and four he would turn up at the boyne club , as well <unk> , as spruce as ever , generally with a flower in his buttonhole .
he never forgot that he was a gentleman , and he had a gentleman 's notions of the fitness of things , and it was against his principles to use , a gentleman 's club for the furtherance of his various enterprises .
" drop into my office some day , dickinson , " he would say .
" i think i've got something there that might interest you ! "
he reminded me , when i met him , that he had always predicted i would get along in life ... .
the portrait of <name> at this period is not so easily drawn .
the decline of the family fortunes seemed to have had as little effect upon her as upon her father , although their characters differed sharply .
something of that spontaneity , of that love of life and <name> in it she had possessed in youth she must have inherited from mcalery willett , but these qualities had disappeared in her long before the coming of financial reverses .
she was nearing thirty , and in spite of her beauty and the rarer distinction that can best be described as breeding , she had never married .
men admired her , but from a distance ; she kept them at arm 's length , they said : strangers who visited the city invariably picked her out of an assembly and asked who she was ; one man from new york who came to visit <name> and who had been madly in love with her , she had amazed many people by refusing , <unk> all he might have given her .
this incident seemed a refutation of the charge that she was calculating .
as might have been foretold , she had the social gift in a remarkable degree , and in spite of the limitations of her purse the knack of dressing better than other women , though at that time the organization of our social life still remained comparatively simple , the custom of luxurious and expensive entertainment not having yet set in .
the more i reflect upon those days , the more surprising does it seem that i was not in love with her .
it may be that i was , unconsciously , for she troubled my thoughts occasionally , and she represented all the qualities i admired in her sex .
the situation that had existed at the time of our first and only quarrel had been reversed , i was on the <unk> to the worldly success i had then resolved upon , <name> was poor , and for that reason , perhaps , prouder than ever .
if she was inaccessible to others , she had the air of being peculiarly inaccessible to me  the more so because some of the superficial relics of our intimacy remained , or rather had been restored .
her very manner of <unk> seemed paradoxically to increase the distance between us .
it piqued me .
had she given me the least encouragement , i am sure i should have responded ; and i remember that i used occasionally to speculate as to whether she still cared for me , and took this method of hiding her real feelings .
yet , on the whole , i felt a certain complacency about it all ; i knew that suffering was disagreeable , i had learned how to avoid it , and i may have had , deep within me , a feeling that i might marry her after all .
meanwhile my life was full , and gave promise of becoming even fuller , more absorbing and exciting in the immediate future .
one of the most fascinating figures , to me , of that order being woven , like a cloth of gold , out of our hitherto drab civilization ,  an order into which i was ready and eager to be initiated ,  was that of adolf scherer , the giant <name> <unk> at the head of the boyne iron works .
his life would easily lend itself to riotous romance .
in the old country , in a valley below the castle perched on the rack above , he had begun life by tending his father 's geese .
what a contrast to " <unk> " with its smells and sickening summer heat , to the shanty where mrs. scherer took boarders and bent over the <unk> !
she , too , was an <unk> , but lived to hear her native wagner from her own box at <unk> garden ; and he to explain , on the deck of an imperial yacht , to the man who might have been his sovereign certain processes in the manufacture of steel hitherto untried on that side of the atlantic .
in comparison with adolf scherer , citizen of a once despised democracy , the minor <name> in whose dominions he had once tended geese was of small account indeed !
the adolf scherer of that day  though it is not so long ago as time flies  was even more solid and impressive than the man he afterwards became , when he reached the <unk> heights from which he delivered to an eager press opinions on politics and war , <unk> and woman's suffrage and other subjects that are the despair of <unk> .
had he stuck to steel , he would have remained invulnerable .
but even then he was beginning to abandon the field of production for that of <unk> : <unk> speaking , he had taken to soap , which with the aid of water may be blown into beautiful , iridescent bubbles to charm the eye .
much good soap , apparently , has gone that way , never to be recovered .
everybody who was anybody began to blow bubbles about that time , and the bigger the bubble the greater its attraction for <unk> of <unk> savings .
outside of this love for financial <unk> , let it be called , mr. scherer seemed to care little then for glitter of any sort .
shortly after his elevation to the presidency of the boyne iron works he had been elected a member of the boyne club ,  an honour of which , some thought , he should have been more sensible ; but generally , when in town , he preferred to lunch at a little <name> restaurant annexed to a saloon , where i used often to find him literally towering above the cloth ,  for he was a giant with short legs ,  his napkin tucked into his shirt front , engaged in lively conversation with the <unk> <unk> .
the chef at the club , mr. scherer insisted , could produce nothing equal to <unk> 's <unk> and sausage .
my earliest relationship with mr. scherer was that of an errand boy , of bringing to him for his approval papers which might not be intrusted to a common messenger .
his <unk> and brevity disturbed me more than i cared to confess .
i was pretty sure that he eyed me with the disposition of the self-made to believe that college <unk> and good tailors were the heaviest <unk> with which a young man could be burdened : and i suspected him of an <unk> attitude toward the older families of the city .
certain men possessed his confidence ; and he had built , as it were , a stockade about them , sternly keeping the rest of the world outside .
in <name> watling he had a childlike <name> .
thus i studied him , with a deliberation which it is the purpose of these chapters to confess , though he little knew that he was being made the subject of analysis .
nor did i ever venture to talk with him , but held strictly to my role of errand boy ,  even after the conviction came over me that he was no longer indifferent to my presence .
the day arrived , after some years , when he suddenly thrust toward me a big , hairy hand that held the document he was examining .
" who <name> this , mr .
paret ! "
he demanded .
mr. ripon , i told him .
the boyne works were buying up <unk> , and this was a contract looking to the purchase of one in <unk> county , provided , after a certain period of working , the yield and quality should come up to specifications .
mr. scherer requested me to read one of the sections , which puzzled him .
and in explaining it an idea flashed over me .
" do you mind my making a suggestion , mr .
scherer ? "
i ventured .
" what is it ? "
he asked <unk> .
i showed him how , by the alteration of a few words , the difficulty to which he had referred could not only be eliminated , but that certain possible penalties might be evaded , while the apparent meaning of the section remained unchanged .
in other words , it gave the boyne iron works an advantage that was not contemplated .
he seized the paper , stared at what i had written in pencil on the margin , and then stared at me .
abruptly , he began to laugh .
" ask mr. wading what he thinks of it ? "
" i intended to , provided it had your approval , sir , " i replied .
" you have my approval , mr. paret , " he declared , rather <unk> , and with the slight <name> <unk> of the v 's into which he relapsed at times .
" bring it to the works this afternoon . "
mr. wading agreed to the alteration .
he looked at me <unk> .
" yes , i think that 's an improvement , <name> , " he said .
i had a feeling that i had gained ground , and from this time on i thought i detected a change in his attitude toward me ; there could be no doubt about the new attitude of mr. scherer , who would often greet me now with a smile and a joke , and sometimes went so far as to ask my opinions ... . then , about six months later , came the famous ribblevale case that aroused the moral indignation of so many persons , among whom was <name> blackwood .
" you know as well as i do , <name> , how this thing is being <unk> , " he declared at <name> 's one <name> evening ; " there was nothing the matter with the ribblevale steel company  it was as right as rain before <name> dickinson and grierson and scherer and that crowd you train with began to talk it down at the club .
oh , they 're very compassionate .
i've heard 'em .
dickinson , privately , does n't think much of ribblevale paper , and <unk> " ( the president of the ribblevale ) " seems worried and looks badly .
it 's all very clever , but i 'd hate to tell you in plain words what i 'd call it . "
" go ahead , " i challenged him <unk> .
" you have n't any proof that the ribblevale was n't in trouble . "
" i heard mr. <unk> tell my father the other day it was a d  d outrage .
he could n't catch up with these rumours , and some of his stockholders were <unk> . "
" you , do n't suppose <unk> would want to admit his situation , do you ? "
i asked .
" <unk> 's a straight man , " retorted <name> .
" that 's more than i can say for any of the other gang , saving your presence .
the unpleasant truth is that scherer and the boyne people want the ribblevale , and you ought to know it if you do n't . "
he looked at me very hard through the glasses he had lately taken to wearing .
<name> , who was lounging by the fire , shifted his position uneasily .
i smiled , and took another cigar .
" i believe <name> is right , <name> , when he calls you a <unk> .
for you there 's a tragedy behind every ordinary business transaction .
the ribblevale people are having a hard time to keep their heads above water , and immediately you smell conspiracy .
dickinson and scherer have been talking it down .
how about it , <name> ? "
but <name> , in these debates , was inclined to be <unk> , although it was clear they troubled him .
" oh , do n't ask me , hughie , " he said .
" i suppose i ought to cultivate the scientific point of view , and look with impartial interest at this industrial <unk> , " returned <name> , sarcastically .
" eat or be eaten that 's what enlightened self-interest has come to .
after all , <name> would say , it is nature , the insect world over again , the victim <unk> and crippled before he is devoured , and the lawyer  how shall i put it ?  <unk> the processes of swallowing and <unk> ... . " there was no use arguing with <name> when he was in this vein ... .
since i am not writing a technical treatise , i need not go into the details of the ribblevale suit .
since it to say that the affair , after a while , came apparently to a <unk> , owing to the impossibility of getting certain definite information from the ribblevale books , which had been taken out of the state .
the treasurer , for reasons of his own , remained out of the state also ; the ordinary course of summoning him before a magistrate in another state had naturally been resorted to , but the desired evidence was not forthcoming .
" the trouble is , " mr. wading explained to mr. scherer , " that there is no law in the various states with a sufficient penalty attached that <name> compel the witness to divulge facts he wishes to conceal . "
it was the middle of a february afternoon , and they were seated in deep , leather chairs in one corner of the reading room of the boyne club .
they had the place to themselves .
fowndes was there also , one leg twisted around the other in familiar fashion , a bored look on his long and sallow face .
mr. wading had telephoned to the office for me to bring them some papers bearing on the case .
" sit down , <name> , " he said kindly .
" now we have present a genuine legal mind , " said mr. scherer , in the playful manner he had adopted of late , while i grinned <unk> and took a chair .
mr. watling presently suggested <unk> the ribblevale treasurer until he should promise to produce the books as the only way out of what seemed an <unk> .
but mr. scherer brought down a huge fist on his knee .
" i tell you it is no joke , watling , we 've got to win that suit , " he asserted .
" that 's all very well , " replied mr. watling .
" but we 're a respectable firm , you know .
we have n't had to resort to <unk> , as yet . "
mr. scherer shrugged his shoulders , as much as to say it were a matter of indifference to him what methods were resorted to .
mr. watling 's eyes met mine ; his glance was amused , yet i thought i read in it a query as to the <unk> , in my presence , of going too deeply into the question of ways and means .
i may have been wrong .
at any rate , its sudden effect was to <unk> me to give voice to an idea that had begun to <unk> in my mind , that excited me , and yet i had feared to utter it .
this look of my chief 's , and the lighter tone the conversation had taken decided me .
" why would n't it be possible to draw up a <name> to fit the situation ? "
i inquired .
mr. wading started .
" what do you mean ? "
he asked quickly .
all three looked at me .
i felt the blood come into my face , but it was too late to draw back .
" well  the legislature is in session .
and since , as mr. watling says , there is no sufficient penalty in other states to compel the witness to produce the information desired , why not draw up a <name> and  and have it passed  " i paused for breath  " imposing a sufficient penalty on home corporations in the event of such <unk> .
the ribblevale steel company is a home corporation . "
i had shot my bolt ... .
there followed what was for me an anxious silence , while the three of them continued to stare at me .
mr. watling put the tips of his fingers together , and i became aware that he was not offended , that he was thinking rapidly .
" by <name> , why not , fowndes ? "
he demanded .
" well , " said fowndes , " there 's an element of risk in such a proceeding i need not dwell upon . "
" risk ! "
cried the senior partner vigorously .
" there 's risk in everything .
they 'll howl , of course .
but they howl anyway , and nobody ever listens to them .
they 'll say it 's special legislation , and the pilot <name> print sensational <unk> for a few days .
but what of it ?
all of that has happened before .
i tell you , if we ca n't see those books , we 'll lose the suit .
that 's in black and white .
and , as a matter of justice , we 're entitled to know what we want to know . "
" there might be two opinions as to that , " observed fowndes , with his <unk> smile .
mr. watling paid no attention to this remark .
he was already deep in thought .
it was characteristic of his mind to leap forward , seize a suggestion that often appeared <unk> to a man like fowndes and turn it into an accomplished fact .
" i believe you 've hit it , <name> , " he said .
" we need n't bother about the powers of the courts in other states .
we'll put into this <name> an appeal to our court for an order on the clerk to compel the witness to come before the court and testify , and we'll provide for a special commissioner to take <unk> in the state where the witness is .
if the officers of a home corporation who are outside of the state refuse to testify , the penalty <name> be that the ration goes into the hands of a receiver . "
fowndes whistled .
" that 's going some ! "
he said .
" well , we 've got to go some .
how about it , scherer ? "
even mr. scherer 's brown eyes were snapping .
" we have got to win that suit , watling . "
we were all excited , even fowndes , i think , though he remained expressionless .
ours was the tense excitement of primitive man in <name> : the quarry which had threatened to elude us was again in view , and not unlikely to fall into our hands .
add to this feeling , on my part , the thrill that it was i who had put them on the scent .
i had all the sensations of an aspiring young brave who for the first time is admitted to the councils of the tribe !
" it ought to be a popular <name> , too , " mr. <unk> was saying , with a smile of <unk> appreciation at the thought of <unk> <unk> it .
" we should have one of <unk> 's friends introduce it . "
" oh , we shall have it properly introduced , " replied mr. wading .
" it may come back at us , " suggested fowndes <unk> .
" the boyne iron works is a home corporation too , if i am not mistaken . "
" the boyne iron works has the firm of wading , fowndes and ripon behind it , " asserted mr. scherer , with what struck me as a magnificent <name> .
" you must n't forget paret , " mr. watling reminded him , with a wink at me .
we had risen .
mr. scherer laid a hand on my arm .
" no , no , i do not forget him .
he <name> not permit me to forget him . "
a remark , i thought , that betrayed some insight into my character ... mr. watling called for pen and paper and made then and there a draft of the proposed <name> , for no time was to be lost .
it was dark when we left the club , and i recall the elation i felt and strove to conceal as i accompanied my chief back to the office .
the <unk> and clerks were gone ; alone in the library we got down the statutes and set to work to perfect the <name> from the rough draft , on which mr. fowndes had written his suggestions .
i felt that a complete yet subtle change had come over my relationship with mr. watling .
in the midst of our labours he asked me to call up the attorney for the railroad .
mr. gorse was still at his office .
" hello !
is that you , miller ? "
mr. watling said .
" this is wading .
when can i see you for a few minutes this evening ?
yes , i am leaving for washington at nine thirty .
eight o'clock .
all right , i 'll be there . "
it was almost eight before he got the draft finished to his satisfaction , and i had picked it out on the typewriter .
as i handed it to him , my chief held it a moment , gazing at me with an odd smile .
" you seem to have acquired a good deal of useful knowledge , here and there , <name> , " he observed .
" i 've tried to keep my eyes open , mr. watling , " i said .
" well , " he said , " there are a great many things a young man practising law in these days has to learn for himself .
and if i had n't given you credit for some cleverness , i should n't have wanted you here .
there's only one way to look at  at these matters we have been discussing , my boy , that 's the common-sense way , and if a man does n't get that point of view by himself , nobody can teach it to him .
i need n't enlarge upon it . "
" no , sir , " i said .
he smiled again , but immediately became serious .
" if mr. gorse should approve of this <name> , i 'm going to send you down to the capital  to-night .
can you go ? "
i nodded .
" i want you to look out for the <name> in the legislature .
of course there wo n't be much to do , except to stand by , but you <name> get a better idea of what goes on down there . "
i thanked him , and told him i would do my best .
" i 'm sure of that , " he replied .
" now it 's time to go to see gorse . "
the legal department of the railroad occupied an entire floor of the corn bank building .
i had often been there on various errands , having on occasions delivered sealed envelopes to mr. gorse himself , approaching him in the ordinary way through a series of offices .
but now , following mr. watling through the dimly lighted corridor , we came to a door on which no name was painted , and which was presently opened by a stenographer .
there was in the proceeding a touch of mystery that revived keenly my boyish love for romance ; brought back the days when i had been , in turn , captain kidd and <name> baba .
i have never realized more strongly than in that moment the psychological force of prestige .
little by little , for five years , an estimate of the extent of miller gorse 's power had been coming home to me , and his features stood in my mind for his particular kind of power .
he was a tremendous worker , and often remained in his office until ten and eleven at night .
he dismissed the stenographer by the wave of a hand which seemed to thrust her bodily out of the room .
" hello , miller , " said mr. watling .
" hello , <name> , " replied mr. gorse .
" this is paret , of my office . "
" i know , " said mr. gorse , and nodded toward me .
i was impressed by the felicity with which a <unk> of the pilot had once <unk> him by the use of curved lines .
the circle of the heavy eyebrows ended at the wide nostrils ; the mouth was a crescent , but bowed downwards ; the heavy shoulders were rounded .
indeed , the only straight line to be discerned about him was that of his hair , black as <unk> , banged across his forehead ; even his polished porphyry eyes were constructed on some curvilinear principle , and never seemed to focus .
it might be said of mr. gorse that he had an overwhelming <unk> .
one could never be quite sure that one 's words reached the <name> .
in spite of the intimacy which i knew existed between them , in my presence at least mr. gorse 's manner was little different with mr. watling than it was with other men .
mr. wading did not seem to mind .
he pulled up a chair close to the desk and began , without any preliminaries , to explain his errand .
" it 's about the ribblevale affair , " he said .
" you know we have a suit . "
gorse nodded .
" we 've got to get at the books , miller ,  that 's all there is to it .
i told you so the other day .
well , we 've found out a way , i think . "
he thrust his hand in his pocket , while the railroad attorney remained impassive , and <name> out the draft of the <name> .
mr. gorse read it , then read it over again , and laid it down in front of him .
" well , " he said .
" i want to put that through both houses and have the governor's signature to it by the end of the week . "
" it seems a little raw , at first sight , <name> , " said mr. gorse , with the suspicion of a smile .
my chief laughed a little .
" it 's not half so raw as some things i might mention , that went through like greased lightning , " he replied .
" what can they do ?
i believe it <name> hold water .
tallant 's , and most of the other newspapers in the state , wo n't print a line about it , and only socialists and <unk> read the pilot .
they 're <unk> anyway .
the point is , there 's no other way out for us .
just think a moment , bearing in mind what i've told you about the case , and you 'll see it . "
mr. gorse took up the paper again , and read the draft over .
" you know as well as i do , miller , how dangerous it is to leave this ribblevale business at loose ends .
the carlisle steel people and the lake shore road are after the ribblevale company , and we ca n't afford to run any risk of their getting it .
it 's logically a part of the boyne interests , as scherer says , and dickinson is ready with the money for the <unk> .
if the carlisle people and the lake shore get it , the product <name> be shipped out by the l and g , and the railroad <name> lose .
what would <unk> say ? "
mr. <unk> , as i have perhaps mentioned , was the president of the railroad , and had his residence in the other great city of the state .
he was then , i knew , in the west .
" we 've got to act now , " insisted mr. watling .
" that 's open and shut .
if you have any other plan , i wish you 'd trot it out .
if not , i want a letter to <name> varney and the governor .
i 'm going to send paret down with them on the night train . "
it was clear to me then , in the discussion following , that mr. <unk> gift of persuasion , though great , was not the determining factor in mr. gorse 's decision .
he , too , possessed boldness , though he preferred caution .
nor did the friendship between the two enter into the transaction .
i was impressed more strongly than ever with the fact that a lawsuit was seldom a mere private affair between two persons or corporations , but involved a chain of relationships and nine times out of ten that chain led up to the railroad , which nearly always was <unk> interested in these legal contests .
half an hour of masterly presentation of the situation was necessary before mr. gorse became convinced that the introduction of the <name> was the only way out for all concerned .
" well , i guess you 're right , <name> , " he said at length .
whereupon he seized his pen and wrote off two notes with great rapidity .
these he showed to mr. watling , who nodded and returned them .
they were folded and sealed , and handed to me .
one was addressed to colonel <name> varney , and the other to the hon .
w. w. <unk> , governor of the state .
" you can trust this young man ? "
demanded mr. gorse .
" i think so , " replied mr. watling , smiling at me .
" the <name> was his own idea . "
the railroad attorney wheeled about in his chair and looked at me ; looked around me , would better express it , with his indefinite , <unk> yet inclusive glance .
i had riveted his attention .
and from henceforth , i knew , i should enter into his calculations .
he had made for me a compartment in his mind .
" his own idea ! "
he repeated .
" i merely suggested it , " i was putting in , when he cut me short .
" are n't you the son of <name> paret ? "
" yes , " i said .
he gave me a queer glance , the significance of which i left <unk> .
my excitement was too great to analyze what he meant by this mention of my father ... .
when we reached the sidewalk my chief gave me a few parting instructions .
" i need scarcely say , <name> , " he added , " that your presence in the capital should not be advertised as connected with this  legislation .
they <name> probably attribute it to us in the end , but if you're reasonably careful , they 'll never be able to prove it .
and there 's no use in putting our cards on the table at the beginning . "
" no indeed , sir ! "
i agreed .
he took my hand and pressed it .
" good luck , " he said .
" i know you 'll get along all right . "
book 2 .
x .
this was not my first visit to the state capital .
indeed , some of that recondite knowledge , in which i took a pride , had been gained on the occasions of my previous visits .
rising and dressing early , i beheld out of the car window the broad , shallow river glinting in the morning sunlight , the dome of the state house against the blue of the sky .
even at that early hour groups of the gentlemen who made our laws were scattered about the lobby of the potts house , standing or seated within easy reach of the gaily coloured <unk> that protected the marble floor : <unk> workers from the cities mingled with <unk> but astute countrymen who <unk> votes amongst farms and villages ; fat or <unk> , <name> , <name> or american , all bore in common a certain indefinable stamp .
having eaten my breakfast in a large dining-room that resounded with the clatter of dishes , i directed my steps to the apartment occupied from year to year by colonel <name> <name> , <unk> of the railroad on the legislative battlefield ,  a position that demanded a certain <unk> of genius .
" how do you do , sir , " he said , in a guarded but courteous tone as he opened the door .
i entered to confront a group of three or four figures , silent and rather hostile , seated in a haze of tobacco smoke around a marble-topped table .
on it reposed a bible , attached to a chain .
" you probably do n't remember me , colonel , " i said .
" my name is <unk> , and i 'm associated with the firm of watling , fowndes , and ripon . "
his air of <unk> ,  heightened by a grey moustache and goatee a la <name> third ,  vanished instantly ; he became hospitable , <unk> .
" why  why certainly , you were down heah with mr. fowndes two years ago . "
the colonel spoke with a slight southern accent .
" to be sure , sir .
i've had the honour of meeting your father .
mr. <name> , of north haven , meet mr. paret  one of our rising lawyers ... " i shook hands with them all and sat down .
opening his long coat , colonel varney revealed two rows of cigars , suggesting cartridges in a belt .
these he proceeded to hand out as he talked .
" i 'm glad to see you here , mr. paret .
you must stay awhile , and become acquainted with the men who  ahem  are shaping the destinies of a great state .
it would give me pleasure to escort you about . "
i thanked him .
i had learned enough to realize how important are the <unk> in politics and business .
the colonel did most of the conversing ; he could not have filled with efficiency and ease the important post that was his had it not been for the endless fund of humorous anecdotes at his disposal .
one by one the visitors left , each assuring me of his personal regard : the colonel closed the door , softly , turning the key in the lock ; there was a sly look in his black eyes as he took a chair in proximity to mine .
" well , mr. paret , " he asked softly , " what 's up ? "
without further ado i handed him mr. gorse 's letter , and another mr. watling had given me for him , which contained a copy of the <name> .
he read these , laid them on the table , glancing at me again , stroking his goatee the while .
he chuckled .
" by gum ! "
he exclaimed .
" i take off my hat to <name> watling , always did . "
he became contemplative .
" it can be done , mr. paret , but it's going to take some careful driving , sir , some reaching out and flicking 'em when they <unk> and <name> .
<name> varney 's never been stumped yet .
just as soon as this is introduced we 'll have gates and <unk> down here  they 're the ribblevale <unk> , are n't they ?
i thought so ,  and the best legal talent they can hire .
and they 'll round up all the <unk> fellows , you know ,  that ai n't friendly to the railroad .
we 've got to do it quick , mr. paret .
gorse gave you a letter to the governor , did n't he ? "
" yes , " i said .
" well , come along .
i 'll pass the word around among the boys , just to let 'em know what to expect . "
his eyes glittered again .
" i 've been following this ribblevale business , " he added , " and i understand <name> dickinson 's all ready to <unk> that company , when the time comes .
he ought to let me in for a little , on the ground floor . "
i did not venture to make any promises for mr. dickinson .
" i reckon it 's just as well if you were to meet me at the governor's office , " the colonel added reflectively , and the hint was not lost on me .
" it 's better not to let 'em find out any sooner than they have to where this thing comes from ,  you understand . "
he looked at his watch .
" how would nine o'clock do ?
i 'll be there , with <unk> , when you come ,  by accident , you understand .
of course he 'll be reasonable , but when they get to be governors they have little notions , you know , and you 've got to indulge 'em , flatter 'em a little .
it does n't hurt , for when they get their backs up it only makes more trouble . "
he put on a soft , black felt hat , and departed noiselessly ... at nine o'clock i arrived at the state house and was ushered into a great square room overlooking the park .
the governor was seated at a desk under an elaborate chandelier , and sure enough , colonel varney was there beside him ; making barely perceptible signals .
" it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance , mr. paret , " said mr. <unk> .
" your name is a familiar one in your city , sir .
and i gather from your card that you are associated with my good friend , <name> watling . "
i acknowledged it .
i was not a little impressed by the perfect blend of cordiality , democratic simplicity and impressiveness mr. <unk> had achieved .
for he had managed , in the course of a long political career , to combine in exact proportions these elements which , in the public mind , should up the personality of a chief executive .
momentarily he overcame the feeling of superiority with which i had entered his presence ; neutralized the sense i had of being associated now with the higher powers which had put him where he was .
for i knew all about his " record . "
" you 're acquainted with colonel varney ? "
he inquired .
" yes , governor , i 've met the colonel , " i said .
" well , i suppose your firm is getting its share of business these days , " mr. <unk> observed .
i acknowledged it was , and after discussing for a few moments the remarkable growth of my native city the governor tapped on his desk and inquired what he could do for me .
i produced the letter from the attorney for the railroad .
the governor read it gravely .
" ah , " he said , " from mr .
gorse . "
a copy of the proposed <name> was enclosed , and the governor read that also , hemmed and <unk> a little , turned and handed it to colonel varney , who was sitting with a detached air , smoking <unk> , a vacant expression on his face .
" what do you think of this , colonel ? "
whereupon the colonel tore himself away from his reflections .
" what 's that , governor ? "
" mr. gorse has called my attention to what seems to him a flaw in our statutes , an inability to obtain testimony from corporations whose books are elsewhere , and who may thus evade , he says , to a certain extent , the sovereign <name> of our state . "
the colonel took the paper with an admirable air of surprise , adjusted his glasses , and became absorbed in reading , clearing his throat once or twice and emitting an exclamation .
" well , if you ask me , governor , " he said , at length , " all i can say is that i am astonished somebody did n't think of this simple remedy before now .
many times , sir , have i seen justice defeated because we had no such legislation as this . "
he handed it back .
the governor studied it once more , and coughed .
" does the penalty , " he inquired , " seem to you a little severe ? "
" no , sir , " replied the colonel , emphatically .
" perhaps it is because i am anxious , as a citizen , to see an evil abated .
i have had an intimate knowledge of legislation , sir , for more than twenty years in this state , and in all that time i do not remember to have seen a <name> more <unk> drawn , or better calculated to accomplish the ends of justice .
indeed , i often wondered why this very penalty was not imposed .
foreign magistrates are notoriously indifferent as to affairs in another state than their own .
rather than go into the hands of a receiver i venture to say that hereafter , if this <name> is made a law , the necessary testimony <name> be forthcoming . "
the governor read the <name> through again .
" if it is introduced , colonel , " he said , " the legislature and the people of the state ought to have it made clear to them that its aim is to remedy an injustice .
a misunderstanding on this point would be unfortunate . "
" most unfortunate , governor . "
" and of course , " added the governor , now addressing me , " it would be improper for me to indicate what course i shall pursue in regard to it if it should come to me for my signature .
yet i may go so far as to say that the defect it seeks to remedy seems to me a real one .
come in and see me , mr. paret , when you are in town , and give my cordial regards to mr .
watling . "
so gravely had the farce been carried on that i almost laughed , despite the fact that the matter in question was a serious one for me .
the governor held out his hand , and i accepted my dismissal .
i had not gone fifty steps in the corridor before i heard the colonel's voice in my ear .
" we had to give him a little rope to go through with his act , " he whispered confidentially .
" but he 'll sign it all right .
and now , if you 'll excuse me , mr. paret , i 'll lay a few mines .
see you at the hotel , sir . "
thus he indicated , delicately , that it would be better for me to keep out of sight .
on my way to the potts house the bizarre elements in the situation struck me again with considerable force .
it seemed so ridiculous , so <unk> to have to go through with this political farce in order that a natural economic evolution might be achieved .
without doubt the development of certain industries had reached a stage where the units in competition had become too small , when a greater concentration of capital was necessary .
curiously enough , in this mental argument of justification , i left out all consideration of the size of the probable profits to mr. scherer and his friends .
profits and brains went together .
and , since the almighty did not limit the latter , why should man attempt to limit the former ?
we were playing for high but justifiable stakes ; and i resented the comedy which an hypocritical <unk> on the forms of democracy compelled us to go through .
it seemed unworthy of men who controlled the destinies of state and nation .
the point of view , however , was consoling .
as the day wore on i sat in the colonel 's room , admiring the skill with which he conducted the campaign : a green country lawyer had been got to introduce the <name> , it had been <unk> to the committee on the judiciary , which would have an executive session immediately after dinner .
i had ventured to inquire about the <unk> .
" there wo n't be any <unk> , sir , " the colonel assured me .
" we own that committee from top to bottom . "
indeed , by four o'clock in the afternoon the message came that the committee had agreed to recommend the <name> .
shortly after that the first flurry occurred .
there came a knock at the door , followed by the entrance of a <unk> <name> american of about forty years of age , whose black hair was plastered over his forehead .
his <unk> eyes had a <name> look .
" hello , <name> , " said the colonel .
" i was just wondering where you were . "
" sure , you must have been ! "
replied the gentleman sarcastically .
but the colonel 's <unk> was unruffled .
" mr. maker , " he said , " you ought to know mr. paret .
mr. maker is the representative from <name> five of your city , and we can always count on him to do the right thing , even if he is a democrat .
how about it , <name> ? "
mr. maker <unk> the stump of his cigar .
" take a fresh one , <name> , " said the colonel , opening a bureau drawer .
mr. maker took two .
" say , colonel , " he demanded , " what 's this <name> that went into the judiciary this morning ? "
" what <name> ? "
asked the colonel , blandly .
" so you think i ai n't on ? "
mr. maker inquired .
the colonel laughed .
" where have you been , <name> ? "
" i 've been up to the city , seem ' my wife  that 's where i 've been . "
the colonel smiled , as at a harmless fiction .
" well , if you were n't here , i do n't see what right you 've got to complain .
i never leave my good democratic friends on the outside , do i ? "
" that 's all right , " replied mr. maker , doggedly , " i 'm on , i 'm here now , and that <name> in the judiciary does n't pass without me .
i guess i can stop it , too .
how about a thousand apiece for five of us boys ? "
" you 're pretty good at a joke , <name> , " remarked the colonel , stroking his goatee .
" maybe you 're looking for a little publicity in this here game , " retorted mr. maker , darkly .
" say , colonel , ai n't we always treated the railroad on the level ? "
" <name> , " asked the colonel , gently , " did n't i always take care of you ? "
he had laid his hand on the shoulder of mr. maker , who appeared slightly <unk> , and glanced at a massive silver watch .
" well , i 'll be dropping in about eight o'clock , " was his significant reply , as he took his leave .
" i guess we 'll have to grease the wheels a little , " the colonel remarked to me , and gazed at the ceiling ... .
the telegram apropos of the <name> five leader was by no means the only cipher message i sent back during my stay .
i had not needed to be told that the matter in hand would cost money , but mr. watling 's parting instruction to me had been to take the colonel 's advice as to specific sums , and obtain confirmation from fowndes .
nor was it any surprise to me to find democrats on intimate terms with such a stout republican as the colonel .
some statesman is said to have declared that he knew neither <unk> nor <unk> , <unk> nor <unk> , but only americans ; so colonel varney recognized neither democrats nor republicans ; in our legislature party divisions were sunk in a greater loyalty to the railroad .
at the colonel 's suggestion i had laid in a liberal supply of cigars and whiskey .
the scene in his room that evening suggested a session of a <unk> grand lodge of some secret order , such were the mysterious <unk> and goings , knocks and <unk> .
one after another the " important " men duly appeared and were introduced , the colonel supplying the light touch .
" why , cuss me if it is n't <name> !
mr. paret , i want you to shake hands with mr. <name> , the floor leader of the <unk> , ' sir .
mr. <name> has had the habit of coming up here for a friendly chat ever since he first came down to the legislature .
how long is it , <name> ? "
" i guess it 's nigh on to fifteen years , colonel . "
" fifteen years ! "
echoed the colonel , " and he 's so good a democrat it has n't changed his politics a particle . "
mr. <name> grinned in appreciation of this thrust , helped himself liberally from the bottle on the mantel , and took a seat on the bed .
we had a " friendly chat . "
thus i made the acquaintance also of the hon .
<name> <unk> , speaker of the house , who <unk> in the most flattering way on learning my identity .
" mr. paret 's here on that little matter , representing watling , fowndes and ripon , " the colonel explained .
and it appeared that mr. <unk> knew all about the " little matter , " and that the mention of the firm of watling , fowndes and ripon had a magical effect in these parts .
the president of the senate , the hon .
<unk> <unk> , went so far as to say that he hoped before long to see mr. watling in washington .
by no means the least among our callers was the hon .
fitch <unk> , editor of the st. <name> 's messenger , whose <unk> were of the <unk> effectiveness that is taken widely for wisdom , and were <unk> copied every week by other state papers and labeled " mr. <unk> 's common sense . "
at countless <unk> in our state he was known as the spokesman of the plain man , who was <unk> ignorant of the fact that mr. <unk> was owned body and carcass by mr. <name> ridden , the principal manufacturer of st. <name> 's and a director in several <unk> lines of the railroad .
in the legislature , the hon .
fitch 's function was that of the moderate counsellor and <unk> for new members , hence nothing could have been more fitting than the choice of that gentleman for the honour of moving , on the morrow , that <name> no .
709 ought to pass .
mr. <unk> reluctantly consented to accept a small " <name> " that would help to pay the mortgage on his new press ... .
when the last of the gathering had departed , about one o'clock in the morning , i had added considerably to my experience , gained a pretty accurate idea of who was who in the legislature and politics of the state , and established relationships  as the colonel reminded me  likely to prove valuable in the future .
it seemed only gracious to congratulate him on his management of the affair ,  so far .
he appeared pleased , and squeezed my hand .
" well , sir , it did require a little delicacy of touch .
and if i do say it myself , it has n't been <unk> , " he admitted .
" there ai n't an outsider , as far as i can learn , who has caught on to the nigger in the <unk> .
that 's the great thing , to keep 'em ignorant as long as possible .
you understand .
they yell bloody murder when they do find out , but generally it 's too late , if a <name> 's been handled right . "
i found myself speculating as to who the " outsiders " might be .
no ribblevale <unk> were on the spot as yet ,  of that i was satisfied .
in the absence of these , who were the opposition ?
it seemed to me as though i had interviewed that day every man in the legislature .
i was very tired .
but when i got into bed , it was impossible to sleep .
my eyes <unk> from the tobacco smoke ; and the events of the day , in disorderly manner , kept running through my head .
the tide of my exhilaration had ebbed , and i found myself struggling against a revulsion caused , apparently , by the contemplation of colonel varney and his associates ; the instruments , in brief , by which our triumph over our opponents was to be effected .
and that same idea which , when launched amidst the surroundings of the boyne club , had seemed so brilliant , now took on an aspect of <unk> .
another thought intruded itself ,  that of mr. <unk> , the president of the ribblevale company .
my father had known him , and some years before i had traveled halfway across the state in his company ; his kindliness had impressed me .
he had spent a large part of his business life , i knew , in building up the ribblevale , and now it was to be <unk> from him ; he was to be set aside , perhaps forced to start all over again when old age was coming on !
in vain i accused myself of sentimentality , and summoned all my arguments to prove that in commerce efficiency must be the only test .
the image of mr. <unk> would not down .
i got up and turned on the light , and took refuge in a novel i had in my bag .
presently i grew calmer .
i had chosen .
i had succeeded .
and now that i had my finger at last on the nerve of power , it was no time to weaken .
it was half-past six when i awoke and went to the window , relieved to find that the sun had scattered my morbid fancies with the darkness ; and i speculated , as i dressed , whether the thing called conscience were not , after all , a matter of nerves .
i went downstairs through the <unk> atmosphere of the lobby into the fresh air and <unk> sunlight of the mild february morning , and leaving the business district i reached the residence portion of the little town .
the front steps of some of the comfortable houses were being swept by industrious servant girls , and out of the chimneys twisted , fantastically , <name> blue smoke ; the bare branches of the trees were silver-grey against the sky ; gaining at last an old-fashioned , wooden bridge , i stood for awhile gazing at the river , over the shallows of which the <unk> hand of nature had flung a shower of diamonds .
and i reflected that the world was for the strong , for him who dared reach out his hand and take what it offered .
it was not money we coveted , we americans , but power , the <unk> conferred by power .
a single experience such as i had had the night before would since to convince any sane man that democracy was a failure , that the <unk> principle of aristocracy would assert itself , that the attempt of our ancestors to curtail political power had merely resulted in the growth of another and greater economic power that bade fair to be limitless .
as i walked slowly back into town i felt a reluctance to return to the noisy hotel , and finding myself in front of a little restaurant on a side street , i entered it .
there was but one other customer in the place , and he was seated on the far side of the counter , with a newspaper in front of him ; and while i was ordering my breakfast i was vaguely aware that the newspaper had dropped , and that he was looking at me .
in the slight interval that elapsed before my <name> could register his identity i experienced a distinct shock of resentment ; a sense of the <unk> of an antagonistic value at a moment when it was most unwelcome ... .
the man had risen and was coming around the counter .
he was hermann krebs .
" paret ! "
i heard him say .
" you here ? "
i exclaimed .
he did not seem to notice the lack of cordiality in my tone .
he appeared so genuinely glad to see me again that i instantly became rather ashamed of my ill nature .
" yes , i 'm here  in the legislature , " he informed me .
" a solon ! "
" exactly . "
he smiled .
" and you ? "
he inquired .
" oh , i 'm only a spectator .
down here for a day or two . "
he was still lanky , his clothes gave no evidence of an increased prosperity , but his complexion was good , his skin had cleared .
i was more than ever baked by a resolute good humour , a simplicity that was not innocence , a whimsical touch seemingly indicative of a state of mind that refused to take too seriously certain things on which i set store .
what right had he to be contented with life ?
" well , i too am only a spectator here , " he laughed .
" i 'm neither fish , flesh nor fowl , nor good red herring . "
" you were going into the law , were n't you ? "
i asked .
" i remember you said something about it that day we met at <name> farms . "
" yes , i managed it , after all .
then i went back home to elkington to try to make a living . "
" but somehow i have never thought of you as being likely to develop political aspirations , krebs , " i said .
" i should say not !
he exclaimed .
" yet here you are , launched upon a political career !
how did it happen ? "
" oh , i 'm not worrying about the career , " he assured me .
" i got here by accident , and i 'm afraid it wo n't happen again in a hurry .
you see , the hands in those big mills we have in elkington sprang a surprise on the machine , and the first thing i knew i was nominated for the legislature .
a committee came to my boarding-house and told me , and there was the deuce to pay , right off .
the railroad politicians turned in and worked for the democratic candidate , of course , and the <unk> , who own the mills , tried through emissaries to intimidate their operatives . "
" and then ? "
i asked .
" well ,  i 'm here , " he said .
" would n't you be accomplishing more , " i inquired , " if you hadn't <unk> the <unk> ? "
" it depends upon what you mean by accomplishment , " he answered , so mildly that i felt more <unk> than ever .
" well , from what you say , i suppose you 're going in for reform , that these workmen up at elkington are not satisfied with their conditions and imagine you can help to better them .
now , provided the conditions are not as good as they might be , how are you going to improve them if you find yourself isolated here , as you say ? "
" in other words , i should <unk> with colonel varney and other disinterested <unk> , " he supplied , and i realized that i was losing my temper .
" well , what can you do ? "
i inquired defiantly .
" i can find out what 's going on , " he said .
" i have already learned something , by the way . "
" and then ? "
i asked , wondering whether the implication were personal .
" then i can help  <unk> the knowledge .
i may be wrong , but i have an idea that when the people of this country learn how their <unk> are conducted they <name> want to change things . "
" that 's right ! "
echoed the waiter , who had come up with my <unk> .
" and you 're the man to tell 'em , mr .
krebs . "
" it <name> need several thousand of us to do that , i 'm afraid , " said krebs , returning his smile .
my distaste for the situation became more acute , but i felt that i was thrown on the defensive .
i could not retreat , now .
" i think you are wrong , " i declared , when the waiter had departed to attend to another customer .
" the people the great majority of them , at least are indifferent , they do n't want to be bothered with politics .
there <name> always be labour agitation , of course ,  the more wages those fellows get , the more they want .
we pay the highest wages in the world to-day , and the standard of living is higher in this country than anywhere else .
they 'd ruin our prosperity , if we 'd let 'em . "
" how about the thousands of families who do n't earn enough to live decently even in times of prosperity ? "
inquired krebs .
" it 's hard , i 'll admit , but the inefficient and the shiftless are bound to suffer , no matter what form of government you adopt . "
" you talk about standards of living ,  i could show you some examples of standards to make your heart sick , " he said .
" what you do n't realize , perhaps , is that low standards help to increase the inefficient of whom you complain . "
he smiled rather sadly .
" the prosperity you are <unk> , " he added , after a moment , " is a mere fiction , it is <unk> the few at the expense of the many .
and what is being done in this country is to store up an explosive gas that some day <name> blow your <unk> to atoms if you do n't wake up in time . "
" is n't that a rather <unk> view , too ? "
i suggested .
" i 've no doubt it may appear so , but take the proceedings in this legislature .
i 've no doubt you know something about them , and that you would maintain they are justified on account of the indifference of the public , and of other reasons , but i can cite an instance that is simply <unk> <unk> . "
for the first time a note of indignation crept into krebs 's voice .
" last night i discovered by a mere accident , in talking to a man who came in on a late train , that a <name> introduced yesterday , which is being rushed through the judiciary committee of the house  an apparently innocent little <name>  <name> enable , if it becomes a law , the boyne iron works , of your city , to take possession of the ribblevale steel company , lock , stock , and barrel .
and i am told it was conceived by a lawyer who claims to be a respectable member of his profession , and who has extraordinary ability , <name> watling . "
krebs put his hand in his pocket and <name> out a paper .
" here 's a copy of it ,  house <name> 709 . "
his expression suddenly changed .
" perhaps mr. watling is a friend of yours . "
" i 'm with his firm , " i replied ... . krebs 's fingers closed over the paper , <unk> it .
" oh , then , you know about this , " he said .
he was putting the paper back into his pocket when i took it from him .
but my adroitness , so carefully schooled , seemed momentarily to have deserted me .
what should i say ?
it was necessary to decide quickly .
" do n't you take rather a  prejudiced view of this , krebs ? "
i said .
" upon my word , i ca n't see why you should accept a rumour running around the <unk> that mr. watling drafted this <name> for a particular purpose . "
he was silent .
but his eyes did not leave my face .
" why should any sensible man , a member of the legislature , take stock in that kind of gossip ? "
i insisted .
" why not judge this <name> by its face , without heeding a cock and bull story as to how it may have originated ?
it is a good <name> , or a bad <name> ?
let 's see what it says . "
i read it .
" so far as i can see , it is legislation which we ought to have had long ago , and tends to compel a publicity in corporation affairs that is much needed , to put a stop to practices which every decent citizen <unk> . "
he <name> the paper out of my hand .
" you need n't go on , paret , " he told me .
" it 's no use . "
" well , i 'm sorry we do n't agree , " i said , and got up .
i left him twisting the paper in his fingers .
beside the clerk 's desk in the potts house , relating one of his anecdotes , i spied colonel varney , and managed presently to draw him upstairs to his room .
" what 's the matter ? "
he asked .
" do you know a man named krebs in the house ? "
i said .
" from elkington ?
why , that 's the man the <unk> let slip through ,  the <unk> , who own the mills over there .
the agitators put up a job on them . "
the colonel was no longer the genial and social <unk> of anecdotes .
he had become tense , alert , suspicious .
" what's he up to ? "
" he 's found out about this <name> , " i replied .
" how ? "
" i do n't know .
but someone told him that it originated in our office , and that we were going to use it in our suit against the ribblevale . "
i related the circumstances of my running across krebs , speaking of having known him at harvard .
colonel varney uttered an oath , and strode across to the window , where he stood looking down into the street from between the lace curtains .
" we 'll have to attend to him , right off , " he said .
i was surprised to find myself resenting the <unk> , and deeply .
" i 'm afraid he 's one of those who ca n't be <unk> to , ' " i answered .
" you mean that he 's in the employ of the ribblevale people ? "
the colonel inquired .
" i do n't mean anything of the kind , " i retorted , with more heat , perhaps , than i realized .
the colonel looked at me queerly .
" that 's all right , mr. paret .
of course i do n't want to question your judgment , sir .
and you say he 's a friend of yours . "
" i said i knew him at college . "
" but you <name> pardon me , " the colonel went on , " when i tell you that i 've had some experience with that breed , and i have yet to see one of 'em you could n't come to terms with in some way  in some way , " he added , significantly .
i did not pause to reflect that the colonel 's attitude , from his point of view ( yes , and from mine ,  had i not adopted it ? )
was the logical one .
in that philosophy every man had his price , or his weakness .
yet , such is the inconsistency of human nature , i was now unable to contemplate this attitude with calmness .
" mr. krebs is a lawyer .
has he accepted a pass from the railroad ? "
i demanded , knowing the custom of that corporation of conferring this delicate favour on the promising young talent in my profession .
" i reckon he 's never had the chance , " said mr. varney .
" well , has he taken a pass as a member of the legislature ? "
" no ,  i remember looking that up when he first came down .
sent that back , if i recall the matter correctly . "
colonel varney went to a desk in the corner of the room , unlocked it , <name> forth a black book , and running his fingers through the pages stopped at the letter k. " yes , sent back his legislative pass , but i 've known 'em to do that when they were holding out for something more .
there must be somebody who can get close to him . "
the colonel <unk> awhile .
then he strode to the door and called out to the group of men who were always lounging in the hall .
" tell alf young i want to see him , <name> . "
i waited , by no means free from uneasiness and anxiety , from a certain lack of self-respect that was unfamiliar .
mr. young , the colonel explained , was a legal light in <unk> , near elkington ,  the railroad lawyer there .
and when at last mr. young appeared he proved to be an oily gentleman of about forty , <unk> to <unk> , with one of those " blue , " shaven faces .
" want me , colonel ? "
he inquired <unk> , when the door had closed behind him ; and added <unk> , when introduced to me , " glad to meet you , mr. paret .
my regards to mr. watling , when you go back .
" alf , " demanded the colonel , " what do you know of this fellow krebs ? "
mr. young laughed .
krebs was " <unk> , " he declared  that was all there was to it .
" wo n't he  listen to reason ? "
" it 's been tried , colonel .
say , he would n't know a <unk> <name> if you showed him one . "
" what does he want ? "
" oh , something ,  that 's sure , they all want something . "
mr. young shrugged his shoulder <unk> , and by a skillful manipulation of his lips shifted his cigar from one side of his mouth to the other without raising his hands .
" but it ai n't money .
i guess he 's got a notion that later on the labour unions 'll send him to the united states senate some day .
he 's no slouch , either , when it comes to law .
i can tell you that . "
" no  no flaw in his  record ? "
colonel varney 's agate eyes sought those of mr. young , meaningly .
" that 's been tried , too , " declared the <unk> attorney .
" say , you can believe it or not , but we 've never dug anything up so far .
he 's been too slick for us , i guess . "
" well , " exclaimed the colonel , at length , " let him squeal and be d  d !
he ca n't do any more than make a noise .
only i hoped we 'd be able to grease this thing along and slide it through the senate this afternoon , before they got wind of it . "
" he 'll squeal , all right , until you smother him , " mr. young observed .
" we 'll smother him some day ! "
replied the colonel , savagely .
mr. young laughed .
but as i made my way toward the state house i was conscious of a feeling of relief .
i had no sooner gained a front seat in the gallery of the house of representatives when the members rose , the senate marched gravely in , the speaker stopped jesting with the chaplain , and over the chaplain 's face came suddenly an agonized expression .
folding his hands across his stomach he began to call on god with terrific fervour , in an intense and resounding voice .
i was struck suddenly by the irony of it all .
why have a legislature when colonel <name> varney was so efficient !
the legislature was a mere <unk> to democratic prejudice , to pray over it heightened the <unk> .
suppose there were a god after all ?
not necessarily the magnified monarch to whom these <unk> prayed , but an intelligent force that makes for righteousness .
how did he , or it , like to be trifled with in this way ?
and , if he existed , would not his disgust be immeasurable as he contemplated that <unk> figure in the " <name> <name> " coat , who pretended to represent him ?
as the routine business began i searched for krebs , to find him presently at a desk beside a window in the rear of the hall making notes on a paper ; there was , <unk> , little satisfaction in the thought that the man whose gaunt features i contemplated was merely one of those <unk> <unk> who beat themselves to pieces against the forces that sway the world and must forever sway it .
i should be compelled to admit that he represented something unique in that assembly if he had the courage to get up and oppose house <name> 709 .
i watched him narrowly ; the suggestion intruded itself  perhaps he had been " seen , " as the colonel expressed it .
i repudiated it .
i grew impatient , feverish ; the monotonous reading of the clerk was interrupted now and then by the sharp tones of the speaker assigning his various measures to this or that committee , " unless objection is offered , " while the members moved about and murmured among themselves ; krebs had stopped making notes ; he was looking out of the window .
at last , without any change of emphasis in his droning voice , the clerk announced the recommendation of the committee on judiciary that house <name> 709 ought to pass .
down in front a man had risen from his seat  the felicitous mr. <unk> .
glancing around at his <unk> he then began to explain in the impressive but conversational tone of one whose counsels are in the habit of being listened to , that this was merely a little measure to remedy a flaw in the statutes .
mr. <unk> believed in corporations when corporations were good , and this <name> was calculated to make them good , to put an end to <unk> and concealment .
our great state , he said , should be in the <unk> of such wise legislation , which made for justice and a proper publicity ; but the <name> in question was of greater interest to lawyers than to <unk> , a committee composed largely of lawyers had recommended it unanimously , and he was sure that no opposition would develop in the house .
in order not to take up their time he asked : therefore , that it be immediately put on its second and third reading and allowed to pass .
he sat down , and i looked at krebs .
could he , could any man , any lawyer , have the presumption to question such an obviously desirable measure , to <unk> the united judgment of the committee 's legal talent ?
such was the note mr. <unk> so admirably struck .
as though fascinated , i continued to gaze at krebs .
i hated him , i desired to see him humiliated , and yet amazingly i found myself wishing with almost equal vehemence that he would be true to himself .
he was rising ,  slowly , timidly , i thought , his hand clutching his desk lid , his voice sounding wholly inadequate as he addressed the speaker .
the speaker hesitated , his tone palpably <unk> .
" the gentleman from  from elkington , mr .
krebs . "
there was a <unk> of necks , a staring , a <unk> .
i burned with <unk> shame as krebs stood there awkwardly , his hand still holding the desk .
there were cries of " louder " when he began ; some picked up their newspapers , while others started conversations .
the speaker rapped with his gavel , and i failed to hear the opening words .
krebs paused , and began again .
his speech did not , at first , flow easily .
" mr. speaker , i rise to protest against this <name> , which in my opinion is not so innocent as the gentleman from st. <name> 's would have the house believe .
it is on a par , indeed , with other legislation that in past years has been <unk> through this legislature under the guise of beneficent law .
no , not on a par .
it is the most arrogant , the most monstrous example of special legislation of them all .
and while i do not expect to be able to delay its passage much longer than the time i shall be on my feet  " " then why not sit down ? "
came a voice , just audible .
as he turned swiftly toward the offender his profile had an <unk> effect that startled me , seemingly realizing a new quality in the man .
it was as though he had needed just the stimulus of that interruption to <unk> and transform him .
his awkwardness disappeared ; and if he was a little <unk> , a little " young , " he spoke with the fire of conviction .
" because , " he cried , " because i should lose my self-respect for life if i sat here and permitted the political organization of a railroad , the members of which are here under the guise of servants of the people , to cow me into silence .
and if it be treason to mention the name of that railroad in connection with its political tyranny , then make the most of it . "
he let go of the desk , and tapped the copy of the <name> .
" what are the facts ?
the boyne iron works , under the presidency of adolf scherer , has been engaged in <unk> with the ribblevale steel company for some years : and this <name> is intended to put into the hands of the <unk> for mr. scherer certain information that <name> enable him to get possession of the property .
gentlemen , that is what <unk> <unk> has descended to in the hands of respectable lawyers .
this device originated with the <unk> mr. <name> watling , and if it had not had the approval of mr. miller gorse , it would never have got any farther than the judiciary committee .
it was confided to the skillful care of colonel <name> varney to be steered through this legislature , as hundreds of other measures have been steered through ,  without unnecessary noise .
it may be asked why the railroad should bother itself by lending its political organization to private corporations ?
i <name> tell you .
because corporations like the boyne corporation are a part of a network of interests , these corporations aid the railroad to maintain its monopoly , and in return receive <unk> . "
krebs had raised his voice as the murmurs became louder .
at this point a <unk> lawyer from belfast got to his feet and objected that the gentleman from elkington was wasting the time of the house , indulging in hearsay .
his remarks were not <unk> , etc .
the speaker rapped again , with a fine show of impartiality , and cautioned the member from elkington .
" very well , " replied krebs .
" i have said what i wanted to say on that score , and i know it to be the truth .
and if this house does not find it <unk> , the day is coming when its constituents <name> . "
whereupon he entered into a discussion of the <name> , <unk> it with more calmness , with an ability that must have commanded , even from some hostile minds , an unwilling respect .
the penalty , he said , was outrageous , hitherto unheard of in law ,  putting a corporation in the hands of a receiver , at the <name> of those who coveted it , because one of its officers refused , or was unable , to testify .
he might be in <name> , in <unk> when the summons was delivered at his last or usual place of abode .
here was an enormity , an exercise of tyrannical power exceeding all bounds , a <unk> on popular government ... .
he ended by pointing out the significance of the fact that the committee had given no <unk> ; by declaring that if the <name> became a law , it would inevitably <unk> upon the heads of those who were responsible for it .
he sat down , and there was a flutter of applause from the scattered audience in the gallery .
" by god , that 's the only man in the whole place ! "
i was aware , for the first time , of a neighbour at my side ,  a solid , red-faced man , evidently a farmer .
his trousers were tucked into his boots , and his gnarled and powerful hands , <unk> with dirt , clutched the arms of the seat as he leaned forward .
" did n't he just naturally <unk> 'em ? "
he cried excitedly .
" they'll down him , i guess ,  but say , he 's right .
a man would lose his self-respect if he did n't let out his mind at them hoss thieves , would n't he ?
what 's that fellow 's name ? "
i told him .
" krebs , " he repeated .
" i want to remember that .
<unk> if i do n't shake hands with him . "
his excitement astonished me .
would the public feel like that , if they only knew ? ...
the speaker 's gavel had come down like a pistol shot .
one " <unk> "  as my neighbour called them  after another proceeded to crush the member from elkington .
it was , indeed , very skillfully done , and yet it was a process from which i did not derive , somehow , much pleasure .
colonel varney 's army had been magnificently trained to meet just this kind of situation : some employed ridicule , others declared , in impassioned tones , that the good name of their state had been wantonly assailed , and pointed fervently to portraits on the walls of patriots of the past ,  sentiments that <name> applause from the fickle gallery .
one gentleman observed that the <unk> of a " railroad machine " was a sure symptom of a certain kind of insanity , of which the first speaker had given many other evidences .
the farmer at my side remained staunch .
" they ca n't fool me , " he said angrily , " i know 'em .
do you see that fellow gettin ' up to talk now ?
well , i could tell you a few things about him , all right .
he comes from glasgow , and his name 's <unk> .
he's done more harm in his life than all the criminals he 's kept out of prison ,  belongs to one of the old families down there , too . "
i had , indeed , remarked <unk> 's face , which seemed to me peculiarly evil , its <unk> enhanced by a shock of grey hair .
his method was withering sarcasm , and he was clearly unable to control his animus ... . no champion appeared to support krebs , who sat pale and tense while this denunciation of him was going on .
finally he got the floor .
his voice trembled a little , whether with passion , excitement , or nervousness it was impossible to say .
but he contented himself with a brief defiance .
if the <name> passed , he declared , the men who voted for it , the men who were behind it , would ultimately be driven from political life by an indignant public .
he had a higher opinion of the voters of the state than those who accused him of <unk> it , than those who sat silent and had not lifted their voices against this crime .
when the <name> was put to a vote he demanded a roll call .
ten members besides himself were recorded against house <name> no .
709 !
in spite of this overwhelming triumph my feelings were not wholly those of satisfaction when i returned to the hotel and listened to the <unk> and denunciations of such politicians as <unk> , young , and colonel varney .
perhaps an image suggesting hermann krebs as some splendid animal at bay , dragged down by the hounds , is too strong : he had been <unk> crushed , and defeat , even for the sake of conviction , was not an inspiring spectacle ... . as the <name> swept on over his prostrate figure i rapidly regained poise and a sense of proportion ; a " master of life " could not permit himself to be tossed about by sentimentality ; and gradually i grew ashamed of my bad quarter of an hour in the gallery of the house , and of the effect of it  which lingered awhile  as of a weakness suddenly revealed , which must at all costs be overcome .
i began to see something dramatic and sensational in krebs 's performance ... .
the ribblevale steel company was the real quarry , after all .
and such had been the expedition , the skill and secrecy , with which our affair was conducted , that before the ribblevale lawyers could arrive , alarmed and breathless , the <name> had passed the house , and their only real chance of halting it had been lost .
for the railroad controlled the house , not by owning the individuals composing it , but through the leaders who dominated it ,  men like <unk> and <unk> .
these , and colonel varney , had seen to it that men who had any parliamentary ability had been attended to ; all save krebs , who had proved a surprise .
there were indeed certain members who , although they had railroad passes in their pockets ( which were regarded as just <unk> ,  the railroad being so <name> !
) , would have opposed the <name> if they had felt sufficiently sure of themselves to cope with such veterans as <unk> .
many of these had allowed themselves to be won over or cowed by the oratory which had crushed krebs .
nor did the ribblevale people  be it recorded  scruple to fight fire with fire .
their existence , of course , was at stake , and there was no public to appeal to .
a part of the legal army that rushed to the aid of our adversaries spent the afternoon and most of the night organizing all those who could be induced by one means or another to reverse their sentiments , and in searching for the few who had grievances against the existing power .
the following morning a motion was introduced to reconsider ; and in the debate that followed , krebs , still defiant , took an active part .
but the resolution required a two-thirds vote , and was lost .
when the battle was shifted to the senate it was as good as lost .
the judiciary committee of the <name> body did indeed condescend to give <unk> , at which the ribblevale lawyers exhausted their energy and ingenuity without result with only two <unk> votes the <name> was calmly passed .
in vain was the governor besieged , entreated , threatened ,  it was said ; mr. <unk> had informed <unk>  so colonel varney gleefully reported  that he had " become fully convinced of the inherent justice of the measure . "
on saturday morning he signed it , and it became a law ... .
colonel varney , as he accompanied me to the train , did not conceal his <unk> .
" perhaps i ought not to say it , mr. paret , but it could n't have been done <unk> .
that 's the <name> in these little affairs , to get 'em <unk> fast , to get momentum on 'em before the other party wakes up , and then he ca n't stop 'em . "
as he shook hands in farewell he added , with more gravity : " we 'll see each other often , sir , i guess .
my very best regards to mr .
watling . "
needless to say , i had not confided to him the part i had played in originating house <name> no .
709 , now a law of the state .
but as the train rolled on through the <name> <name> landscape a sense of well-being , of importance and power began to steal through me .
i was <unk> bearing home my first scalp ,  one which was by no means to be despised ... .
it was not until we reached <unk> , about five o'clock , that i was able to get the evening newspapers .
such was the perfection of the organization of which i might now call myself an <unk> part that the " best " publications contained only the <unk> mention ,  and that in the legislative news ,  of the signing of the <name> .
i read with complacency and even with amusement the flaring headlines i had anticipated in mr. <unk> 's <unk> . '
" the governor signs it ! "
" special legislation , forced through by the railroad lobby , which <name> drive honest corporations from this state . "
" ribblevale steel company the victim . "
it was common talk in the capital , the article went on to say , that <name> watling himself had drawn up the measure ... . perusing the editorial <name> my eye fell on the name , krebs .
one member of the legislature above all deserved the gratitude of the people of the state ,  the member from elkington .
" an unknown man , elected in spite of the opposition of the machine , he had dared to raise his voice against this iniquity , " etc. , etc .
we had won .
that was the essential thing .
and my legal experience had taught me that victory counts ; defeat is soon forgotten .
even the discontented , <unk> and heterogeneous element from which the pilot got its circulation had short memories .
xi .
the next morning , which was <name> , i went to mr. watling 's house in , fillmore street  a new residence at that time , being admired as the <unk> <unk> in architecture .
it had a mediaeval look , queer <unk> in a steep roof of red tiles , <unk> windows buried deep in walls of rough stone .
emerging from the <unk> vestibule on a level with the street were the watling twins , aglow with health , dressed in identical costumes of blue .
they had made their bow to society that <name> .
" why , here 's <name> ! "
said <name> .
" does n't he look pleased with himself ? "
" he 's come to take us to church , " said <name> .
" oh , he 's much too important , " said <name> .
" he 's made a killing of some sort ,  have n't you , <name> ? " ...
i rang the <name> and stood watching them as they departed , reflecting that i was thirty-two years of age and unmarried .
mr. watling , surrounded with newspapers and seated before his library fire , glanced up at me with a welcoming smile : how had i borne the legislative baptism of fire ?
such , i knew , was its implication .
" everything went through according to schedule , eh ?
well , i congratulate you , <name> , " he said .
" oh , i did n't have much to do with it , " i answered , smiling back at him .
" i kept out of sight . "
" that 's an <name> in itself . "
" i had an opportunity , at close range , to study the methods of our <unk> . "
" they 're not particularly <unk> , " mr. watling replied .
" but they seem , unfortunately , to be necessary . "
such had been my own thought .
" who is this man krebs ? "
he inquired suddenly .
" and why did n't varney get hold of him and make him listen to reason ? "
" i 'm afraid it would n't have been any use , " i replied .
" he was in my class at harvard .
i knew him  slightly .
he worked his way through , and had a pretty hard time of it .
i imagine it affected his ideas . "
" what is he , a socialist ? "
" something of the sort . "
in <name> watling 's vigorous , <unk> presence krebs 's act appeared fantastic , ridiculous .
" he has queer notions about a new kind of democracy which he says is coming .
i think he is the kind of man who would be willing to die for it . "
" what , in these days ! "
mr. watling looked at me incredulously .
" if that 's so , we must keep an eye on him , a sincere fanatic is a good deal more dangerous than a reformer who wants something .
there are such men , " he added , " but they are rare .
how was the governor , <unk> ? "
he asked suddenly .
" <unk> ? "
" behaved like a lamb , although he insisted upon going through with his little humbug , " i said .
mr. watling laughed .
" they always do , " he observed , " and waste a lot of valuable time .
you 'll find some light cigars in the corner , <name> . "
i sat down beside him and we spent the morning going over the details of the ribblevale suit , mr. watling <unk> to me certain matters connected with it of a kind with which i had not hitherto been entrusted ; and he spoke again , before i left , of his intention of taking me into the firm as soon as the affair could be arranged .
walking homeward , with my mind intent upon things to come , i met my mother at the corner of <unk> street coming from church .
her face lighted up at sight of me .
" have you been working to-day , <name> ? "
she asked .
i explained that i had spent the morning with mr. watling .
" i 'll tell you a secret , mother .
i 'm going to be taken into the firm . "
" oh , my dear , i 'm so glad ! "
she exclaimed .
" i often think , if only your father were alive , how happy he would be , and how proud of you .
i wish he could know .
perhaps he does know . "
<name> watling had once said to me that the man who can best keep his own counsel is the best counsel for other men to keep .
i did not go about boasting of the part i had played in originating the now famous <name> no .
709 , the passage of which had brought about the <unk> of the ribblevale steel company to our clients .
but <name> hambleton knew of it , of course .
" that was a pretty good thing you pulled off , hughie , " he said .
" i did n't think you had it in you . "
it was rank patronage , of course , yet i was secretly pleased .
as the years went on i was thrown more and more with him , though in boyhood there had been between us no bond of sympathy .
about this time he was beginning to increase very considerably the hambleton fortune , and a little later i became counsel for the crescent gas and electric company , in which he had shrewdly gained a controlling interest .
even toward the colossal game of modern finance his attitude was characteristically that of the <unk> , of the amateur ; he played it , as it were , contemptuously , even as he had played poker at harvard , with a cynical audacity that had a peculiarly disturbing effect upon his companions .
he <unk> , he raised the limit in spite of protests , and when he lost one always had the feeling that he would ultimately get his money back twice over .
at the conferences in the boyne club , which he often attended , his manner toward mr. dickinson and mr. scherer and even toward miller gorse was frequently one of thinly veiled amusement at their seriousness .
i often wondered that they did not resent it .
but he was a privileged person .
his cousin , ham durrett , whose inheritance was even greater than <unk> had been , had also become a privileged person whose <unk> and goings and more reputable doings were often recorded in the newspapers .
ham had attained to what <name> hollister aptly but <unk> called " notoriety " : as <name> <unk> remarked , ham gave to polo and women that which might have gone into high finance .
he spent much of his time in the east ; his conduct there and at home would once have created a black scandal in our community , but we were gradually leaving our <unk> behind us and growing more tolerant : we were ready to forgive much to wealth especially if it was inherited .
<unk> lamented the fact that ham was " wild , " but they asked him to dinners and dances to meet their daughters .
if some <unk> better educated and more <unk> than <name> blackwood ( for <name> had become a <unk> ) had told these <unk> that hambleton durrett was a victim of our new civilization , they would have raised their eyebrows .
they deplored while they coveted .
if ham had been told he was a victim of any sort , he would have laughed .
he enjoyed life ; he was genial and jovial , both lavish and <unk> ,  this latter characteristic being the curious survival of the trait of the ancestors to which he owed his millions .
he was growing even heavier , and decidedly red in the face .
<name> used to take <name> to task for not saving ham from his <unk> , and <name> would reply that ham was going to the devil anyway , and not even the devil himself could stop him .
" you can stop him , and you know it , " <name> retorted indignantly .
" what do you want me to do with him ? "
asked <name> .
" convert him to the saintly life i lead ? "
this was a <unk> .
" that 's a fact , " sand <name> , " you 're no better than he is . "
" i do n't know what you mean by 'better , ' " retorted <name> , grinning .
" i'm wiser , that 's all . "
( we had been talking about the ethics of business when <name> had switched off to ham . )
" i believe , at least , in restraint of trade .
ham does n't believe in restraint of any kind . "
when , therefore , the news suddenly began to be circulated in the boyne club that ham was showing a tendency to straighten up , surprise and incredulity were genuine .
he was drinking less ,  much less ; and it was said that he had severed certain ties that need not again be definitely mentioned .
the theory of religious regeneration not being <unk> , it was naturally supposed that he had fallen in love ; the identity of the unknown <name> becoming a fruitful subject of speculation among the feminine portion of society .
the announcement of the marriage of hambleton durrett would be news of the first magnitude , to be absorbed eagerly by the many who had not the honour of his acquaintance ,  comparable only to that of a devastating flood or a murder mystery or a change in the tariff .
being absorbed in affairs that seemed more important , the subject did not interest me greatly .
but one cold <name> afternoon , as i made my way , in answer to her invitation , to see <name> willett , i found myself wondering idly whether she might not be by way of making a shrewd guess as to the object of hambleton 's affections .
it was well known that he had entertained a hopeless infatuation for her ; and some were inclined to attribute his later lapses to her lack of response .
he still called on her , and her lectures , which she delivered like a great aunt with a recondite knowledge of the world , he took meekly .
but even she had seemed powerless to alter his habits ... . powell street , that happy <unk> of my youth , had changed its character , become contracted and unfamiliar , <unk> .
the <unk> and other older families who had not decayed with the neighbourhood were rapidly deserting it , moving out to the new residence district known as " the heights . "
i came to the willett house .
that , too , had an air of <unk> ,  of <unk> <unk> , to be sure ; the stone steps had been scrupulously scrubbed , but one of them was cracked clear across , and the silver on the polished <unk> was wearing off ; even the act of pulling the knob of a door-bell was becoming obsolete , so used had we grown to pushing porcelain buttons in bright , new <unk> .
as i waited for my summons to be answered it struck me as remarkable that neither <name> nor her father had been <unk> by the <unk> that surrounded them .
she had managed rather marvellously to redeem one room from the old-fashioned severity of the rest of the house , the library behind the big " parlour . "
it was <name> 's room , eloquent of her <unk> and taste , of her essential <unk> and <unk> ; and that evening , as i was ushered into it , this quality of <unk> , of being able to shut out the disagreeable aspects of life that surrounded and threatened her , particularly impressed me .
she had not lacked opportunities to escape .
i wondered uneasily as i waited why she had not embraced them .
i strayed about the room .
a coal fire burned in the grate , the <unk> lamps gave a subdued but cheerful light ; some impulse led me to cross over to the windows and draw aside the heavy hangings .
dusk was gathering over that garden , bleak and frozen now , where we had romped together as children .
how queer the place seemed !
how shrivelled !
once it had had the wide range of a park .
there , still <unk> the elements , was the old-fashioned latticed summer-house , but the fruit-trees that i recalled as clouds of pink and white were gone ... . a touch of <unk> was in these memories .
i dropped the curtain , and turned to confront <name> , who had entered noiselessly .
" well , <name> , were you dreaming ? "
she said .
" not exactly , " i replied , embarrassed .
" i was looking at the garden . "
" the soot has ruined it .
my life seems to be one continual struggle against the soot ,  the blacks , as the english call them .
it 's a more expressive term .
they are like an army , you know , overwhelming in their relentless invasion .
well , do sit down .
it is nice of you to come .
you 'll have some tea , wo n't you ? "
the maid had brought in the tray .
afternoon tea was still rather a new custom with us , more of a ceremony than a meal ; and as <name> handed me my cup and the thinnest of slices of bread and butter i found the intimacy of the situation a little disquieting .
her manner was indeed intimate , and yet it had the odd and disturbing effect of making her seem more remote .
as she chatted i answered her <unk> , while all the time i was asking myself why i had ceased to <name> her , whether the old longing for her might not return  was not even now returning ?
i might indeed go far afield to find a wife so suited to me as <name> .
she had beauty , distinction , and position .
she was a woman of whom any man might be proud ... . " i have n't congratulated you yet , <name> , " she said suddenly , " now that you are a partner of mr. watling 's .
i hear on all sides that you are on the high road to a great success . "
" of course i 'm glad to be in the firm , " i admitted .
it was a new tack for <name> , rather a disquieting one , this discussion of my affairs , which she had so long avoided or ignored .
" you are getting what you have always wanted , are n't you ? "
i wondered in some trepidation whether by that word " always " she was making a deliberate reference to the past .
" always ? "
i repeated , rather <unk> .
" nearly always , ever since you have been a man . "
i was incapable of taking advantage of the opening , if it were one .
she was baffling .
" a man likes to succeed in his profession , of course , " i said .
" and you made up your mind to succeed more deliberately than most men .
i need n't ask you if you are satisfied , <name> .
success seems to agree with you ,  although i imagine you <name> never be satisfied . "
" why do you say that ? "
i demanded .
" i have n't known you all your life for nothing .
i think i know you much better than you know yourself . "
" you have n't acted as if you did , " i exclaimed .
she smiled .
" have you been interested in what i thought about you ? "
she asked .
" that is n't quite fair , <name> , " i protested .
" you have n't given me much evidence that you did think about me . "
" have i received much encouragement to do so ? "
she inquired .
" but you have n't seemed to invite  you 've kept me at arm 's length . "
" oh , do n't fence ! "
she cried , rather sharply .
i had become agitated , but her next words gave me a shock that was momentarily paralyzing .
" i asked you to come here to-day , <name> , because i wished you to know that i have made up my mind to marry hambleton durrett . "
" hambleton durrett ! "
i echoed stupidly .
" hambleton durrett ! "
" why not ? "
" have you  have you accepted him ? "
" no .
but i mean to do so . "
" you  you love him ? "
" i do n't see what right you have to ask . "
" but you just said that you invited me here to talk frankly . "
" no , i do n't love him . "
" then why , in heaven 's name , are you going to marry him ? "
she lay back in her chair , regarding me , her lips slightly parted .
all at once the full flavour of her , the <unk> quality was revealed after years of <unk>  nor can i describe the sudden rebellion , the revulsion that i experienced .
hambleton durrett !
it was an outrage , a sacrilege !
i got up , and put my hand on the mantel .
<name> remained motionless , inert , her head lying back against the chair .
could it be that she were enjoying my discomfiture ?
there is no need to confess that i knew next to nothing of women ; had i been less excited , i might have made the discovery that i still regarded them <unk> .
certain romantic axioms concerning them , garnered from victorian literature , passed current in my mind for wisdom ; and one of these declared that they were prone to remain true to an early love .
did <name> still care for me ?
the query , coming as it did on top of my emotion , brought with it a strange and overwhelming perplexity .
did i really care for her ?
the many years during which i had practised the habit of caution began to exert an <unk> pressure .
here was a situation , an opportunity suddenly thrust upon me which might never return , and which i was utterly unprepared to meet .
would i be happy with <name> , after all ?
her expression was still <unk> .
" why should n't i marry him ? "
she demanded .
" because he 's not good enough for you . "
" good ! "
she exclaimed , and laughed .
" he loves me .
he wants me without reservation or calculation . "
there was a sting in this .
" and is he any worse , " she asked slowly , " than many others who might be mentioned ? "
" no , " i agreed .
i did not intend to be led into the <unk> and disagreeable position of condemning hambleton durrett .
" but why have you waited all these years if you did not mean to marry a man of ability , a man who has made something of himself ? "
" a man like you , <name> ? "
she said gently .
i flushed .
" that is n't quite fair , <name> . "
" what are you working for ? "
she suddenly inquired , straightening up .
" what any man works for , i suppose . "
" ah , there you have hit it ,  what any man works for in our world .
power ,  personal power .
you want to be somebody ,  is n't that it ?
not the noblest ambition , you 'll have to admit ,  not the kind of thing we used to dream about , when we did dream .
well , when we find we ca n't realize our dreams , we take the next best thing .
and i fail to see why you should blame me for taking it when you yourself have taken it .
hambleton durrett can give it to me .
he 'll accept me on my own terms , he won't interfere with me , i <name> n't be <unk> ,  and i shall have a position which i could not <name> to have if i remained unmarried , a very marked position as hambleton durrett 's wife .
i am thirty , you know . "
her frankness appalled me .
" the trouble with you , <name> , is that you still deceive yourself .
you throw a glamour over things .
you want to keep your cake and eat it too .
" i do n't see why you say that .
and marriage especially  " she took me up .
" marriage !
what other career is open to a woman ?
unless she is married , and married well , according to the money standard you men have set up , she is nobody .
we ca n't all be <name> <unk> , and i am unable to imagine myself a <name> <name> <unk> or a <name> beecher <unk> .
what is left ?
nothing but marriage .
i 'm hard and cynical , you <name> say , but i have thought , and i 'm not afraid , as i have told you , to look things in the face .
there are very few women , i think , who would not take the real thing if they had the chance before it were too late , who would n't be willing to do their own cooking in order to get it . "
she fell silent suddenly .
i began to pace the room .
" for god 's sake , do n't do this , <name> ! "
i begged .
but she continued to stare into the fire , as though she had not heard me .
" if you had made up your mind to do it , why did you tell me ? "
i asked .
" sentiment , i suppose .
i am paying a tribute to what i once was , to what you once were , " she said .
" a  a sort of good-bye to sentiment . "
" <name> ! "
i said hoarsely .
she shook her head .
" no , <name> .
surely you ca n't <unk> me so ! "
she answered reproachfully .
" do you think i should have sent for you if i had meant  that ! "
" no , no , i did n't think so .
but why not ?
you  you cared once , and you tell me plainly you do n't love him .
it was all a terrible mistake .
we were meant for each other . "
" i did love you then , " she said .
" you never knew how much .
and there is nothing i would n't give to bring it all back again .
but i ca n't .
it's gone .
you 're gone , and i 'm gone .
i mean what we were .
oh , why did you change ? "
" it was you who changed , " i declared , bewildered .
" could n't you see  ca n't you see now what you did ?
but perhaps you could n't help it .
perhaps it was just you , after all . "
" what i did ? "
" why could n't you have held fast to your <name> ?
if you had , you would have known what it was i adored in you .
oh , i do n't mind telling you now , it was just that <name> , <name> , that <name> you had in life , that <name> you had in me .
you were n't cynical and calculating , like <name> hambleton , you had imagination .
i  i dreamed , too .
and do you remember the time when you made the boat , and we went to <name> 's pond , and you sank in her ? "
" and you stayed , " i went on , " when all the others ran away ?
you ran down the hill like a whirlwind . "
she laughed .
" and then you came here one day , to a party , and said you were going to harvard , and quarrelled with me . "
" why did you doubt met " i asked <unk> .
" why did n't you let me see that you still cared ? "
" because that was n't you , <name> , that was n't your real self .
do you suppose it mattered to me whether you went to harvard with the others ?
oh , i was foolish too , i know .
i should n't have said what i did .
but what is the use of regrets ? "
she exclaimed .
" we 've both run after the practical gods , and the others have hidden their faces from us .
it may be that we are not to blame , either of us , that the practical gods are too strong .
we 've learned to love and worship them , and now we ca n't do without them . "
" we can try , <name> , " i pleaded .
" no , " she answered in a low voice , " that 's the difference between you and me .
i know myself better than you know yourself , and i know you better . "
she smiled again .
" unless we could have it all back again , i should n't want any of it .
you do not love me  " i started once more to protest .
" no , no , do n't say it ! "
she cried .
" you may think you do , just this moment , but it 's only because  you've been moved .
and what you believe you want is n't me , it 's what i was .
but i 'm not that any more ,  i 'm simply recalling that , do n't you see ?
and even then you would n't wish me , now , as i was .
that sounds involved , but you must understand .
you want a woman who <name> be wrapped up in your career , <name> , and yet who <name> not share it ,  who <name> devote herself body and soul to what you have become .
a woman whom you can shape .
and you wo n't really love her , but only just so much of her as may become the incarnation of you .
well , i 'm not that kind of woman .
i might have been , had you been different .
i 'm not at all sure .
certainly i 'm not that kind now , even though i know in my heart that the sort of career you have made for yourself , and that i intend to make for myself is all dross .
but now i ca n't do without it . "
" and yet you are going to marry hambleton durrett ! "
i said .
she understood me , although i regretted my words at once .
" yes , i am going to marry him . "
there was a shade of bitterness , of defiance in her voice .
" surely you are not offering me the  the other thing , now .
oh , <name> ! "
" i am willing to abandon it all , <name> . "
" no , " she said , " you 're not , and i 'm not .
what you ca n't see and won't see is that it has become part of you .
oh , you are successful , you <name> be more and more successful .
and you think i should be somebody , as your wife , <name> , more perhaps , eventually , than i shall be as hambleton 's .
but i should be nobody , too .
i could n't stand it now , my dear .
you must realize that as soon as you have time to think it over .
we shall be friends . "
the sudden gentleness in her voice pierced me through and through .
she held out her hand .
something in her grasp spoke of a resolution which could not be shaken .
" and besides , " she added sadly , " i do n't love you any more , <name> .
i'm mourning for something that 's gone .
i wanted to have just this one talk with you .
but we <name> n't mention it again ,  we 'll close the book . " ...
at that i fled out of the house , and at first the thought of her as another man 's wife , as hambleton durrett 's wife , was seemingly not to be borne .
it was incredible !
" we 'll close the book . "
i found myself repeating the phrase ; and it seemed then as though something within me i had believed dead  something that formerly had been all of me  had revived again to throb with pain .
it is not surprising that the acuteness of my suffering was of short duration , though i remember certain sharp <unk> when the announcement of the engagement burst on the city .
there was much controversy over the question as to whether or not ham durrett 's reform would be permanent ; but most people were willing to give him the benefit of the doubt ; it was time he settled down and took the position in the community that was to be expected of one of his name ; and as for <name> , it was generally agreed that she had done well for herself .
she was not made for poverty  and who so well as she was fitted for the social leadership of our community ?
they were married in <name> church in the month of may , and i was one of ham 's attendants .
<name> was " best man . "
for the last time the old willett mansion in powell street wore the <name> air of former days ; carpets were spread over the sidewalk , and red and white awnings ; rooms were filled with flowers and flung open to hundreds of guests .
i found the wedding something of an ordeal .
i do not like to dwell upon it  especially upon that moment when i came to congratulate <name> as she stood beside ham at the end of the long parlour .
she seemed to have no regrets .
i do n't know what i expected of her  certainly not tears and tragedy .
she seemed taller than ever , and very beautiful in her veil and white satin gown and the diamonds ham had given her ; very much mistress of herself , quite a contrast to ham , who made no secret of his elation .
she smiled when i wished her happiness .
" we 'll be home in the autumn , <name> , and expect to see a great deal of you , " she said .
as i paused in a corner of the room my eye fell upon <name> 's father .
mcalery willett 's elation seemed even greater than ham 's .
with a <unk> in his frock-coat and a glass of champagne in his hand he went from group to group ; and his familiar laughter , which once had seemed so full of merriment and fun , gave me to-day a somewhat scandalized feeling .
i heard <name> 's voice , and turned to discover him standing beside me , his long legs thrust slightly apart , his hands in his pockets , overlooking the scene with typical , <unk> amusement .
" this lets old mcalery out , anyway , " he said .
" what do you mean ? "
i demanded .
" one or two little notes of his <name> be <unk> , sooner or later  that 's all . "
for a moment i was unable to speak .
" and do you think that she  that <name> found out  ? "
i stammered .
" well , i 'd be willing to take that end of the bet , " he replied .
" why the deuce should she marry ham ?
you ought to know her well enough to understand how she 'd feel if she discovered some of mcalery 's financial <unk> ?
of course it 's not a thing i talk about , you understand .
are you going to the club ? "
" no , i 'm going home , " i said .
i was aware of his somewhat compassionate smile as i left him ... . xii .
one november day nearly two years after my admission as <name> member of the firm of watling , fowndes and ripon seven gentlemen met at luncheon in the boyne club ; mr. <unk> , president of the railroad , mr. scherer , of the boyne iron works and other corporations , mr. <name> dickinson , of the corn national bank , mr. <unk> , a prominent banker from the other great city of the state , mr. <unk> , chairman of the republican state committee , and mr. <name> grierson , who had become a very important man in our community .
at four o'clock they emerged from the club : citizens in boyne street who saw them chatting <unk> on the steps little suspected that in the last three hours these gentlemen had chosen and practically elected the man who was to succeed mr. <name> as united states senator in washington .
those were the days in which great affairs were simply and efficiently handled .
no democratic nonsense about leaving the choice to an <unk> that did not know what it wanted .
the man chosen to fill this high position was <name> watling .
he said he would think about the matter .
in the nation at large , through the <unk> of certain northern states neither so conservative nor fortunate as ours , the democratic party was in power , which naturally implies financial depression .
there was no question about our ability to send a republican senator ; the choice in the boyne club was final ; but before the legislature should ratify it , a year or so hence , it were just as well that the people of the state should be convinced that they desired mr. watling more than any other man ; and surely enough , in a little while such a conviction sprang up spontaneously .
in offices and restaurants and hotels , men began to suggest to each other what a fine thing it would be if <name> watling might be persuaded to accept the <unk> ; at the banks , when customers called to renew their notes and tight money was discussed and democrats <unk> , it was generally agreed that the obvious thing to do was to get a safe man in the senate .
from the very first , watling sentiment stirred like spring sap after a hard <name> .
the country newspapers , watered by providential rains , began to put forth tender little editorial shoots , which mr. judah b. tallant presently collected and presented in a charming bouquet in the morning <name> .
" the voice of the state press ; " thus was the column headed ; and the remarks of the hon .
fitch <unk> , of the st. <name> 's messenger , were given a special prominence .
mr. <unk> was the first , in his section , to be inspired by the happy thought that the one man <unk> fitted to represent the state in the present crisis , when her great industries had been crippled by democratic folly , was mr. <name> watling .
the <unk> banner , the elkington <name> , the belfast <unk> , and i know not how many others simultaneously began to sing mr. watling 's praises .
" not since the <unk> times of the civil war , " declared the morning <name> , " had the demand for any man been so unanimous . "
as a proof of it , there were the country newspapers , " which reflected the sober opinion of the <unk> of the common people . "
there are certain industrious gentlemen to whom little credit is given , and who , unlike the average citizen who reserves his enthusiasm for election time , are patriotic enough to labour for their country 's good all the year round .
when in town , it was their habit to pay a friendly call on the counsel for the railroad , mr. miller gorse , in the corn bank building .
he was never too busy to converse with them ; or , it might better be said , to listen to them converse .
let some legally and politically ambitious young man observe mr. gorse 's method .
did he inquire what the party worker thought of mr. watling for the senate ?
not at all !
but before the party worker left he was telling mr. gorse that public sentiment demanded mr. watling .
after leaving mr. gorse they <unk> their way to the durrett building and handed their cards over the rail of the offices of watling , fowndes and ripon .
mr. watling shook hands with scores of them , and they departed , well satisfied with the flavour of his cigars and intoxicated by his personality .
he had a marvellous way of cutting short an interview without giving offence .
some of them he turned over to mr. paret , whom he particularly desired they should know .
thus mr. paret acquired many valuable additions to his acquaintance , cultivated a memory for names and faces that was to stand him in good stead ; and kept , besides , an <unk> note-book into which he put various bits of interesting information concerning each .
though not immediately lucrative , it was all , no doubt , part of a <unk> education .
during the summer and the following <name> colonel <name> varney came often to town and spent much of his time in mr. paret 's office smoking mr. watling 's cigars and discussing the coming campaign , in which he took a <unk> interest .
" say , <name> , this is goin ' slick ! "
he would exclaim , his eyes glittering like round buttons of jet .
" i never saw a campaign where they fell in the way they 're doing now .
if it was anybody else but <name> watling , it would scare me .
you ought to have been in <name> <unk> 's campaign , " he added , referring to the <name> senator , " they would n't wood up at all , they was just listless .
but gorse and <unk> and the rest wanted him , and we had to put him over .
i reckon he is useful down there in washington , but say , do you know what he always reminded me of ?
one of those <unk> i used to play with as a boy up in columbia county ,  shuts up tight soon as he sees you coming .
now <name> watling ai n't like that , any way of speaking .
we can get up some enthusiasm for a man of his sort .
he 's liberal and big .
he 's made his pile , and he do n't <unk> some of it to the fellows who do the work .
<name> my words , when you see a man who wants a big office cheap , look out for him . "
this , and much more wisdom i imbibed while <unk> to my <unk> greatness .
for mr. varney was right ,  one could feel enthusiasm for <name> watling ; and my growing intimacy with him , the sense that i was having a part in his career , a share in his success , became for the moment the passion of my life .
as the campaign progressed i gave more and more time to it , and made frequent trips of a confidential nature to the different counties of the state .
the whole of my being was <unk> .
the national fever had thoroughly pervaded my blood  the national fever to win .
prosperity  writ large  demanded it , and <name> watling <unk> , <unk> the cause .
i had neither the time nor the <name> to <unk> on this national fever , which animated all my associates : animated , i might say , the nation , which was beginning to get into a fever about games .
if i remember rightly , it was about this time that golf was introduced , tennis had become a commonplace , professional baseball was in full swing ; ham durrett had even organized a local polo team ... .
the man who failed to win something tangible in sport or law or business or politics was counted out .
such was the spirit of <name> , in the closing years of the nineteenth century .
and yet , when one has said this , one has failed to express the national <unk> in all its <unk> .
in brief , the great american sport was not so much to win the game as to beat it ; the evasion of rules challenged our ingenuity ; and having won , we set about devising methods whereby it would be less and less possible for us winners to lose in the future .
no better illustration of this tendency could be given than the development which had recently taken place in the field of our city politics , hitherto the <unk> of <name> politicians who had fought one another for supremacy .
individualism had been rampant , competition the custom ; you bought an alderman , or a boss who owned four or five aldermen , and then you never could be sure you were to get what you wanted , or that the aldermen and the bosses would " stay bought . "
but now a genius had appeared , an american genius who had arisen swiftly and almost silently , who appealed to the imagination , and whose name was often mentioned in a whisper ,  the hon .
judd <name> , sometimes known as the spider , who organized the city hall and <unk> it ; an ultimate and logical effect  if one had considered it  of the manchester school of economics .
enlightened self-interest , stripped of sentiment , ends on judd <unk> .
he ran the city even as mr. <name> ran his department store ; you paid your price .
it was very convenient .
being a genius , mr. <name> did not wholly break with tradition , but retained those elements of the old muddled system that had their value , <unk> steamboats for outings on the river , giving colossal picnics in <unk> park .
the poor and the wanderer and the criminal ( of the male sex at least ) were cared for .
but he was not loved , as the <unk> <unk> had been loved ; he did not make himself common ; he was surrounded by an <name> of mystery which i confess had not failed of effect on me .
once , and only once during my legal apprenticeship , he had been pointed out to me on the street , where he rarely ventured .
his appearance was not impressive ... . mr. <name> could not , of course , prevent mr. watling 's election , even did he so <name> , but he did command the allegiance of several city candidates  both democratic and republican  for the state legislature , who had as yet failed to announce their preferences for united states senator .
it was important that mr. watling 's vote should be large , as indicative of a public reaction and <unk> of democratic national folly .
this matter among others was the subject of discussion one july morning when the republican state chairman was in the city ; mr. <unk> expressed anxiety over mr. <name> 's continued silence .
it was expedient that somebody should " see " the boss .
" why not paret ? "
suggested <name> dickinson .
mr. watling was not present at this conference .
" paret seems to be running <unk> campaign , anyway . "
it was settled that i should be the <unk> .
with lively sensations of curiosity and excitement , tempered by a certain anxiety as to my ability to match wits with the spider , i made my way to his " lair " over <unk> 's saloon , situated in a district that was anything but respectable .
the saloon , on the ground floor , had two apartments ; the bar-room proper where <name> <unk> , chamberlain of the establishment , was wont to stand , red faced and smiling , to greet the courtiers , big and little , the party workers , the district leaders , the <unk> ready to be hired , the city officials , the police judges ,  yes , and the dignified members of state courts whose elections depended on mr. <name> 's favour : even judge bering , whose acquaintance i had made the day i had come , as a law student , to mr. watling 's office , <unk> from time to time sufficiently to call there for a small glass of rye and water , and to relate , with his <unk> gravity , an anecdote to the " boys . "
the saloon represented democracy , so dear to the american public .
here all were welcome , even the <unk> gentlemen who enjoyed the privilege of police protection ; and who sometimes , through <unk> circumstances , were hauled before the very magistrates with whom they had rubbed elbows on the polished rail .
behind the bar-room , and separated from it by swinging doors only the <unk> ventured to thrust apart , was an audience chamber whither mr. <name> occasionally descended .
anecdote and political reminiscence gave place here to matters of high policy .
i had several times come to the saloon in the days of my apprenticeship in search of some judge or official , and once i had run down here the city auditor himself .
<name> <unk> , whose affair it was to know everyone , recognized me .
it was part of his business , also , to understand that i was now a member of the firm of watling , fowndes and ripon .
" good morning to you , mr. paret , " he said <unk> .
we held a colloquy in <unk> over the bar , eyed by the two or three customers who were present .
mr. <unk> disappeared , but presently returned to whisper : " sure , he 'll see you , " to lead the way through the swinging doors and up a dark stairway .
i came suddenly on a room in the greatest disorder , its tables and chairs piled high with newspapers and letters , its windows streaked with soot .
from an open door on its farther side issued a voice .
" is that you , mr. paret ?
come in here . "
it was little less than a command .
" heard of you , mr. paret .
glad to know you .
sit down , wo n't you ? "
the inner room was almost dark .
i made out a bed in the corner , and propped up in the bed a man ; but for the moment i was most aware of a pair of eyes that flared up when the man spoke , and died down again when he became silent .
they reminded me of those insects which in my childhood days we called " lightning bugs . "
mr. <name> gave me a hand like a woman 's .
i expressed my pleasure at meeting him , and took a chair beside the bed .
" i believe you 're a partner of <name> watling 's now are n't you ?
smart man , watling . "
" he 'll make a good senator , " i replied , accepting the opening .
" you think he 'll get elected  do you ? "
mr. <name> inquired .
i laughed .
" well , there is n't much doubt about that , i imagine . "
" do n't know  do n't know .
seen some <unk> things go wrong in my time . "
" what 's going to defeat him ? "
i asked pleasantly .
" i do n't say anything , " mr. <name> replied .
" but i 've known funny things to happen  never does to be dead sure . "
" oh , well , we 're as sure as it 's humanly possible to be , " i declared .
the eyes continued to fascinate me , they had a peculiar , disquieting effect .
now they died down , and it was as if the man 's very presence had gone out , as though i had been left alone ; and i found it exceedingly difficult , under the circumstances , to continue to address him .
suddenly he flared up again .
" watling send you over here ? "
he demanded .
" no .
as a matter of fact , he 's out of town .
some of mr. <unk> friends , mr. <unk> and mr. dickinson , mr. gorse and others , suggested that i see you , mr .
<name> . "
there came a grunt from the bed .
" mr. watling has always valued your friendship and support , " i said .
" what makes him think he ai n't going to get it ? "
" he has n't a doubt of it , " i went on <unk> .
" but we felt  and i felt personally , that we ought to be in touch with you , to work along with you , to keep informed how things are going in the city . "
" what things ? "
" well  there are one or two representatives , friends of yours , who have n't come out for mr. watling .
we are n't worrying , we know you 'll do the right thing , but we feel that it would have a good deal of influence in some other parts of the state if they declared themselves .
and then you know as well as i do that this is n't a year when any of us can afford to recognize too closely party lines ; the democratic administration has brought on a panic , the business men in that party are down on it , and it ought to be rebuked .
and we feel , too , that some of the city 's democrats ought to be loyal to mr. watling ,  not that we expect them to vote for him in caucus , but when it comes to the joint ballot  " " who ? "
demanded mr. <name> .
" senator <unk> and <name> <unk> , for instance , " i suggested .
" <name> voted for <name> 709 all right  did n't he ? "
said mr. <name> abruptly .
" that 's just it , " i put in boldly .
" we 'd like to induce him to come in with us this time .
but we feel that  the inducement would better come through you . "
i thought mr. <name> smiled .
by this time i had grown accustomed to the darkness , the face and figure of the man in the bed had become discernible .
power , i remember thinking , chooses odd houses for itself .
here was no overbearing , <unk> <name> ruffian brimming with vitality , but a thin , sallow little man in a cotton <unk> , with <unk> hair and a wiry moustache ; he might have been an overworked clerk behind a dry-goods counter ; and yet somehow , now that i had talked to him , i realized that he never could have been .
those extraordinary eyes of his , when they were <unk> , marked his individuality as unique .
it were almost too dramatic to say that he required darkness to make his effect , but so it seemed .
i should never forget him .
he had in truth been well named the spider .
" of course we have n't tried to get in touch with them .
we are leaving them to you , " i added .
" paret , " he said suddenly , " i do n't care a damn about <unk>  never did .
i 'd turn him down for ten cents .
but you can tell <name> watling for me , and dickinson , that i guess the <unk> ' can be fixed . "
i felt a certain relief that the interview had come to an end , that the moment had arrived for <unk> .
to my surprise , mr. <name> anticipated me .
" i 've been interested in you , mr. paret , " he observed .
" know who you are , of course , knew you were in watling 's office .
then some of the boys spoke about you when you were down at the legislature on that ribblevale matter .
guess you had more to do with that <name> than came out in the newspapers  eh ? "
i was taken off my guard .
" oh , that 's talk , " i said .
" all right , it 's talk , then ?
but i guess you and i <name> have some more talk after a while ,  after <name> watling gets to be united states senator .
give him my regards , and  and come in when i can do anything for you , mr .
paret . "
thanking him , i groped my way downstairs and let myself out by a side door <unk> had shown me into an alleyway , thus avoiding the saloon .
as i walked slowly back to the office , seeking the shade of the awnings , the figure in the darkened room took on a sinister aspect that troubled me ... .
the autumn arrived , the campaign was on with a whoop , and i had my first taste of " stump " politics .
the acrid smell of red fire brings it back to me .
it was a medley of railroad travel , of committees provided with badges  and cigars , of open carriages slowly drawn between lines of bewildered citizens , of <name> clubs and other clubs marching in <unk> ranks , uniformed and <unk> , <unk> carrying torches and banners .
and then there were the <unk> <unk> with the sylvan scenery pushed back and plush chairs and sofas pushed forward ; with an ominous table , a pitcher of water on it and a glass , near the <unk> .
the houses were packed with more bewildered citizens .
what a wonderful study of <unk> it would have offered !
men who had not thought of the grand old republican party for two years , and who had not cared much about it when they had entered the <unk> , after an hour or so went mad with fervour .
the hon .
<name> <unk> , <unk> of the house , with whom i traveled on occasions , had a speech referring to the <unk> president , ending with an appeal to the revolutionary fathers who followed washington with bleeding feet .
the hon .
<name> possessed that most valuable of political gifts , presence ; and when with quivering voice he finished his <unk> , citizens wept with him .
what it all had to do with the tariff was not quite clear .
yet nobody seemed to miss the connection .
we were all of us most concerned , of course , about the <unk> and his dinner pail ,  whom the democrats had wantonly thrown out of employment for the sake of a <unk> theory .
they had put him in competition with the <unk> of europe .
such was the <unk> of my own modest addresses in this , my maiden campaign .
i had the sense to see myself in perspective ; to recognize that not for me , a dignified and substantial lawyer of affairs , were the <unk> flights of the hon .
<name> <unk> .
i spoke with a certain restraint .
not too dryly , i <name> .
but i sought to curb my sentiments , my indignation , at the manner in which the <unk> had been treated ; to appeal to the common sense rather than to the passions of my audiences .
here were the statistics !
( drawn , by the way , from the republican campaign book ) .
unscrupulous <unk>  democratic , of course  had sought to twist and evade them .
let this terrible record of lack of employment and misery be compared with the prosperity under republican rule .
" one of the most effective speakers in this campaign for the restoration of prosperity , " said the <unk> banner , " is mr. <name> paret , of the firm of watling , fowndes and ripon .
mr. paret 's speech at the <unk> last evening made a most favourable impression .
mr. paret deals with facts .
and his thoughtful analysis of the situation into which the democratic party has brought this country should convince any <unk> <unk> that the time has come for a change . "
i began to keep a scrap-book , though i locked it up in the drawer of my desk .
in it are to be found many clippings of a similarly gratifying tenor ... . <unk> and i were well contrasted .
in this way , incidentally , i made many valuable acquaintances among the " solid " men of the state , the local capitalists and manufacturers , with whom my manner of dealing with public questions was in particular favour .
these were practical men ; they rather patronized the hon .
<name> , thus estimating , to a nicety , a <unk> value ; or solidity , or specific gravity , it might better be said , since our universe was one of checks and balances .
the hon .
<name> and his like , <unk> through the air , were somehow necessary in the scheme of things , but not to be taken too seriously .
me they did take seriously , these provincial lords , inviting me to their houses and opening their hearts .
thus , when we came to elkington , mr. <unk> reposed in the commercial house , on the noisy main street .
fortunately for him , the clanging of trolley cars never interfered with his slumbers .
i slept in a wide chamber in the mansion of mr. <name> hutchins .
there were many <unk> in elkington ,  brothers and cousins and uncles and <unk> ,  and all were connected with the woollen mills .
but there is always one supreme hutchins , and <name> was he : tall , self-contained , elderly , but well preserved through frugal living , essentially american and typical of his class , when he entered the lobby of the commercial house that afternoon the babel of political discussion was suddenly hushed ; politicians , traveling <unk> and the members of the local committee made a <name> for him ; to him , the hon .
<name> and i were introduced .
mr. hutchins knew what he wanted .
he was cordial to mr. <unk> , but he took me .
we entered a most respectable surrey with tassels , driven by a <unk> coachman in a black overcoat , drawn by two sleek horses .
" how is this thing going , paret ? "
he asked .
i gave him mr. <unk> 's estimated majority .
" what do you think ? "
he demanded , a shrewd , humorous look in his blue eyes .
" well , i think we 'll <name> the state .
i have n't had <unk> experience in estimating . "
<name> hutchins smiled <unk> .
" what does watling think ? "
" he does n't seem to be worrying much . "
" ever been in elkington before ? "
i said i had n't .
" well , a drive <name> do you good . "
it was about four o'clock on a mild october afternoon .
the little town , of fifteen thousand inhabitants or so , had a wonderful setting in the widening valley of the <unk> , whose swiftly running waters furnished the power for the mills .
we drove to these through a gateway over which the words " no admittance " were conspicuously painted , past long brick buildings that bordered the canals ; and in the windows i caught sight of drab figures of men and women bending over the machines .
half of the buildings , as mr. hutchins pointed out , were closed ,  mute witnesses of <unk> madness .
even more eloquent of democratic folly was that part of the town through which we presently passed , streets lined with rows of dreary houses where the workers lived .
children were playing on the sidewalks , but theirs seemed a listless play ; listless , too , were the men and women who sat on the steps ,  listless , and somewhat sullen , as they watched us passing .
<name> hutchins seemed to read my thought .
" since the unions got in here i 've had nothing but trouble , " he said .
" i 've tried to do my duty by my people , god knows .
but they wo n't see which side their bread 's buttered on .
they oppose me at every step , they vote against their own interests .
some years ago they put up a job on us , and sent a <unk> radical to the legislature . "
" krebs . "
" do you know him ? "
" slightly .
he was in my class at harvard ... . is he still here ? "
i asked , after a pause .
" oh , yes .
but he has n't gone to the legislature this time , we 've seen to that .
his father was a respectable old <name> who had a little shop and made <unk> .
the son is an example of too much education .
he 's a notoriety seeker .
oh , he 's clever , in a way .
he 's given us a good deal of trouble , too , in the courts with damage cases . " ...
we came to a brighter , more spacious , well-to-do portion of the town , where the residences faced the river .
in a little while the waters widened into a lake , which was surrounded by a park , a gift to the city of the hutchins family .
facing it , on one side , was the hutchins library ; on the other , across a wide street , where the maples were turning , were the <unk> ' residences of various dates of construction , from that of the younger <name> , who had lately married a wife , and built in bright yellow brick , to the old-fashioned mansion of <name> himself .
this , he told me , had been good enough for his father , and was good enough for him .
the picture of it comes back to me , now , with singular attractiveness .
it was of brick , and i suppose a modification of the georgian ; the kind of house one still sees in <unk> way corners of london , with a sort of <unk> flavour ; high and square and uncompromising , with <unk> windows , with a flat roof surrounded by a low balustrade , and many substantial chimneys .
the third <unk> was lower than the others , separated from them by a distinct line .
on one side was a wide porch .
yellow and red leaves , the day 's fall , scattered the well-kept lawn .
standing in the doorway of the house was a girl in white , and as we descended from the surrey she came down the walk to meet us .
she was young , about twenty .
her hair was the colour of the russet <name> leaves .
" this is mr. paret , <name> . "
mr. hutchins looked at his watch as does a man accustomed to live by it .
" if you 'll excuse me , mr. paret , i have something important to attend to .
perhaps mr. paret would like to look about the grounds ? "
he addressed his daughter .
i said i should be delighted , though i had no idea what grounds were meant .
as i followed <name> around the house she explained that all the hutchins connection had a common back yard , as she expressed it .
in reality , there were about two blocks of the property , extending behind all the houses .
there were great trees with swings , groves , orchards where the late apples glistened between the leaves , an old-fashioned flower garden loath to relinquish its blooming .
in the distance the shadowed western ridge <name> like a curtain of deep blue <name> against the sunset .
" what a wonderful spot ! "
i exclaimed .
" yes , it is nice , " she agreed , " we were all brought up here  i mean my cousins and myself .
there are dozens of us .
and dozens left , " she added , as the shouts and laughter of children broke the stillness .
a boy came running around the corner of the path .
he struck out at <name> .
with a remarkably swift movement she <unk> .
" ouch ! "
he exclaimed .
" you got him that time , " i laughed , and , being detected , she suddenly blushed .
it was this act that <name> my attention to her , that defined her as an individual .
before that i had regarded her merely as a shy and provincial girl .
now she was brimming with an unsuspected vitality .
a certain interest was aroused , although her shyness towards me was not altered .
i found it rather a flattering shyness .
" it 's <name> , " she explained , " he 's always trying to be funny .
speak to mr. paret , <name> . "
" why , that 's my name , too , " i said .
" is it ? "
" she knocked my hat off a little while ago , " said <name> .
" i was only getting square . "
" well , you did n't get square , did you ? "
i asked .
" are you going to speak in the <unk> hall to-night ? "
the boy demanded .
i admitted it .
he went off , pausing once to stare back at me ... . <name> and i walked on .
" it must be exciting to speak before a large audience , " she said .
" if i were a man , i think i should like to be in politics . "
" i can not imagine you in politics , " i answered .
she laughed .
" i said , if i were a man . "
" are you going to the meeting ? "
" oh , yes .
father promised to take me .
he has a box . "
i thought it would be pleasant to have her there .
" i 'm afraid you 'll find what i have to say rather dry , " i said .
" a woman ca n't expect to understand everything , " she answered quickly .
this remark struck me favourably .
i glanced at her sideways .
she was not a beauty , but she was distinctly well-formed and strong .
her face was oval , her features not quite regular ,  giving them a certain charm ; her colour was fresh , her eyes blue , the lighter blue one sees on chinese ware : not a poetic comparison , but so i thought of them .
she was apparently not sophisticated , as were most of the young women at home whom i knew intimately ( as were the watling twins , for example , with one of whom , <name> , i had had , by the way , rather a lively flirtation the spring before ) ; she seemed <unk> original , <unk> and plastic ... . we walked slowly back to the house , and in the hallway i met mrs. hutchins , a bustling , <unk> <name> , inclined to <unk> , whose creased and kindly face bore witness to long acquiescence in the discipline of matrimony , to the contentment that results from an essentially circumscribed and comfortable life .
she was , i learned later , the second mrs. hutchins , and <name> their only child .
the children of the first marriage , all girls , had married and scattered .
supper was a decorous but heterogeneous meal of the old-fashioned sort that gives one the choice between tea and cocoa .
it was something of an occasion , i suspected .
the minister was there , the reverend mr. <unk> , who would have made , in appearance at least , a perfect puritan divine in a steeple hat and a <unk> .
only  he was no longer the leader of the community ; and even in his <name> he had the air of <unk> to the man who provided the <unk> of which we were about to partake rather than to the almighty .
young <name> was there , mr. hutchins 's nephew , who was daily becoming more and more of a factor in the management of the mills , and had built the house of yellow brick that stood out so <unk> among the older <unk> ' mansions , and marked a transition .
i thought him rather a <unk> gentleman himself for his assumption of cosmopolitan manners .
his wife was a pretty , discontented little woman who plainly deplored her environment , longed for larger fields of conquest : <name> , she said , must remain where he was , for the present at least ,  uncle <name> depended on him ; but elkington was a <unk> place , and mrs. <name> gave the impression that she did not belong here .
they went to the city on occasions ; both cities .
and when she told me we had a common acquaintance in mrs. hambleton durrett  whom she thought so lovely !  i knew that she had taken <name> as an ideal : <name> , the social leader of what was to mrs. <name> a metropolis .
presently the talk became general among the men , the subject being the campaign , and i the authority , bombarded with questions i strove to answer judicially .
what was the situation in this county and in that ?
the national situation ?
<name> indulged in rather a vigorous arraignment of the <unk> , national and state , who were hurting business in order to obtain political power .
the reverend mr. <unk> assented , <unk> the poverty that the local people had brought on themselves by heeding the advice of agitators ; and mrs. hutchins , who spent much of her time in <name> work , agreed with the minister when he declared that the trouble was largely due to a decline in <name> belief .
<name> hutchins , too , nodded at this .
" take that man krebs , for example , " the minister went on , stimulated by this encouragement , " he 's an <unk> , pure and simple . "
a sympathetic shudder went around the table at the word .
<name> alone smiled .
" old krebs was a <unk> ; i used to get my glasses of him .
he was at least a conscientious man , a good workman , which is more than can be said for the son .
young krebs has talent , and if only he had devoted himself to the honest practice of law , instead of stirring up dissatisfaction among these people , he would be a successful man to-day . "
mr. hutchins explained that i was at college with krebs .
" these people must like him , " i said , " or they would n't have sent him to the legislature . "
" well , a good many of them do like him , " the minister admitted .
" you see , he actually lives among them .
they believe his <unk> doctrines because he 's a friend of theirs . "
" he wo n't represent this town again , that 's sure , " exclaimed <name> .
" you did n't see in the papers that he was nominated ,  did you , paret ? "
" but if the mill people wanted him , <name> , how could it be prevented ? "
his wife demanded .
<name> winked at me .
" there are more ways of skinning a cat than one , " he said <unk> .
" well , it 's time to go to the meeting , i guess , " remarked <name> , rising .
once more he looked at his watch .
we were packed into several family carriages and started off .
in front of the hall the inevitable red fire was burning , its quivering light reflected on the faces of the crowd that blocked the street .
they stood silent , strangely <unk> as we pushed through them to the curb , and the red fire went out suddenly as we descended .
my temporary sense of depression , however , deserted me as we entered the hall , which was well lighted and filled with people , who clapped when the hon .
<name> and i , accompanied by mr. <unk> and the hon .
<name> <name> mellish from <unk> , with the local chairman , walked out on the stage .
a glance over the audience sufficed to ascertain that that portion of the population whose dinner pails we longed to fill was evidently not present in large <name> .
but the farmers had driven in from the hills , while the merchants and storekeepers of elkington had turned out loyally .
the chairman , in introducing me , proclaimed me as a coming man , and declared that i had already achieved , in the campaign , considerable notoriety .
as i spoke , i was pleasantly aware of <name> hutchins leaning forward a little across the rail of the right-hand stage box  for the town hall was half <unk> ; her attitude was one of <unk> admiration ; and the thought that i had made an impression on her stimulated me .
i spoke with more <unk> .
somewhat to my surprise , i found myself making occasional , unexpected <unk> that <name> laughter and applause .
suddenly , from the back of the hall , a voice called out :  " how about house <name> 709 ? "
there was a silence , then a stirring and <unk> of necks .
it was my first experience of <unk> , and for the moment i was taken aback .
i thought of krebs .
he had , indeed , been in my mind since i had risen to my feet , and i had scanned the faces before me in search of his .
but it was not his voice .
" well , what about <name> 709 ? "
i demanded .
" you ought to know something about it , i guess , " the voice responded .
" put him out ! "
came from various portions of the hall .
inwardly , i was shaken .
not  in orthodox language from any " conviction of sin . "
yet it was my first intimation that my part in the legislation referred to was known to any save a select few .
i blamed krebs , and a hot anger arose within me against him .
after all , what could they prove ?
" no , do n't put him out , " i said .
" let him come up here to the platform .
i 'll yield to him .
and i 'm entirely willing to discuss with him and defend any measures passed in the legislature of this state by a republican majority .
perhaps , " i added , " the gentleman has a copy of the law in his pocket , that i may know what he is talking about , and answer him intelligently . "
at this there was wild applause .
i had the audience with me .
the offender remained silent and presently i finished my speech .
after that mr. <unk> made them cheer and weep , and mr. mellish made them laugh .
the meeting had been highly successful .
" you polished him off , all right , " said <name> hutchins , as he took my hand .
" who was he ? "
" oh , one of the local <unk> .
krebs put him up to it , of course . "
" was krebs here ? "
i asked .
" sitting in the corner of the balcony .
that meeting must have made him feel sick . "
<name> bent forward and whispered in my ear : " i thought <name> 709 was watling 's idea . "
" oh , i happened to be in the potts house about that time , " i explained .
<name> , of whom it may be gathered that he was not wholly <unk> , grinned at me <unk> .
" say , paret , " he replied , putting his hand through my arm , " there's a little legal business in prospect down here that <name> require some handling , and i wish you 'd come down after the campaign and talk it over , with us .
i 've just about made up my mind that you 're he man to tackle it . "
" all right , i 'll come , " i said .
" and stay with me , " said <name> ... . we went to his <unk> house for refreshments , salad and ice-cream and ( in the face of the hutchins traditions ) champagne .
others had been invited in , some twenty persons ... . once in a while , when i looked up , i met <name> 's eyes across the room .
i walked home with her , slowly , the length of the <unk> ' block .
floating over the lake was a waning october moon that cast through the thinning maples a <unk> of shadows at our feet ; i had the feeling of well-being that comes to heroes , and the presence of <name> hutchins was an incense , a vestal incense far from <unk> .
yet she had reservations which appealed to me .
hers was not a gushing <unk> , like that of mrs. <name> .
" i liked your speech so much , mr. paret , " she told me .
" it seemed so sensible and  controlled , compared to the others .
i have never thought a great deal about these things , of course , and i never understood before why taking away the tariff caused so much misery .
you made that quite plain .
" if so , i 'm glad , " i said .
she was silent a moment .
" the working people here have had a hard time during the last year , " she went on .
" some of the mills had to be shut down , you know .
it has troubled me .
indeed , it has troubled all of us .
and what has made it more difficult , more painful is that many of them seem actually to dislike us .
they think it 's father 's fault , and that he could run all the mills if he wanted to .
i 've been around a little with mother and sometimes the women would n't accept any help from us ; they said they'd rather starve than take <name> , that they had the right to work .
but father could n't run the mills at a loss  could he ? "
" certainly not , " i replied .
" and then there 's mr. krebs , of whom we were speaking at supper , and who puts all kinds of queer notions into their heads .
father says he 's an <unk> .
i heard father say at supper that he was at harvard with you .
did you like him ? "
" well , " i answered hesitatingly , " i did n't know him very well . "
" of course not , " she put in .
" i suppose you could n't have . "
" he 's got these notions , " i explained , " that are mischievous and crazy  but i do n't dislike him . "
" i 'm glad to hear you say that ! "
she answered quietly .
" i like him , too  he seems so kind , so understanding . "
" do you know him ? "
" well ,  " she hesitated  " i feel as though i do .
i 've only met him once , and that was by accident .
it was the day the big strike began , last spring , and i had been shopping , and started for the mills to get father to walk home with me , as i used to do .
i saw the crowds blocking the streets around the canal .
at first i paid no attention to them , but after a while i began to be a little uneasy , there were places where i had to squeeze through , and i could n't help seeing that something was wrong , and that the people were angry .
men and women were talking in loud voices .
one woman stared at me , and called my name , and said something that frightened me terribly .
i went into a doorway  and then i saw mr. krebs .
i did n't know who he was .
he just said , 'you 'd better come with me , miss hutchins , ' and i went with him .
i thought afterwards that it was a very courageous thing for him to do , because he was so popular with the mill people , and they had such a feeling against us .
yet they did n't seem to resent it , and made way for us , and mr. krebs spoke to many of them as we passed .
after we got to state street , i asked him his name , and when he told me i was speechless .
he took off his hat and went away .
he had such a nice face  not at all ugly when you look at it twice  and kind eyes , that i just could n't believe him to be as bad as father and <name> think he is .
of course he is mistaken , " she added hastily , " but i am sure he is sincere , and honestly thinks he can help those people by telling them what he does . "
the question shot at me during the meeting <unk> still ; i wanted to believe that krebs had inspired it , and her championship of him gave me a twinge of jealousy ,  the slightest twinge , to be sure , yet a perceptible one .
at the same time , the unaccountable liking i had for the man stirred to life .
the act she described had been so characteristic .
" he 's one of the born rebels against society , " i said glibly .
" yet i do think he 's sincere . "
<name> was grave .
" i should be sorry to think he was n't , " she replied .
after i had bidden her good night at the foot of the stairs , and gone to my room , i reflected how absurd it was to be jealous of krebs .
what was <name> hutchins to me ?
and even if she had been something to me , she never could be anything to krebs .
all the forces of our civilization stood between the two ; nor was she of a nature to take plunges of that sort .
the next day , as i lay back in my seat in the <unk> and gazed at the autumn landscape , i indulged in a luxurious contemplation of the picture she had made as she stood on the lawn under the trees in the early morning light , when my carriage had driven away ; and i had turned , to perceive that her eyes had followed me .
i was not in love with her , of course .
i did not wish to return at once to elkington , but i dwelt with a pleasant anticipation upon my visit , when the campaign should be over , with <name> .
xiii .
" the good old days of the watling campaign , " as colonel <name> varney is wont to call them , are gone forever .
and the colonel himself , who stuck to his gods , has been through the burning , fiery furnace of investigation , and has come out unscathed and <unk> .
the flames of investigation , as a matter of fact , passed over his head in their vain attempt to reach the " man higher up , " whose feet they licked ; but him they did not devour , either .
a veteran in retirement , the colonel is living under his vine and fig tree on the lake at <unk> ; the vine bears <unk> grapes , of which he is passionately fond ; the fig tree , the bartlett pears he gives to his friends .
he has saved something from the spoils of war , but other veterans i could mention are not so fortunate .
the old warriors have retired , and many are dead ; the good old methods are becoming obsolete .
we never bothered about those mischievous things called primaries .
our county committees , our state committees chose the candidates for the conventions , which turned around and chose the committees .
both the committees and the conventions  under advice  chose the candidates .
why , pray , should the people complain , when they had everything done for them ?
the benevolent parties , both democratic and republican , even undertook the expense of printing the ballots !
and generous ballots they were ( twenty inches long and five wide !
) , distributed before election , in order that the voters might have the opportunity of studying and preparing them : in order that democrats of delicate feelings might take the pains to scratch out all the democratic candidates , and write in the names of the republican candidates .
patriotism could go no farther than this ... .
i spent the week before election in the city , where i had the opportunity of observing what may be called the charitable side of politics .
for a whole month , or more , the burden of existence had been lifted from the shoulders of the homeless .
no church or organization , looked out for these <unk> , <unk> and ragged wanderers who had failed to find a place in the scale of efficiency .
for a whole month , i say , mr. judd <name> and his lieutenants made them their especial care ; supported them in <unk> , induced the night clerks to give them attention ; took the greatest pains to ensure them the <unk> which , as american citizens , was theirs ,  that of voting .
they were not only given homes for a period , but they were registered ; and in the abundance of good feeling that reigned during this time of cheer , even the foreigners were registered !
on election day they were driven , like visiting <unk> , in <unk> and carriages to the polls !
some of them , as though in compensation for ills endured between elections , voted not once , but many times ; exercising judicial functions for which they should be given credit .
for instance , they were convinced that the hon .
w. w. <unk> had made a good governor ; and they were watling <unk> ,  intent on sending men to the legislature who would vote for him for senator ; yet there were cases in which , for the minor offices , the democrat was the better man !
it was a memorable day .
in spite of mr. <unk> 's pilot , which was as a voice crying in the wilderness , citizens who had wives and homes and responsibilities , business men and clerks went to the voting booths and recorded their choice for <unk> , watling and prosperity : and <unk> followed suit .
victory was in the air .
even the policemen wore happy smiles , and in some instances the election officers themselves in absent-minded exuberance thrust bunches of ballots into the boxes !
in response to an insistent demand from his fellow-citizens mr. watling , the saturday evening before , had made a speech in the <unk> , decked with bunting and filled with people .
for once the morning <name> did not exaggerate when it declared that the ovation had lasted fully ten minutes .
" a remarkable proof " it went on to say , " of the esteem and confidence in which our <unk> is held by those who know him best , his neighbours in the city where he has given so many instances of his public spirit , where he has achieved such distinction in the practice of the law .
he holds the sound american conviction that the office should seek the man .
his address is printed in another column , and we believe it <name> appeal to the intelligence and sober judgment of the state .
it is replete with modesty and wisdom . "
mr. watling was introduced by mr. bering of the state supreme court ( a candidate for <unk> ) , who spoke with deliberation , with <unk> impressiveness .
he did n't believe in judges meddling in politics , but this was an unusual occasion .
( loud applause . )
most unusual .
he had come here as a man , as an american , to pay his tribute to another man , a <unk> friend , whom he thought to stand somewhat aside and above mere party strife , to represent values not merely political ... .
so accommodating and flexible is the human mind , so " practical " may it become through dealing with men and affairs , that in listening to judge bering i was able to ignore the little anomalies such a situation might have suggested to the <unk> , to the mere student of the institutions of democracy .
the friendly glasses of rye and water mr. bering had taken in <unk> 's saloon , the cases he had " arranged " for the firm of watling , fowndes and ripon were forgotten .
forgotten , too , when <name> watling stood up and men began , to throw their hats in the air ,  were the <unk> charges of mr. <unk> 's pilot that , far from the office seeking the man , our candidate had spent over a hundred thousand dollars of his own money , to say nothing of the contributions of mr. scherer , mr. dickinson and the railroad !
if i had been troubled with any weak , ethical doubts , mr. watling would have dispelled them ; he had red blood in his veins , a creed in which he believed , a rare power of expressing himself in plain , everyday language that was often <unk> , but never  as the saying goes  " cheap . "
the <unk> predicament was real to him .
he would present a policy of our opponents charmingly , even <unk> , and then add , after a moment 's pause : " there is only one objection to this , my friends  that it does n't work . "
it was all in the way he said it , of course .
the audience would go wild with approval , and shouts of " that 's right " could be heard here and there .
then he proceeded to show why it did n't work .
he had the faculty of bringing his lessons home , the imagination to put himself into the daily life of those who listened to him ,  the life of the storekeeper , the clerk , of the <unk> and of the <unk> .
the effect of this can scarcely be <unk> .
for the american <unk> the delusion that there are no class distinctions , even though his whole existence may be an effort to rise out of once class into another .
" your wife , " he told them once , " needs a dress .
let us admit that the material for the dress is a little cheaper than it was four years ago , but when she comes to look into the family stocking  " ( laughter . )
" i need n't go on .
if we could have things cheaper , and more money to buy them with , we should all be happy , and the republican party could retire from business . "
he did not once refer to the united states <unk> .
it was appropriate , perhaps , that many of us dined on the evening of election day at the boyne club .
there was early evidence of a republican <unk> .
and when , at ten o'clock , it was announced that mr. <unk> was <unk> by a majority which exceeded mr. <unk> 's most hopeful estimate , that the legislature was " safe , " that <name> watling would be the next united states senator , a scene of <unk> ensued within those hallowed walls which was unprecedented .
chairs were pushed back , rugs taken up , <name> hollister played the piano and a <name> reel started ; in a burst of enthusiasm <name> dickinson ordered champagne for every member present .
the country was returning to its senses .
<name> watling had preferred , on this eventful night , to remain quietly at home .
but presently carriages were ordered , and a " delegation " of enthusiastic friends departed to congratulate him ; dickinson , of course , grierson , fowndes , ogilvy , and <unk> .
we found judah b. tallant there ,  in spite of the fact that it was a busy night for the <name> ; and adolf scherer himself , in expansive mood , was filling the largest of the library chairs .
mr. watling was the least excited of them all ; remarkably calm , i thought , for a man on the verge of realizing his life 's high ambition .
he had some old <name> , and a box of cigars he had been saving for an occasion .
he managed to convey to everyone his appreciation of the value of their <unk> ... .
it was midnight before mr. scherer arose to take his departure .
he seized mr. watling 's hand , warmly , in both of his own .
" i have never , " he said , with a relapse into the <name> f 's , " i have never had a happier moment in my life , my friend , than when i congratulate you on your success . "
his voice shook with emotion .
" alas , we shall not see so much of you now . "
" he 'll be on guard , scherer , " said <name> dickinson , putting his arm around my chief .
" good night , senator , " said tallant , and all echoed the word , which struck me as peculiarly appropriate .
much as i had admired mr. watling before , it seemed indeed as if he had undergone some subtle change in the last few hours , gained in dignity and greatness by the action of the people that day .
when it came my turn to bid him good night , he retained my hand in his .
" do n't go yet , <name> , " he said .
" but you must be tired , " i objected .
" this sort of thing does n't make a man tired , " he laughed , leading me back to the library , where he began to poke the fire into a blaze .
" sit down awhile .
you must be tired , i think ,  you 've worked hard in this campaign , a good deal harder than i have .
i have n't said much about it , but i appreciate it , my boy . "
mr. watling had the gift of expressing his feelings naturally , without sentimentality .
i would have given much for that gift .
" oh , i liked it , " i replied awkwardly .
i read a gentle amusement in his eyes , and also the expression of something else , difficult to define .
he had seated himself , and was absently thrusting at the logs with the poker .
" you 've never regretted going into law ? "
he asked suddenly , to my surprise .
" why , no , sir , " i said .
" i 'm glad to hear that .
i feel , to a considerable extent , responsible for your choice of a profession . "
" my father intended me to be a lawyer , " i told him .
" but it 's true that you gave me my  my first enthusiasm . "
he looked up at me at the word .
" i admired your father .
he seemed to me to be everything that a lawyer should be .
and years ago , when i came to this city a raw country boy from <unk> , he represented and embodied for me all the fine traditions of the profession .
but the practice of law is n't what it was in his day , <name> . "
" no , " i agreed , " that could scarcely be expected . "
" yes , i believe you realize that , " he said .
" i 've watched you , i've taken a personal pride in you , and i have an idea that eventually you <name> succeed me here  neither fowndes nor ripon have the peculiar ability you have shown .
you and i are alike in a great many respects , and i am inclined to think we are rather rare , as men go .
we are able to keep one object vividly in view , so vividly as to be able to work for it day and night .
i could mention dozens who had and have more natural talent for the law than i , more talent for politics than i .
the same thing may be said about you .
i do n't regard either of us as natural lawyers , such as your father was .
he could n't help being a lawyer . "
here was new evidence of his <unk> .
" but surely , " i ventured , " you do n't feel any regrets concerning your career , mr .
watling ? "
" no , " he said , " that 's just the point .
but no two of us are made wholly alike .
i had n't practised law very long before i began to realize that conditions were changing , that the new forces at work in our industrial life made the older legal ideals impracticable .
it was a case of choosing between efficiency and inefficiency , and i chose efficiency .
well , that was my own affair , but when it comes to influencing others  " he paused .
" i want you to see this as i do , not for the sake of <unk> myself , but because i honestly believe there is more to it than expediency ,  a good deal more .
there 's a weak way of looking at it , and a strong way .
and if i feel sure you understand it , i shall be satisfied .
" because things are going to change in this country , <name> .
they are changing , but they are going to change more .
a man has got to make up his mind what he believes in , and be ready to fight for it .
we 'll have to fight for it , sooner perhaps than we realize .
we are a nation divided against ourselves ; democracy  <unk> democracy , at all events , is a flat failure , and we may as well acknowledge it .
we have a political system we have <unk> , and which , therefore , we have had to <unk> .
there are certain needs , certain tendencies of development in nations as well as in individuals ,  needs stronger than the state , stronger than the law or constitution .
in order to make our resources effective , combinations of capital are more and more necessary , and no more to be denied than a chemical process , given the proper ingredients , can be thwarted .
the men who control capital must have a free hand , or the structure <name> be destroyed .
this compels us to do many things which we would rather not do , which we might accomplish openly and <unk> if conditions were frankly recognized , and met by wise statesmanship which sought to bring about <name> by the <unk> of laws and policies .
do you follow me ? "
" yes , " i answered .
" but i have never heard the situation stated so clearly .
do you think the day <name> come when statesmanship <name> recognize this need ? "
" ah , " he said , " i 'm afraid not  in my time , at least .
but we shall have to develop that kind of statesmen or go on the rocks .
public opinion in the old democratic sense is a myth ; it must be made by strong individuals who recognize and represent <unk> needs , otherwise it 's at the <name> of <unk> who play fast and loose with the prejudice and ignorance of the mob .
the people do n't value the vote , they know nothing about the real problems .
so far as i can see , they are as easily swayed to-day as the crowd that listened to <name> <unk> oration about caesar .
you 've seen how we have to handle them , in this election and  in other matters .
it is n't a pleasant practice , something we 'd indulge in out of choice , but the alternative is unthinkable .
we'd have chaos in no time .
we 've just got to keep hold , you understand  we ca n't leave it to the irresponsible . "
" yes , " i said .
in this mood he was more impressive than i had ever known him , and his confidence flattered and thrilled me .
" in the meantime , we 're criminals , " he continued .
" from now on we'll have to stand more and more denunciation from the <unk> , the dissatisfied , the trouble makers .
we may as well make up our minds to it .
but we 've got something on our side worth fighting for , and the man who is able to make that clear <name> be great . "
" but you  you are going to the senate , " i reminded him .
he shook his head .
" the time has not yet come , " he said .
" confusion and misunderstanding must increase before they can diminish .
but i have hopes of you , <name> , or i should n't have spoken .
i <name> n't be here now  of course i 'll keep in touch with you .
i wanted to be sure that you had the right view of this thing . "
" i see it now , " i said .
" i had thought of it , but never  never as a whole  not in the large sense in which you have expressed it . "
to attempt to acknowledge or <unk> the compliment he had paid me was impossible ; i felt that he must have read my gratitude and appreciation in my manner .
" i must n't keep you up until morning . "
he glanced at the clock , and went with me through the hall into the open air .
a meteor darted through the november night .
" we 're like that , " he observed , staring after it , a " flash across the darkness , and we 're gone . "
" only  there are many who have n't the satisfaction of a flash , " i was moved to reply .
he laughed and put his hand on my shoulder as he bade me good night .
" <name> , you ought to get married .
i 'll have to find a nice girl for you , " he said .
with an elation not <unk> with awe i made my way homeward .
<name> watling had given me a creed .
a week or so after the election i received a letter from <name> hutchins asking me to come to elkington .
i shall not enter into the details of the legal matter involved .
many times that <name> i was a guest at the <unk> house , and i have to confess , as spring came on , that i made several trips to elkington which business necessity did not absolutely demand .
i considered <name> hutchins , and found the consideration rather a delightful process .
as became an eligible and successful young man , i was careful not to betray too much interest ; and i occupied myself at first with a review of what i deemed her shortcomings .
not that i was thinking of marriage  but i had imagined the future mrs. paret as tall ; <name> was up to my <name> : again , the hair of the fortunate <name> was to be dark , and <name> 's was golden red : my ideal had <unk> , lightness of touch , the faculty of seizing just the aspect of a subject that delighted me , and a knowledge of the world ; <name> was simple , direct , and in a word provincial .
her <unk> , however , was negative rather than positive , she had no disagreeable <unk> , her voice was not nasal ; her <unk> appealed to me .
i suppose i was lost without knowing it when i began to think of <unk> her .
all of this went on at frequent intervals during the <name> , and while i was organizing the elkington power and traction company for <name> i found time to dine and sup at <name> 's house , and to take walks with her .
i thought i detected an incense deliciously sweet ; by no means overpowering , like the <name> 's , but more like the shy fragrance of the wood flower .
i recall her kind <unk> , the faint deepening of colour in her cheeks when she greeted me , and while i suspected that she looked up to me she had a surprising and tantalizing self-command .
there came moments when i grew slightly alarmed , as , for instance , one <name> in the early spring when i was dining at the <name> <unk> house and surprised mrs. hutchins 's glance on me , suspecting her of seeking to divine what manner of man i was .
i became self-conscious ; i dared not look at <name> , who sat across the table ; thereafter i began to feel that the hutchins connection regarded me as a suitor .
i had grown intimate with <name> and his wife , who did not refrain from sly allusions ; and <name> himself once remarked , with characteristic tact , that i was most conscientious in my attention to the traction affair ; i have reason to believe they were even less delicate with <name> .
this was the logical time to withdraw  but i <unk> .
the experience was becoming more <unk> ,  if i may so describe it ,  and spring was approaching .
the stars in their courses were <unk> .
i was by no means as yet a <unk> <unk> , and we discussed love in its lighter phases through the medium of literature .
heaven forgive me for calling it so !
about that period , it <name> be remembered , a mushroom growth of volumes of a certain kind sprang into existence ; little books with " artistic " <unk> and wide margins , sweetened essays , some of them written in beautiful english by <unk> authors for drawing-room consumption ; and collections of short stories , no doubt chiefly bought by <unk> like myself , who were thus enabled to skate on thin ice over deep water .
it was a most delightful relationship that these helped to support , and i fondly believed i could reach shore again whenever i chose .
there came a <name> in early may , one of those days when the feminine assumes a large importance .
i had been to the <unk> ' church ; and <name> , as she sat and prayed <unk> in the pew beside me , suddenly increased in attractiveness and <unk> .
her voice was very sweet , and i felt a delicious and <unk> thrill which i identified not only with love , but also with a reviving <unk> .
how often the two seem to go hand in hand !
she wore a dress of a filmy material , <unk> , with a design in gold thread running through it .
of late , it seemed , she had had more new dresses : and their modes seemed more cosmopolitan ; at least to the masculine eye .
how delicately her hair grew , in little , shining <unk> , around her white neck !
i could have reached out my hand and touched her .
and it was this <name> ,  although by no means overwhelming ,  that startled me .
did i really want her ?
the consideration of this vital question occupied the whole time of the sermon ; made me <unk> at dinner ,  a large family gathering .
later i found myself alone with heron a bench in the <unk> ' garden where we had walked the day of my arrival , during the campaign .
the gardens were very different , now .
the trees had burst forth again into leaf , the <unk> bushes seemed weighted down with snow , and with a note like that of the quivering bass string of a <unk> the bees hummed among the fruit blossoms .
and there beside me in her filmy dress was <name> , a part of it all  the meaning of all that set my being clamouring .
she was like some ripened , delicious flower ready to be picked ... . one of those pernicious , make-believe volumes had fallen on the bench between us , for i could not read any more ; i could not think ; i touched her hand , and when she <name> it gently away i glanced at her .
reason made a valiant but hopeless effort to assert itself .
was i sure that i wanted her  for life ?
no use !
i wanted her now , no matter what price that future might demand .
an awkward silence fell between us  awkward to me , at least  and i , her guide and mentor , became <unk> , apologetic , confused .
i made some idiotic remark about being together in the garden of <name> .
" i remember mr. <unk> saying in bible class that it was supposed to be on the euphrates , " she replied .
" but it 's been destroyed by the flood . "
" let 's make another  one of our own , " i suggested .
" why , how silly you are this afternoon . "
" what 's to prevent us  <name> ? "
i demanded , with a dry throat .
" nonsense ! "
she laughed .
in proportion as i lost poise she seemed to gain it .
" it 's not nonsense , " i faltered .
" if we were married . "
at last the fateful words were pronounced  irrevocably .
and , instead of <unk> , i felt nothing but relief , <name> that i had been swept along by the flood of feeling .
she did not look at me , but gazed straight ahead of her .
" if i love you , <name> ? "
i stammered , after a moment .
" but i do n't love you , " she replied , steadily .
never in my life had i been so utterly taken aback .
" do you mean , " i managed to say , " that after all these months you don't like me a little ? "
" <unk> ' is n't loving . "
she looked me full in the face .
" i like you very much . "
" but  " there i stopped , paralyzed by what appeared to me the <unk> of feminine inconsistency and <name> .
yet , as i stared at her , she certainly did not appear capricious .
it is not too much to say that i was fairly astounded at this evidence of self-command and decision , of the strength of mind to refuse me .
was it possible that she had felt nothing and i all ?
i got to my feet .
" i hate to hurt your feelings , " i heard her say .
" i 'm very sorry . " ...
she looked up at me .
afterwards , when reflecting on the scene , i seemed to remember that there were tears in her eyes .
i was not in a condition to appreciate her splendid sincerity .
i was overwhelmed and inarticulate .
i left her there , on the bench , and went back to <name> 's , announcing my intention of taking the five o'clock train ... . <name> hutchins had become , at a stroke , the most desirable of women .
i have often wondered how i should have felt on that <unk> journey back to the city if she had fallen into my arms !
i should have persuaded myself , no doubt , that i had not done a foolish thing in yielding to an impulse and proposing to an inexperienced and provincial young woman , yet there would have been regrets in the background .
too deeply chagrined to see any humour in the situation , i settled down in a pullman seat and went over and over again the event of that afternoon until the train reached the city .
as the days wore on , and i attended to my cases , i thought of <name> a great deal , and in those moments when the pressure of business was relaxed , she <unk> me .
she must love me ,  only she did not realize it .
that was the secret !
her value had risen amazingly , become supreme ; the very act of refusing me had emphasized her qualifications as a wife , and i now desired her with all the intensity of a nature which had been permitted always to achieve its objects .
the inevitable process of <unk> began .
in <name> offices i recalled her freshness as she had sat beside me in the garden ,  the freshness of a flower ; with <unk> <unk> i clothed the flower with colour , bestowed it with fragrance .
i conferred on <name> all the gifts and graces that woman had possessed since the creation .
and i recalled , with mingled bitterness and tenderness , the turn of her head , the down on her neck , the <unk> curve of her arm ... .
in spite of the growing sordidness of <unk> street , my mother and i still lived in the old house , for which she very naturally had a sentiment .
in vain i had urged her from time to time to move out into a brighter and fresher neighbourhood .
it would be time enough , she said , when i was married .
" if you wait for that , mother , " i answered , " we shall spend the rest of our lives here . "
" i shall spend the rest of my life here , " she would declare .
" but you  you have your life before you , my dear .
you would be so much more contented if  if you could find some nice girl .
i think you live  too feverishly . "
i do not know whether or not she suspected me of being in love , nor indeed how much she read of me in other ways .
i did not confide in her , nor did it strike me that she might have yearned for confidences ; though sometimes , when i dined at home , i surprised her gentle face  framed now with white hair  lifted wistfully toward me across the table .
our relationship , indeed , was a pathetic projection of that which had existed in my childhood ; we had never been <unk> then .
the world in which i lived and fought , of great transactions and merciless consequences frightened her ; her own world was more limited than ever .
she heard disquieting things , i am sure , from cousin <name> breck , who had become more and more <unk> since the <unk> firm of breck and company had been forced to close its doors and the home at <unk> had been sold .
my mother often spent the day in the <unk> suburban cottage with the coloured glass front door where he lived with the <unk> and <name> ... .
if my mother suspected that i was anticipating marriage , and said nothing , <name> durrett suspected and spoke out .
life is such a curious succession of contradictions and surprises that i record here without comment the fact that i was seeing much more of <name> since her marriage than i had in the years preceding it .
a comradeship existed between us .
i often dined at her house and had fallen into the habit of stopping there frequently on my way home in the evening .
ham did not seem to mind .
what was clear , at any rate , was that <name> , before marriage , had exacted some sort of an understanding by which her " freedom " was not to be interfered with .
she was the first among us of the " modern wives . "
ham , whose <unk> and <unk> were oddly <unk> , had stipulated that they were to occupy the old durrett mansion ; but when <name> had made it " <unk> , " as she expressed it , he is said to have remarked that he might as well have built a new house and been done with it .
not even old <name> himself would have recognized his home when <name> finished what she termed furnishing : out went the horsehair , the hideous chandeliers , the stuffy books , the <unk> statuary , and an army of <unk> , <unk> , etc. , from boston and new york invaded the place .
the old mahogany doors were spared , but matched now by <unk> and <unk> ; the new , polished floors were covered with oriental rugs , the dreary durrett pictures replaced by good canvases and tapestries .
<name> had what amounted to a genius for interior effects , and she was the first to introduce among us the luxury that was to grow more and more prevalent as our wealth increased by leaps and bounds .
only <name> 's luxury , though lavish , was never vulgar , and her house when completed had rather marvellously the fine distinction of some old london mansion filled with the best that generations could contribute .
it left mrs. <name> grierson  whose residence on the heights had hitherto been our " grandest "  breathless with despair .
with characteristic audacity <name> had chosen old <name> 's sanctum for her particular salon , into which ham himself did not dare to venture without invitation .
it was <name> in <unk> red and had a little <unk> balcony projecting over the yard , now transformed by an expert into a garden .
when i had first entered this room after the metamorphosis had taken place i inquired after the tombstone mantel .
" oh , i 've pulled it up by the roots , " she said .
" are n't you afraid of ghosts ? "
i inquired .
" do i look it ? "
she asked .
and i confessed that she did n't .
indeed , all ghosts were laid , nor was there about her the slightest evidence of mourning or regret .
one was forced to acknowledge her perfection in the part she had chosen as the <unk> of social honours .
the candidates were rapidly increasing ; almost every month , it seemed , someone turned up with a fortune and the aspirations that go with it , and it was mrs. durrett who decided the delicate question of fitness .
with these , and with the world at large , her manner might best be described as difficult ; and i was often amused at the way in which she contrived to keep them at arm 's length and make them uncomfortable .
with her intimates  of whom there were few  she was <name> .
" i suppose you enjoy it , " i said to her once .
" of course i enjoy it , or i should n't do it , " she retorted .
" it isn't the real thing , as i told you once .
but none of us gets the real thing .
it 's power ... . just as you enjoy what you 're doing  sorting out the unfit .
it 's a game , it keeps us from brooding over things we ca n't help .
and after all , when we have good appetites and are fairly happy , why should we complain ? "
" i 'm not complaining , " i said , taking up a cigarette , " since i still enjoy your favour . "
she regarded me curiously .
" and when you get married , <name> ? "
" sufficient unto the day , " i replied .
" how shall i get along , i wonder , with that simple and <unk> <name> when she appears ? "
" well , " i said , " you would n't marry me . "
she shook her head at me , and smiled ... . " no , " she corrected me , " you like me better as hams ' wife than you would have as your own . "
i merely laughed at this remark ... .
it would indeed have been difficult to analyze the new relationship that had sprung up between us , to say what elements composed it .
the roots of it went back to the beginning of our lives ; and there was much of sentiment in it , no doubt .
she understood me as no one else in the world understood me , and she was fond of me in spite of it .
hence , when i became infatuated with <name> hutchins , after that <name> when she so unexpectedly had refused me , i might have known that <unk> suspicions would be aroused .
she startled me by accusing me , out of a clear sky , of being in love .
i denied it a little too emphatically .
" why should n't you tell me , <name> , if it 's so ? "
she asked .
" i didn't hesitate to tell you . "
it was just before her departure for the east to spend the summer .
we were on the balcony , shaded by the big <name> that grew at the end of the garden .
" but there 's nothing to tell , " i insisted .
she lay back in her chair , regarding me .
" did you think that i 'd be jealous ? "
" there 's nothing to be jealous about . "
" i 've always expected you to get married , <name> .
i 've even predicted the type . "
she had , in truth , with an accuracy almost uncanny .
" the only thing i 'm afraid of is that she wo n't like me .
she lives in that place you 've been going to so much , lately ,  does n't she ? "
of course she had put two and two together , my visits to elkington and my manner , which i had flattered myself had not been <unk> .
on the chance that she knew more , from some source , i changed my tactics .
" i suppose you mean <name> hutchins , " i said .
<name> laughed .
" so that 's her name ! "
" it 's the name of a girl in elkington .
i 've been doing legal work for the <unk> , and i imagine some idiot has been gossiping .
she 's just a young girl  much too young for me . "
" men are queer creatures , " she declared .
" did you think i should be jealous ? "
it was exactly what i had thought , but i denied it .
" why should you be  even if there were anything to be jealous about ?
you did n't consult me when you got married .
you merely announced an <unk> decision . "
<name> leaned forward and laid her hand on my arm .
" my dear , " she said , " strange as it may seem , i want you to be happy .
i do n't want you to make a mistake , <name> , too great a mistake . "
i was surprised and moved .
once more i had a momentary glimpse of the real <name> ... . our conversation was interrupted by the arrival of <name> hambleton ... . xiv .
however , thoughts of <name> continued to possess me .
she still appeared the most desirable of beings , and a fortnight after my repulse , without any excuse at all , i telegraphed the <name> <unk> that i was coming to pay them a visit .
mrs. <name> , wearing a knowing smile , met me at the station in a light <unk> .
" i 've asked <name> to dinner , " she said ... .
thus with masculine directness i returned to the charge , and <unk> continued resistance but increased my ardour ; could not see why she continued to resist me .
" because i do n't love you , " she said .
this was incredible .
i suggested that she did n't know what love was , and she admitted it was possible : she liked me very , very much .
i told her , <unk> , that this was the best foundation for matrimony .
that might be , but she had had other ideas .
for one thing , she felt that she did not know me ... .
in short , she was charming and maddening in her defensive <unk> , in her advances and retreats , for i pressed her hard during the four weeks which followed , and in them made four visits .
flinging caution to the winds , i did not even pretend to <name> that i was coming to see him on business .
i had the hutchins family on my side , for they had the sense to see that the match would be an advantageous one ; i even summoned up enough courage to talk to <name> hutchins on the subject .
" i 'll not attempt to influence <name> , mr. paret  i 've always said i would n't interfere with her choice .
but as you are a young man of sound habits , sir , successful in your profession , i should raise no objection .
i suppose we ca n't keep her always . "
to conceal his emotion , he pulled out the watch he lived by .
" why , it's church time ! "
he said ... .
i attended church regularly at elkington ... . on a <name> night in <name> , following a day during which victory seemed more distant than ever , with startling <unk> <name> <unk> .
she sat beside me on the bench , obscured , yet the warm night quivered with her presence .
i felt her tremble ... .
i remember the first exquisite touch of her soft cheek .
how strange it was that in conquest the tumult of my being should be stilled , that my passion should be <unk> into awe that thrilled yet <unk> !
what had i done ?
it was as though i had suddenly entered an <unk> sanctuary filled with holy flame ... .
presently , when we began to talk , i found myself seeking more familiar levels .
i asked her why she had so long resisted me , accusing her of having loved me all the time .
" yes , i think i did , <name> .
only  i did n't know it . "
" you must have felt something , that afternoon when i first proposed to you ! "
" you did n't really want me , <name> .
not then . "
surprised , and a little uncomfortable at this evidence of intuition , i started to protest .
it seemed to me then as though i had always wanted her .
" no , no , " she exclaimed , " you did n't .
you were carried away by your feelings  you had n't made up your mind .
indeed , i ca n't see why you want me now . "
" you believe i do , " i said , and <name> her toward me .
" yes , i  i believe it , now .
but i ca n't see why .
there must be so many attractive girls in the city , who know so much more than i do . "
i sought <unk> to reassure her on this point ... . at length when we went into the house she <name> away from me at arm 's length and gave me one long searching look , as though seeking to read my soul .
" <name> , you <name> always love me  to the very end , wo n't you ? "
" yes , " i whispered , " always . "
in the library , one on each side of the table , under the lamp , <name> hutchins and his wife sat reading .
mrs. hutchins looked up , and i saw that she had divined .
" mother , i am engaged to <name> , " <name> said , and bent over and kissed her .
<name> and i stood gazing at them .
then he turned to me and pressed my hand .
" well , i never saw the man who was good enough for her , <name> .
but god bless you , my son .
i <name> you <name> prize her as we prize her . "
mrs. hutchins embraced me .
and through her tears she , too , looked long into my face .
when she had released me <name> had his watch in his hand .
" if you 're going on the ten o'clock train , <name>  " " father ! "
<name> protested , laughing , " i must say i do n't call that very polite . " ...
in the train i slept but fitfully , awakening again and again to recall the extraordinary fact that i was now engaged to be married , to go over the incidents of the evening .
indifferent to the <unk> and the <unk> of the car , the voices in the stations , the clanging of locomotive bells and all the incomprehensible <unk> and <unk> , exalted yet troubled i beheld <name> luminous with the love i had amazingly awakened , a love somewhere beyond my comprehension .
for her indeed marriage was made in heaven .
but for me ?
could i rise now to the ideal that had once been mine , thrust henceforth evil out of my life ?
love forever , live always in this sanctuary she had made for me ?
would the time come when i should feel a sense of bondage ? ...
the wedding was set for the end of <name> .
i continued to go every week to elkington , and in <name> , <name> and i spent a fortnight at the sea .
there could be no doubt as to my mother 's happiness , as to her approval of <name> ; they loved each other from the beginning .
i can picture them now , sitting together with their sewing on the porch of the cottage at <unk> .
out on the bay little <unk> danced in the sunlight , <unk> tacked hither and thither , the strong cape breeze , laden with <unk> salt , stirred <name> 's hair , and occasionally played havoc with my papers .
" she is just the wife for you , <name> , " my mother confided to me .
" if i had chosen her myself i could not have done better , " she added , with a smile .
i was inclined to believe it , but <name> would have none of this illusion .
" he just stumbled across me , " she insisted ... . we went on long sails together , towards wood 's hole and the open sea , the <unk> washing over us .
her cheeks grew tanned ... .
sometimes , when i praised her and spoke confidently of our future , she wore a troubled expression .
" what are you thinking about ? "
i asked her once .
" you must n't put me on a pedestal , " she said gently .
" i want you to see me as i am  i do n't want you to wake up some day and be disappointed .
i 'll have to learn a lot of things , and you 'll have to teach me .
i can't get used to the fact that you , who are so practical and successful in business , should be such a dreamer where i am concerned . "
i laughed , and told her , comfortably , that she was talking nonsense .
" what did you think of me , when you first knew me ? "
i inquired .
" well , " she answered , with the courage that characterized her , " i thought you were rather calculating , that you put too high a price on success .
of course you attracted me .
i own it . "
" you hid your opinions rather well , " i retorted , somewhat discomfited .
she flushed .
" have you changed them ? "
i demanded .
" i think you have that side , and i think it a weak side , <name> .
it 's hard to tell you this , but it 's better to say so now , since you ask me .
i do think you set too high a value on success . '
" well , now that i know what success really is , perhaps i shall reform , " i told her .
" i do n't like to think that you fool yourself , " she replied , with a <unk> i should have found extraordinary .
throughout my life there have been days and incidents , some trivial , some important , that linger in my memory because they are saturated with " atmosphere . "
i recall , for instance , a <name> occasion in youth when my mother gave one of her luncheon parties ; on my return from school , the house and its surroundings wore a mysterious , exciting and unfamiliar look , somehow changed by the simple fact that guests sat <unk> chatting in a dining-room shining with my mother 's best linen and treasured family silver and <name> .
the atmosphere of my <unk> is no less vivid .
the house of <name> hutchins was scarcely recognizable : its doors and windows were opened wide , and all the morning people were being escorted upstairs to an <unk> room that contained a collection like a <unk> 's exhibit ,  a bewildering display .
there was a massive <unk> from which dangled the card of mr. and mrs. adolf scherer , a really wonderful tea set of old english silver given by senator and mrs. watling , and <name> willett , with her certainty of good taste , had sent an old english <unk> of the time of the second <name> .
the secret was in that room .
and it magically transformed for me ( as i stood , momentarily alone , in the doorway where i had first beheld <name> ) the accustomed scene , and charged with <unk> significance the blue shadows under the heavy foliage of the maples .
the <name> sunlight was heavy , tinged with gold ... .
so fragmentary and confused are the events of that day that a <unk> literature were necessary to convey the impressions left upon me .
i had something of the feeling of a recruit who for the first time is taking part in a brilliant and complicated manoeuvre .
<name> and <name> peters flit across the view , and <name> hollister and <name> blackwood and the <unk> ,  all of whom had come up in a special car ; <name> hambleton was " best man , " looking <unk> tall in his frock-coat : and his manner , throughout the whole proceeding , was one of good-natured tolerance toward a folly none but he might escape .
" if you must do it , hughie , i suppose you must , " he had said to me .
" i 'll see you through , of course .
but do n't blame me afterwards . "
<name> was a little afraid of him ... .
i dressed at <name> 's ; then , like one of those bewildering shifts of a <unk> , comes the scene in church , the glimpse of my mother's wistful face in the front pew ; and i found myself in front of the austere mr. <unk> standing beside <name>  or rather beside a woman i tried hard to believe was <name>  so veiled and generally encased was she .
i was thinking of this all the time i was mechanically answering mr. <unk> , and even when the wedding march burst forth and i led her out of the church .
it was as though they had done their best to disguise her , to put our union on the <unk> plane that was deemed to be its only justification , to neutralize her sex at the very moment it should have been most enhanced .
well , they succeeded .
if i had not been as conventional as the rest , i should have preferred to have run away with her in the lavender dress she wore when i first proposed to her .
it was only when we had got into the carriage and started for the house and she turned to me her face from which the veil had been thrown back that i realized what a sublime meaning it all had for her .
her eyes were wet .
once more i was acutely conscious of my inability to feel deeply at supreme moments .
for months i had looked forward with anticipation and impatience to my <unk> .
i kissed her gently .
but i felt as though she had gone to heaven , and that the face i beheld enshrouded were merely her effigy .
commonplace words were inappropriate , yet it was to these i resorted .
" well  it was n't so bad after all !
was it ? "
she smiled at me .
" you do n't want to take it back ? "
she shook her head .
" i think it was a beautiful wedding , <name> .
i 'm so glad we had a good day . " ...
she seemed shy , at once very near and very remote .
i held her hand awkwardly until the carriage stopped .
a little later we were standing in a corner of the parlour , the atmosphere of which was heavy with the scent of flowers , submitting to the onslaught of relatives .
then came the wedding breakfast : <unk> , champagne , chicken salad , ice-cream , the <unk> , speeches and more kisses ... .
i remember <name> peters holding on to both my hands .
" good-bye , and god bless you , old boy , " he was saying .
<name> , in view of the occasion , had allowed him a little more champagne than usual  enough to betray his feelings , and i knew that these had not changed since our college days .
i resolved to see more of him .
i had neglected him and <unk> his loyalty ... .
he had followed me to my room in <unk> house where i was dressing for the journey , and he gave it as his deliberate judgment that in <name> i had " struck gold . "
" she 's just the girl for you , hughie , " he declared .
" <name> thinks so , too . "
later in the afternoon , as we sat in the state-room of the car that was bearing us eastward , <name> began to cry .
i sat looking at her helplessly , unable to enter into her emotion , resenting it a little .
yet i tried awkwardly to comfort her .
" i ca n't bear to leave them , " she said .
" but you <name> see them often , when we come back , " i reassured her .
it was scarcely the moment for reminding her of what she was getting in return .
this peculiar family affection she evinced was beyond me ; i had never experienced it in any poignant degree since i had gone as a freshman to harvard , and yet i was struck by the fact that her emotions were so rightly placed .
it was natural to love one 's family .
i began to feel , vaguely , as i watched her , that the new relationship into which i had entered was to be much more complicated than i had imagined .
twilight was coming on , the train was winding through the mountain passes , crossing and <unk> a swift little stream whose banks were massed with <unk> ; here and there , on the steep hillsides , blazed the <unk> ... .
presently i turned , to surprise in her eyes a wide , questioning look ,  the look of a child .
even in this <unk> hour she sought to grasp what manner of being was this to whom she had confided her life , and with whom she was faring forth into the unknown .
the experience was utterly unlike my anticipation .
yet i responded .
the kiss i gave her had no passion in it .
" i 'll take good care of you , <name> , " i said .
suddenly , in the fading light , she flung her arms around me , pressing me tightly , desperately .
" oh , i know you <name> , <name> , dear .
and you 'll forgive me , wo n't you , for being so horrid to-day , of all days ?
i do love you ! "
neither of us had ever been abroad .
and although it was before the days of <unk> and <unk> and a la <unk> <unk> on ocean liners , the atlantic was imposing enough .
<name> had a more lasting capacity for pleasure than i , a keener enjoyment of new experiences , and as she lay beside me in the <unk> where i had carefully tucked her she would exclaim : " i simply ca n't believe it , <name> !
it seems so unreal .
i 'm sure i shall wake up and find myself back in elkington . "
" do n't speak so loud , my dear , " i cautioned her .
there were some very <unk> new <unk> next us .
" no , i wo n't , " she whispered .
" but i 'm so happy i feel as though i should like to tell everyone . "
" there 's no need , " i answered smiling .
" oh , <name> , i do n't want to disgrace you ! "
she exclaimed , in real alarm .
" otherwise , so far as i am concerned , i should n't care who knew . "
people smiled at her .
women came up and took her hands .
and on the fourth day the formidable new <unk> unexpectedly thawed .
i had once thought of <name> as plastic .
then i had discovered she had a mind and <name> of her own .
once more she seemed plastic ; her love had made her so .
was it not what i had desired ?
i had only to express a wish , and it became her law .
nay , she appealed to me many times a day to know whether she had made any mistakes , and i began to drill her in my silly traditions ,  gently , very gently .
" well , i should n't be quite so familiar with people , quite so ready to make acquaintances , <name> .
you have no idea who they may be .
some of them , of course , like the <unk> , i know by reputation . "
the <unk> were the new <unk> who sat next us .
" i 'll try , <name> , to be more reserved , more like the wife of an important man . "
she smiled .
" it is n't that you 're not reserved , " i replied , ignoring the latter half of her remark .
" nor that i want you to change , " i said .
" i only want to teach you what little of the world i know myself . "
" and i want to learn , <name> .
you do n't know how i want to learn ! "
the sight of <unk> liverpool is not a cheering one for the american who first puts foot on the mother country 's soil , a liverpool of <unk> and dingy blacks , of tilted funnels pouring out smoke into an atmosphere already charged with it .
the long wharves and shed roofs glistened with moisture .
" just think , <name> , it 's actually england ! "
she cried , as we stood on the wet deck .
but i felt as though i 'd been there before .
" no wonder they 're addicted to cold baths , " i replied .
" they must feel perfectly at home in them , especially if they put a little <unk> in the water . "
<name> laughed .
" you <unk> old thing ! "
she exclaimed .
nothing could <unk> her ardour , not the sight of the <unk> stone houses when we got ashore , nor even the frigid luncheon we ate in the <unk> hotel .
for her it was all quaint and new .
finally we found ourselves established in a compartment <unk> in light grey , with tassels and <unk> , on the window of which was pasted a poster with the word reserved in large , red letters .
the guard inquired respectfully , as the <name> put our new luggage in the racks , whether we had everything we wanted .
the toy locomotive blew its toy whistle , and we were off for the north ; past dingy , yellow tenements of the smoking factory towns , and stretches of orderly , <unk> <unk> country .
the quaint cottages we glimpsed , the sight of distant , stately mansions on green slopes caused <name> to cry out with rapture :  " oh , <name> , there 's a <unk> ! "
more vivid than were the experiences themselves of that journey are the memories of them .
we went to <unk> , <unk> edinburgh , to high stirling and dark holyrood , and to <unk> .
it was through sir <name> 's eyes we beheld <unk> bathed in autumn light , by his aid <unk> it with forgotten monks eating their <unk> <unk> .
and as we sat reading and dreaming in the still , <name> corners i forgot , that struggle for power in which i had been so furiously engaged since leaving cambridge .
<unk> , politicians and capitalists receded into a dim background ; and the gift i had possessed , in youth , of living in a realm of fancy showed astonishing signs of revival .
" why , <name> , " <name> exclaimed , " you ought to have been a writer ! "
" you 've only just begun to fathom my talents , " i replied laughingly .
" did you think you 'd married just a dry old lawyer ? "
" i believe you capable of anything , " she said ... .
i grew more and more to depend on her for little things .
she was a born housewife .
it was pleasant to have her do all the packing , while i read or sauntered in the queer streets about the inns .
and she took complete charge of my wardrobe .
she had a talent for drawing , and as we went southward through england she made sketches of the various houses that took our fancy  suggestions for future <unk> ; we spent hours in the evenings in the inn <unk> <unk> new features into our residence , continually modifying our plans .
now it was a tudor house that carried us away , now a <unk> , and again an early georgian with <unk> wings and a <unk> <unk> .
a stage of bewilderment succeeded .
<name> , i knew , loved the cottages best .
she said they were more " homelike . "
but she yielded to my liking for grandeur .
" my , i should feel lost in a palace like that ! "
she cried , as we gazed at the <name> of so-and-so 's <unk> .
" well , of course we should have to modify it , " i admitted .
" perhaps  perhaps our family <name> be larger . "
she put her hand on my lips , and blushed a fiery red ... . we examined , with other tourists , at a shilling apiece historic mansions with endless drawing-rooms , halls , libraries , galleries filled with family portraits ; elaborate , formal bedrooms where famous sovereigns had slept , all roped off and carpeted with canvas strips to protect the floors .
through <unk> windows we caught glimpses of gardens and geometrical <unk> , lakes , fountains , statuary , fantastic <unk> and distant stretches of park .
<name> sighed with admiration , but did not <unk> .
she had me .
but i was often uncomfortable , resenting the vulgar , gaping tourists with whom we were <unk> and the easy familiarity of the guides .
these did not trouble <name> , who often annoyed me by asking naive questions herself .
i would <unk> her .
one afternoon when , with other <unk> , we were being hurried through a famous castle , the guide unwittingly ushered us into a drawing-room where the owner and several guests were seated about a tea-table .
i shall never forget the stares they gave us before we had time precipitately to retreat , nor the feeling of disgust and rebellion that came over me .
this was heightened by the remark of a heavy , six-foot <unk> with an infantile face and a genial manner .
" i notice that they did n't invite us to sit down and have a bite , " he said .
" i call that kind of inhospitable . "
" it was 'is lordship himself ! "
exclaimed the guide , scandalized .
" you do n't say ! "
drawled our <unk> .
" i guess i owe you another shilling , my friend . "
the guide , utterly bewildered , accepted it .
the <unk> point of view towards the nobility was beyond him .
" his lordship could make a nice little income if he set up as a side show , " added the <unk> .
<name> giggled , but i was furious .
and no sooner were we outside the gates than i declared i should never again enter a private residence by the back door .
" why , <name> , how queer you are sometimes , " she said .
" i maybe queer , but i have a sense of fitness , " i retorted .
she asserted herself .
" i ca n't see what difference it makes .
they did n't know us .
and if they admit people for money  " " i ca n't help it .
and as for the man from ohio  " " but he was so funny ! "
she interrupted .
" and he was really very nice . "
i was silent .
her point of view , eminently sensible as it was , exasperated me .
we were leaning over the parapet of a <unk> bridge .
her face was turned away from me , but presently i realized that she was crying .
men and women , villagers , passing across the bridge , looked at us curiously .
i was miserable , and somewhat appalled ; resentful , yet striving to be gentle and conciliatory .
i assured her that she was talking nonsense , that i loved her .
but i did not really love her at that moment ; nor did she <unk> as easily as usual .
it was not until we were together in our sitting-room , a few hours later , that she gave in .
i felt a tremendous sense of relief .
" <name> , i 'll try to be what you want .
you know i am trying .
but don't kill what is natural in me . "
i was touched by the appeal , and repentant ...
it is impossible to say when the little worries , annoyances and <unk> began , when i first felt a restlessness creeping over me .
i tried to hide these moods from her , but always she divined them .
and yet i was sure that i loved <name> ; in a surprisingly short period i had become accustomed to her , dependent on her ministrations and the normal , cosy intimacy of our companionship .
i did not like to think that the keen edge of the enjoyment of possession was wearing a little , while at the same time i <unk> that the divine fire , when <unk> , settles down to a comfortable glow .
the <name> to go home that grew upon me i attributed to the irritation aroused by the spectacle of a fixed social order commanding such unquestioned deference from the many who were content to remain resignedly outside of it .
before the setting in of the liberal movement and the " american invasion " england was a country in which ( from my point of view ) one must be " somebody " in order to be happy .
i was " somebody " at home ; or at least rapidly becoming so ... . london was shrouded , parliament had risen , and the great houses were closed .
day after day we issued forth from a musty and highly respectable hotel near piccadilly to a gloomy tower , a <unk> hampton court or a mournful british museum .
our native longing for luxury  or rather my native longing  impelled me to abandon smith 's hotel for a huge hostelry where our suite overlooked the thames , where we ran across a man i had known slightly at harvard , and other americans with whom we made excursions and dined and went to the theatre .
<name> liked these persons ; i did not find them especially congenial .
my life-long habit of unwillingness to accept what life sent in its ordinary course was asserting itself ; but <name> took her friends as she found them , and i was secretly annoyed by her lack of discrimination .
in addition to this , the sense of having been pulled up by the roots grew upon me .
" suppose , " <name> surprised me by suggesting one morning as we sat at breakfast watching the river craft flit like phantoms through the <unk> fog  " suppose we do n't go to <name> , after all , <name> ? "
" not go to <name> ! "
i exclaimed .
" are you tired of the trip ? "
" oh , <name> ! "
her voice caught .
" i could go on , always , if you were content . "
" and  what makes you think that i 'm not content ? "
her smile had in it just a touch of <unk> .
" i understand you , <name> , better than you think .
you want to get back to your work , and  and i should be happier .
i 'm not so silly and so ignorant as to think that i can satisfy you always .
and i 'd like to get settled at home ,  i really should . "
there surged up within me a feeling of relief .
i seized her hand as it lay on the table .
" we 'll come abroad another time , and go to <name> , " i said .
" <name> , you 're splendid ! "
she shook her head .
" oh , no , i 'm not . "
" you do satisfy me , " i insisted .
" it is n't that at all .
but i think , perhaps , it would be wiser to go back .
it 's rather a crucial time with me , now that mr. watling 's in washington .
i 've just arrived at a position where i shall be able to make a good deal of money , and later on  " " it is n't the money , <name> , " she cried , with a vehemence which struck me as a little odd .
" i sometimes think we 'd be a great deal happier without  without all you are going to make . "
i laughed .
" well , i have n't made it yet . "
she possessed the <unk> of the <unk> .
and some times my <unk> had frightened her , as when we had taken the suite of rooms we now occupied .
" are you sure you can afford them , <name> ? "
she had asked when we first surveyed them .
i began married life , and carried it on without giving her any <name> of the state of my finances .
she had an allowance from the first .
as the steamer slipped westward my spirits rose , to reach a climax of exhilaration when i saw the towers of new york rise gleaming like huge <unk> in the early <name> sun .
<name> likened them more happily  to gigantic <name> <unk> .
well , new york was <name> 's <unk> , and the great players had already begun to make moves that astonished the world .
as we sat at breakfast in a fifth avenue hotel i ran my eye eagerly over the <unk> reports and the financial news , and rallied <name> for a lack of spirits .
" are n't you glad to be home ? "
i asked her , as we sat in a hansom .
" of course i am , <name> ! "
she protested .
" but  i ca n't look upon new york as home , somehow .
it <unk> me . "
i laughed <unk> .
" you 'll get used to it , " i said .
" we 'll be coming here a great deal , off and on . "
she was silent .
but later , when we took a hansom and entered the streams of traffic , she responded to the stimulus of the place : the movement , the colour , the sight of the <unk> carriages , of the well-fed , <unk> people who sat in them , the <unk> of the shops in which we made our purchases had their effect , and she became cheerful again ... .
in the evening we took the " limited " for home .
we lived for a month with my mother , and then moved into our own house .
it was one which i had rented from <name> ogilvy , and it stood on the corner of baker and <name> streets , near that fashionable neighbourhood called " the heights . "
ogilvy , who was some ten years older than i , and who belonged to one of our old families , had embarked on a career then becoming common , but which at first was regarded as somewhat <unk> : gradually abandoning the practice of law , and perceiving the possibilities of the city of his birth , he had " gambled " in real estate and other enterprises , such as our local water company , until he had <unk> his inheritance .
he had built a mansion on <name> avenue , the wide thoroughfare <unk> the heights .
the house he had vacated was not large , but essentially distinctive ; with the oddity characteristic of the revolt against the <unk> architecture of the 80 's .
the curves of the tiled roof <unk> the upper windows ; the walls were thick , the note one of mystery .
i remember <name> 's naive delight when we inspected it .
" you 'd never guess what the inside was like , would you , <name> ? "
she cried .
from the <unk> box of an entrance hall one went up a few steps to a drawing-room which had a bowed recess like an <unk> , and <unk> .
the dining-room was an odd shape , and was <unk> in oak ; it had a tiled fireplace and ( according to <name> ) the " sweetest " <name> closet built into the wall .
there was a " den " for me , and an octagonal <unk> on the corner .
upstairs , the bedrooms were quite as unusual , the <unk> of the new pattern , heavy and imposing .
<name> expressed the air of seclusion when she exclaimed that she could almost imagine herself in one of the mediaeval towns we had seen abroad .
" it 's a dream , <name> , " she sighed .
" but  do you think we can afford it ? " ...
" this house , " i announced , smiling , " is only a <unk> to the palace i intend to build you some day . "
" i do n't want a palace ! "
she cried .
" i 'd rather live here , like this , always . "
a certain vehemence in her manner troubled me .
i was charmed by this disposition for <unk> , and yet i shrank from the contemplation of its permanency .
i felt vaguely , at the time , the possibility of a future conflict of temperaments .
<name> was docile , now .
but would she remain docile ?
and was it in her nature to take ultimately the position that was desirable for my wife ?
well , she must be moulded , before it were too late .
her <unk> tendencies must be halted .
as yet <unk> unaware of the inability of the masculine mind to fathom the <unk> of feminine relationships , i was particularly desirous that <name> and <name> durrett should be intimates .
the very day after our arrival , and while we were still at my mother 's , <name> called on <name> , and took her out for a drive .
<name> told me of it when i came home from the office .
" dear old <name> ! "
i said .
" i know you liked her . "
" of course , <name> .
i should like her for your sake , anyway .
she 's  she's one of your oldest and best friends . "
" but i want you to like her for her own sake . "
" i think i shall , " said <name> .
she was so scrupulously truthful !
" i was a little afraid of her , at first . "
" afraid of <name> ! "
i exclaimed .
" well , you know , she 's much older than i. i think she is sweet .
but she knows so much about the world  so much that she does n't say .
i can't describe it . "
i smiled .
" it 's only her manner .
you 'll get used to that , when you know what she really is . "
" oh , i <name> so , " answered <name> .
" i 'm very anxious to like her  i do like her .
but it takes me such a lot of time to get to know people . "
<name> asked us to dinner .
" i want to help <name> all i can ,  if she 'll let me , " <name> said .
" why should n't she let you ? "
i asked .
" she may not like me , " <name> replied .
" nonsense ! "
i exclaimed .
<name> smiled .
" it wo n't be my fault , at any rate , if she does n't , " she said .
" i wanted her to meet at first just the right people your old friends and a few others .
it is hard for a woman  especially a young woman  coming among strangers . "
she glanced down the table to where <name> sat talking to ham .
" she has an air about her ,  a great deal of self-possession . "
i , too , had noticed this , with pride and relief .
for i knew <name> had been nervous .
" you are luckier than you deserve to be , " <name> reminded me .
" but i <name> you realize that she has a mind of her own , that she <name> form her own opinions of people , independently of you . "
i must have betrayed the fact that i was a little startled , for the remark came as a confirmation of what i had dimly felt .
" of course she has , " i agreed , somewhat lamely .
" every woman has , who is worth her salt . "
<name> 's smile <unk> a knowledge that seemed to <unk> my own .
" you do like her ? "
i demanded .
" i like her very much indeed , " said <name> , a little gravely .
" she 's simple , she 's real , she has that which so few of us possess nowadays  character .
but  i 've got to be prepared for the possibility that she may not get along with me . "
" why not ? "
i demanded .
" there you are again , with your old unwillingness to analyze a situation and face it .
for heaven 's sake , now that you have married her , study her .
do n't take her for granted .
ca n't you see that she does n't care for the things that amuse me , that make my life ? "
" of course , if you insist on making yourself out a hardened , sophisticated woman  " i protested .
but she shook her head .
" her roots are deeper ,  she is in touch , though she may not realize it , with the <unk> .
she is one of those women who are <unk> . "
though somewhat <unk> , i was struck by the phrase .
and i lost sight of <name> 's generosity .
she looked me full in the face .
" i wonder whether you can rise to her , " she said .
" if i were you , i should try .
you <name> be happier  far happier than if you attempt to use her for your own ends , as a <unk> to your comfort and an auxiliary to your career .
i was afraid  i confess it  that you had married an aspiring , <unk> and <unk> provincial like that mrs. <name> hutchins ' whom i met once , and who would sell her soul to be at my table .
well , you escaped that , and you may thank god for it .
you 've got a chance , think it over .
" a chance ! "
i repeated , though i gathered something of her meaning .
" think it over , said <name> again .
and she smiled .
" but  do you want me to bury myself in <unk> ? "
i demanded , without grasping the significance of my words .
" you 'll find her reasonable , i think .
you 've got a chance now , <name> .
do n't spoil it . "
she turned to <name> dickinson , who sat on her other side ... .
when we got home i tried to conceal my anxiety as to <name> 's impressions of the evening .
i lit a cigarette , and remarked that the dinner had been a success .
" do you know what i 've been wondering all evening ? "
<name> asked .
" why you did n't marry <name> instead of me . "
" well , " i replied , " it just did n't come off .
and <name> was telling me at dinner how fortunate i was to have married you . "
<name> passed this .
" i ca n't see why she accepted hambleton durrett .
it seems horrible that such a woman as she is could have married  just for money .
" <name> has an odd streak in her , " i said .
" but then we all have odd streaks .
she 's the best friend in the world , when she is your friend . "
" i 'm sure of it , " <name> agreed , with a little note of penitence .
" you enjoyed it , " i ventured cautiously .
" oh , yes , " she agreed .
" and everyone was so nice to me  for your sake of course . "
" do n't be ridiculous ! "
i said .
" i <name> n't tell you what <name> and the others said about you . "
<name> had the gift of silence .
" what a beautiful house ! "
she sighed presently .
" i know you 'll think me silly , but so much luxury as that <unk> me a little .
in england , in those places we saw , it seemed natural enough , but in <name>  !
and they all your friends  seem to take it as a matter of course . "
" there 's no reason why we should n't have beautiful things and well served dinners , too , if we have the money to pay for them . "
" i suppose not , " she agreed , absently .
xv .
that <name> many other entertainments were given in our honour .
but the conviction grew upon me that <name> had no real liking for the social side of life , that she acquiesced in it only on my account .
thus , at the very outset of our married career , an <unk> developed : signs of it , indeed , were apparent from the first , when we were preparing the house we had rented for <unk> .
hurrying away from my office at odd times to furniture and department stores to help decide such momentous questions as curtains , carpets , chairs and tables i would often spy the tall , uncompromising figure of <name> peters standing beside <name> 's , while an obliging clerk spread out , anxiously , rugs or <unk> for their inspection .
" why do n't you get <name> to help you , too ! "
i ventured to ask her once .
" ours is such a little house  compared to <name> 's , <name> . "
my attitude towards <name> had hitherto remained undefined .
she was tom's wife and <name> 's affair .
in spite of her marked disapproval of the modern trend in business and social life ,  a prejudice she had communicated to <name> , as a bachelor i had not disliked her ; and it was certain that these views had not mitigated <name> 's loyalty and affection for me .
<name> had been my friend , as had her brother <name> , and <name> , <name> 's wife : they made no secret of the fact that they deplored in me what they were pleased to call <unk> <unk> , nor had their disapproval always been confined to <unk> .
<name> , too , they looked upon as a <unk> .
i was able to bear their reproaches with the superior good nature that springs from success , to point out why the american tradition to which they so <unk> clung was a things of the past .
the habit of taking dinner with them at least once a week had continued , and their arguments rather amused me .
if they chose to dwell in a <unk> out of touch with the current of great affairs , this was a matter to be deplored , but i did not feel strongly enough to resent it .
so long as i remained a bachelor the relationship had not troubled me , but now that i was married i began to consider with some alarm its power to affect my welfare .
it had remained for <name> to inform me that i had married a woman with a mind of her own .
i had flattered myself that i should be able to control <name> , to govern her <unk> , and now at the very beginning of our married life she was showing a disquieting tendency to choose for herself .
to be sure , she had found my intimacy with the <unk> and <unk> already formed ; but it was an intimacy from which i was growing away .
i should not have quarrelled with her if she had not <unk> : <name> made <unk> , and <name> <name> back ; <name> presented herself , and with annoying perversity and in an extraordinarily brief time <name> had become her intimate .
it seemed to me that she was always at <name> 's , lunching or playing with the children , who grew devoted to her ; or with <name> , choosing carpets and clothes ; while more and more frequently we dined with the <unk> and the <unk> , or they with us .
with <name> 's wife <name> was scarcely less intimate than with <name> .
this was the more surprising to me since <name> blackwood was a <unk> " intellectual , " a graduate of <unk> , the daughter of a harvard professor .
<name> had fallen in love with her during her visit to <name> .
<name> was , perhaps , the most influential of the group ; she scorned the world , she held strong views on the higher education of women ; she had long discarded orthodoxy for what may be called a cambridge <unk> of simple living and high thinking ; while <name> was a strict presbyterian , and not in the least given to theories .
when , some months after our <unk> , i ventured to warn her gently of the dangers of confining one 's self to a <unk>  especially one of such narrow views  her answer was rather bewildering .
" but is n't <name> your best friend ? "
she asked .
i admitted that he was .
" and you always went there such a lot before we were married . "
this , too , was undeniable .
" at the same time , " i replied , " i have other friends .
i 'm fond of the <unk> and the <unk> , i 'm not <unk> seeing less of them , but their point of view , if taken without any <unk> , is rather narrowing .
we ought to see all kinds , " i suggested , with a fine restraint .
" you mean  more worldly people , " she said with her disconcerting directness .
" not necessarily worldly , " i struggled on .
" people who know more of the world  yes , who understand it better . "
<name> sighed .
" i do try , <name> ,  i return their calls ,  i do try to be nice to them .
but somehow i do n't seem to get along with them easily  i 'm not myself , they make me shy .
it 's because i 'm provincial . "
" nonsense ! "
i protested , " you 're not a bit provincial . "
and it was true ; her dignity and self-possession redeemed her .
<name> was not once mentioned .
but i think she was in both our minds ... .
since my marriage , too , i had begun to resent a little the attitude of <name> and <name> and the <unk> of humorous yet affectionate tolerance toward my professional activities and financial creed , though <name> showed no disposition to take this seriously .
i did suspect , however , that they were more and more determined to rescue <name> from what they would have termed a frivolous career ; and on one of these occasions  so exasperating in married life when a slight cause for pique <unk> husband or wife to try to ask myself whether this affair were only a squall , something to be looked for once in a while on the seas of matrimony , and weathered : or whether <name> had not , after all , been right when she declared that i had made a mistake , and that we were not fitted for one another ?
in this gloomy view endless years of <unk> stretched ahead ; and for the first time i began to rehearse with a certain cold detachment the chain of apparently accidental events which had led up to my marriage : to consider the gradual blindness that had come over my faculties ; and finally to wonder whether judgment ever entered into sexual selection .
would <name> have relapsed into this senseless fit if she had realized how fortunate she was ?
for i was prepared to give her what thousands of women longed for , position and influence .
my resentment rose again against <name> and <name> , and i began to attribute their lack of appreciation of my achievements to jealousy .
they had not my ability ; this was the long and short of it ... .
i pondered also , regretfully , on my bachelor days .
and for the first time , i , who had worked so hard to achieve freedom , felt the pressure of the yoke i had fitted over my own shoulders .
i had voluntarily , though unwittingly , returned to slavery .
this was what had happened .
and what was to be done about it ?
i would not consider divorce .
well , i should have to make the best of it .
whether this conclusion brought on a mood of reaction , i am unable to say .
i was still annoyed by what seemed to the masculine mind a senseless and dramatic performance on <name> 's part , an incomprehensible case of " nerves . "
nevertheless , there stole into my mind many recollections of <unk> affection , many passages between us ; and my eye chanced to fall on the <unk> she had bought me out of the allowance i gave her .
an <unk> pity welled up within me for her loneliness , her despair in that room upstairs .
i got up  and hesitated .
a <unk> , <unk> wave passed through me .
i hardened .
i began to walk up and down , a prey to conflicting impulses .
something whispered , " go to her " ; another voice added , " for your own peace of mind , at any rate . "
i rejected the intrusion of this motive as unworthy , turned out the light and groped my way upstairs .
the big clock in the hall struck twelve .
i listened outside the door of the bedroom , but all was silent within .
i knocked .
" <name> ! "
i said , in a low voice .
there was no response .
" <name>  let me in !
i did n't mean to be unkind  i 'm sorry . "
after an interval i heard her say : " i 'd rather stay here ,  to-night . "
but at length , after more entreaty and <unk> on my part , she opened the door .
the room was dark .
we sat down together on the window-seat , and all at once she relaxed and her head fell on my shoulder , and she began weeping again .
i held her , the alternating moods still running through me .
" <name> , " she said at length , " how could you be so cruel ?
when you know i love you and would do anything for you . "
" i did n't mean to be cruel , <name> , " i answered .
" i know you did n't .
but at times you seem so  indifferent , and you can't understand how it hurts .
i have n't anybody but you , now , and it 's in your power to make me happy or  or miserable . "
later on i tried to explain my point of view , to justify myself .
" all i mean , " i concluded at length , " is that my position is a little different from <name> 's and <name> 's .
they can afford to <unk> themselves , but i 'm thrown <unk> with the men who are building up this city .
some of them , like <name> hambleton and mr. ogilvy , i 've known all my life .
life is n't so simple for us , <name>  we ca n't ignore the social side . "
" i understand , " she said contentedly .
" you are more of a man of affairs  much more than <name> or <name> , and you have greater responsibilities and wider interests .
i 'm really very proud of you .
only  do n't you think you are a little too sensitive about yourself , when you are teased ? "
i let this pass ... .
i give a paragraph from a possible biography of <name> paret which , as then seemed not improbable , might in the future have been written by some aspiring young <unk> of success .
" on his return from a brief but delightful honeymoon in england mr. paret took up again , with characteristic vigour , the practice of the law .
he was entering upon the prime years of manhood ; golden opportunities confronted him as , indeed , they confronted other men  but paret had the foresight to take advantage of them .
and his training under <name> watling was now to produce results ... .
the reputations had already been made of some of that remarkable group of financial geniuses who were chiefly instrumental in bringing about the industrial evolution begun after the civil war : at the same time , as is well known , a political leadership developed that gave proof of a deplorable blindness to the logical necessity of combinations in business .
the lawyer with initiative and brains became an indispensable factor , " etc. , etc .
the biography might have gone on to relate my association with and important services to adolf scherer in connection with his constructive dream .
shortly after my return from abroad , in answer to his summons , i found him at <unk> 's , his napkin tucked into his shirt front , and a dish of his favourite sausages before him .
" so , the honeymoon is over ! "
he said , and pressed my hand .
" you are right to come back to business , and after awhile you can have another honeymoon , eh ?
i have had many since i married .
and how long do you think was my first ?
a day !
i was a foreman then , and the wedding was at six o'clock in the morning .
we went into the country , the wife and i . "
he laid down his knife and fork , possessed by the memory .
" i have grown <name> since , and we 've been to europe and back to germany , and travelled on the best ships and stayed at the best hotels , but i never enjoyed a holiday more than that day .
it was n't long afterwards i went to mr. durrett and told him how he could save much money .
he was always ready to listen , mr. durrett , when an employee had anything to say .
he was a big man ,  an <unk> .
ah , he would be astonished if only he could wake up now ! "
" he would not only have to be an <unk> , " i agreed , " but a financier and a railroad man to boot . "
" a <name> of all trades , " laughed mr. scherer .
" that 's what we are  men in my position .
well , it was comparatively simple then , when we had no <name> law and crazy statutes , such as some of the states are passing , to bother us .
what has got into the politicians , that they are indulging in such foolishness ? "
he exclaimed , more warmly .
" we try to build up a trade for this country , and they 're doing their best to tie our hands and tear it down .
when i was in washington the other day i was talking with one of those western senators whose state has passed those laws .
he said to me , 'mr .
scherer , i 've been making a study of the boyne iron works .
you are clever men , but you are building up <unk> which we propose to stop . '
'by what means ? ' "
i asked .
" <unk> , for one , ' said he , 'you get <unk> rates from your railroad which give you advantages over your competitors . '
foolishness ! "
mr. scherer exclaimed .
" i tell him the railroad is a private concern , built up by private enterprise , and it has a right to make special rates for large <unk> .
no ,  railroads are public carriers with no right to make special rates .
i ask him what else he objects to , and he says <unk> processes .
as if we do n't have a right to our own patents !
we buy them .
i buy them , when other steel companies wo n't touch 'em .
what is that but enterprise , and business foresight , and taking risks ?
and then he begins to talk about the tariff taking money out of the pockets of american <unk> and making men like me <name> .
i have come to washington to get the tariff raised on steel rails ; and watling and other senators we send down there are raising it for us .
we are building up <unk> !
well , suppose we are .
we ca n't help it , even if we want to .
has he ever made a study of the other side of the question  the competition side ?
of course he has n't . "
he brought down his beer mug heavily on the table .
in times of excitement his speech suggested the <name> <unk> .
abruptly his air grew mysterious ; he glanced around the room , now becoming empty , and lowered his voice .
" i have been thinking a long time , i have a little scheme , " he said , " and i have been to washington to see watling , to talk over it .
well , he thinks much of you .
fowndes and ripon are good lawyers , but they are not smart like you .
see paret , he says , and he can come down and talk to me .
so i ask you to come here .
that is why i say you are wise to get home .
<unk> can wait  eh ? "
i smiled <unk> .
" they talk about monopoly , those <unk> senators , but i ask you what is a man in my place to do ?
if you do n't eat , somebody eats you  is it not so ?
like the <unk>  that is modern business .
look at the <unk> plate people , over there at <name> .
for years we sold them steel billets from which to make their plates , and three months ago they serve notice on us that they are getting ready to make their own billets , they buy mines north of the lakes and are building their plant .
here is a big customer gone .
next year , maybe , the empire tube company goes into the business of making crude steel , and many more thousands of tons go from us .
what is left for us , paret ? "
" obviously you 've got to go into the tube and plate business yourselves , " i said .
" so ! "
cried mr. scherer , triumphantly , " or it is close up .
we are not fools , no , we <name> not lie down and be eaten like lambs for any law .
dickinson can put his hand on the capital , and i  i have already bought a tract on the lakes , at bolivar , i have already got a plant designed with the latest modern machinery .
i can put the ore right there , i can send the <unk> back from here in cars which would otherwise be empty , and manufacture tubes at eight dollars a ton less than they are selling .
if we can make tubes we can make plates , and if we can make plates we can make boilers , and beams and girders and bridges ... .
it is not like it was but where is it all leading , my friend ?
the time <name> come  is right on us now , in respect to many products  when the market <name> be flooded with tubes and plates and girders , and then we 'll have to find a way to limit production .
and the inefficient mills <name> all be forced to shut down . "
the logic seemed unanswerable , even had i cared to answer it ... .
he unfolded his campaign .
the boyne iron works was to become the boyne iron works , <unk> , owner of various <unk> companies , some of which were as yet <unk> ignorant of their fate .
all had been thought out as calmly as the partition of poland  only , lawyers were required ; and ultimately , after the process of acquisition should have been completed , a delicate document was to be drawn up which would pass through the <unk> of that annoying <unk> net , the <name> <unk> law .
new mines were to be purchased , extending over a certain large area ; wide coal deposits ; little strips of railroad to tap them .
the competition of the <unk> plate people was to be met by acquiring and bringing up to date the plate mills of king and son , over the borders of a sister state ; the <unk> bridge and construction company and the <unk> steel and wire company were to be absorbed .
when all of this should have been accomplished , there would be scarcely a process in the steel industry , from the <unk> of the ore to the completion of a bridge , which the boyne iron works could not undertake .
such was the beginning of the " lateral extension " period .
" two can play at that game , " mr. scherer said .
" and if those fellows could only be content to let well enough alone , to continue buying their crude steel from us , there would n't be any trouble . " ...
it was evident , however , that he really welcomed the " trouble , " that he was going into battle with enthusiasm .
he had already picked out his points of attack and was marching on them .
life , for him , would have been a poor thing without new conflicts to absorb his energy ; and he had already made of the boyne iron works , with its <unk> furnaces , a <name> of modern efficiency that had opened the eyes of the steel world , and had drawn the attention of a personality in new york ,  a personality who was one of the new and dominant type that had developed with such amazing rapidity , the <unk> ; <unk> upon and <unk> the <unk> , conquering type of the preceding age , builder of the railroads , mills and <unk> .
the <unk> , the gigantic ones , were in wall street , and strove among themselves for the industrial spoils accumulated by their predecessors .
it was characteristic of these monsters that they never fought in the open unless they were forced to .
then the earth rocked , huge economic structures tottered and fell , and much dust arose to obscure the vision of smaller creatures , who were bewildered and terrified .
such disturbances were called " <unk> , " and were blamed by the newspapers on the democratic party , or on the reformers who had wantonly assailed established institutions .
these dominant bankers had contrived to gain control of the savings of thousands and thousands of fellow-citizens who had deposited them in banks or paid them into insurance companies , and with the power thus accumulated had sallied forth to capture railroads and industries .
the railroads were the <unk> links .
with these in hand , certain favoured industrial concerns could be fed , and others starved into submission .
adolf scherer might be said to represent a transitional type .
for he was not only an <unk> who knew every detail of his business , who kept it ahead of the times ; he was also a strategist , wise in his generation , making friends with the railroad while there had yet been time , at length securing <unk> and favours .
and when that railroad ( which had been constructed through the enterprise and courage of such men as <name> durrett ) had passed under the control of the <unk> to whom i have referred , and had become part of a system , adolf scherer remained in alliance , and continued to receive favours ... .
i can well remember the time when the ultimate authority of our railroad was transferred , quietly , to wall street .
<name> <unk> , its president , had been a great man , but after that he bowed , in certain matters , to a greater one .
i have <unk> ... . mr. scherer unfolded his scheme , talking about " units " as calmly as though they were <unk> on a board instead of huge , fiery , <unk> mills where thousands and thousands of human beings toiled day and night  beings with families , and hopes and fears , whose destinies were to be dominated by the <name> of the man who sat opposite me .
but  did not he in his own person represent the triumph of that american creed of opportunity ?
he , too , had been through the fire , had sweated beside the blasts , had handled the <unk> of steel .
he was one of the " fittest " who had survived , and looked it .
had he no memories of the terrors of that struggle ? ...
adolf scherer had grown to be a giant .
and yet without me , without my profession he was a helpless giant , at the <name> of those alert and vindictive <unk> who sought to restrain and hamper him , to check his growth with their webs .
how stimulating the idea of his dependence !
how exhilarating too , the thought that that vision which had first possessed me as an <unk>  on my visit to <name> kyme  was at last to be realized !
i had now become the indispensable associate of the few who divided the spoils , i was to have a share in these myself .
" you 're young , paret , " mr. scherer concluded .
" but watling has confidence in you , and you <name> consult him frequently .
i believe in the young men , and i have already seen something of you  so ? " ...
when i returned to the office i wrote <name> watling a letter expressing my gratitude for the position he had , so to speak , willed me , of confidential legal adviser to adolf scherer .
though the opportunity had thrust itself upon me suddenly , and sooner than i expected it , i was determined to prove myself worthy of it .
i worked as i had never worked before , making trips to new york to consult leading members of this new branch of my profession there , trips to washington to see my former chief .
there were , too , numerous conferences with local personages , with mr. dickinson and mr. grierson , and judah b. tallant ,  whose newspaper was most useful ; there were consultations and negotiations of a delicate nature with the owners and lawyers of other companies to be " taken in . "
nor was it all legal work , in the older and narrower sense .
men who are playing for <unk> are making war .
some of our operations had all the excitement of war .
there was information to be got , and it was got  somehow .
modern war involves a spy system , and a friendly telephone company is not to be despised .
and all of this work from first to last had to be done with extreme caution .
<unk> distinctions of right and wrong did not trouble me , for the modern man labours religiously when he knows that evolution is on his side .
for all of these operations a corps of counsel had been employed , including the firm of harrington and <unk> next to <name> watling , <name> harrington was deemed the ablest lawyer in the city .
we organized in due time the corporation known as the boyne iron works , limited ; a trust agreement was drawn up that was a masterpiece of its kind , one that caused , first and last , meddling officials in the department of justice at washington no little trouble and perplexity .
i was proud of the fact that i had taken no small part in its composition ... .
in short , in addition to certain <unk> and opportunities for investment , i emerged from the affair firmly established in the good graces of adolf scherer , and with a reputation practically made .
a year or so after the boyne company , <unk> , came into existence i chanced one morning to go down to the new <unk> hotel to meet a new <unk> of some prominence , and was awaiting him in the lobby , when i overheard a conversation between two commercial travellers who were sitting with their backs to me .
" did you notice that fellow who went up to the desk a moment ago ? "
asked one .
" the young fellow in the grey suit ?
sure .
who is he ?
he looks as if he was pretty well fixed . "
" i guess he is , " replied the first .
" that 's paret .
he 's <unk> confidential counsel .
he used to be senator watling 's partner , but they say he 's even got something on the old man . "
in spite of the feverish life i led , i was still undoubtedly <unk> , and in this i was true to the incoming type of successful man .
our fathers appeared staid at six and thirty .
clothes , of course , made some difference , and my class and generation did not wear the sombre and <unk> kind , with skirts and tails ; i patronized a tailor in new york .
my chestnut hair , a little darker than my father 's had been , showed no signs of turning grey , although it was thinning a little at the crown of the forehead , and i wore a small moustache , clipped in a straight line above the mouth .
this made me look less like a college youth .
thanks to a strong pigment in my skin , derived probably from <unk> ancestors , my colour was fresh .
i have spoken of my life as feverish , and yet i am not so sure that this word completely describes it .
it was full to overflowing  one side of it ; and i did not miss ( save vaguely , in rare moments of weariness ) any other side that might have been developed .
i was busy all day long , engaged in affairs i deemed to be alone of vital importance in the universe .
i was convinced that the welfare of the city demanded that supreme financial power should remain in the hands of the group of men with whom i was associated , and whose battles i fought in the courts , in the legislature , in the city council , and sometimes in washington ,  although they were well cared for there .
by every means ingenuity could devise , their enemies were to be driven from the field , and they were to be protected from blackmail .
a sense of importance sustained me ; and i remember in that first flush of a success for which i had not waited too long  what a secret satisfaction it was to pick up the <name> and see my name embedded in certain dignified notices of board meetings , transactions of weight , or cases known to the initiated as significant .
" mr. scherer 's interests were taken care of by mr. <name> paret . "
the fact that my triumphs were modestly set forth gave me more pleasure than if they had been trumpeted in headlines .
although i might have started out in practice for myself , my affection and regard for mr. watling kept me in the firm , which became watling , fowndes and paret , and a new , arrangement was entered into : mr. ripon retired on account of ill health .
there were instances , however , when a certain amount of annoying publicity was inevitable .
such was the famous galligan case , which occurred some three or four years after my marriage .
<unk> galligan was a brakeman , and his legs had become paralyzed as the result of an accident that was the result of defective <unk> on a freight car .
he had sued , and been awarded damages of $ 15,000 .
to the amazement and indignation of miller gorse , the supreme court , to which the railroad had appealed , affirmed the decision .
it was n't the single payment of $ 15,000 that the railroad cared about , of course ; a precedent might be established for compensating maimed employees which would be expensive in the long run .
carelessness could not be proved in this instance .
gorse sent for me .
i had been away with <name> at the sea for two months , and had not followed the case .
" you 've got to take charge , paret , and get a <unk> .
see bering , and find out who in the deuce is to blame for this .
<unk> 's one , of course .
we ought never to have permitted his nomination for the supreme bench .
it was against my judgment , but varney and gill assured me that he was all right . "
i saw judge bering that evening .
we sat on a plush sofa in the parlour of his house in baker street .
" i had a notion gorse 'd be mad , " he said , " but it looked to me as if they had it on us , paret .
i did n't see how we could do anything else but affirm without being too rank .
of course , if he feels that way , and you want to make a motion for a <unk> , i 'll see what can be done . "
" something 's got to be done , " i replied .
" ca n't you see what such a decision lets them in for ? "
" all right , " said the judge , who knew an order when he heard one , " i guess we can find an error . "
he was not a little frightened by the report of mr. gorse 's wrath , for <unk> was approaching .
" say , you would n't take me for a sentimental man , now , would you ? "
i smiled at the notion of it .
" well , i 'll own up to you this kind of got under my skin .
that galligan is a fine-looking fellow , if there ever was one , and he 'll never be of a bit of use any more .
of course the case was plain sailing , and they ought to have had the verdict , but that lawyer of his handled it to the <name> 's taste , if i do say so .
he made me feel real bad , by god ,  as if it was my own son <name> who 'd been battered up .
lord , i ca n't forget the look in that man galligan 's eyes .
i hate to go through it again , and reverse it , but i guess i 'll have to , now . "
the judge sat gazing at the flames playing over his gas log .
" who was the lawyer ? "
i asked .
" a man by the name of krebs , " he replied .
" never heard of him before .
he 's just moved to the city . "
" this city ? "
i ejaculated .
the judge glanced at me <unk> .
" this city , of course .
what do you know about him ? "
" well , " i answered , when i had recovered a little from the shock  for it was a distinct shock  " he lived in elkington .
he was the man who stirred up the trouble in the legislature about <name> 709 . "
the judge slapped his knee .
" that fellow ! "
he exclaimed , and <unk> .
" why did n't somebody tell me ? "
he added , <unk> .
" why did n't miller gorse let me know about it , instead of licking up a fuss after it 's all over ? " ...
of all men of my acquaintance i had thought the judge the last to grow maudlin over the misfortunes of those who were weak or unfortunate enough to be defeated and crushed in the struggle for existence , and it was not without food for reflection that i departed from his presence .
to make mr. bering " feel bad " was no small achievement , and krebs had been responsible for it , of course ,  not galligan .
krebs had turned up once more !
it seemed as though he were destined to haunt me .
well , i made up my mind that he should not disturb me again , at any rate : i , at least , had learned to eliminate sentimentality from business , and it was not without <unk> i remembered my experience with him at the capital , when he had made me temporarily ashamed of my connection with <name> 709 .
i had got over that .
and when i entered the court room ( the tribunal having graciously granted a <unk> on the ground that it had committed an error in the law ! )
my feelings were of lively curiosity and zest .
i had no disposition to <unk> his abilities , but i was fortified by the consciousness of a series of triumphs behind me , by a sense of association with prevailing forces against which he was helpless .
i could afford to take a superior attitude in regard to one who was destined always to be dramatic .
as the case proceeded i was rather disappointed on the whole that he was not dramatic  not even as dramatic as he had been when he defied the powers in the legislature .
he had changed but little , he still wore <unk> clothes , but i was forced to acknowledge that he seemed to have gained in self-control , in presence .
he had nodded at me before the case was called , as he sat beside his maimed client ; and i had been on the alert for a hint of reproach in his glance : there was none .
i smiled back at him ... .
he did not <unk> .
he seemed to have rather a remarkable knowledge of the law .
in a conversational tone he described the sufferings of the man in the flannel shirt beside him , but there could be no question of the fact that he did produce an effect .
the spectators were plainly moved , and it was undeniable that some of the judges wore rather a sheepish look as they <unk> with their watch chains or moved the stationery in front of them .
they had seen maimed men before , they had heard impassioned , sentimental lawyers talk about wives and families and god and justice .
krebs did none of this .
just how he managed to bring the thing home to those judges , to make them ashamed of their role , just how he managed  in spite of my fortified attitude to revive something of that sense of discomfort i had experienced at the state house is difficult to say .
it was because , i think , he contrived through the intensity of his own sympathy to enter into the body of the man whose cause he pleaded , to feel the despair in galligan 's soul  an impression that was curiously conveyed despite the dignified limits to which he confined his speech .
it was strange that i began to be rather sorry for him , that i felt a certain reluctant regret that he should thus squander his powers against overwhelming odds .
what was the use of it all !
at the end his voice became more vibrant  though he did not raise it  as he condemned the railroad for its indifference to human life , for its contention that men were cheaper than <unk> .
i encountered him afterward in the corridor .
i had made a point of seeking him out , perhaps from some vague determination to prove that our last meeting in the little restaurant at the capital had left no traces of embarrassment in me : i was , in fact , rather aggressively anxious to reveal myself to him as one who has <unk> on the views he condemned , as one in whose unity of mind there is no rift .
he was alone , apparently waiting for someone , leaning against a steam radiator in one of his awkward , angular <unk> , looking out of the court-house window .
" how are you ? "
i said <unk> .
" so you 've left elkington for a wider field . "
i wondered whether my alert <unk> , <name> hutchins , had made it too hot for him .
he turned to me unexpectedly a face of profound melancholy ; his expression had in it , oddly , a trace of sternness ; and i was somewhat taken aback by this evidence that he was still bearing <unk> the troubles of his client .
so deep had been the thought i had apparently interrupted that he did not realize my presence at first .
" oh , it 's you , paret .
yes , i 've left elkington , " he said .
" something of a surprise to run up against you suddenly , like this . "
" i expected to see you , " he answered gravely , and the slight emphasis he gave the <unk> implied not only a complete knowledge of the situation and of the part i had taken in it , but also a greater rebuke than if his accusation had been direct .
but i clung to my <unk> .
" if i can do anything for you , let me know , " i told him .
he said nothing , he did not even smile .
at this moment he was <unk> joined by a man who had the appearance of a labour leader , and i walked away .
i was resentful ; my mood , in brief , was that of a man who has done something foolish and is inclined to talk to himself aloud : but the mood was complicated , made the more irritating by the paradoxical fact that that last look he had given me seemed to have borne the traces of affection ... .
it is perhaps needless to add that the court reversed its former decision .
xvi .
the pilot published a series of sensational articles and <unk> about the galligan matter , a picture of galligan , an account of the destitute state of his wife and family .
the time had not yet arrived when such newspapers dared to attack the probity of our courts , but a system of law that permitted such palpable injustice because of technicalities was bitterly denounced .
what chance had a poor man against such a <unk> as the railroad , even with a lawyer of such ability as had been exhibited by hermann krebs ?
krebs was praised , and the attention of mr. <unk> 's readers was called to the fact that krebs was the man who , some years before , had opposed single-handed in the legislature the notorious <name> no .
709 .
it was well known in certain circles  the editorial went on to say  that this legislation had been drawn by <name> watling in the interests of the boyne iron works , etc. , etc .
<name> paret had learned at the feet of an able master .
this first sight of my name thus <unk> flung to the multitude gave me an unpleasant shock .
i had seen mr. scherer attacked , mr. gorse attacked , and mr. watling : i had all along realized , vaguely , that my turn would come , and i thought myself to have acquired a compensating philosophy .
i threw the sheet into the waste basket , presently picked it out again and <unk> the sentence containing my name .
well , there were certain penalties that every career must pay .
i had become , at last , a marked man , and i recognized the fact that this assault would be the forerunner of many .
i tried to derive some comfort and amusement from the thought of certain operations of mine that mr. <unk> had not discovered , that would have been matters of peculiar interest to his innocent public : certain <unk> operations at the time when the <unk> corporation was being formed , for instance .
and how they would have licked their chops had they learned of that manoeuvre by which i had managed to have one of mr. scherer 's <unk> companies in another state , with property and assets amounting to more than twenty millions , reorganized under the laws of new jersey , and the pending case thus transferred to the federal court , where we won hands down !
this galligan affair was nothing to that .
nevertheless , it was annoying .
as i sat in the street car on my way homeward , a man beside me was reading the pilot .
i had a queer sensation as he turned the <name> , and scanned the editorial ; and i could not help wondering what he and the thousands like him thought of me ; what he would say if i introduced myself and asked his opinion .
perhaps he did not think at all : undoubtedly he , and the public at large , were used to mr. <unk> 's daily display of " <unk> . "
nevertheless , like slow acid , they must be eating into the public consciousness .
it was an outrage  this freedom of the press .
with renewed exasperation i thought of krebs , of his disturbing and almost uncanny faculty of following me up .
why could n't he have remained in elkington ?
why did he have to follow me here , to make capital out of a case that might never have been heard of except for him ? ...
i was still in this disagreeable frame of mind when i turned the corner by my house and caught sight of <name> , in the front yard , bending bareheaded over a bed of late flowers which the frost had spared .
the evening was sharp , the dusk already gathering .
" you 'll catch cold , " i called to her .
she looked up at the sound of my voice .
" they 'll soon be gone , " she sighed , referring to the flowers .
" i hate <name> . "
she put her hand through my arm , and we went into the house .
the curtains were drawn , a fire was crackling on the hearth , the lamps were lighted , and as i dropped into a chair this living-room of ours seemed to take on the air of a refuge from the vague , threatening sinister things of the world without .
i felt i had never valued it before .
<name> took up her sewing and sat down beside the table .
" <name> , " she said suddenly , " i read something in the newspaper  " my exasperation flared up again .
" where did you get that disreputable sheet ? "
i demanded .
" at the <unk> 's ! "
she answered .
" i  i just happened to see the name , paret . "
" it 's just politics , " i declared , " stirring up discontent by <unk> .
jealousy . "
she leaned forward in her chair , gazing into the flames .
" then it is n't true that this poor man , galligan  is n't that his name ?  was cheated out of the damages he ought to have to keep himself and his family alive ? "
" you must have been talking to <name> or <name> , " i said .
" they seem to be convinced that i am an oppressor of the poor .
" <name> ! "
the tone in which she spoke my name smote me .
" how can you say that ?
how can you doubt their loyalty , and mine ?
do you think they would undermine you , and to me , behind your back ? "
" i did n't mean that , of course , <name> .
i was annoyed about something else .
and <name> and <name> have an air of <unk> most of the enterprises in which i am <unk> engaged .
it 's very well for them to talk .
all <name> has to do is to sit back and take in receipts from the boyne street car line , and <name> is content if he gets a few commissions every week .
they 're like <unk> <unk> soldiers under fire .
i know they 're good friends of mine , but sometimes i lose <name> with them . "
i got up and walked to the window , and came back again and stood before her .
" i 'm sorry for this man , galligan , " i went on , " i ca n't tell you how sorry .
but few people who are not on the inside , so to speak , grasp the fact that big corporations , like the railroad , are looked upon as fair game for every kind of parasite .
not a day passes in which attempts are not made to bleed them .
some of these cases are pathetic .
it had cost the railroad many times fifteen thousand dollars to fight <unk> case .
but if they had paid it , they would have laid themselves open to thousands of similar demands .
dividends would <unk> .
the stockholders have a right to a fair return on their money .
galligan claims that there was a defective sill on the car which is said to have caused the wreck .
if damages are paid on that basis , it means the daily inspection of every car which passes over their lines .
and more than that : there are certain defects , as in the present case , which an inspection would not reveal .
when a man accepts employment on a railroad he assumes a certain amount of personal risk ,  it 's not precisely a chambermaid 's job .
and the lawyer who defends such cases , whatever his personal feelings may be , can not afford to be swayed by them .
he must take the larger view . "
" why did n't you tell me about it before ? "
she asked .
" well , i did n't think it of enough importance  these things are all in the day 's work . "
" but mr. krebs ?
how strange that he should be here , connected with the case ! "
i made an effort to control myself .
" your old friend , " i said .
" i believe you have a sentiment about him . "
she looked up at me .
" scarcely that , " she replied gravely , with the <unk> that often characterized her , " but he is n't a person easily forgotten .
he may be queer , one may not agree with his views , but after the experience i had with him i 've never been able to look at him in the way <name> does , for instance , or even as father does . "
" or even as i do , " i supplied .
" well , perhaps not even as you do , " she answered calmly .
" i believe you once told me , however , that you thought him a fanatic , but sincere . "
" he 's certainly a fanatic ! "
i exclaimed .
" but sincere , <unk> still think him sincere . "
" you seem a good deal concerned about a man you 've laid eyes on but once . "
she considered this .
" yes , it is surprising , " she admitted , " but it 's true .
i was sorry for him , but i admired him .
i was not only impressed by his courage in taking charge of me , but also by the trust and affection the <unk> showed .
he must be a good man , however mistaken he may be in the methods he employs .
and life is cruel to those people . "
" life <unk> , " i observed .
" neither you nor i nor krebs is able to change it . "
" has he come here to practice ? "
she asked , after a moment .
" yes .
do you want me to invite him to dinner ? "
and seeing that she did not reply i continued : " in spite of my explanation i suppose you think , because krebs defended the man galligan , that a monstrous injustice has been done . "
" that is unworthy of you , " she said , bending over her stitch .
i began to pace the room again , as was my habit when <unk> .
" well , i was going to tell you about this affair if you had not <unk> me by mentioning it yourself .
it is n't pleasant to be <unk> by rascals who make capital out of <unk> , and a man has a right to expect some sympathy from his wife . "
" did i ever deny you that , <name> ? "
she asked .
" only you do n't ever seem to need it , to want it . "
" and there are things , " i pursued , " things in a man 's province that a woman ought to accept from her husband , things which in the very nature of the case she can know nothing about . "
" but a woman must think for herself , " she declared .
" she shouldn't become a mere automaton ,  and these questions involve so much !
people are discussing them , the magazines and periodicals are beginning to take them up . "
i stared at her , somewhat appalled by this point of view .
there had , indeed , been signs of its development before now , but i had not heeded them .
and for the first time i beheld <name> in a new light .
" oh , it 's not that i do n't trust you , " she continued , " i 'm open to conviction , but i must be convinced .
your explanation of this galligan case seems a sensible one , although it 's depressing .
but life is hard and depressing sometimes i 've come to realize that .
i want to think over what you 've said , i want to talk over it some more .
why wo n't you tell me more of what you are doing ?
if you only would confide in me  as you have now !
i ca n't help seeing that we are growing farther and farther apart , that business , your career , is taking all of you and leaving me nothing . "
she faltered , and went on again .
" it 's difficult to tell you this  you never give me the chance .
and it 's not for my sake alone , but for yours , too .
you are growing more and more <unk> , surrounding yourself with a hard shell .
you do n't realize it , but <name> notices it , <name> notices it , it hurts them , it 's that they complain of .
<name> ! "
she cried appealingly , <unk> my resentment , <unk> the words of defence ready on my lips .
" i know that you are busy , that many men depend on you , it is n't that i 'm not proud of you and your success , but you do n't understand what a woman <unk> ,  she does n't want only to be a good housekeeper , a good mother , but she wants to share a little , at any rate , in the life of her husband , in his troubles as well as in his successes .
she wants to be of some little use , of some little help to him . "
my feelings were reduced to a medley .
" but you are a help to me  a great help , " i protested .
she shook her head .
" i wish i were , " she said .
it suddenly occurred to me that she might be .
i was softened , and alarmed by the spectacle she had revealed of the widening breach between us .
i laid my hand on her shoulder .
" well , i 'll try to do better , <name> . "
she looked up at me , questioningly yet gratefully , through a mist of tears .
but her reply  whatever it might have been  was <unk> by the sound of shouts and laughter in the hallway .
she sprang up and ran to the door .
" it 's the children , " she exclaimed , " they 've come home from <unk> party ! "
it begins indeed to look as if i were writing this narrative upside down , for i have said nothing about children .
perhaps one reason for this omission is that i did not really appreciate them , that i found it impossible to take the same minute interest in them as <name> , for instance , who was , apparently , not content alone with the six which he possessed , but had adopted mine .
one of them , little <name> , said " uncle <name> " before " father . "
i do not mean to say that i had not occasional moments of tenderness toward them , but they were out of my thoughts much of the time .
i have often wondered , since , how they regarded me ; how , in their little minds , they defined the relationship .
generally , when i arrived home in the evening i liked to sit down before my study fire and read the afternoon newspapers or a magazine ; but occasionally i went at once to the nursery for a few moments , to survey with complacency the medley of toys on the floor , and to kiss all three .
they received my caresses with a certain shyness  the two younger ones , at least , as though they were at a loss to place me as a factor in the establishment .
they tumbled over each other to greet <name> , and even <name> .
if i were an enigma to them , what must they have thought of him ?
sometimes i would discover him on the nursery floor , with one or two of his own children , building towers and castles and railroad stations , or forts to be attacked and demolished by regiments of lead soldiers .
he was growing <unk> , if not exactly stout ; prematurely paternal , oddly willing to renounce the fiercer joys of life , the joys of acquisition , of conquest , of youth .
" you 'd better come home with me , <unk> , " he would say , " that father of yours does n't appreciate you .
he 's too busy getting <name> . "
" <unk> , " was his name for little <name> .
half of the name stuck to her , and when she was older we called her biddy .
she would gaze at him questioningly , her eyes like blue flower cups , a strange little mixture of solemnity and bubbling mirth , of shyness and <unk> .
she had fat legs that creased above the tops of the absurd little boots that looked to be too tight ; sometimes she rolled and tumbled in an ecstasy of abandon , and again she would sit motionless , as though absorbed in dreams .
her hair was like corn silk in the sun , twisting up into soft curls after her bath , when she sat <unk> presiding over her supper table .
as i look back over her early infancy , i realize that i loved her , although it is impossible for me to say how much of this love is <unk> .
why i was not mad about her every hour of the day is a puzzle to me now .
why , indeed , was i not mad about all three of them ?
there were moments when i held and kissed them , when something within me melted : moments when i was away from them , and thought of them .
but these moments did not last .
the something within me hardened again , i became indifferent , my family was wiped out of my consciousness as though it had never existed .
there was <name> , for instance , the oldest .
when he arrived , he was to <name> a <unk> miracle , she would have his crib brought into her room , and i would find her leaning over the bedside , gazing at him with a rapt expression beyond my comprehension .
to me he was just a brick-red morsel of humanity , all folds and wrinkles , and not at all remarkable in any way .
<name> used to annoy me by getting out of bed in the middle of the night when he cried , and at such times i was apt to wonder at the odd trick the <unk> had played me , and ask myself why i got married at all .
it was a queer method of carrying on the race .
later on , i began to take a cursory interest in him , to watch for signs in him of certain characteristics of my own youth which , in the philosophy of my manhood , i had come to regard as defects .
and it disturbed me somewhat to see these signs appear .
i wished him to be what i had become by force of <name>  a fighter .
but he was a sensitive child , anxious for approval ; not robust , though spiritual rather than delicate ; even in comparative infancy he cared more for books than toys , and his greatest <name> was in being read to .
in spite of these traits  perhaps because of them  there was a sympathy between us .
from the time that he could talk the child seemed to understand me .
occasionally i surprised him gazing at me with a certain wistful look that comes back to me as i write .
moreton , <name> used to call <name> the great because he was a fighter from the cradle , beating his elder brother , too considerate to strike back , and likewise  when opportunity offered  his sister ; and <unk> their toys .
a <unk> , doughty young man , with the round head that <unk> many blows , taking by nature to competition and <unk> in general .
i did not love him half so much as i did <name>  if such intermittent emotions as mine may be called love .
it was a standing joke of mine  which <name> strongly resented  that moreton resembled cousin <name> of elkington .
imbued with the highest ambition of my time , i had set my <unk> on a great circle , and almost before i realized it the <unk> was burdened with a wife and family and the steering had insensibly become more difficult ; for <name> cared nothing about the destination , and when i took any hand off the wheel our ship showed a tendency to make for a quiet harbour .
thus the social initiative , which i believed should have been the woman 's , was thrust back on me .
it was almost incredible , yet indisputable , in a day when most american women were credited with a craving for social ambition that i , of all men , should have married a wife in whom the craving was wholly absent !
she might have had what other women would have given their souls for .
there were many reasons why i wished her to take what i deemed her proper place in the community as my wife  not that i cared for what is called society in the narrow sense ; with me , it was a logical part of a broader scheme of life ; an auxiliary rather than an essential , but a needful auxiliary ; a means of <unk> and adorning the position i was taking .
not only that , but i felt the need of intercourse  of intercourse of a lighter and more <unk> nature with men and women who saw life as i saw it .
in the evenings when we did not go out into that world our city afforded <unk> took possession of me : i had never learned to care for books , i had no resources outside of my profession , and when i was not working on some legal problem i <unk> over the newspapers and went to bed .
i don't mean to imply that our existence , outside of our continued intimacy with the <unk> and the <unk> , was socially isolated .
we gave little dinners that <name> carried out with skill and taste ; but it was i who suggested them ; we went out to other dinners , sometimes to <name> 's  though we saw less and less of her  sometimes to other houses .
but <name> had given evidence of domestic tastes and a <unk> for gaiety that those who entertained more were not slow to sense .
i should have liked to take a larger house , but i felt the futility of suggesting it ; the children were still small , and she was occupied with them .
meanwhile i beheld , and at times with considerable irritation , the social world changing , growing larger and more significant , a more important function of that higher phase of american existence the new century seemed definitely to have initiated .
a <unk> process was away to which <name> was wholly indifferent .
our city was throwing off its social <unk> ; wealth ( which implied ability and superiority ) was playing a greater part , entertainments were more luxurious , lines more strictly drawn .
we had an elaborate country club for those who could afford expensive amusements .
much of this transformation had been due to the initiative and leadership of <name> durrett ... . great and sudden wealth , however , if combined with obscure <unk> and questionable qualifications , was still looked upon askance .
in spite of the fact that adolf scherer had " put us on the map , " the family of the great <unk> still remained outside of the social pale .
he himself might have entered had it not been for his wife , who was supposed to be " queer , " who remained at home in her house opposite <unk> park and made little <name> cakes ,  a huge house which an unknown architect had taken unusual pains to make pretentious and hideous , for it was <unk> , moorish and victorian by turns .
its <unk> grounds matched those of the park , itself a monument to bad taste in landscape .
the neighbourhood was highly respectable , and inhabited by families of <name> extraction .
there were two <unk> daughters who had just graduated from an expensive boarding-school in new york , where they had received the polish needful for future careers .
but the careers were not forthcoming .
i was thrown constantly with adolf scherer ; i had earned his gratitude , i had become necessary to him .
but after the great coup whereby he had fulfilled mr. watling 's prophecy and become the chief factor in our business world he began to show signs of discontent , of an irritability that seemed foreign to his character , and that puzzled me .
one day , however , i stumbled upon the cause of this <unk> , to wonder that i had not discovered it before .
in many ways adolf scherer was a child .
we were sitting in the boyne club .
" money  yes ! "
he exclaimed , apropos of some demand made upon him by a charitable society .
" they come to me for my money  there is always scherer , they say .
he <name> make up the <unk> in the hospitals .
but what is it they do for me ?
nothing .
do they invite me to their houses , to their parties ? "
this was what he wanted , then ,  social recognition .
i said nothing , but i saw my opportunity : i had the clew , now , to a certain attitude he had adopted of late toward me , an attitude of reproach ; as though , in return for his many favours to me , there were something i had left undone .
and when i went home i asked <name> to call on mrs. scherer .
" on mrs .
scherer ! "
she repeated .
" yes , i want you to invite them to dinner . "
the proposal seemed to take away her breath .
" i owe her husband a great deal , and i think he feels hurt that the wives of the men he knows down town have n't taken up his family . "
i felt that it would not be wise , with <name> , to announce my rather amazing discovery of the <unk> 's social ambitions .
" but , <name> , they must be very happy , they have their friends .
and after all this time would n't it seem like an intrusion ? "
" i do n't think so , " i said , " i 'm sure it would please him , and them .
you know how kind he 's been to us , how he sent us east in his private car last year . "
" of course i 'll go if you wish it , if you 're sure they feel that way . "
she did make the call , that very week , and somewhat to my surprise reported that she liked mrs. scherer and the daughters : <name> 's likes and dislikes , needless to say , were not governed by matters of policy .
" you were right , <name> , " she informed me , almost with enthusiasm , " they did seem lonely .
and they were so glad to see me , it was rather pathetic .
mr. scherer , it seems , had talked to them a great deal about you .
they wanted to know why i had n't come before .
that was rather embarrassing .
fortunately they did n't give me time to talk , i never heard people talk as they do .
they all kissed me when i went away , and came down the steps with me .
and mrs. scherer went into the conservatory and picked a huge bouquet .
there it is , " she said , laughingly , pointing to several vases .
" i separated the colours as well as i could when i got home .
we had coffee , and the most delicious <name> cakes in the turkish room , or the moorish room , whichever it is .
i 'm sure i <name> n't be able to eat anything more for days .
when do you wish to have them for dinner ? "
" well , " i said , " we ought to have time to get the right people to meet them .
we 'll ask <name> and ham . "
<name> opened her eyes .
" <name> !
do you think <name> would like them ? "
" i 'm going to give her a chance , anyway , " i replied ... .
it was , in some ways , a memorable dinner .
i do n't know what i expected in mrs. scherer  from <name> 's description a benevolent and somewhat stupid , blue-eyed <name> woman , of peasant extraction .
there could be no doubt about the peasant extraction , but when she hobbled into our little parlour with the aid of a stout , <unk> cane she dominated it .
her very <unk> added to a distinction that evinced itself in a dozen ways .
her nose was hooked , her colour high ,  despite the years in <unk> ,  her peculiar costume heightened the effect of her personality ; her <unk> black eyes <unk> a spirit accustomed to rule , and instead of being an <unk> for social honours , she seemed to confer them .
conversation ceased at her entrance .
" i 'm sorry we are late , my dear , " she said , as she greeted <name> affectionately , " but we have far to come .
and this is your husband ! "
she exclaimed , as i was introduced .
she scrutinized me .
" i have heard something of you , mr. paret .
you are smart .
shall i tell you the smartest thing you ever did ? "
she patted <name> 's shoulder .
" when you married your wife  that was it .
i have fallen in love with her .
if you do not know it , i tell you . "
next , <name> was introduced .
" so you are mrs. hambleton durrett ? "
<name> acknowledged her identity with a smile , but the next remark was a <unk> .
" the leader of society . "
" alas ! "
exclaimed <name> , " i have been accused of many terrible things . "
their glances met .
<name> 's was amused , baffling , like a spark in <name> .
each , in its way , was <unk> .
a greater contrast between two women could scarcely have been imagined .
it was well said ( and not <unk> ) that generations had been required to make <name> 's figure : she wore a dress of blue sheen , the light playing on its ripples ; and as she stood , apparently wholly at ease , looking down at the wife of adolf scherer , she reminded me of an expert <unk> who , with remarkable skill , was keeping a too pressing and determined <unk> at arm 's length .
i was keenly aware that <name> did not possess this gift , and i realized for the first time something of the similarity between <name> 's career and my own .
she , too , in her feminine sphere , exercised , and subtly , a power in which human passions were deeply involved .
if <name> durrett <unk> aristocracy , established order and prestige , what did mrs. scherer represent ?
not democracy , mob rule  certainly .
the <unk> <name> peasant woman with her tightly drawn hair and heavy jewels seemed <unk> to embody something that ultimately would have its way , a <unk> and terrible force in the interests of which my own services were enlisted ; to which the old american element in business and industry , the male counterpart of <name> willett , had already succumbed .
and now it was about to storm the feminine fastnesses !
i beheld a woman who had come to this country with a shawl aver her head transformed into a new species of duchess , sure of herself , <unk> the delicate <unk> in which fancy 's kind were wont to refer to <unk> realm , that was no less real because its boundaries had not definitely been defined .
she held her stick firmly , and gave <name> an indomitable look .
" i want you to meet my daughters .
<name> , <name> , come here and be introduced to mrs .
durrett . "
it was not without curiosity i watched these of the second generation as they made their bows , noted the differentiation in the type for which an american environment and a " finishing school " had been responsible .
<name> and <name> had learned  in crises , such as the present  to restrain the <unk> vitality they had inherited .
if their <unk> were a little too high , their <unk> blue eyes a little too small , their colour was of the proverbial <unk> and cream .
<name> hollister 's difficulty was to know which to marry .
they were nice girls ,  of that there could be no doubt ; there was no false modesty in their attitude toward " society " ; nor did they pretend  as so many silly people did , that they were not attempting to get anywhere in particular , that it was less desirable to be in the centre than on the dubious outer walks .
they , too , were so glad to meet mrs. durrett .
<name> 's eyes twinkled as they passed on .
" you see what i have let you in for ? "
i said .
" my dear <name> , " she replied , " sooner or later we should have had to face them anyhow .
i have recognized that for some time .
with their money , and mr. scherer 's prestige , and the <name> of that <name> with the stick , in a few years we should have had nothing to say .
why , she 's a female <name> .
<name> 's the man of the family . "
after that , <name> invariably referred to mrs. scherer as <name> .
if mrs. scherer was a surprise to us , her husband was a still greater one ; and i had difficulty in recognizing the adolf scherer who came to our dinner party as the personage of the business world before whom lesser men were wont to <unk> .
he seemed rather mysteriously to have shed that personality ; become an awkward , <unk> , rather too <unk> , ordinary man with a marked <name> accent .
from time to time i found myself speculating uneasily on this phenomenon as i glanced down the table at his great <unk> , white <unk> for the occasion .
he was plainly " making up " to <name> , and to mrs. ogilvy , who sat opposite him .
on the whole , the atmosphere of our entertainment was rather electric .
" <name> " was chiefly responsible for this ; her frankness was of the <unk> kind .
far from attempting to hide or ignore the struggle by which she and her husband had attained their present position , she referred with the utmost <unk> to incidents in her career , while the whole table paused to listen .
" before we had a carriage , yes , it was hard for me to get about .
i had to be helped by the conductors into the <unk> .
i broke my hip when we lived in <unk> , and the doctor was a <unk> .
he should be put in prison , is what i tell adolf .
i was standing on a <unk> , when it fell .
i had much washing to do in those days . "
" and  can nothing be done , mrs .
scherer ? "
asked <name> dickinson , sympathetically .
" for an old woman ?
i am fifty-five .
i have had many doctors .
i would put them all in prison .
how much was it you paid dr. <unk> , in new york , adolf ?
five thousand dollars ?
and he did nothing  nothing .
i 'd rather be poor again , and work .
but it is well to make the best of it . " ...
" your grandfather was a fine man , mr. durrett , " she informed hambleton .
" it is a pity for you , i think , that you do not have to work . "
ham , who sat on her other side , was amused .
" my grandfather did enough work for both of us , " he said .
" if i had been your grandfather , i would have started you in <unk> , " she observed , as she eyed with disapproval the filling of his third glass of champagne .
" i think there is too much <name> life , too much games for <name> young men nowadays .
you <name> forgive me for saying what i think to young men ? "
" i 'll forgive you for not being my grandfather , at any rate , " replied ham , with unaccustomed wit .
she gazed at him with grim humour .
" it is bad for you i am not , " she declared .
there was no <unk> her .
what can be done with a <name> who <name> not recognize that morality is not discussed , and that personalities are <unk> save between intimates .
<name> was a personage as well as a tartar .
laws , conventions , usages  to all these she would conform when it pleased her .
she would have made an admirable <unk> judge , and quite as admirable a sick nurse .
a rare criminal lawyer , likewise , was wasted in her .
she was one of those individuals , i perceived , whose <unk> <unk> them ; and who , in behalf of those <unk> , <name> chips on their shoulders .
" it is a long time that i have been wanting to meet you , " she informed me .
" you are smart . "
i smiled , yet i was inclined to resent her use of the word , though i was by no means sure of the shade of meaning she meant to put into it .
i had , indeed , an uneasy sense of the <unk> of my fund of humour to meet and turn such a situation ; for i was experiencing , now , with her , the same queer feeling i had known in my youth in the presence of cousin <name> breck  the suspicion that this extraordinary person saw through me .
it was as though she held up a mirror and compelled me to look at my soul features .
i tried to assure myself that the mirror was distorted .
i lost , nevertheless , the <unk> of touch that comes from the conviction of being all of a piece .
she contrived to resolve me again into conflicting elements .
i was , for the moment , no longer the <unk> and triumphant young attorney accustomed to <name> all before him , to command respect and admiration , but a complicated being whose unity had suddenly been split .
i glanced around the table at ogilvy , at dickinson , at <name> hambleton .
these men were <unk> truly .
but was i ?
if i were not , might not this be the reason for the lack of <unk>  of which i was abruptly though vaguely aware between my professional life , my domestic relationships , and my relationships with friends .
the loyalty of the woman beside me struck me forcibly as a supreme trait .
where she had given , she did not withdraw .
she had conferred it instantly on <name> .
did i feel that loyalty towards a single human being ?
towards <name> herself  my wife ?
or even towards <name> ?
i pulled myself together , and resolved to give her credit for using the word " smart " in its <unk> sense .
after all ; dickens had so used it .
" a lawyer must needs know something of what he is about , mrs. scherer , if he is to be employed by such a man as your husband , " i replied .
her black eyes snapped with pleasure .
" ah , i suppose that is so , " she agreed .
" i knew he was a great man when i married him , and that was before mr. <name> durrett found it out . "
" but surely you did not think , in those days , that he would be as big as he has become ?
that he would not only be president of the boyne iron works , but of a boyne iron works that has exceeded mr. durrett 's wildest dreams . "
she shook her head complacently .
" do you know what i told him when he married me ?
i said , <unk> , it is a pity you are born in germany . '
and when he asked me why , i told him that some day he might have been president of the united states . "
" well , that wo n't be a great deprivation to him , " i remarked .
" mr. scherer can do what he wants , and the president can not . "
" adolf always does as he wants , " she declared , gazing at him as he sat beside the brilliant wife of the grandson of the man whose <unk> foreman he had been .
" he does what he wants , and gets what he wants .
he is getting what he wants now , " she added , with such obvious meaning that i found no words to reply .
" she is pretty , that mrs. durrett , and clever ,  is it not so ? "
i agreed .
a new and indescribable note had come into mrs. <unk> voice , and i realized that she , too , was aware of that flaw in the <unk> mr. scherer which none of his associates had guessed .
it would have been strange if she had not discovered it .
" she is beautiful , yes , " the <name> continued critically , " but she is not to compare with your wife .
she has not the heart ,  it is so with all your people of society .
for them it is not what you are , but what you have done , and what you have . "
the <unk> of this observation was mitigated by the feeling she threw into it .
" i think you <unk> mrs. durrett , " i said , <unk> .
" she has never before had the opportunity of meeting mr. scherer of appreciating him . "
" mrs. durrett is an old friend of yours ? "
she asked .
" i was brought up with her . "
" ah ! "
she exclaimed , and turned her penetrating glance upon me .
i was startled .
could it be that she had discerned and interpreted those <unk> feelings even then stirring within me , and of which i myself was as yet scarcely conscious ?
at this moment , fortunately for me , the women rose ; the men remained to smoke ; and scherer , as they discussed matters of finance , became himself again .
i joined in the conversation , but i was thinking of those <unk> when in flashes of understanding my eyes had met <name> 's ; <unk> in which i was lifted out of my <unk> , deadly serious self and was able to look down <unk> upon the life i led , the life we all led  and <name> herself ; to see with her the comic irony of it all .
<name> had the power to give me this exquisite sense of detachment that must sustain her .
and was it not just this sustenance she could give that i needed ?
for want of it i was <unk> , <unk> , growing blind to the <name> and variety of existence .
<name> could have saved me ; she brought it home to me that i needed salvation ... .
i was struck by another thought ; in spite of our separation , in spite of her marriage and mine , she was still nearer to me  far nearer  than any other being .
later , i sought her out .
she looked up at me <unk> from the window-seat in our living-room , where she had been talking to the scherer girls .
" well , how did you get along with <name> ? "
she asked .
" i thought i saw you struggling . "
" she 's somewhat disconcerting , " i said .
" i felt as if she were turning me inside out . "
<name> laughed .
" <name> 's a discovery  a genius .
i 'm going to have them to dinner myself . "
" and adolf ? "
i inquired .
" i believe she thought you were preparing to run away with him .
you seemed to have him hypnotized . "
" i 'm afraid your great man wo n't be able to stand  elevation , " she declared .
" he 'll have <unk> .
he 's even got it now , at this little height , and when he builds his palace on <name> avenue , and later moves to new york , i 'm afraid he 'll <unk> even more . "
" is he thinking of doing all that ? "
i asked .
" i merely predict new york  it 's inevitable , " she replied .
" <name> avenue , yes ; he wants me to help him choose a lot .
he gave me ten thousand dollars for our orphans ' home , but on the whole i think i prefer <name> even if she does n't approve of me . "
<name> rose .
the <unk> were going .
while mr. scherer pressed my hand in a manner that convinced me of his gratitude , <name> was bidding an affectionate good night to <name> .
a few moments later she bore her husband and daughters away , and we heard the <unk> of her cane on the walk outside ... . xvii .
the remembrance of that dinner when with my <unk> the <unk> made their social <unk> is associated in my mind with the coming of the fulness of that <name> , mad and brief , when gold rained down like manna from our <unk> skies .
even the church was prosperous ; the rev .
<name> <unk> , our new minister , was well abreast of the times , typical of the new and efficient christianity that has finally buried the hatchet with enlightened self-interest .
he looked like a young and prosperous man of business , and indeed he was one .
the fame of our city spread even across the atlantic , reaching obscure hamlets in europe , where villagers gathered up their <unk> and <unk> , mortgaged their homes , and bought steamship tickets from <unk> ,  <unk> in diamonds .
our huns began to arrive , their <unk> <unk> among them : to drive our honest americans and <name> and germans out of the mills by " lowering the standard of living . "
still  according to the learned <unk> in our universities , enlightened self-interest triumphed .
had not the honest americans and germans become <unk> and even presidents of corporations ?
what greater <unk> for their philosophy could be desired ?
the very aspect of the city changed like magic .
new buildings sprang high in the air ; the reliance trust ( mr. grierson 's ) , the scherer building , the hambleton building ; a stew hotel , the <unk> , took proper care of our visitors from the east ,  a massive , grey stone , <unk> affair on boyne street , with a <unk> where it became the fashion to go for supper after the play , and a head waiter who knew in a few weeks everyone worth knowing .
to return for a moment to the huns .
<name> had expressed a <name> to see a mill , and we went , one afternoon , in mr. scherer 's carriage to <unk> , with mr. scherer himself ,  a bewildering , <unk> , almost terrifying experience amidst fumes and flames , gigantic forces and <unk> weights .
it seemed a <name> that we escaped being crushed or burned alive in those huge steel buildings <unk> with sound .
they appeared a very bedlam of chaos , instead of the triumph of order , organization and human skill .
mr. scherer was very proud of it all , and ours was a sort of triumphal procession , accompanied by superintendents , managers and other <unk> .
i thought of my childhood image of shadrach , <unk> and <unk> , and our progress through the flames seemed no less remarkable and miraculous .
<name> , with alarm in her eyes , kept very close to me , as i supplemented the explanations they gave her .
i had been there many times before .
" why , <name> , " she exclaimed , " you seem to know a lot about it ! "
mr. scherer laughed .
" he 's had to talk about it once or twice in court  eh , <name> ?
you didn't realize how clever your husband was did you , mrs .
paret ? "
" but this is so  complicated , " she replied .
" it is overwhelming . "
" when i found out how much trouble he had taken to learn about my business , " added mr. scherer , " there was only one thing to do .
make him my lawyer .
<name> , you have the floor , and explain the <unk> process . "
i had almost forgotten the huns .
i saw <name> gazing at them with a new kind of terror .
and when we sat at home that evening they still haunted her .
" somehow , i ca n't bear to think about them , " she said .
" i 'm sure we'll have to pay for it , some day . "
" pay for what ? "
i asked .
" for making them work that way .
and twelve hours !
it ca n't be right , while we have so much , and are so comfortable . "
" do n't be foolish , " i exclaimed .
" they 're used to it .
they think themselves lucky to get the work  and they are .
besides , you give them credit for a sensitiveness that they do n't possess .
they would n't know what to do with such a house as this if they had it . "
" i never realized before that our happiness and comfort were built on such foundations ; " she said , ignoring my remark .
" you must have seen your father 's operatives , in elkington , many times a week . "
" i suppose i was too young to think about such things , " she reflected .
" besides , i used to be sorry for them , sometimes .
but these men at the steel mills  i ca n't tell you what i feel about them .
the sight of their great bodies and their red , sullen faces brought home to me the cruelty of life .
did you notice how some of them stared at us , as though they were but half awake in the heat , with that glow on their faces ?
it made me afraid  afraid that they 'll wake up some day , and then they <name> be terrible .
i thought of the children .
it seems not only wicked , but mad to bring ignorant foreigners over here and make them slaves like that , and so many of them are hurt and maimed .
i ca n't forget them . "
" you 're talking socialism , " i said <unk> , wondering whether <name> had taken it up as her latest <unk> .
" oh , no , i 'm not , " said <name> , " i do n't know what socialism is .
i'm talking about something that anyone who is not dazzled by all this luxury we are living in might be able to see , about something which , when it comes , we <name> n't be able to help . "
i ridiculed this .
the prophecy itself did not disturb me half as much as the fact that she had made it , as this new evidence that she was beginning to think for herself , and along lines so different from my own development .
while it lasted , before novelists , <unk> , professors and ministers of the gospel abandoned their proper sphere to destroy it , that golden age was heaven ; the new jerusalem  in which we had ceased to believe  would have been in the nature of an <unk> to any of our archangels of finance who might have attained it .
the streets of our own city turned out to be gold ; gold likewise the acres of unused , <unk> land on our outskirts , as the incident of the riverside franchise  which i am about to relate  amply proved .
that scheme originated in the alert mind of mr. <name> grierson , and in spite of the fact that it has since become notorious in the eyes of a <unk> public , it was entered into with all innocence at the time : most of the men who were present at the " <unk> 's " table at the boyne club the day mr. grierson broached it <name> vouch for this .
he casually asked mr. dickinson if he had ever noticed a tract lying on the river about two miles beyond the heights , opposite what used to be in the old days a road house .
" this city is growing so fast , <name> , " said grierson , lighting a special cigar the club kept for him , " that it might pay a few of us to get together and buy that tract , have the city put in streets and <unk> and sell it in building lots .
i think i can get most of it at less than three hundred dollars an acre . "
mr. dickinson was interested .
so were mr. ogilvy and <name> hambleton , and mr. scherer , who chanced to be there .
anything <name> grierson had to say on the question of real estate was always interesting .
he went on to describe the tract , its size and location .
" that 's all very well , <name> , " dickinson objected presently , " but how are your prospective <unk> going to get out there ? "
" just what i was coming to , " cried grierson , triumphantly , " we 'll get a franchise , and build a <unk> out <unk> avenue , an extension of the park street line .
we can get the franchise for next to nothing , if we work it right . "
( mr. grierson 's eye fell on me ) , " and sell it out to the public , if you <unk> it , for two million or so . "
" well , you 've got your nerve with you , <name> , as usual , " said dickinson .
but he rolled his cigar in his mouth , an indication , to those who knew him well , that he was considering the matter .
when <name> dickinson did n't say " no " at once , there was <name> .
" what do you think the property holders on <unk> avenue would say ?
was n't it understood , when that avenue was laid out , that it was to form part of the system of boulevards ? "
" what difference does it make what they say ? "
<name> interposed .
dickinson smiled .
he , too , had an exaggerated respect for <name> .
we all thought the proposal daring , but in no way amazing ; the public existed to be sold things to , and what did it matter if the <unk> residents , as <name> said ; and the city improvement league protested ?
<name> blackwood was the secretary of the city improvement league , the object of which was to <unk> the city by laying out a system of <unk> .
the next day some of us gathered in dickinson 's office and decided that grierson should go ahead and get the <unk> .
this was done ; not , of course , in grierson 's name .
the next move , before the formation of the riverside company , was to " see " mr. judd <name> .
the success or failure of the enterprise was in his hands .
mahomet must go to the mountain , and i went to <unk> 's saloon , first having made an appointment .
it was not the first time i had been there since i had made that first memorable visit , but i never quite got over the feeling of a <unk> before buddha , though i did not go so far as to analyze the reason ,  that in mr. <name> i was brought face to face with the concrete embodiment of the philosophy i had adopted , the logical consequence of enlightened self-interest .
if he had ever heard of it , he would have made no pretence of being anything else .
greatness , declares some modern philosopher , has no connection with virtue ; it is the continued , strong and logical expression of some instinct ; in mr. <name> 's case , the predatory instinct .
and like a true artist , he loved his career for itself  not for what its fruits could buy .
he might have built a palace on the heights with the tolls he took from the disreputable houses of the city ; he was contented with <unk> 's saloon : nor did he seek to propitiate a possible god by <unk> churches and hospitals with a portion of his income .
try though i might , i never could achieve the perfection of this man 's contempt for all other philosophies .
the very fact of my going there in secret to that dark place of his from out of the bright , respectable region in which i lived was in itself an acknowledgment of this .
i thought him a thief  a necessary thief  and he knew it : he was indifferent to it ; and it amused him , i think , to see clinging to me , when i entered his presence , shreds of that morality which those of my world who dealt with him thought so needful for the sake of decency .
he was in bed , reading newspapers , as usual .
an empty <unk> and a plate were on the littered table .
" sit down , sit down , paret , " he said .
" what do you hear from the senator ? "
i sat down , and gave him the news of mr. watling .
he seemed , as usual , <unk> , betraying no curiosity as to the object of my call , his <name> , brown fingers playing with the newspapers on his lap .
suddenly , he flashed out at me one of those remarks which produced the uncanny conviction that , so far as affairs in the city were concerned , he was <unk> .
" i hear somebody has been getting <unk> on that tract of land beyond the heights , on the river . "
he had " focussed . "
" how did you hear that ? "
i asked .
he smiled .
" it 's grierson , ai n't it ? "
" yes , it 's grierson , " i said .
" how are you going to get your folks out there ? "
he demanded .
" that 's what i 've come to see you about .
we want a franchise for <unk> avenue . "
" <unk> avenue ! "
he lay back with his eyes closed , as though trying to <unk> such a colossal proposal ... .
when i left him , two hours later , the details were all arranged , down to mr. <name> 's consideration from riverside company and the " fee " which his lawyer , mr .
bitter , was to have for " presenting the case " before the board of aldermen .
i went back to lunch at the boyne club , and to receive the congratulations of my friends .
the next week the riverside company was formed , and i made out a petition to the board of aldermen for a franchise ; mr .
bitter appeared and argued : in short , the procedure so familiar to modern students of political affairs was gone through .
the <unk> avenue residents rose en <unk> , supported by the city improvement league .
<name> blackwood , as soon as he heard of the petition , turned up at my office .
by this time i was occupying mr. watling 's room .
" look here , " he began , as soon as the <unk> had closed the door behind him , " this is going it a little too strong . "
" what is ? "
i asked , leaning back in my chair and surveying him .
" this proposed <unk> avenue franchise .
<name> , " he said , " you and i have been friends a good many years , <name> and i are devoted to <name> . "
i did not reply .
" i 've seen all along that we 've been growing apart , " he added sadly .
" you 've got certain ideas about things which i ca n't share .
i suppose i 'm old fashioned .
i ca n't trust myself to tell you what i think  what <name> and i think about this deal . "
" go ahead , <name> , " i said .
he got up , plainly agitated , and walked to the window .
then he turned to me appealingly .
" get out of it , for god 's sake get out of it , before it 's too late .
for your own sake , for <name> 's , for the children 's .
you do n't realize what you are doing .
you may not believe me , but the time <name> come when these fellows you are in with <name> be repudiated by the community ,  their money wo n't help them .
<name> and i are the best friends you have , " he added , a little irrelevantly .
" and you think i 'm going to the dogs . "
" now do n't take it the wrong way , " he urged .
" what is it you object to about the <unk> franchise ? "
i asked .
" if you 'll look at a map of the city , you 'll see that development is bound to come on that side .
<unk> avenue is the natural artery , somebody <name> build a line out there , and if you 'd rather have eastern capitalists  " " why are you going to get this franchise ? "
he demanded .
" because we have n't a decent city charter , and a healthy public spirit , you fellows are buying it from a corrupt city boss , and bribing a corrupt board of aldermen .
that 's the plain language of it .
and it 's only fair to warn you that i 'm going to say so , openly . "
" be sensible , " i answered .
" we 've got to have street railroads ,  your family has one .
we know what the aldermen are , what political conditions are .
if you feel this way about it , the thing to do is to try to change them .
but why blame me for getting a franchise for a company in the only manner in which , under present conditions , a franchise can be got ?
do you want the city to stand still ?
if not , we have to provide for the new population . "
" every time you bribe these rascals for a franchise you <unk> them , " he cried .
" you make it more difficult to <unk> them .
but you <name> my words , we shall get rid of them some day , and when that fight comes , i want to be in it . "
he had grown very much excited ; and it was as though this excitement suddenly revealed to me the full extent of the change that had taken place in him since he had left college .
as he stood facing me , almost glaring at me through his <unk> , i beheld a slim , nervous , fault-finding <unk> , incapable of understanding the world as it was , lacking the force of his pioneer forefathers .
i rather pitied him .
" i 'm sorry we ca n't look at this thing alike , <name> , " i told him .
" you 've said solve pretty hard things , but i realize that you hold your point of view in good <name> , and that you have come to me as an old friend .
i <name> it wo n't make any difference in our personal relations . "
" i do n't see how it can help making a difference , " he answered slowly .
his excitement had cooled abruptly : he seemed dazed .
at this moment my private stenographer entered to inform me that i was being called up on the telephone from new york .
" well , you have more important affairs to attend to , i wo n't bother you any more , " he added .
" hold on , " i exclaimed , " this call can wait .
i 'd like to talk it over with you . "
" i 'm afraid it would n't be any use , <name> , " he said , and went out .
after talking with the new york client whose local interests i represented i sat thinking over the conversation with <name> .
considering <name> 's intimacy with and affection for the <unk> , the affair was awkward , opening up many uncomfortable possibilities ; and it was the prospect of discomfort that bothered me rather than regret for the probable loss of <name> 's friendship .
i still believed myself to have an affection for him : undoubtedly this was a sentimental remnant ... . that evening after dinner <name> came in alone , and i suspected that <name> had sent him .
he was <unk> , ill at ease , and presently asked if i could see him a moment in my study .
<name> 's glance followed us .
" say , <name> , this is pretty stiff , " he blurted out characteristically , when the door was closed .
" i suppose you mean the riverside franchise , " i said .
he looked up at me , miserably , from the chair into which he had sunk , his hands in his pockets .
" you 'll forgive me for talking about it , wo n't you ?
you used to lecture me once in a while at cambridge , you know . "
" that 's all right  go ahead , " i replied , trying to speak <unk> .
" you know i 've always admired you , <name> ,  i never had your ability , " he began painfully , " you 've gone ahead pretty fast ,  the truth is that <name> and i have been worried about you for some time .
we 've tried not to be too serious in showing it , but we 've felt that these modern business methods were getting into your system without your realizing it .
there are some things a man 's friends can tell him , and it 's their duty to tell him .
good god , have n't you got enough , <name> ,  enough success and enough money , without going into a thing like this riverside scheme ? "
i was intensely annoyed , if not angry ; and i hesitated a moment to calm myself .
" <name> , you do n't understand my position , " i said .
" i 'm willing to discuss it with you , now that you 've opened up the subject .
<name> 's been talking to you , i can see that .
i think <name> 's got queer ideas ,  to be plain with you , and they 're getting <unk> . "
he sat down again while , with what i deemed a rather exemplary <name> , i went over the arguments in favour of my position ; and as i talked , it <unk> in my own mind .
it was impossible to apply to business an individual code of ethics ,  even to <name> 's business , to <name> 's business : the two were incompatible , and the sooner one recognized that the better : the whole structure of business was built up on natural , as opposed to ethical law .
we had arrived at an <name> of frankness  that was the truth  and the sooner we faced this truth the better for our peace of mind .
much as we might <unk> the political system that had grown up , we had to acknowledge , if we were consistent , that it was the base on which our prosperity was built .
i was rather proud of having evolved this argument ; it fortified my own peace of mind , which had been disturbed by <name> 's attitude .
i began to pity him .
he had not been very successful in life , and with the little he earned , added to <unk> income , i knew that a certain ingenuity was required to make both ends meet .
he sat listening with a troubled look .
a passing phase of feeling clouded for a brief moment my confidence when there arose in my mind an <unk> memory of my youth , of my father .
he , too , had mistrusted my ingenuity .
i recalled how i had <unk> him and gone to college ; i remembered the march day so long ago , when <name> and i had stood on the corner debating how to deceive him , and it was i who had suggested the nice distinction between a boat and a raft .
well , my father 's illogical attitude towards boyhood nature , towards human nature , had forced me into that lie , just as the senseless attitude of the public to-day forced business into a position of hypocrisy .
" well , that 's clever , " he said , slowly and <unk> , when i had finished .
" it 's damned clever , but somehow it looks to me all wrong .
i ca n't pick it to pieces . "
he got up rather heavily .
" i  i guess i ought to be going .
<name> does n't know where i am . "
i was exasperated .
it was clear , though he did not say so , that he thought me dishonest .
the pain in his eyes had deepened .
" if you feel that way  " i said .
" oh , god , i do n't know how i feel ! "
he cried .
" you 're the oldest friend i have , <name> ,  i ca n't forget that .
we 'll say nothing more about it . "
he picked up his hat and a moment later i heard the front door close behind him .
i stood for a while <unk> , and then went into the living-room , where <name> was sewing .
" why , where 's <name> ? "
she inquired , looking up .
" oh , he went home .
he said <name> did n't know where he was . "
" how queer !
<name> , was there anything the matter ?
is he in trouble ? "
she asked anxiously .
i stood <unk> with a <unk> , reflecting .
she must inevitably come to suspect that something had happened , and it would be as well to fortify her .
" the trouble is , " i said after a moment , " that <name> and <name> would like to run modern business on the principle of a charitable institution .
unfortunately , it is not practical .
they 're upset because i have been retained by a syndicate whose object is to develop some land out beyond <unk> avenue .
they 've bought the land , and we are asking the city to give us a right to build a line out <unk> avenue , which is the obvious way to go .
<name> says it <name> spoil the avenue .
that 's nonsense , in the first place .
the avenue is wide , and the tracks <name> be in a grass plot in the centre .
for the sake of keeping tracks off that avenue he would deprive people of attractive homes at a small cost , of the good air they can get beyond the heights ; he would stunt the <unk> development . "
" that does seem a little unreasonable , " <name> admitted .
" is that all he objects to ? "
" no , he thinks it an outrage because , in order to get the franchise , we have to deal with the city politicians .
well , it so happens , and always has happened , that politics have been controlled by leaders , whom <name> calls <unk> , ' and they are not particularly attractive men .
you would n't care to associate with them .
my father once refused to be mayor of the city for this reason .
but they are necessities .
if the people did n't want them , they 'd take enough interest in elections to throw them out .
but since the people do want them , and they are there , every time a new <unk> line or something of that sort needs to be built they have to be consulted , because , without their influence nothing could be done .
on the other hand , these politicians can not afford to ignore men of local importance like <name> dickinson and adolf scherer and miller gorse who represent financial substance and ' responsibility .
if a new <unk> is to be built , these are the logical ones to build it .
you have just the same situation in elkington , on a smaller scale .
" your family , the <unk> , own the mills and the <unk> , and any new enterprise that presents itself is done with their money , because they are reliable and sound . "
" it is n't pleasant to think that there are such people as the politicians , is it ? "
said <name> , slowly .
" unquestionably not , " i agreed .
" it is n't pleasant to think of some other crude forces in the world .
but they exist , and they have to be dealt with .
suppose the united states should refuse to trade with russia because , from our republican point of view , we regarded her government as tyrannical and oppressive ?
or to <unk> with england in some undertaking for the world 's benefit because we contended that she ruled <name> with an iron hand ?
in such a case , our president and senate would be scoundrels for making and <unk> a treaty .
yet here are <name> and <name> , and no doubt <name> and <name> , accusing me , a lifetime friend , of <unk> because i happen to be counsel for a syndicate that wishes to build a <unk> for the convenience of the people of the city . "
" oh , no , not of <unk> ! "
she exclaimed .
" i ca n't  i wo n't believe they would do that . "
" pretty near it , " i said .
" if i listened to them , i should have to give up the law altogether . "
" sometimes , " she answered in a low voice , " sometimes i wish you would . "
" i might have expected that you would take their point of view . "
as i was turning away she got up quickly and put her hand on my shoulder .
" <name> , please do n't say such things  you 've no right to say them . "
" and you ? "
i asked .
" do n't you see , " she continued pleadingly , " do n't you see that we are growing apart ?
that 's the only reason i said what i did .
it is n't that i do n't trust you , that i do n't want you to have your work , that i demand all of you .
i know a woman ca n't ask that ,  ca n't have it .
but if you would only give me  give the children just a little , if i could feel that we meant something to you and that this other was n't gradually becoming everything , was n't absorbing you more and more , killing the best part of you .
it 's poisoning our marriage , it 's poisoning all your relationships . "
in that appeal the real <name> , the <name> of the early days of our marriage flashed forth again so vividly that i was taken aback .
i understood that she had had herself under control , had worn a mask  a mask i had forced on her ; and the revelation of the continued existence of that other <name> was profoundly disturbing .
was it true , as she said , that my absorption in the great game of modern business , in the modern american philosophy it implied was poisoning my marriage ?
or was it that my marriage had failed to satisfy and absorb me ?
i was touched  but <unk> touched : i felt that this was a situation that ought to touch me ; i did n't wish to face it , as usual : i could n't acknowledge to myself that anything was really wrong ...
i patted her on the shoulder , i bent over and kissed her .
" a man in my position ca n't altogether choose just how busy he <name> be , " i said smiling .
" matters are thrust upon me which i have to accept , and i ca n't help thinking about some of them when i come home .
but we 'll go off for a real vacation soon , <name> , to europe  and take the children . "
" oh , i <name> so , " she said .
from this time on , as may be supposed , our intercourse with both the <unk> began to grow less frequent , although <name> continued to see a great deal of <name> ; and when we did dine in their company , or they with us , it was quite noticeable that their former <unk> was suppressed .
even <name> had ceased to refer to me as the young <name> of the law : he clung to me , but he too kept silent on the subject of business .
<name> of course must have noticed this , must have <unk> the change of atmosphere , have known that the <unk> , at least , were maintaining appearances for her sake .
she did not speak to me of the change , nor i to her ; but when i thought of her silence , it was to suspect that she was weighing the question which had led up to the difference between <name> and me , and i had a suspicion that the fact that i was her husband would not affect her ultimate decision .
this faculty of hers of thinking things out instead of accepting my views and decisions was , as the saying goes , getting a little " on my nerves " : that she of all women should have developed it was a recurring and unpleasant surprise .
i began at times to pity myself a little , to feel the need of sympathetic companionship  feminine companionship ... .
i shall not go into the details of the <unk> of what became known as the riverside franchise .
in spite of the <unk> residents , of the city improvement league and individual protests , we obtained it with absurd ease .
indeed <name> blackwood himself appeared before the public <unk> committee of the board of aldermen , and was listened to with deference and gravity while he discoursed on the <unk> of a beautiful boulevard to satisfy the greed of certain private individuals .
mr. <name> bitter and myself , who appeared for the <unk> , had a similar reception .
that struggle was a tempest in a <unk> .
the reformer raged , but he was feeble in those days , and the great public believed what it read in the respectable newspapers .
in mr. judah b. tallant 's newspaper , for instance , the morning <name> , there were <unk> <unk> about " <unk> . "
mr. <name> blackwood was a well-meaning , able gentleman of an old family , etc. , but with a sentiment for <unk> .
the <name> published also the resolutions which ( with interesting spontaneity ! )
had been passed by our board of trade and chamber of commerce and other influential bodies in favour of the franchise ; the idea  unknown to the public  of mr. <name> paret , who wrote drafts of the resolutions and suggested privately to mr. <name> dickinson that a little enthusiasm from these organizations might be helpful .
mr. dickinson accepted the suggestion eagerly , wondering why he had n't thought of it himself .
the resolutions carried some weight with a public that did not know its right hand from its left .
after fitting deliberation , one evening in february the board of aldermen met and granted the franchise .
not unanimously , oh , no !
mr. <name> was not so simple as that !
no further visits to <unk> 's saloon on my part , in this connection were necessary ; but mr. <name> bitter met me one day in the hotel with a significant message from the boss .
" it 's all fixed , " he informed me .
" murphy and <name> and <unk> and <name> and loth are the <unk> .
you understand ? "
" i think i gather your meaning , " i said .
mr .
bitter smiled by pulling down one corner of a crooked mouth .
" they 'll vote against it on principle , you know , " he added .
" we get a little something from the <name> avenue residents . "
i 've forgotten what the riverside franchise cost .
the sum was paid in a lump sum to mr .
bitter as his " fee , "  so , to their chagrin , a grand jury discovered in later years , when they were barking around mr. <unk> hole with an eager district attorney snapping his whip over them .
i remember the <unk> .
the municipal geese were gone , but it was impossible to prove that this particular fox had used his enlightened reason in their <unk> .
mr .
bitter was a legally authorized fox , and could take fees .
how mr. <name> was to be rewarded by the land company 's left-hand , unknown , to the land company 's right hand , became a problem worthy of a genius .
the genius was found , but modesty forbids me to mention his name , and the problem was solved , to wit : the land company bought a piece of downtown property from  mr. <unk> , who was mr. grierson 's real estate man and the agent for the land company , for a consideration of thirty thousand dollars .
an <unk> rumour had it that mr. <unk> turned over the thirty thousand to mr. <name> .
then the riverside company issued a secret deed of the same property back to mr. <unk> , and this deed was not recorded until some years later .
such are the elaborate transactions progress and prosperity demand .
nature is the great teacher , and we know that her ways are at times complicated and clumsy .
likewise , under the " natural " laws of economics , new enterprises are not born without <unk> , without the aid of legal physicians well versed in financial <unk> .
one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand , let us say , for the right to build tracks on <unk> avenue , and we sold nearly two million dollars worth of the securities back to the public whose aldermen had sold us the franchise .
is there a man so dead as not to feel a thrill at this achievement ?
and let no one who declares that literary talent and imagination are <unk> in <name> pronounce final judgment until he reads that <unk> , in which was combined the best of <unk> and <unk> , for the labours of <name> cheyne were not to be wasted , after all .
mr. dickinson , who was a director in the <unk> line , got a handsome <unk> percentage , and mr. <unk> , also a director , on the bonds and preferred stock he sold .
mr. paret , who entered both companies on the ground floor , likewise got fees .
everybody was satisfied except the trouble makers , who were ignored .
in short , the episode of the riverside franchise is a triumphant proof of the contention that business men are the best fitted to conduct the politics of their country .
we had learned to pursue our happiness in packs , we knew that the happy <unk> are here and now , while the reverend <name> <unk> continued to assure the maimed , the halt and the blind that their kingdom was not of this world , that their time was coming later .
could there have been a more <unk> arrangement !
everybody should have been satisfied , but everybody was not .
otherwise these pages would never have been written .
book 3 .

as the name of our city grew to be more and more a <unk> for sudden and fabulous wealth , not only were the huns and the <unk> , the <unk> and the greeks drawn to us , but it became the fashion for distinguished englishmen and frenchmen and sometimes germans and italians to pay us a visit when they made the grand tour of <name> .
they had been told that they must not miss us ; scarcely a week went by in our community  so it was said  in which a full-fledged millionaire was not turned out .
our visitors did not always remain a week ,  since their rapid <unk> from the atlantic to the pacific , from canada to the gulf rarely occupied more than four ,  but in the books <unk> their mature comments on the manners , customs and <unk> of american civilization no less than a chapter was usually devoted to us ; and most of the adjectives in their various languages were exhausted in the attempt to prove how <unk> we were of the ambitions and ideals of the republic .
the fact that many of these gentlemen  literary and otherwise  returned to their own shores better fed and with larger balances in the banks than when they departed is neither here nor there .
egyptians are <unk> created to be spoiled .
the wiser and more fortunate of these travellers and students of life brought letters to mr. and mrs. hambleton durrett .
that household was <unk>  if they liked  of the new order of things ; and it was rare indeed when both members of it were at home to entertain them .
if mr. durrett were in the city , and they did not happen to be britons with sporting <unk> , they simply were not entertained : when mrs. durrett received them dinners were given in their honour on the durrett gold plate , and they spent <unk> and delightful hours conversing with her in the little salon overlooking the garden , to return to their hotels and jot down paragraphs on the superiority of the american women over the men .
these particular foreigners did not lay eyes on mr. durrett , who was in <name> or in the east playing polo or engaged in some other pursuit .
one result of the <unk> and luxury that amazed them they wrote  had been to raise the standard of culture of the women , who were our leisure class .
but the travellers did not remain long enough to arrive at any conclusions of value on the effect of luxury and <unk> on the sacred institution of marriage .
if mr. <name> durrett could have returned to his native city after fifteen years or so in the grave , not the least of the phenomena to startle him would have been that which was taking place in his own house .
for he would have beheld serenely established in that former abode of <unk> one of the most reprehensible of exotic <unk> , a <unk> de <unk> ; ' nor could he have failed to observe , moreover , the complacency with which the descendants of his friends , the pew holders in dr .
pound 's church , regarded the matter : and not only these , but the city at large .
the stronghold of scotch <unk> had become a london or a <name> , a gomorrah !
mrs. hambleton durrett went her way , and mr. durrett his .
the less said about mr. durrett 's way  even in this suddenly advanced age  the better .
as for <name> , she seemed to the distant eye to be walking through life in a stately and triumphant manner .
i read in the newspapers of her doings , her <unk> and goings ; sometimes she was away for months together , often abroad ; and when she was at home i saw her , but <unk> , under conditions more or less formal .
not that she was formal ,  or i : our intercourse seemed eloquent of an intimacy in a tantalizing state of suspense .
would that intimacy ever be renewed ?
this was a question on which i sometimes speculated .
the situation that had suspended or put an end to it , as the case might be , was never referred to by either of us .
one afternoon in the late <name> of the year following that in which we had given a dinner to the <unk> ( where the <unk> had rather marvellously appeared together ) i left my office about three o'clock  a most unusual occurrence .
i was restless , unable to fix my mind on my work , filled with unsatisfied <unk> the object of which i sought to keep vague , and yet i directed my steps westward along boyne street until i came to the <name> museum , where a <name> exhibition was being held .
i entered , bought a catalogue , and presently found myself standing before number 103 , designated as a portrait of mrs. hambleton durrett ,  painted in <name> the autumn before by a polish artist then much in vogue , <unk> <unk> .
<name>  was it <name> ?  was standing facing me , tall , superb in the maturity of her beauty , with one hand resting on an antique table , a smile upon her lips , a gentle mockery in her eyes as though laughing at the world she adorned .
with the smile and the mockery  somehow significant , too , of an achieved <unk>  went the sheen of her clinging gown and the glint of the heavy pearls drooping from her high throat to her waist .
these caught the eye , but failed at length to hold it , for even as i looked the smile faded , the mockery turned to <unk> .
so i thought , and looked again  to see the <unk> : the smile had gone , the pearls seemed heavier .
was it a trick of the artist ?
had he seen what i saw , or thought i saw ?
or was it that imagination which by now i might have learned to suspect and distrust .
wild longings took possession of me , for the portrait had seemed to emphasize at once how distant now she was from me , and yet how near !
i wanted to put that nearness to the test .
had she really changed ?
did anyone really change ?
and had i not been a fool to accept the <unk> she had given me ?
i remembered those moments when our glances had met as across barriers in flashes of understanding .
after all , the barriers were mere relics of the superstition of the past .
what if i went to her now ?
i felt that i needed her as i never had needed anyone in all my life ... .
i was aroused by the sound of lowered voices beside me .
" that 's mrs. hambleton durrett , " i heard a woman say .
" is n't she beautiful ? "
the note of envy struck me sharply  horribly .
without waiting to listen to the comment of her companion i hurried out of the building into the cold , white sunlight that threw into bold relief the <unk> houses of the street .
here was everyday life , but the portrait had suggested that which might have been  might be yet .
what did i mean by this ?
i didn't know , i did n't care to define it ,  a renewal of her friendship , of our intimacy .
my being cried out for it , and in the world in which i lived we took what we wanted  why not this ?
and yet for an instant i stood on the sidewalk to discover that in new situations i was still subject to unaccountable <unk> of that thing i had been taught to call " conscience " ; whether it were conscience or not must be left to the <unk> .
i was married  terrible word !
the shadow of that institution fell athwart me as the sun went under a cloud ; but the sun came out again as i found myself walking toward the durrett house reflecting that <name> of married men called on <name> , and that what i had in mind in regard to her was nothing that the court would have pronounced an <unk> upon the institution ... .
i reached her steps , the long steps still guarded by the curved <unk> railings reminiscent of <name> 's day , though the " <unk> " were gone , a modern vestibule having replaced them ; i rang the <name> ; the butler , flung open the doors .
he , at any rate , did not seem surprised to see me here , he greeted me with respectful cordiality and led me , as a favoured guest , through the big drawing-room into the salon .
" mr. paret , madam ! "
<name> , rose quickly from the low chair where she sat cutting the pages of a french novel .
" <name> ! "
she exclaimed .
" i 'm out if anyone calls .
bring tea , " she added to the man , who retired .
for a moment we stood gazing at each other , questioningly .
" well , wo n't you sit down and stay awhile ? "
she asked .
i took a chair on the opposite side of the fire .
" i just thought i 'd drop in , " i said .
" i am flattered , " said <name> , " that a person so <unk> should find time to call on an old friend .
why , i thought you never left your office until seven o'clock . "
" i do n't , as a rule , but to-day i was n't particularly busy , and i thought i 'd go round to the <name> museum and look at your portrait . "
" more flattery !
<name> , you 're getting quite human .
what do you think of it ? "
" i like it .
i think it quite remarkable . "
" have a cigarette ! "
i took one .
" so you really like it , " she said .
" do n't you ? "
" oh , i think it 's a trifle  romantic , " she replied " but that 's <unk> .
he made me quite cross ,  the feminine presentation of <name> , the spoiled woman who has shed responsibilities and is beginning to have a glimpse  just a little one  of the emptiness of it all . "
i was stirred .
" then why do you accept it , if it is n't you ? "
i demanded .
" one doesn't refuse <unk> 's canvases , " she replied .
" and what difference does it make ?
it amused him , and he was fairly subtle about it .
only those who are looking for romance , like you , are able to guess what he meant , and they would think they saw it anyway , even if he had painted me  extinct . "
" extinct ! "
i repeated .
she laughed .
" <name> , you 're a silly old goose ! "
" that 's why i came here , i think , to be told so , " i said .
tea was brought in .
a sense of <unk> stole over me ,  i was more at home here in this room with <name> , than in any other place in the world ; here , where everything was at once soothing yet stimulating , expressive of her , even the smaller objects that caught my eye ,  the <name> inkstand tipped with gold , the racks for the table books , her <unk> .
<name> 's was a discriminating luxury .
and her talk !
the lightness with which she touched life , the unexplored depths of her , guessed at but never <unk> !
did she feel a little the need of me as i felt the need of her ?
" why , i believe you 're <unk> romantic , <name> , " she said laughingly , when the men had left the room .
" here you are , what they call a paragon of success , a future senator , ambassador to england .
i hear of those remarkable things you have done  even in new york the other day a man was asking me if i knew mr. paret , and spoke of you as one of the coming men .
i suppose you <name> be moving there , soon .
a practical success !
it always surprises me when i think of it , i find it difficult to remember what a dreamer you were and here you turn out to be still a dreamer !
have you discovered , too , the emptiness of it all ? "
she inquired <unk> .
" i must say you do n't look it "  she gave me a critical , quizzical glance  " you look quite prosperous and contented , as though you enjoyed your power . "
i laughed uneasily .
" and then , " she continued , " and then one day when your luncheon has disagreed with you  you walk into a gallery and see a portrait of  of an old friend for whom in youth , when you were a dreamer , you professed a sentimental attachment , and you exclaim that the artist is a discerning man who has discovered the secret that she has guarded so closely .
she's sorry that she ever tried to console herself with <unk> it 's what you 've suspected all along .
but you 'll just run around to see for yourself  to be sure of it . "
and she handed me my tea .
" come now , confess .
where are your wits  i hear you do n't lack them in court . "
" well , " i said , " if that amuses you  " " it does amuse me , " said <name> , twining her fingers across her knee and regarding me smilingly , with parted lips , " it amuses me a lot  it 's so characteristic . "
" but it 's not true , it 's unjust , " i protested vigorously , smiling , too , because the attack was so characteristic of her .
" what then ? "
she demanded .
" well , in the first place , my luncheon did n't disagree with me .
it never does . "
she laughed .
" but the sentiment  come now  the sentiment ?
do you perceive any hint of emptiness  despair ? "
our chairs were very close , and she leaned forward a little .
" emptiness or no emptiness , " i said a little tremulously , " i know that i have n't been so contented , so happy for a long time . "
she sat very still , but turned her gaze on the fire .
" you really would n't want to find that , <name> , " she said in another voice , at which i exclaimed .
" no , i 'm not being sentimental .
but , to be serious , i really should n't care to think that of you .
i 'd like to think of you as a friend  a good friend  although we do n't see very much of one another . "
" but that 's why i came , <name> , " i explained .
" it was n't just an impulse  that is , i 've been thinking of you a great deal , all along .
i miss you , i miss the way you look at things  your point of view .
i can't see any reason why we should n't see something of each other  now  " she continued to stare into the fire .
" no , " she said at length , " i suppose there is n't any reason . "
her mood seemed suddenly to change as she bent over and extinguished the flame under the kettle .
" after all , " she added gaily , " we live in a tolerant age , we 've reached the years of discretion , and we 're both too conventional to do anything silly  even if we wanted to  which we do n't .
we 're neither of us likely to quarrel with the world as it is , i think , and we might as well make fun of it together .
we 'll begin with our friends .
what do you think of mr. scherer 's palace ? "
" i hear you 're building it for him . "
" i told him to get <unk> , " said <name> , laughingly , " i was afraid he'd repeat the <unk> park monstrosity on a larger scale , and <unk> 's the only man in this country who understands the french .
it 's been rather amusing , " she went on , " i 've had to fight <name> , and she 's no mean antagonist .
how she hates me !
she wanted a monstrosity , of course , a <unk> <name> <unk> sort of an affair , i can imagine .
she's been so funny when i 've met her at dinner .
'i understand you take a great interest in the house , mrs .
durrett . '
ca n't you hear her ? "
" well , you did get ahead of her , " i said .
" i had to .
i could n't let our first citizen build a modern rhine castle , could i ?
i have some public spirit left .
and besides , i expect to build on <name> avenue myself . "
" and leave here ? "
" oh , it 's too grubby , it 's in the slums , " said <name> .
" but i really owe you a debt of gratitude , <name> , for the <unk> . "
" i 'm told adolf 's lost his head over you . "
" it 's not only over me , but over everything .
he 's so ridiculously proud of being on the board of the children 's hospital ... . you ought to hear him talking to old mrs. ogilvy , who of course ca n't get used to him at all ,  she always has the air of inquiring what he 's doing in that galley .
she still thinks of him as mr. durrett 's foreman . "
the time flew .
her presence was like a bracing , tingling atmosphere in which i felt revived and <unk> , <unk> .
for <name> did not question  she took me as i was .
we looked out on the world , as it were , from the same window , and i could not help thinking that ours , after all , was a large view .
the topics did n't matter  our conversation was fragrant with intimacy ; and we were so close to each other it seemed incredible that we ever should be parted again .
at last the little clock on the mantel chimed an hour , she started and looked up .
" why , it 's seven , <name> ! "
she exclaimed , rising .
" i 'd no idea it was so late , and i 'm dining with the <unk> .
i 've only just time to dress . "
" it 's been like a reunion , has n't it ?  a reunion after many years , " i said .
i held her hand unconsciously  she seemed to be drawing me to her , i thought she swayed , and a sudden dizziness seized me .
then she <name> away abruptly , with a little cry .
i could n't be sure about the cry , whether i heard it or not , a note was struck in the very depths of me .
" come in again , " she said , " whenever you 're not too busy . "
and a minute later i found myself on the street .
this was the beginning of a new intimacy with <name> , resembling the old intimacy yet differing from it .
the emotional note of our parting on the occasion i have just related was not again struck , and when i went eagerly to see her again a few days later i was conscious of limitations ,  not too conscious : the freedom she offered and which i gladly accepted was a large freedom , nor am i quite sure that even i would have wished it larger , though there were naturally moments when i thought so : when i asked myself what i did wish , i found no answer .
though i sometimes chafed , it would have been absurd of me to object to a certain timidity or caution i began to perceive in her that had been absent in the old <name> ; but the old <name> had ceased to exist , and here instead was a highly developed , highly <unk> creature in whom i delighted ; and after taking thought i would not have robbed her of fine acquired attribute .
as she had truly observed , we were both conventional ; <unk> was part of the price we had willingly paid for membership in that rarer world we had both achieved .
it was a world , to be sure , in which we were rapidly learning to take the law into our own hands without seeming to defy it , in order that the fear of it might remain in those less fortunately placed and endowed : we had begun with the appropriation of the material property of our fellow-citizens , which we took legally ; from this point it was , of course , merely a logical step to take  legally , too other <unk> human property  their wives , in short : the more progressive east had set us our example , but as yet we had been <unk> to follow it .
about this time rebellious voices were beginning to make themselves heard in the literary wilderness proclaiming <name>  <name> of the sexes .
there were russian novels and french novels , and pioneer english novels preaching <name> with <unk> <unk> , or taking it for granted .
i picked these up on <name> 's table .
" reading them ? "
she said , in answer to my query .
" of course i 'm reading them .
i want to know what these clever people are thinking , even if i do n't always agree with them , and you ought to read them too .
it 's quite true what foreigners say about our men ,  that they live in a groove , that they have n't any range of conversation . "
" i 'm quite willing to be educated , " i replied .
" i have n't a doubt that i need it . "
she was leaning back in her chair , her hands behind her head , a posture she often assumed .
she looked up at me <unk> .
" i 'll acknowledge that you 're more <unk> than most of them , " she said .
" do you know , <name> , sometimes you puzzle me greatly .
when you are here and we 're talking together i can never think of you as you are out in the world , fighting for power  and getting it .
i suppose it 's part of your charm , that there is that side of you , but i never consciously realize it .
you 're what they call a <unk> personality . "
" that 's a pretty hard name ! "
i exclaimed .
she laughed .
" i ca n't help it  you are .
oh , not <unk> so , quite normally  that 's the odd thing about you .
sometimes i believe that you were made for something different , that in spite of your success you have missed your <unk> . ' "
" what ought i to have been ? "
" how can i tell ?
a goethe , perhaps  a goethe smothered by a <unk> environment .
your love of adventure is n't dead , it's been merely <unk> , real adventure , i mean , forth faring , <unk> into unknown paths .
perhaps you have n't yet found yourself . "
" how uncanny ! "
i said , stirred and startled .
" you have a taste for literature , you know , though you 've buried it .
give me <unk> .
we 'll begin with him ... . " her reading and the talks that followed it were exciting , amazingly stimulating ... . once <name> gave me an amusing account of a debate which had taken place in the newly organized woman 's discussion club to which she belonged over a rather daring book by an english novelist .
mrs. dickinson had revolted .
" no , she was n't really shocked , not in the way she thought she was , " said <name> , in answer to a query of mine .
" how was she shocked , then ? "
" as you and i are shocked . "
" but i 'm not shocked , " i protested .
" oh , yes , you are , and so am i  not on the moral side , nor is it the moral aspect that troubles <name> dickinson .
she thinks it 's the moral aspect , but it 's really the revolutionary aspect , the menace to those precious institutions from which we derive our privileges and comforts . "
i considered this , and laughed .
" what 's the use of being a humbug about it , " said <name> .
" but you 're talking like a revolutionary , " i said .
" i may be talking like one , but i 'm not one .
i once had the <unk> of one  of a good one ,  a <unk> ' one , as the english would say . "
she sighed .
" you regret it ? "
i asked curiously .
" of course i regret it ! "
she cried .
" what woman worth her salt doesn't regret it , does n't want to live , even if she has to suffer for it ?
and those people  the <unk> , i mean , the rebels  they live , they 're the only ones who do live .
the rest of us degenerate in a <unk> paralysis we think of as pleasure .
look at me !
i 'm incapable of committing a single original act , even though i might conceive one .
well , there was a time when i should have been equal to anything and would n't have cared a  a damn . "
i believed her ... .
i fell into the habit of dropping in on <name> at least twice a week on my way from the office , and i met her occasionally at other houses .
i did not tell <name> of that first impulsive visit ; but one evening a few weeks later she asked me where i had been , and when i told her she made no comment .
i came presently to the conclusion that this renewed intimacy did not trouble her  which was what i wished to believe .
of course i had gone to <name> for a <unk> i failed to get at home , and it is the more extraordinary , therefore , that i did not become more discontented and restless : i suppose this was because i had grown to regard marriage as most of the world regarded it , as something inevitable and <unk> , as a kind of habit it is useless to try to shake off .
but life is so full of <unk> and anomalies that i still had a real affection for <name> , and i liked her the more because she didn't expect too much of me , and because she did n't complain of my friendship with <name> although i should vehemently have denied there was anything to complain of .
i respected <name> .
if she was not a squaw , she performed religiously the traditional squaw duties , and made me comfortable : and the fact that we lived separate mental existences did not trouble me because i never thought of hers  or even that she had one .
she had the children , and they seemed to suffice .
she never renewed her appeal for my confidence , and i forgot that she had made it .
nevertheless i always felt a tug at my <unk> when <name> came around and it was time for her and the children to go to <unk> for the summer ; when i accompanied them , on the evening of their departure , to the smoky , noisy station and saw deposited in the sleeping-car their luggage and shawls and bundles .
they always took the evening train to boston ; it was the best .
<name> and <name> were invariably there with <name> and toys to see them off  if <name> and her children had not already gone  and at such moments my heart warmed to <name> .
and i was astonished as i clung to <name> and moreton and little biddy at the affection that welled up within me , saddened when i kissed <name> good-bye .
she too was sad , and always seemed to feel <unk> for deserting me .
" i feel so selfish in leaving you all alone ! "
she would say .
" if it were n't for the children  they need the sea air .
but i know you don't miss me as i miss you .
a man does n't , i suppose ... .
please do n't work so hard , and promise me you 'll come on and stay a long time .
you can if you want to .
we <name> n't starve . "
she smiled .
" that nice room , which is yours , at the southeast corner , is always waiting for you .
and you do like the sea , and seeing the <unk> in the morning . "
i felt an emptiness when the train pulled out .
i did love my family , after all !
i would go back to the deserted house , and i could not bear to look in at the nursery door , at the little beds with covers flung over them .
why could n't i appreciate these joys when i had them ?
one evening , as we went home in an open <unk> together , after such a departure , <name> blurted out :  " <name> , i believe i care for your family as much as for my own .
i often wonder if you realize how wonderful these children are !
my boys are just plain ruffians  although i think they're pretty decent ruffians , but <name> has a mind  he 's thoughtful  and an imagination .
he 'll make a name for himself some day if he 's steered properly and allowed to develop naturally .
moreton 's more like my boys .
and as for <unk> !  " words failed him .
i put my hand on his knee .
i actually loved him again as i had loved and yearned for him as a child ,  he was so human , so <unk> .
and why could n't this feeling last ?
he disapproved  foolishly , i thought  of my professional career , and this was only one of his limitations .
but i knew that he was loyal .
why had n't i been able to breathe and be reasonably happy in that atmosphere of friendship and love in which i had been placed  or rather in which i had placed myself ? ...
before the summer was a day or two older i had grown accustomed to being alone , and enjoyed the <name> ; and when <name> and the children returned in the autumn , similarly , it took me some days to get used to the restrictions imposed by a household .
i run the risk of shocking those who read this by declaring that if my family had been taken permanently out of my life , i should not long have missed them .
but on the whole , in those years my marriage relation might be called a negative one .
there were moments , as i have described , when i warmed to <name> , moments when i felt something akin to a violent antagonism aroused by little <unk> and tricks she had .
the fact that we got along as well as we did was probably due to the orthodox teaching with which we had been <unk> ,  to the effect that matrimony was a moral trial , a <unk> process .
but moral trials were ceasing to appeal to people , and more and more of them were refusing to be shaken down .
we did n't cut the <unk> knot , but we managed to loosen it considerably .
i have spoken of a new species of <unk> who inhabited the giant buildings in wall street , new york , and fought among themselves for possession of the united states of <name> .
it is interesting to note that in these struggles a certain chivalry was observed among the combatants , no matter how bitter the rivalry : for instance , it was deemed very bad form for one of the groups of combatants to take the public into their confidence ; cities were upset and stirred to the core by these conflicts , and the citizens never knew who was doing the fighting , but imagined that some burning issue was at stake that concerned them .
as a matter of fact the issue always did concern them , but not in the way they supposed .
gradually , out of the chaotic <unk> in which these <unk> were engaged had emerged one group more powerful than the rest and more respectable , whose leader was the personality to whom i have before referred .
he and his group had managed to gain control of certain conservative fortresses in various cities such as the corn national bank and the <unk> telephone company  to mention two of many : adolf scherer was his ally , and the boyne iron works , limited , was soon to be merged by him into a greater corporation still .
<name> dickinson might be called his local governor-general .
we manned the <unk> and kept our ears constantly to the ground to listen for the rumble of attacks ; but sometimes they burst upon us fiercely and suddenly , without warning .
such was the assault on the <unk> , which for years had exercised an apparently secure monopoly of the city 's telephone service , which had been able to ignore with complacency the <unk> protests of unreasonable subscribers .
through the pilot it was announced to the public that certain benevolent " eastern capitalists " were ready to rescue them from their <unk> if the city would <name> them a franchise .
mr. <unk> , the <unk> of whose newspaper could not be doubted , fanned the flame day by day , sent his reporters about the city gathering instances of the haughty neglect of the <unk> , proclaiming its instruments <unk> compared with those used in more progressive cities , as compared with the very latest inventions which the automatic company was ready to <unk> provided they could get their franchise .
and the prices !
these , too , would fall  under competition .
it was a clever campaign .
if the city would give them a franchise , that automatic company  so well named !
would provide automatic instruments .
each <unk> , by means of a numerical disk , could call up any other , <unk> ; there would be no central operator , no listening , no tapping of wires ; the number of calls would be unlimited .
as a proof of the confidence of these eastern gentlemen in our city , they were willing to spend five millions , and present more than six hundred <unk> free to the city departments !
what was fairer , more generous than this !
there could be no doubt that popular enthusiasm was enlisted in behalf of the " eastern capitalists , " who were made to appear in the light of crusaders ready to rescue a groaning people from the thrall of monopoly .
the excitement approached that of a presidential election , and became the dominant topic at <unk> counters and in <unk> .
cheap and efficient service !
down with the bastille of monopoly !
as counsel for the <unk> , mr. ogilvy sent for me , and by certain secret <unk> of information at my disposal i was not long in discovering the disquieting fact that a mr. <unk> , who was described as a gentleman with fat fingers and a plausible manner , had been in town for a week and had been twice seen entering and emerging from <unk> saloon .
in short , mr. <name> had already been " seen . "
nevertheless i went to him myself , to find him for the first time in my experience absolutely non-committal .
" what 's the <unk> willing to do ? "
he demanded .
i mentioned a sum , and he shook his head .
i mentioned another , and still he shook his head .
" come 'round again , " he said ...
i was compelled to report this alarming situation to ogilvy and dickinson and a few chosen members of a <unk> board of directors .
" it 's that damned <unk> crowd , " said dickinson , mentioning an aggressive gentleman who had migrated from chicago to wall street some five years before in a pink collar .
" but what 's to be done ? "
demanded ogilvy , playing nervously with a gold pencil on the polished table .
he was one of those americans who in a commercial atmosphere become prematurely white , and today his boyish , smooth-shaven face was almost as devoid of colour as his hair .
even <name> dickinson showed anxiety , which was unusual for him .
" you 've got to fix it , <name> , " he said .
i did not see my way , but i had long ago learned to assume the unruffled air and judicial manner of speaking that inspires the layman with almost superstitious confidence in the lawyer ... . " we 'll find a way out , " i said .
mr. <name> , of course , held the key to the situation , and just how i was to get around him was <unk> .
in the meantime there was the public : to permit the other fellow to capture that was to be lacking in ordinary <name> ; if its votes counted for nothing , its savings were desirable ; and it was fast getting into a state of outrage against monopoly .
the chivalry of finance did not permit of a revelation that mr. <unk> and his buccaneers were behind the automatic , but it was possible to direct and strengthen the <unk> which the <name> and other conservative newspapers had already begun .
mr. tallant for delicate reasons being <unk> non <unk> at the boyne club , despite the fact that he had so many friends there , we met for lunch in a private room at the new hotel , and as we <unk> our coffee and smoked our cigars we planned a series of <unk> and articles that duly appeared .
they made a strong appeal to the loyalty of our citizens to stand by the home company and home capital that had taken generous risks to give them service at a time when the future of the telephone business was by no means assured ; they <unk> the charges made by irresponsible and interested " parties , " and finally pointed out , not without effect , that one logical consequence of having two telephone companies would be to compel subscribers in self-defence to <unk> two <unk> instead of one .
and where was the saving in that ?
" say , paret , " said judah b. when we had finished our labours ; " if you ever get sick of the law , i 'll give you a job on the <name> 's staff .
this is fine , the way you put it .
it 'll do a lot of good , but how in hell are you going to handle judd ? ... "
for three days the inspiration was withheld .
and then , as i was strolling down boyne street after lunch gazing into the store windows it came suddenly , without warning .
like most inspirations worth anything , it was very simple .
within half an hour i had reached <unk> 's saloon and found mr. <name> out of bed , but still in his bedroom , seated meditatively at the window that looked over the alley .
" you know the crowd in new york behind this automatic company as well as i do , <name> , " i said .
" why do you want to deal with them when we've always been straight with you , when we 're ready to meet them and go one better ?
name your price . "
" suppose i do  what then , " he replied .
" this thing 's gone pretty far .
under that damned new charter the franchise has got to be bid for  has n't it ?
and the people want this company .
there 'll be a howl from one end of this town to the other if we throw 'em down . "
" we 'll look out for the public , " i assured him , smiling .
" well , " he said , with one of his glances that were like flashes , " what you got up your sleeve ? "
" suppose another telephone company steps in , and bids a little higher for the franchise .
that relieves , your aldermen of all responsibility , does n't it ? "
" another telephone company ! "
he repeated .
i had already named it on my walk .
" the <unk> , " i said .
" a dummy company ? "
said mr. <name> .
" lively enough to bid something over a hundred thousand to the city for its franchise , " i replied .
judd <name> , with a queer look , got up and went to a desk in a dark corner , and after rummaging for a few moments in one of the <unk> , <name> forth a glass cylinder , which he held out as he approached me .
" you get it , mr. paret , " he said .
" what is it ? "
i asked , " a bomb ! "
" that , " he announced , as he twisted the tube about in his long fingers , holding it up to the light , " is the finest brand of cigars ever made in cuba .
a gentleman who had every reason to be grateful to me  i won't say who he was  gave me that once .
well , the lord made me so 's i can't appreciate any better tobacco than those <unk> <unk> ' <unk> got downstairs , and i saved it .
i saved it for the man who would put something over me some day , and  you get it . "
" thank you , " i said , unconsciously falling in with the <unk> of his manner .
" i do not flatter myself that the solution i have suggested did not also occur to you . "
" you 'll smoke it ? "
he asked .
" surely . "
" now ?
here with me ? "
" certainly , " i agreed , a little puzzled .
as i broke the seal , pulled out the cork and <unk> the cigar from its gold foil he took a stick and rapped loudly on the floor .
after a brief interval footsteps were heard on the stairs and <name> <unk> , white <unk> and <name> faced , appeared at the door .
" <unk> , " said mr. <name> , laconically .
" it 's them i thought ye 'd be wanting , " said the <unk> , holding out a handful .
judd <name> lighted one , and began smoking reflectively .
i gazed about the mean room , with its litter of newspapers and reports , its shabby furniture , and these seemed to have become incongruous , out of figure in the chair facing me keeping with the thoughtful figure in the chair facing me .
" you had a college education , mr. paret , " he remarked at length .
" yes . "
" life 's a queer thing .
now if i 'd had a college education , like you , and you 'd been thrown on the world , like me , maybe i 'd be livin ' up there on <name> avenue and you 'd be down here over the saloon . "
" maybe , " i said , wondering uneasily whether he meant to imply a similarity in our gifts .
but his manner remained impassive , speculative .
" ever read carlyle 's <unk> revolution ' ? "
he asked suddenly .
" why , yes , part of it , a good while ago . "
" when you was in college ? "
" yes . "
" i 've got a little library here , " he said , getting up and raising the shades and opening the glass doors of a bookcase which had escaped my attention .
he took down a volume of carlyle , bound in half calf .
" would n't think i cared for such things , would you ? "
he demanded as he handed it to me .
" well , you never can tell what a man 's real tastes are until you know him , " i observed , to conceal my surprise .
" that 's so , " he agreed .
" i like books  some books .
if i 'd had an education , i 'd have liked more of 'em , known more about 'em .
now i can read this one over and over .
that feller carlyle was a genius , he could look right into the bowels of the volcano , and he was on to how men and women feet down there , how they hate , how they square 'emselves when they get a chance . "
he had managed to bring before me vividly that terrible , volcanic flow on versailles of the <name> mob .
he put back the book and resumed his seat .
" and i know how these people fed down here , below the crust , " he went on , waving his cigar out of the window , as though to indicate the whole of that mean district .
" they hate , and their hate is molten hell .
i've been through it . "
" but you 've got on top , " i suggested .
" sure , i 've got on top .
do you know why ?
it 's because i hated  that's why .
a man 's feelings , if they 're strong enough , have a lot to do with what he becomes . "
" but he has to have ability , too , " i objected .
" sure , he has to have ability , but his feeling is the driving power if he feels strong enough , he can make a little ability go a long way . "
i was struck by the force of this remark .
i scarcely recognized judd <name> .
the man , as he revealed himself , had become at once more sinister and more fascinating .
" i can guess how some of those jacobins felt when they had the aristocrats in the dock .
they 'd got on top  the jacobins , i mean .
it's human nature to want to get on top  ai n't it ? "
he looked at me and smiled , but he did not seem to expect a reply .
" well , what you call society , <name> , respectable society like you belong to would have made a <unk> and a criminal out of me if i had n't been too smart for 'em , and it 's a kind of satisfaction to have 'em coming down here to <unk> for things they ca n't have without my leave .
i 've got a half <name> on 'em .
i would n't live up on <name> avenue if you gave me scherer 's new house . "
i was silent .
" instead of starting my career in college , i started in jail , " he went on , apparently ignoring any effect he may have produced .
so subtly , so dispassionately indeed was he delivering himself of these remarks that it was impossible to tell whether he meant their application to be personal , to me , or general , to my associates .
" i went to jail when i was fourteen because i wanted a knife to make kite sticks , and i stole a razor from a barber .
i was bitter when they steered me into a lockup in hickory street .
it was full of bugs and crooks , and they put me in the same cell with an <unk> named <unk> ' waters ; who was one of the <unk> <unk> around in those days .
red took a shine to me , found out i had a head piece , and said their gang could use a clever boy .
if i 'd go in with him , i could make all kinds of money .
i guess i might have joined the gang if red had n't kept talking  about how the boss of his district named <unk> would come down and get him out ,  and sure enough <unk> did come down and get him out .
i thought i 'd rather be <unk> than red  red had to serve time once in a while .
soon as he got out i went down to <unk> 's saloon , and there was red leaning over the bar .
'here 's a smart kid !
he says , 'he and me were <unk> over in hickory street . '
he got to <unk> me , and telling me i 'd better come along with him , when <unk> came in .
'what is it <unk> like to be , my son ? '
says he .
a politician , i told him .
i was through going to jail .
<unk> had a laugh you could hear all over the place .
he took me on as a kind of handy boy around the establishment , and by and by i began to run errands and find out things for him .
i was boss of that <name> myself when i was twenty-six ... . how 'd you like that cigar ? "
i praised it .
" it ought to have been a good one , " he declared .
" well , i do n't want to keep you here all afternoon telling you my life story . "
i assured him i had been deeply interested .
" pretty slick idea of yours , that dummy company , mr. paret .
go ahead and organize it . "
he rose , which was contrary to his custom on the departure of a visitor .
" drop in again .
we 'll talk about the books . " ...
i walked slowly back reflecting on this conversation , upon the motives impelling mr. <name> to become thus confidential ; nor was it the most comforting thought in the world that the artist in me had appealed to the artist in him , that he had hailed me as a <unk> .
but for the <name> of god i might have been mr. <name> and he mr. paret : undoubtedly that was what he had meant to imply ... and i was forced to admit that he had succeeded  deliberately or not  in making the respectable mr. paret just a trifle uncomfortable .
in the marble vestibule of the corn national bank i ran into tallant , holding his brown straw hat in his hand and looking a little more <unk> than usual .
" hello , paret , " he said " how is that telephone business getting along ? "
" is dickinson in ? "
i asked .
tallant nodded .
we went through the cool bank , with its shining brass and red mahogany , its tiled floor , its busy <unk> attending to files of clients , to the president 's sanctum in the rear .
<name> dickinson , very spruce and dignified in a black <unk> coat , was dictating rapidly to a woman , stenographer , whom he dismissed when he saw us .
the door was shut .
" i was just asking paret about the telephone affair , " said mr. tallant .
" well , have you found a way out ? "
<name> dickinson looked questioningly at me .
" it 's all right , " i answered .
" i 've seen <name> . "
" all right ! "
they both ejaculated at once .
" we win , " i said .
they stood gazing at me .
even dickinson , who was rarely ruffled , seemed excited .
" do you mean to say you 've fixed it ? "
he demanded .
i nodded .
they stared at me in amazement .
" how the deuce did you manage it ? "
" we organize the <unk> telephone company , and bid for the franchise  that 's all . "
" a dummy company ! "
cried tallant .
" why , it 's simple as <unk> ! "
dickinson smiled .
he was tremendously relieved , and showed it .
" that 's true about all great ideas , tallant , " he said .
" they 're simple , only it takes a clever man to think of them . "
" and <name> agrees ? "
tallant demanded .
i nodded again .
" we 'll have to <unk> the automatic people .
i haven't seen bitter yet about the  about the fee . "
" that 's all right , " said <name> dickinson , quickly .
" i take off my hat to you .
you 've saved us .
you can ask any fee you like , " he added genially .
" let 's go over to  to the <unk> and get some lunch . "
he had been about to say the club , but he remembered mr. tallant 's presence in time .
" nothing 's worrying you , <name> ? "
he added , as we went out , followed by the glances of his employees .
" nothing , " i said ... . <unk> .
making money in those days was so ridiculously easy !
the trouble was to know how to spend it .
one evening when i got home i told <name> i had a surprise for her .
" a surprise ? "
she asked , looking up from a little pink <unk> she was making for <unk> .
" i 've bought that lot on <name> avenue , next to the <unk> ' . "
she dropped her sewing , and stared at me .
" are n't you pleased ? "
i asked .
" at last we are going to have a house of our very own .
what 's the matter ? "
" i ca n't bear the thought of leaving here .
i 'm so used to it .
i 've grown to love it .
it 's part of me . "
" but , " i exclaimed , a little exasperated , " you did n't expect to live here always , did you ?
the house has been too small for us for years .
i thought you 'd be delighted . "
( this was not strictly true , for i had rather expected some such action on her part . )
" most women would .
of course , if it 's going to make such a difference to you as that , i'll sell the lot .
that wo n't be difficult . "
i got up , and started to go into my study .
she half rose , and her sewing fell to the floor .
" oh , why are we always having <unk> ?
do sit down a minute , <name> .
do n't think i 'm not appreciative , " she pleaded .
" it was  such a shock . "
i sat down rather reluctantly .
" i ca n't express what i think , " she continued , rather breathlessly , " but sometimes i 'm actually frightened , we 're going through life so fast in these days , and it does n't seem as if we were getting the real things out of it .
i 'm afraid of your success , and of all the money you're making . "
i smiled .
" i 'm not so <name> yet , as riches go in these days , that you need be alarmed , " i said .
she looked at me helplessly a moment .
" i feel that it is n't  right , somehow , that you 'll pay for it , that we 'll pay for it .
goodness knows , we have everything we want , and more too .
this house  this house is real , and i 'm afraid that wo n't be a home , wo n't be real .
that we 'll be overwhelmed with  with things ! " ...
she was interrupted by the entrance of the children .
but after dinner , when she had seen them to bed , as was her custom , she came downstairs into my study and said quietly :  " i was wrong , <name> .
if you want to build a house , if you feel that you 'd be happier , i have no right to object .
of course my sentiment for this house is natural , the children were born here , but i 've realized we could n't live here always . "
" i 'm glad you look at it that way , " i replied .
" why , we 're already getting cramped , <name> , and now you 're going to have a governess i don't know where you 'd put her . "
" not too large , a house , " she pleaded .
" i know you think i 'm silly , but this extravagance we see everywhere does make me uneasy .
perhaps it's because i 'm provincial , and always shall be . "
" well , we must have a house large enough to be comfortable in , " i said .
" there 's no reason why we should n't be comfortable . "
i thought it as well not to confess my ambitions , and i was greatly relieved that she did not reproach me for buying the lot without consulting her .
indeed , i was grateful for this <unk> acquiescence , i felt nearer to her , than i had for a long time .
i <name> up another chair to my desk .
" sit down and we 'll make a few sketches , just for fun , " i urged .
" <name> , " she said presently , as we were blacking out prospective rooms , " do you remember all those drawings and plans we made in england , on our wedding trip , and how we knew just what we wanted , and changed our minds every few days ?
and now we 're ready to build , and have n't any ideas at all ! "
" yes , " i answered  but i did not look at her .
" i have the book still  it 's in the attic somewhere , packed away in a box .
i suppose those plans would seem ridiculous now . "
it was quite true ,  now that we were ready to build the home that had been deferred so long , now that i had the money to spend without stint on its construction , the irony of life had deprived me of those strong desires and <unk> i had known on my wedding trip .
what a <name> it would have been to build then !
but now i found myself : wholly lacking in definite ideas as to style and construction .
secretly , i looked forward to certain luxuries , such as a bedroom and dressing-room and warm tiled bathroom all to myself bachelor <unk> for which i had longed .
two mornings later at the breakfast table <name> asked me if i had thought of an architect .
" why , <name> <unk> , i suppose .
who else is there ?
have you anyone else in mind ? "
" n-no , " said <name> .
" but i heard of such a clever man in boston , who does n't charge mr. <unk> 's prices ; and who designs such beautiful private houses . "
" but we can afford to pay <unk> 's prices , " i replied , smiling .
" and why should n't we have the best ? "
" are you sure  he is the best , <name> ? "
" everybody has him , " i said .
<name> smiled in return .
" i suppose that 's a good reason , " she answered .
" of course it 's a good reason , " i assured her .
" these people  the people we know  would n't have had <unk> unless he was satisfactory .
what's the matter with his houses ? "
" well , " said <name> , " they 're not very original .
i do n't say they 're not good , in away , but they lack a certain imagination .
it 's difficult for me to express what i mean , <unk> made ' is n't precisely the idea , but there should be a certain irregularity in <name>  should n't there ?
i saw a reproduction in one of the architectural journals of a house in boston by a man named <unk> , that seemed to me to have great charm . "
here was <name> , unmistakably .
" that 's all very well , " i said impatiently , " but when one has to live in a house , one wants something more than artistic irregularity .
<unk> knows how to build for everyday existence ; he 's a practical man , as well as a man of taste , he may not be a <name> <unk> , but he understands conveniences and comforts .
his chimneys do n't smoke , his windows are tight , he knows what systems of heating are the best , and whom to go to : he knows what good <unk> is .
i 'm rather surprised you don't appreciate that , <name> , you 're so particular as to what kind of rooms the children shall have , and you want a <unk> with all the latest devices , with sun and ventilation .
the <unk> would n't have had him , the <unk> and <unk> would n't have had him if his work lacked taste . "
" and <name> would n't have had him , " added <name> , and she smiled once more .
" well , i have n't consulted <name> , or anyone else , " i replied  a little tartly , perhaps .
" you do n't seem to realize that some fashions may have a basis of reason .
they are not all silly , as <name> seems to think .
if <unk> builds satisfactory houses , he ought to be forgiven for being the fashion , he ought to have a chance . "
i got up to leave .
" let 's see what kind of a plan he 'll draw up , at any rate . "
her glance was almost indulgent .
" of course , <name> .
i want you to be satisfied , to be pleased , " she said .
" and you ? "
i questioned , " you are to live in the house more than i . "
" oh , i 'm sure it <name> turn out all right , " she replied .
" now you'd better run along , i know you 're late . "
" i am late , " i admitted , rather lamely .
" if you do n't care for <unk> 's drawings , we 'll get another architect . "
several years before mr. <unk> had arrived among us with a <unk> arts moustache and letters of introduction to mrs. durrett and others .
we found him the most <unk> , the most accommodating of young men , always ready to <unk> his talents and his services to private theatricals , <unk> , and <unk> balls , to take a place at a table at the last moment .
one of his most appealing attributes was his " belief " in our city ,  a form of patriotism that <unk> , in later years , in " million population " clubs .
i have often heard him declare , when the ladies had left the dining-room , that there was positively no limit to our future growth ; and , incidentally , to our future wealth .
such sentiments as these could not fail to add to any man 's popularity , and his success was a <unk> conclusion .
almost before we knew it he was building the new union station of which he had foreseen the need , to take care of the millions to which our population was to be swelled ; building the new post office that the unceasing efforts of <name> watling finally procured for us : building , indeed , <name> 's new house , the largest of our private mansions save mr. scherer 's , a commission that had immediately brought about others from the <unk> and the <unk> ... . that very day i called on him in his offices at the top of one of our new buildings , where many young <unk> were bending over their boards .
i was ushered into his private studio .
" i suppose you want something handsome , <name> , " he said , looking at me over his cigarette , " something commensurate with these fees i hear you are getting . "
" well , i want to be comfortable , " i admitted .
we lunched at the club together , where we talked over the requirements .
when he came to dinner the next week and spread out his sketch on the living-room table <name> <name> in her breath .
" why , <name> , " she exclaimed in dismay , " it 's as big as  as big as the white house ! "
" not quite , " i answered , laughing with <name> .
" we may as well take our ease in our old age . "
" take our ease ! "
echoed <name> .
" we 'll rattle 'round in it .
i 'll never get used to it . "
" after a month , mrs. paret , i 'll wager you 'll be wondering how you ever got along without it , " said <name> .
it was not as big as the white house , yet it could not be called small .
i had seen , to that .
the long facade was imposing , dignified , with a touch of <unk> and solidity in keeping with my standing in the city .
it was georgian , of <unk> brick with marble trimmings and marble wedges over the ample windows , some years later i saw the house by ferguson , of new york , from which <name> had <unk> it .
at one end , off the dining-room , was a semicircular conservatory .
there was a small portico , with marble pillars , and in the ample , swift sloping roof many <unk> ; servants ' rooms , <name> explained .
the look of anxiety on <name> 's face deepened as he went over the floor plans , the <unk> ; dining room to seat thirty , the servants ' hall ; and upstairs <name> 's room , boudoir and bath and dress closet , my " apartments " adjoining on one side and the children 's on the other , and the <unk> with baths ... . <name> surrendered , as one who gives way to the inevitable .
when the actual building began we both of us experienced , i think ; a certain mild excitement ; and walked out there , sometimes with the children , in the spring evenings , and on <name> afternoons .
" excitement " is , perhaps , too strong a word for my feelings : there was a pleasurable anticipation on my part , a looking forward to a more decorous , a more luxurious existence ; a certain impatience at the delays inevitable in building .
but a new legal commercial enterprise of magnitude began to absorb me at his time , and somehow the building of this home  the first that we possessed was not the event it should have been ; there were moments when i felt cheated , when i wondered what had become of that capacity for enjoyment which in my youth had been so keen .
i remember indeed , one grey evening when i went there alone , after the workmen had departed , and stood in the litter of mortar and bricks and boards gazing at the completed front of the house .
it was even larger than i had imagined it from the plans ; in the summer twilight there was an air about it ,  if not precisely menacing , at least portentous , with its gaping windows and towering roof .
i was a little tired from a hard day ; i had the odd feeding of having raised up something with which  momentarily at least  i doubted my ability to cope : something huge , impersonal ; something that ought to have represented a fireside , a sanctuary , and yet was the embodiment of an element quite alien to the home ; a restless element with which our american atmosphere had , by invisible degrees , become charged .
as i stared at it , the odd fancy seized me that the building somehow <unk> my own career ... .
i had gained something , in truth , but had i not also missed something ?
something a different home would have embodied ?
<name> and the children had gone , to the seaside .
with a vague uneasiness i turned away from the contemplation of those walls .
the companion mansions were closed , their blinds tightly drawn ; the neighbourhood was as quiet as the country , save for a slight but persistent noise that impressed itself on my consciousness .
i walked around the house to spy in the back yard ; a young girl rather stealthily gathering <unk> , and fragments of <unk> and flooring , and loading them into a child 's <unk> .
she started when she saw me .
she was little , more than a child , and the loose calico dress she wore seemed to emphasize her thinness .
she stood <unk> , staring at me with frightened yet defiant eyes .
i , too , felt a strange timidity in her presence .
" why do you stop ? "
i asked at length .
" say , is this your heap ? "
she demanded .
i acknowledged it .
a hint of awe widened her eyes .
then site glanced at the <unk> wagon .
" this stuff ai n't no use to you , is it ? "
" no , i 'm glad to have you take it . "
she shifted to the other foot , but did not continue her gathering .
an impulse seized me , i put down my <unk> and began picking up pieces of wood , flinging them into the wagon .
i looked at her again , rather furtively ; she had not moved .
her attitude puzzled me , for it was one neither of surprise nor of protest .
the spectacle of the " millionaire " owner of the house engaged in this menial occupation gave her no thrills .
i finished the loading .
" there ! "
i said , and <name> a dollar <name> out of my pocket and gave it to her .
even then she did not thank me , but took up the wagon tongue and went off , leaving on me a disheartening impression of <unk> , of life crushed out .
i glanced up once more at the mansion i had built for myself looming in the dusk , and walked hurriedly away ... . one afternoon some three weeks after we had moved into the new house , i came out of the club , where i had been lunching in conference with scherer and two capitalists from new york .
it was after four o'clock , the day was fading , the street lamps were beginning to cast sickly streaks of <unk> light across the slush of the pavements .
it was the sight of this slush ( which for a brief half hour that morning had been pure snow , and had sent <name> and moreton and biddy into ecstasies at the notion of a " real christmas " ) , that brought to my mind the <unk> of the festival , and the fact that i had as yet bought no presents .
such was the predicament in which i usually found myself on christmas <name> ; and it was not without a certain sense of annoyance at the task thus abruptly confronting me that i got into my automobile and directed the chauffeur to the shopping district .
the crowds surged along the wet sidewalks and overflowed into the street , and over the heads of the people i stared at the blazing <unk> decked out in christmas greens .
my chauffeur , a <unk> parisian , blew his horn insolently , men and women jostled each other to get out of the way , their holiday mood giving place to resentment as they stared into the windows of the <unk> .
with the american inability to sit still i shifted from one corner of the seat to another , impatient at the slow progress of the machine : and i felt a certain contempt for human beings , that they should make all this fuss , burden themselves with all these senseless purchases , for a tradition .
the automobile stopped , and i fought my way across the sidewalk into the store of that <unk> firm , <unk> , yates and <unk> , pausing uncertainly before the very counter where , some ten years before , i had bought an engagement ring .
young mr. <unk> himself spied me , and handing over a customer to a tired clerk , hurried forward to greet me , his manner implying that my entrance was in some sort an event .
i had become used to this aroma of deference .
" what can i show you , mr .
paret ? "
he asked .
" i do n't know  i 'm looking around , " i said , vaguely , bewildered by the glittering <unk> by which i was confronted .
what did <name> want ?
while i was gazing into the case , mr. <unk> opened a safe behind him , laying before me a large sapphire set with diamonds in a platinum brooch ; a beautiful stone , in the depths of it gleaming a fire like a <name> in an arctic sky .
i had not given <name> anything of value of late .
decidedly , this was of value ; mr. <unk> named the price glibly ; if mrs. paret did n't care for it , it might be brought back or exchanged .
i took it , with a sigh of relief .
leaving the store , i paused on the edge of the rushing stream of humanity , with the problem of the children 's gifts still to be solved .
i thought of my own childhood , when at <unk> i had walked with my mother up and down this very street , so changed and <unk> now ; recalling that i had had definite desires , desperate ones ; but my imagination failed me when i tried to summon up the emotions connected with them .
i had no desires now : i could buy anything in reason in the whole street .
what did <name> and moreton want ?
and little biddy ?
<name> had not " spoiled " them ; but they did n't seem to have any definite wants .
the children made me think , with a sudden softening , of <name> peters , and i went into a <unk> 's and bought him a box of expensive cigars .
then i told the chauffeur to take me to a <unk> , where i stood staring through a plate-glass window at the elaborate playthings devised for the modern children of luxury .
in the centre was a toy man-of-war , three feet in length , with turrets and guns , and propellers and a real steam-engine .
as a boy i should have dreamed about it , <unk> for it , bartered my immortal soul for it .
but  if i gave it to <name> , what was there for moreton ?
a steam locomotive caught my eye , almost as elaborate .
forcing my way through the doors , i captured a salesman , and from a state bordering on nervous collapse he became <unk> into an intense <unk> and respect when he understood my desires .
he did n't know the price of the objects in question .
he brought the proprietor , an obsequious little <name> who , on learning my name , repeated it in every sentence .
for biddy i chose a doll that was all but human ; when held by a young woman for my inspection , it elicited murmurs of admiration from the women <unk> by whom we were surrounded .
the proprietor promised to make a special delivery of the three articles before seven o'clock ... .
presently the automobile , after speeding up the asphalt of <name> avenue , stopped before the new house .
in spite of the change that house had made in my life , in three weeks i had become amazingly used to it ; yet i had an odd feeling that christmas <name> as i stood under the portico with my key in the door , the same feeling of the <unk> of the place which i had experienced before .
not that for one moment i would have exchanged it for the smaller house we had left .
i opened the door .
how often , in that other house , i had come in the evening seeking quiet , my <name> occupied with a problem , only to be annoyed by the romping of the children on the landing above .
a noise in one end of it echoed to the other .
but here , as i entered the hall , all was quiet : a dignified , <unk> stairway swept upward before me , and on either side were wide , empty rooms ; and in the subdued light of one of them i saw a dark figure moving silently about  the butler .
he came forward to relieve me , deftly , of my hat and overcoat .
well , i had it at last , this establishment to which i had for so long looked forward .
and yet that evening , as i hesitated in the hall , i somehow was unable to grasp that it was real and permanent , the very solidity of the walls and doors paradoxically suggested <unk> , the butler a flitting ghost .
how still the place was !
almost <unk> still .
i recalled oddly a story of a peasant who , yearning for the great life , had stumbled upon an empty palace , its tables set with food in golden dishes .
before two days had passed he had fled from it in horror back to his crowded cottage and his drudgery in the fields .
never once had the sense of possession of the palace been realized .
nor did i feel that i possessed this house , though i had the deeds of it in my safe and the <unk> bills in my files .
it eluded me ; seemed , in my bizarre mood of that evening , almost to mock me .
" you have built me , " it seemed to say , " but i am stronger than you , because you have not earned me . "
ridiculous , when the years of my labour and the size of my bank account were considered !
such , however , is the verbal expression of my feeling .
was the house empty , after all ?
had something happened ?
with a slight <unk> sensation i climbed the stairs , with their endless shallow <unk> , to hurry through the silent hallway to the schoolroom .
reassuring noises came faintly through the heavy door .
i opened it .
little biddy was <unk> round and round , crying out :  " to-morrow 's <unk> !
<name> claus is coming tonight . "
<name> was regarding her <unk> , sympathetically , moreton rather scornfully .
the myth had been exploded for both , but <name> still hugged it .
that was the difference between them .
<name> , seated on the floor , perceived me first , and glanced up at me with a smile .
" it 's father ! "
she said .
biddy stopped in the midst of a <unk> .
at the age of seven she was still shy with me , and retreated towards <name> .
" are n't we going to have a tree , father ? "
demanded moreton , aggressively .
" mother wo n't tell us  neither <name> miss <unk> . "
miss <unk> was their governess .
" why do you want a tree ? "
i asked .
" oh , for biddy , " he said .
" it would n't be christmas without a tree , " <name> declared , "  and <name> claus , " he added , for his sister 's benefit .
" perhaps <name> claus , when he sees we 've got this big house , <name> think we do n't need anything , and go on to some poorer children , " said <name> .
" you would n't blame him if he did that ,  would you ? "
the response to this appeal can not be said to have been enthusiastic ... . after dinner , when at last all of them were in bed , we dressed the tree ; it might better be said that <name> and miss <unk> dressed it , while i gave a <unk> aid .
both the women took such a <name> in the process , <unk> with each other in getting effects , and as i watched them eagerly <unk> the tinsel and pinning on the glittering ornaments i wondered why it was that i was unable to find the same <name> as they .
thus it had been every christmas <name> .
i was always tired when i got home , and after dinner relaxation set in .
an <unk> had come while we were at the table , and had fastened on the little electric bulbs which did duty as candles .
" oh , " said <name> , as she stood off to survey the effect , " is n't it beautiful !
come , miss <unk> , let 's get the presents . "
they flew out of the room , and presently hurried back with their arms full of the usual parcels : parcels from <name> 's family in elkington , from my own relatives , from the <unk> and the <unk> , from <name> .
in the meantime i had had my own contributions brought up , the man of war , the locomotive , the big doll .
<name> stood staring .
" <name> , they 'll be utterly ruined ! "
she exclaimed .
" the boys might as well have something instructive , " i replied , " and as for biddy  nothing 's too good for her . "
" i might have known you would n't forget them , although you are so busy . " ... .
we filled the three stockings <name> by the great fireplace .
then , with a last lingering look at the brightness of the tree , she stood in the doorway and turned the electric switch .
" not before seven to-morrow morning , miss <unk> , " she said .
" <name> , you <name> get up , wo n't you ?
you must n't miss seeing them .
you can go back to bed again . "
i promised .
evidently , this was reality to <name> .
and had it not been one of my dreams of marriage , this preparing for the children 's christmas , remembering the fierce desires of my own childhood ?
it struck me , after i had kissed her good night and retired to my dressing-room , that fierce desires burned within me still , but the objects towards which their flames leaped out differed .
that was all .
had i remained a child , since my idea of pleasure was still that of youth ?
the craving far excitement , adventure , was still <unk> ; the craving far freedom as keen as ever .
during the whole of my married life , i had been conscious of an inner protest against " settling down , " as <name> peters had settled down .
the smaller house from which we had moved , with its enforced <unk> , hard emphasized the bondage of marriage .
now i had two rooms to myself , in the undisputed possession of which i had taken a <unk> delight .
on one side of my dressing-room <name> <unk> had provided a huge closet containing the latest devices for the keeping of a multitudinous wardrobe ; there was a <unk> , and the easiest of <unk> , imported from england , while between the windows were shelves of italian walnut which i had filled with the books i had bought while at cambridge , and had never since opened .
as i sank down in my chair that odd feeling of uneasiness , of <unk> and unreality , of <unk> i had had ever since we had moved suddenly became intensified , and at the very moment when i had gained everything i had once believed a man could <name> !
i was successful , i was <name> , my health had not failed , i had a wife who <unk> to my wishes , lovable children who gave no trouble and yet  there was still the void to be filled , the old void i had felt as a boy , the longing for something beyond me , i knew not what ; there was the strange inability to taste any of these things , the need at every turn for excitement , for a stimulus .
my marriage had been a disappointment , though i strove to conceal this from myself ; a disappointment because it had not filled the requirements of my category  excitement and mystery : i had provided the setting and lacked the happiness .
another woman <name>  might have given me the needed <unk> ; and yet my thoughts did not dwell on <name> that night , my longings were not directed towards her , but towards the vision of a calm , contented married happiness i had looked forward to in youth ,  a vision suddenly presented once more by the sight of <unk> simple pleasure in dressing the christmas tree .
what restless , fiendish element in me prevented my enjoying that ?
i had something of the fearful feeling of a ghost in my own house and among my own family , of a spirit doomed to wander , unable to share in what should have been my own , in what would have saved me were i able to partake of it .
was it too late to make that effort ? ...
presently the strains of music pervaded my consciousness , the <unk> of <name> ringing out in the damp night the christmas hymn , <unk> <unk> .
it was midnight it was christmas .
how clear the notes rang through the wet air that came in at my window !
back into the dim centuries that music led me , into <unk> gothic chapels of monasteries on <unk> heights above the firs , and cathedrals in mediaeval cities .
twilight ages of war and scourge and stress and storm  and <name> .
" oh , come , all ye faithful ! "
what a strange thing , that <name> whose flame so marvellously persisted , piercing the gloom ; the christmas myth , as i had heard someone once call it .
did it possess the power to save me ?
save me from what ?
ah , in this hour i knew .
in the darkness the danger loomed up before me , vague yet terrible , and i trembled .
why was not this thing ever present , to <unk> and sober me ?
the thing was myself .
into my remembrance , by what suggestion i know not , came that march evening when i had gone to holder chapel at harvard to listen to a preacher , a personality whose fame and influence had since spread throughout the land .
some dim fear had possessed me then .
i recalled vividly the man , and the face of hermann krebs as i <name> back from the doorway ... .
when i awoke my disquieting , <unk> mood had disappeared , and yet there clung to me , minus the sanction of fear or reward or revealed truth , a certain determination to behave , on this day at least , more like a father and a husband : to make an effort to enter into the spirit of the festival , and see what happened .
i dressed in cheerful haste , took the sapphire pendant from its <name> box , tiptoed into the still silent schoolroom and <name> it on the tree , flooding on the electric light that set the tinsel and globes ablaze .
no sooner had i done this than i heard the patter of feet in the hallway , and a high-pitched voice  biddy 's  crying out :  " it 's <name> claus ! "
three small , <unk> figures stood in the doorway .
" why , it 's father ! "
exclaimed moreton .
" and he 's all dressed ! "
said <name> .
" <unk> ! "
cried biddy , staring at the blazing tree , " is n't it beautiful ! "
<name> was close behind them .
she gave an exclamation of delighted surprise when she saw me , and then stood gazing with shining eyes at the children , especially at biddy , who stood dazzled by the <name> of the constellation confronting her ... . <name> , too , wished to prolong the moment of mystery .
it was the practical moreton who cried :  " let 's see what we 've got ! "
the assault and the sacking began .
i could n't help thinking as i watched them of my own wildly riotous , <unk> sensations , when all the gifts had worn the <name> of the supernatural ; but the arrival of these toys was looked upon by my children as a part of the natural order of the universe .
at <name> 's suggestion the night before we had placed my presents , pieces de resistance , at a distance from the tree , in the <name> that they would not be spied at once , that they would be in some sort a climax .
it was <name> who first perceived the ship , and identified it , by the card , as his property .
to him it was clearly wonderful , but no miracle .
he did not cry out , or call the attention of the others to it , but stood with his feet apart , examining it , his first remark being a query as to why it did n't fly the american flag .
it 's ensign was british .
then moreton saw the locomotive , was told that it was his , and took possession of it violently .
why was n't there more track ?
wouldn't i get more track ?
i explained that it would go by steam , and he began <unk> the cap on the little boiler until he was distracted by the man-of-war , and with natural <unk> started to take possession of that .
biddy was bewildered by the doll , which <name> had taken up and was holding in her lap .
she had had talking dolls before , and dolls that closed their eyes ; she recognized this one , indeed , as a sort of <unk> , but her little mind was modern , too , and set no limits on what might be accomplished .
she patted it , but was more impressed by the <unk> of miss <unk> , who had come in and was admiring it with some extravagance .
suddenly the child caught sight of her stocking , until now forgotten , and darted for the fireplace .
i turned to <name> , who stood beside me , watching them .
" but you have n't looked on the tree yourself , " i reminded her .
she gave me an odd , questioning glance , and got up and set down the doll .
as she stood for a moment gazing at the lights , she seemed very girlish in her dressing-gown , with her hair in two long <unk> down her back .
" oh , <name> ! "
she lifted the pendant from the branch and held it up .
her gratitude , her <name> at receiving a present was deeper than the children 's !
" you chose it for me ? "
i felt something like a pang when i thought how little trouble it had been .
" if you do n't like it , " i said , " or wish to have it changed  " " changed ! "
she exclaimed reproachfully .
" do you think i 'd change it ?
only  it 's much too valuable  " i smiled ... . miss <unk> deftly undid the clasp and <name> it around <name> 's neck .
" how it suits you , mrs .
paret ! "
she cried ... .
this pendant was by no means the only present i had given <name> in recent years , and though she cared as little for jewels as for dress she seemed to attach to it a peculiar value and significance that disturbed and smote me , for the incident had revealed a love unchanged and <unk> .
had she taken my gift as a sign that my indifference was melting ?
as i went downstairs and into the library to read the financial <name> of the morning newspaper i asked myself , with a certain <unk> , whether , in the formal , complicated , and luxurious conditions in which we now lived it might be possible to build up new ties and common interests .
i reflected that this would involve confessions and confidences on my part , since there was a whole side of my life of which <name> knew nothing .
i had convinced myself long ago that a man 's business career was no affair of his wife 's : i had justified that career to myself : yet i had always had a vague feeling that <name> , had she known the details , would not have approved of it .
impossible , indeed , for a woman to grasp these problems .
they were outside of her experience .
nevertheless , something might be done to improve our relationship , something which would relieve me of that uneasy lack of unity i felt when at home , of the <unk> and <unk> i was wont to feel creeping over me on sundays and holidays ... . xx .
i find in relating those parts of my experience that seem to be of most significance i have neglected to tell of my mother 's death , which occurred the year before we moved to <name> avenue .
she had clung the rest of her days to the house in which i had been born .
of late years she had lived in my children , and <name> 's devotion to her had been <unk> .
truth compels me to say that she had long ceased to be a factor in my life .
i have thought of her in later years .
coincident with the unexpected feeling of <unk> that came to me with the <name> avenue house , of things achieved but not realized or appreciated , was the appearance of a cloud on the business horizon ; or rather on the political horizon , since it is hard to separate the two realms .
there were signs , for those who could read , of a rising popular storm .
during the earliest years of the new century the political atmosphere had changed , the public had shown a tendency to grow restless ; and everybody knows how important it is for financial operations , for prosperity , that the people should mind their own business .
in short , our <unk> pilgrimage began to meet with unexpected resistance .
it was as though the nation were entering into a senseless conspiracy to kill prosperity .
in the first place , in regard to the presidency of the united states , a <unk> had unwittingly been slipped .
it had always been recognized  as i have said  by responsible financial personages that the impulses of the majority of americans could not be trusted , that these  who had inherited illusions of freedom  must be governed firmly yet with delicacy ; unknown to them , their presidents must be chosen for them , precisely as mr. watling had been chosen for the people of our state , and the popular enthusiasm manufactured later .
there were informal meetings in new york , in washington , where candidates were discussed ; not that such and such a man was settled upon ,  it was a process of elimination .
usually the affair had gone smoothly .
for instance , a while before , a benevolent capitalist of the middle west , an intimate of adolf scherer , had become <unk> with the idea that a friend of his was the safest and <unk> man for the head of the nation , had convinced his <unk> of this , whereupon he had gone ahead to spend his energy and his money freely to secure the nomination and election of this gentleman .
the republican national committee , the republican national convention were allowed to <unk> to their hearts ' content as to whether smith , jones or brown should be nominated , but it was clearly understood that if robinson or white were chosen there would be no corporation campaign funds .
this applied also to the democratic party , on the rare occasions when it seemed to have an opportunity of winning .
now , however , through an unpardonable blunder , there had got into the white house a president who was inclined to ignore advice , who appealed over the heads of the " advisers " to the populace ; who went about tilting at the industrial structures we had so painfully wrought , and in frequent blasts of presidential messages <unk> new and <unk> doctrines ; who attacked the railroads , encouraged the brazen treason of labour unions , inspired an army of " <unk> " to fill the magazines with the wildest and most violent of language .
state <unk> were emboldened to pass mischievous and <unk> laws , and much of my time began to be occupied in inducing , by various means , our courts to declare these <unk> .
how we sighed for a business man or a lawyer in the white house !
the country had gone mad , the <unk> trembled , the cry of " corporation control " resounded everywhere , and everywhere <unk> arose to <unk> " reform campaigns , " in an abortive attempt to " clean up politics . "
down with the bosses , who were the tools of the corporations !
in our own city , which we fondly believed to be proof against the prevailing madness , a slight epidemic occurred ; slight , yet momentarily alarming .
accidents <name> happen , even in the best regulated political organizations ,  and accidents in these days appeared to be the rule .
a certain mr. <name> greenhalge , a middle-aged , <unk> and inoffensive man who had made a moderate fortune in wholesale drugs , was elected to the school board .
later on some of us had reason to suspect that <name> blackwood  with more astuteness than he had been given credit for  was responsible for mr. greenhalge 's <unk> .
at any rate , he was not a man to oppose , and in his previous life had given no hint that he might become a trouble maker .
nothing happened for several months .
but one day on which i had occasion to interview mr. <name> on a little matter of handing over to the railroad a piece of land belonging to the city , which was known as billings ' bowl , he inferred that mr. <unk> might prove a <unk> of that profound peace with which the city administration had for many years been blessed .
" who the hell is he ? "
was mr. <name> 's question .
it appeared that mr. g. 's private life had been investigated , with <unk> barren results ; he was , seemingly , an <unk> being in our <unk> age , an <unk> man ; he had never sold any drugs to the city ; he was not a church member ; nor could it be learned that he had ever wandered into those <unk> of the town where mr. <name> might easily have got trace of him : if he had any vices , he kept them locked up in a <unk> box that could not be " located . "
he was very genial , and had a way of conveying disturbing facts  when he wished to convey them  under cover of the most amusing stories .
mr. <name> was not a man to get <unk> .
greenhalge could be handled all right , only  what was there in it for greenhalge ?  a nut difficult for mr. <name> to crack .
the two other members of the school board were solid .
here again the wisest of men was proved to err , for mr. greenhalge turned out to have powers of persuasion ; he made what in religious terms would have been called a conversion in the case of another member of the board , an hitherto staunch old <unk> by the name of muller , an <unk> in comfortable circumstances to whom the idea of public office had appealed .
mr. greenhalge , having got wind of certain transactions that interested him extremely , brought them in his good-natured way to the knowledge of mr. <name> , the district attorney , suggesting that he investigate .
mr. <name> smiled ; undertook , as delicately as possible , to convey to mr. greenhalge the ways of the world , and of the political world in particular , wherein , it seemed , everyone was a good fellow .
mr. greenhalge was evidently a good fellow , and did n't want to make trouble over little things .
no , mr. greenhalge did n't want to make trouble ; he appreciated a comfortable life as much as mr. <name> ; he told the district attorney a funny story which might or might not have had an application to the affair , and took his leave with the remark that he had been happy to make mr. <name> 's acquaintance .
on his departure the district attorney 's countenance changed .
he severely rebuked a subordinate for some trivial mistake , and walked as rapidly as he could <name> his considerable weight to <unk> 's saloon ... . one of the things mr. <name> had pointed out incidentally was that mr. <unk> evidence was vague , and that a grand jury wanted facts , which might be difficult to obtain .
mr. greenhalge , thinking over the suggestion , sent for krebs .
in the course of a month or two the investigation was accomplished , greenhalge went back to <name> ; who repeated his <unk> , whereupon he was handed a hundred or so typewritten pages of evidence .
it was a dramatic moment .
mr. <name> resorted to pleading .
he was sure that mr. greenhalge didn't want to be disagreeable , it was true and unfortunate that such things were so , but they would be amended : he promised all his influence to amend them .
the public conscience , said mr. <name> , was being aroused .
now how much better for the party , for the reputation , the fair name of the city if these things could be corrected quietly , and nobody <unk> or tried !
between sensible and humane men , was n't that the obvious way ?
after the election , suit could be brought to recover the money .
but mr. greenhalge appeared to be one of those hopeless individuals without a spark of party loyalty ; he merely continued to smile , and to suggest that the district attorney prosecute .
mr. <name> <unk> , and presently left the city on a vacation .
a day or two after his second visit to the district attorney 's office mr. greenhalge had a call from the city auditor and the purchasing agent , who talked about their families ,  which was very painful .
it was also intimated to mr. greenhalge by others who accosted him that he was just the man for mayor .
he smiled , and modestly <unk> his qualifications ... .
suddenly , one fine morning , a part of the evidence krebs had gathered appeared in the columns of the mail and state , a new and enterprising newspaper for which the growth and prosperity of our city were responsible ; the sort of " revelations " that stirred to amazement and wrath innocent citizens of nearly every city in our country : politics and " graft " <unk> our entire educational system , teachers and <unk> levied upon , prices that took the breath away paid to favoured firms for supplies , specifications so worded that reasonable bids were barred .
the respectable firm of <unk> and <unk> was involved .
in spite of our horror , we were americans and saw the humour of the situation , and laughed at the caricature in the mail and state representing a scholar holding up a pencil and a legend under it , " no , it 's not gold , but it ought to be . "
here i must enter into a little secret history .
any affair that threatened the integrity of mr. <name> 's organization was of serious moment to the gentlemen of the financial world who found that organization invaluable and who were also concerned about the fair name of their community ; a conference in the boyne club decided that the city officials were being persecuted , and entitled therefore to " the very best of counsel , "  in this instance , mr. <name> paret .
it was also thought wise by mr. dickinson , mr. gorse , and mr. grierson , and by mr. paret himself that he should not appear in the matter ; an aspiring young attorney , mr. <unk> , was retained to conduct the case in public .
thus capital came to the assistance of mr. <name> , a fund was raised , and i was given <unk> <name> to defend the miserable city auditor and purchasing agent , both of whom elicited my sympathy ; for they were stout men , and rapidly losing weight .
our first care was to create a delay in the trial of the case in order to give the public excitement a chance to die down .
for the public is <unk> unable to fix its attention for long on one object , continually demanding the distraction that our newspapers make it their business to supply .
fortunately , a murder was committed in one of our suburbs , creating a mystery that filled the " extras " for some weeks , and this was <unk> followed by the <unk> of a considerable sum by the cashier of one of our state banks .
public interest was divided between baseball and the tracking of this criminal to new zealand .
our resentment was directed , not so much against commissioner greenhalge as against krebs .
it is curious how keen is the instinct of men like grierson , dickinson , tallant and scherer for the really dangerous opponent .
who the deuce was this man krebs ?
well , i could supply them with some information : they doubtless recalled the galligan , case ; and miller gorse , who forgot nothing , also remembered his opposition in the legislature to house <name> 709 .
he had continued to be the obscure legal champion of " oppressed " labour , but how he had managed to keep body and soul together i knew not .
i had encountered him occasionally in court corridors or on the street ; he did not seem to change much ; nor did he appear in our brief and <unk> conversations to bear any resentment against me for the part i had taken in the galligan affair .
i avoided him when it was possible ... .
i had to admit that he had done a remarkably good piece of work in collecting greenhalge 's evidence , and how the erring city officials were to be rescued became a matter of serious concern .
<name> , the district attorney , was in an abject funk ; in any case a <unk> lawyer , after the indictment he was no help at all .
i had to do all the work , and after we had selected the particular " railroad " judge before whom the case was to be tried , i talked it over with him .
his name was <unk> , he understood perfectly what was required of him , and that he was for the moment the chief bulwark on which depended the logical interests of capital and sane government for their defence ; also , his <unk> was at stake .
it was indicated to newspapers ( such as the mail and state ) showing a <name> to keep up public interest in the affair that their advertising matter might decrease ; mr. <name> 's great department store , for instance , did not approve of this sort of agitation .
certain <unk> , booksellers and other business men had got " cold feet , " as mr. <name> put it , the prospect of bankruptcy suddenly looming ahead of them ,  since the corn national bank held certain paper ... .
in short , when the case did come to trial , it " blew up , " as one of our <name> leaders <unk> expressed it .
several important witnesses were mysteriously lacking , and two or three <unk> had suddenly decided  to take a trip to europe .
the district attorney was ill , and assigned the prosecution to a mild assistant ; while a sceptical jury  composed largely of gentlemen who had the business interests of the community , and of themselves , at heart returned a verdict of " not guilty . "
this was the signal for severely dignified <unk> in mr. tallant 's and other conservative newspapers , hinting that it might be well in the future for all well-meaning but misguided reformers to think twice before subjecting the city to the cost of such trials , and <unk> attempting to <unk> public opinion and upset legitimate business .
the <name> expressed the opinion that no city in the united states was " more efficiently and <unk> governed than our own . "
" irregularities " might well occur in every large organization ; and it would better have become mr. greenhalge if , instead of hiring an unknown lawyer <unk> for notoriety to cook up charges , he had called the attention of the proper officials to the matter , etc. , etc .
the pilot alone , which relied on sensation for its circulation , kept hammering away for a time with veiled accusations .
but our citizens had become weary ... . as a topic , however , this effective suppression of reform was referred to with some delicacy by my friends and myself .
our interference had been necessary and therefore justified , but we were not particularly proud of it , and our triumph had a temporarily <unk> effect .
it was about this time , if i remember correctly , that mr. dickinson gave the beautiful <unk> window to the church ... .
months passed .
one day , having occasion to go over to the boyne iron works to get information at first hand from certain officials , and having finished my business , i boarded a south side electric car standing at the terminal .
just before it started krebs came down the aisle of the car and took the seat in front of me .
" well , " i said , " how are you ? "
he turned in surprise , and thrust his big , bony hand across the back of the seat .
" come and sit here . "
he came .
" do you ever get back to cambridge in these days ? "
i asked cordially .
" not since i graduated from newspaper work in boston .
that 's a good many years ago .
by the way , our old landlady died this year . "
" do you mean  ? "
" granite face , " i was about to say .
i had forgotten her name , but that homesick scene when <name> and i stood before our open trunks , when krebs had paid us a visit , came back to me .
" you 've kept in touch with her ? "
i asked , in surprise .
" well , " said krebs , " she was one of the few friends i had at cambridge .
i had a letter from the daughter last week .
she 's done very well , and is an instructor in biology in one of the western universities . "
i was silent a moment .
" and you ,  you never married , did you ? "
i inquired , somewhat irrelevantly .
his <unk> gesture seemed to deny that such a luxury was for him .
the conversation dragged a little ; i began to feel the curiosity he invariably inspired .
what was his life ?
what were his beliefs ?
and i was possessed by a certain <unk> , a <name> to " smoke him out . "
i did not stop to reflect that mine was in reality a defensive rather than an aggressive attitude .
" do you live down here , in this part of the city ? "
i asked .
no , he boarded in fowler street .
i knew it as in a district given over to the small houses of <unk> .
" i suppose you are still a socialist . "
" i suppose i am , " he admitted , and added , " at any rate , that is as near as you can get to it . "
" is n't it fairly definite ? "
" fairly , if my notions are taken in general as the antithesis of what you fellows believe . "
" the abolition of property , for instance . "
" the abolition of too much property . "
" what do you mean by 'too much ' ? "
" when it ceases to be real to a man , when it represents more than his need , when it drives him and he becomes a slave to it . "
involuntarily i thought of my new house ,  not a soothing reflection .
" but who is going to decree how much property , a man should have ? "
" nobody  everybody .
that <name> gradually tend to work itself out as we become more sensible and better educated , and understand more clearly what is good for us . "
i retorted with the stock , common-sense phrase .
" if we had a division to-morrow , within a few years or so the most efficient would contrive to get the bulk of it back in their hands . "
" that 's so , " he admitted .
" but we 're not going to have a division to-morrow . "
" thank god ! "
i exclaimed .
he regarded me .
" the <unk> ' <name> have to die or be educated first .
that <name> take time . "
" educated ! "
" paret , have you ever read any serious books on what you call socialism ? "
he asked .
i threw out an impatient negative .
i was going on to protest that i was not ignorant of the doctrine .
" oh , what you call socialism is merely what you believe to be the more or less crude and <unk> <unk> of an obscure political party .
that is n't socialism .
nor is the <unk> attempt that the <name> socialists make to unite modern <unk> philosophy with <name> orthodoxy , socialism . "
" what is socialism , then ? "
i demanded , somewhat defiantly .
" let 's call it education , science , " he said smilingly , " economics and government based on human needs and a rational view of religion .
it has been taught in <name> universities , and it <name> be taught in ours whenever we shall succeed in inducing your friends , by one means or another , not to continue <unk> them .
socialism , in the proper sense , is merely the application of modern science to government . "
i was puzzled and angry .
what he said made sense somehow , but it sounded to me like so much <unk> .
" but germany is a monarchy , " i objected .
" it is a modern , scientific system with monarchy as its <unk> .
it is anomalous , but <name> .
the monarchy is there for all men to see , and some day it <name> be done away with .
we are <unk> a democracy , and our <unk> is <unk> .
our people feel the burden , but they have not yet discovered what the burden is . "
" and when they do ? "
i asked , a little defiantly .
" when they do , " replied krebs , " they <name> set about making the <unk> happy .
now <unk> are discontented , and never satisfied ; the more they get , the more they want , the more they are troubled by what other people have . "
i smiled in spite of myself .
" your interest in  in <unk> is charitable , then ? "
" why , yes , " he said , " my interest in all kinds of people is charitable .
however improbable it may seem , i have no reason to dislike or envy people who have more than they know what to do with . "
and the worst of it was he looked it .
he managed somehow simply by sitting there with his strange eyes fixed upon me  in spite of his ridiculous philosophy  to <unk> my ambitions , to make of small worth my achievements , to bring home to me the fact that in spite of these i was neither contented nor happy though he kept his humour and his poise , he implied an experience that was far deeper , more tragic and more significant than mine .
i was goaded into making an <unk> remark .
" well , your campaign against <unk> and <name> fell through , didn't it ? "
<unk> and <name> were the city officials who had been tried .
" it was n't a campaign against them , " he answered .
" and considering the subordinate part i took in it , it could scarcely be called mine . "
" greenhalge turned to you to get the evidence . "
" well , i got it , " he said .
" what became of it ? "
" you ought to know . "
" what do you mean ? "
" just what i say , paret , " he answered slowly .
" you ought to know , if anyone knows . "
i considered this a moment , more soberly .
i thought i might have counted on my fingers the number of men cognizant of my connection with the case .
i decided that he was guessing .
" i think you should explain that , " i told him .
" the time may come , when you 'll have to explain it . "
" is that a threat ? "
i demanded .
" a threat ? "
he repeated .
" not at all . "
" but you are accusing me  " " of what ? "
he interrupted suddenly .
he had made it necessary for me to define the nature of his charges .
" of having had some connection with the affair in question . "
" whatever else i may be , i 'm not a fool , " he said quietly .
" neither the district attorney 's office , nor young <unk> had brains enough to get them out of that scrape .
<name> did n't have influence enough with the judiciary , and , as i happen to know , there was a good deal of money spent . "
" you may be called upon to prove it , " i retorted , rather hotly .
" so i may . "
his tone , far from being defiant , had in it a note of sadness .
i looked at him .
what were his <unk> ?
was it not just possible that i should have to <unk> my idea of him , acknowledge that he might become more formidable than i had thought ?
there was an awkward silence .
" you must n't imagine , paret , that i have any personal animus against you , or against any of the men with whom you 're associated , " he went on , after a moment .
" i 'm sorry you 're on that side , that 's all ,  i told you so once before .
i 'm not calling you names , i 'm not talking about morality and immorality .
immorality , when you come down to it , is often just the opposition to progress that comes from blindness .
i don't make the mistake of blaming a few individuals for the evils of modern industrial society , and on the other hand you must n't blame individuals for the discomforts of what you call the reform movement , for that movement is merely a symptom  a symptom of a disease due to a change in the structure of society .
we 'll never have any happiness or real prosperity until we cure that disease .
i was inclined to blame you once , at the capital that time , because it seemed to me that a man with all the advantages you have had and a mind like yours did n't have much excuse .
but i 've thought about it since ; i realize now that i 've had a good many more <unk> ' than you , and to tell you the truth , i don't see how you could have come out anywhere else than where you are ,  all your surroundings and training were against it .
that does n't mean that you wo n't grasp the situation some day  i have an idea you <name> .
it's just an idea .
the man who ought to be condemned is n't the man that does n't understand what 's going on , but the man who comes to understand and <unk> in opposing it . "
he rose and looked down at me with the queer , disturbing smile i remembered .
" i get off at this corner , " he added , rather <unk> .
" i <name> you 'll forgive me for being personal .
i did n't mean to be , but you rather forced it on me . "
" oh , that 's all right , " i replied .
the car stopped , and he hurried off .
i watched his tall figure as it disappeared among the crowd on the sidewalk ... .
i returned to my office in one of those moods that are the more disagreeable because conflicting .
to-day in particular i had been aroused by what <name> used to call krebs 's " crust , " and as i sat at my desk warm waves of resentment went through me at the very notion of his telling me that my view was limited and that therefore my professional conduct was to be forgiven !
it was he , the fanatic , who saw things in the larger scale !
an assumption the more exasperating because at the moment he made it he almost convinced me that he did , and i was unable to achieve for him the measure of contempt i desired , for the incident , the measure of ridicule it deserved .
my real animus was due to the fact that he had managed to shake my self-confidence , to take the flavour out of my achievements ,  a flavour that was in the course of an hour to be completely restored by one of those interesting coincidences occasionally occurring in life .
a young member of my staff entered with a telegram ; i tore it open , and sat staring at it a moment before i realized that it brought to me the greatest honour of my career .
the <unk> in new york had summoned me for consultation .
to be recognized by him conferred indeed an <unk> , the <name> and garter , so to speak , of the only great realm in <name> , that of high finance ; and the yellow piece of paper i held in my hand instantly <unk> me , renewed my energy , and i hurried home to pack my bag in order to catch the seven o'clock train .
i announced the news to <name> .
" i imagine it 's because he knows i have made something of a study of the coal roads situation , " i added .
" i 'm glad , <name> , " she said .
" i suppose it 's a great compliment . "
never had her inadequacy to appreciate my career been more apparent !
i looked at her curiously , to realize once more with peculiar sharpness how far we were apart ; but now the resolutions i had made  and never carried out  on that first christmas in the new home were lacking .
indeed , it was the futility of such resolutions that struck me at this moment .
if her manner had been merely one of indifference , it would in a way have been easier to bear ; she was simply incapable of grasping the significance of the event , the meaning to me of the years of unceasing , ambitious effort it crowned .
" yes , it is something of a recognition , " i replied .
" is there anything i can get for you in new york ?
i do n't know how long i shall have to stay  i 'll telegraph you when i 'm getting back . "
i kissed her and hurried out to the automobile .
as i drove off i saw her still standing in the doorway looking after me ... .
in the station i had a few minutes to telephone <name> .
" if you do n't see me for a few days it 's because i 've gone to new york , " i informed her .
" something important , i 'm sure . "
" how did you guess ? "
i demanded , and heard her laugh .
" come back soon and tell me about it , " she said , and i walked , <unk> , to the train ... . as i sped through the night , staring out of the window into the darkness , i reflected on the man i was going to see .
but at that time , although he represented to me the <unk> of achievement and power , i did not by any means grasp the many sided significance of the phenomenon he presented , though i was keenly aware of his influence , and that men spoke of him with bated breath .
presidents came and went , kings and emperors had responsibilities and were subject daily to annoyances , but this man was a law unto himself .
he did exactly what he chose , and compelled other men to do it .
wherever commerce reigned ,  and where did it not ?  he was king and head of its holy empire , pope and emperor at once .
for he had his code of ethics , his religion , and those who rebelled , who failed to conform , he <unk> ; a code something like the map of europe ,  apparently inconsistent in places .
what i did not then comprehend was that he was the american principle <unk> , the supreme individual assertion of the conviction that government should remain modestly in the background while the efficient acquired the supremacy that was theirs by natural right ; nor had i grasped at that time the crowning achievement of a unity that fused christianity with those <unk> dispositions said to be inherent in humanity .
in him the lion and the lamb , the eagle and the dove dwelt together in amity and power .
new york , always a congenial place to gentlemen of vitality and means and influential connections , had never appeared to me more sparkling , more inspiring .
<name> had relented , spring had not as yet begun .
and as i sat in a corner of the dining-room of my hotel looking out on the sunlit avenue i was conscious of partaking of the vigour and confidence of the well-dressed , <unk> people who walked or drove past my window with the air of a conquering race .
what else was there in the world more worth having than this conquering sense ?
religion might offer charms to the weak .
yet here religion itself became sensible , and wore the garb of prosperity .
the <unk> of the tall church on the corner was all lace ; and the very saints in their <unk> , who had known martyrdom and poverty , seemed to have renounced these as foolish , and to look down complacently on the procession of wealth and <unk> across the street , behind a sheet of glass , was a <unk> where were displayed the shining yellow and black panels of a closed automobile , the cost of which would have built a farm-house and stocked a barn .
at eleven o'clock , the appointed hour , i was in wall street .
sending in my name , i was speedily ushered into a room containing a table , around which were several men ; but my eyes were drawn at once to the figure of the great banker who sat , massive and preponderant , at one end , smoking a cigar , and listening in silence to the conversation i had interrupted .
he rose courteously and gave me his hand , and a glance that is <unk> .
" it is good of you to come , mr. paret , " he said simply , as though his summons had not been a command .
" perhaps you know some of these gentlemen . "
one of them was our united states senator , <name> watling .
he , as it turned out , had been summoned from washington .
of course i saw him frequently , having from time to time to go to washington on various errands connected with legislation .
though spruce and <unk> as ever , in the black morning coat he invariably wore , he appeared older than he had on the day when i had entered his office .
he greeted me warmly , as always .
" <name> , i 'm glad to see you here , " he said , with a slight emphasis on the last word .
my legal career was reaching its logical climax , the climax he had foreseen .
and he added , to the banker , that he had brought me up .
" then he was trained in a good school , " remarked that personage , <unk> .
mr. <unk> , the president of our railroad , was present , and nodded to me kindly ; also a president of a smaller road .
in addition , there were two new york <unk> of great prominence , whom i had met .
the <unk> own special lieutenant of the law , mr. <name> t. <unk> , for whom i looked , was absent ; but it was forthwith explained that he was offering , that morning , a resolution of some importance in the convention of his church , but that he would be present after lunch .
" i have asked you to come here , mr. paret , " said the banker , " not only because i know something personally of your legal ability , but because i have been told by mr. scherer and mr. <unk> that you happen to have considerable knowledge of the situation we are discussing , as well as some experience with cases involving that statute somewhat hazy to lay minds , the <name> <unk> law . "
a smile went around the table .
mr. watling winked at me ; i nodded , but said nothing .
the banker was not a man to listen to superfluous words .
the <unk> of his character was despatch ... .
the subject of the conference , like many questions bitterly debated and fought over in their time , has in the year i write these words come to be of merely <unk> interest .
indeed , the very situation we discussed that day has been cited in some of our modern text-books as a classic consequence of that archaic school of economics to which the name of manchester is attached .
some half dozen or so of the railroads running through the <unk> coal region had <unk> their interests ,  an extremely profitable proceeding .
the public paid .
we deemed it quite logical that the public should pay  having been created largely for that purpose ; and very naturally we resented the fact that the meddling person who had got into the white house without asking <unk> leave ,  who apparently did not believe in the infallibility of our legal bible , the constitution ,  should maintain that the <unk> roads had formed a combination in restraint of trade , should lay down the preposterous doctrine  so <unk> of the rights of man  that railroads should not own coal mines .
congress had passed a law to meet this contention , suit had been brought , and in the lower court the government had won .
as the day wore on our <name> increased , we were joined by other lawyers of renown , not the least of whom was mr. <unk> himself , fresh from his triumph over religious heresy in his church convention .
the note of the conference became tinged with exasperation , and certain gentlemen seized the opportunity to relieve their pent-up feelings on the subject of the president and his <unk> advisers ,  some of whom , before they came under the spell of his sorcery , had once been sound lawyers and sensible men .
with the exception of the great banker himself , who made few comments , <name> watling was accorded the most deference ; as one of the leaders of that indomitable group of senators who had dared to stand up against popular clamour , his opinions were of great value , and his <unk> advice was listened to with respect .
i felt more pride than ever in my former chief , who had lost none of his charm .
while in no way <unk> the seriousness of the situation , his wisdom was tempered , as always , with humour ; he managed , as it were , to neutralize the acid injected into the atmosphere by other gentlemen present ; he alone seemed to bear no animus against the author of our troubles ; <unk> and calm , good <unk> , he sometimes brought the company into roars of laughter and even succeeded in bringing occasional smiles to the face of the man who had summoned us  when relating some characteristic story of the queer genius whom the fates ( undoubtedly as a practical joke ) had made the chief magistrate of the united states of <name> .
all geniuses have weaknesses ; mr. wading had made a study of the president 's , and more than once had lured him into an <unk> .
the case had been appealed to the supreme court , and mr. wading , with remarkable <unk> and penetration , reviewed the characteristics of each and every member of that tribunal , all of whom he knew intimately .
they were , of course , not subject to " advice , " as were some of the gentlemen who sat on our state courts ; no sane and self-respecting american would presume to " approach " them .
nevertheless they were human , and it were wise to take account , in the conduct of the case , of the probable bias of each individual .
the president , <unk> his constitutional , newtonian limits , might propose laws , congress might acquiesce in them , but the supreme court , after listening to lawyers like <unk> ( and he bowed to the attorney ) , made them : made them , he might have added , without responsibility to any man in our unique republic that scorned kings and <unk> lawyers .
a <unk> with a sense of humour witnessing a <name> session of congress would have giggled at the thought of a few tranquil gentlemen in another room of the capitol waiting to decide what the people 's representatives meant  or whether they meant anything ... . for the first time since i had known <name> watling , however , i saw him in the shadow of another individual ; a man who , like a powerful magnet , continually <name> our glances .
when we spoke , we almost invariably addressed him , his rare words fell like bolts upon the consciousness .
there was no apparent rift in that personality .
when , about five o'clock , the conference was ended and we were dismissed , united states senator , railroad presidents , <unk> of the law , the great banker fell into an eager conversation with <unk> over the canon on divorce , the subject of warm debate in the convention that day .
<unk> , it appeared , had led his party against the theological <unk> .
he believed that law was static , but none knew better its <unk> ; that it was infallible , but none so well as he could find a text on either side .
his reputation was not of the popular , newspaper sort , but was known to <unk> , editors , financiers , statesmen and judges ,  to those , in short , whose business it is to make themselves familiar with the instruments of power .
he was the <unk> chief legal adviser , the banker 's <unk> of tempered steel , sheathed from the vulgar view save when it flashed forth on a swift errand .
" i 'm glad to be associated with you in this case , mr. paret , " mr. <unk> said modestly , as we emerged into the <unk> of wall street .
" if you can make it convenient to call at my office in the morning , we 'll go over it a little .
and i 'll see you in a day or two in washington , watling .
keep your eye on the bull , " he added , with a twinkle , " and do n't let him break any more <name> than you can help .
i do n't know where we 'd be if it were n't for you fellows . "
by " you fellows , " he meant mr. watling 's distinguished associates in the senate ... . mr. watling and i dined together at a new york club .
it was not a dinner of herbs .
there was something exceedingly comfortable about that club , where the <name> of <unk> to those who had earned the right to be <unk> to came as near perfection as human things attain .
from the great , heavily curtained dining-room the noises of the city had been carefully excluded ; the dust of the avenue , the <unk> and smells of the brown stone fronts and <unk> tenements of those gloomy districts lying a <unk> east and west .
we had a <unk> champagne , and afterwards a cigar of the club 's special importation .
" well , " said mr. watling , " <unk> that you 're a member of the <name> council , what do you think of the king ? "
" i 've been thinking a great deal about him , " i said , and indeed it was true .
he had made , perhaps , his greatest impression when i had shaken his hand in parting .
the manner in which he had looked at me then had puzzled me ; it was as though he were seeking to divine something in me that had escaped him .
" why does n't the government take him over ? "
i exclaimed .
mr. watling smiled .
" you mean , instead of his mines and railroads and other properties ? "
" yes .
but that 's your idea .
do n't you remember you said something of the kind the night of the election , years ago ?
it occurred to me to-day , when i was looking at him . "
" yes , " he agreed thoughtfully , " if some american genius could find a way to <unk> that power and <unk> the men who created it the worst of our problems would be solved .
a man with his ability has a right to power , and none would respond more quickly or more splendidly to a call of the government than he .
all this fight is waste , <name> , damned waste of the nation 's energy . "
mr. watling seldom swore .
" look at the president !
there 's a man of remarkable ability , too .
and those two ought n't to be fighting each other .
the president 's right , in a way .
yes , he is , though i 've got to oppose him . "
i smiled at this from <name> watling , though i admired him the more for it .
and suddenly , oddly , i happened to remember what krebs had said , that our troubles were not due to individuals , but to a disease that had developed in industrial society .
if the day should come when such men as the president and the great banker would be working together , was it not possible , too , that the idea of mr. watling and the vision of krebs might coincide ?
i was struck by a certain seeming similarity in their views ; but mr. watling interrupted this train of thought by continuing to express his own .
" well ,  they 're running right into a <name> when they might be sailing with it , " he said .
" you think we 'll have more trouble ? "
i asked .
" more and more , " he replied .
" it 'll be worse before it 's better i'm afraid . "
at this moment a club servant announced his cab , and he rose .
" well , good-bye , my son , " he said .
" i 'll <name> to see you in washington soon .
and remember there 's no one thinks any more of you than i do . "
i escorted him to the door , and it was with a real pang i saw him wave to me from his cab as he drove away .
my affection for him was never more alive than in this hour when , for the first time in my experience , he had given real evidence of an inner anxiety and lack of confidence in the future .
xxi .
in spite of that unwonted note of <unk> from mr. watling , i went home in a day or two flushed with my new honours , and it was impossible not to be conscious of the fact that my <name> of prestige was increased  tremendously increased  by the recognition i had received .
a certain subtle deference in the attitude of the small minority who owed allegiance to the personage by whom i had been summoned was more satisfying than if i had been <unk> at the station by thousands of my fellow-citizens who knew nothing of my journey and of its significance , even though it might have a concern for them .
to men like <unk> , grierson and tallant and our lesser great lights the banker was a <unk> figure , and many times on the day of my return i was stopped on the street to satisfy the curiosity of my friends as to my impressions .
had he , for instance , let fall any opinions , <unk> on the political and financial situation ?
dickinson and scherer were the only other men in the city who had the honour of a personal acquaintance with him , and scherer was away , abroad , gathering furniture and pictures for the house in new york <name> had predicted , and which he had already begun to build !
with dickinson i lunched in private , in order to give him a detailed account of the conference .
by five o'clock i was ringing the door-bell of <name> 's new mansion on <name> avenue .
it was several blocks below my own .
" well , how does it feel to be sent for by the great sultan ? "
she asked , as i stood before her fire .
" of course , i have always known that ultimately he could n't get along without you . "
" even if he has been a little late in realizing it , " i retorted .
" sit down and tell me all about him , " she commanded .
" i met him once , when ham had the yacht at bar harbor . "
" and how did he strike you ? "
" as somewhat wrapped up in himself , " said <name> .
we laughed together .
" oh , i fell a victim , " she went on .
" i might have sailed off with him , if he had asked me . "
" i 'm surprised he did n't ask you . "
" i suspect that it was not quite convenient , " she said .
" women are secondary considerations to <unk> , we 're all very well when they have n't anything more serious to occupy them .
of course that 's why they fascinate us .
what did he want with you , <name> ? "
" he was evidently afraid that the government would win the coal roads suit unless i was retained . "
" more laurels ! "
she sighed .
" i suppose i ought to be proud to know you . "
" that 's exactly what i 've been trying to impress on you all these years , " i declared .
" i 've laid the laurels at your feet , in vain . "
she sat with her head back on the cushions , surveying me .
" your dress is very becoming , " i said irrelevantly .
" i hoped it would meet your approval , " she mocked .
" i 've been trying to identify the shade .
it 's elusive  like you . "
" do n't be <unk> ... . what is the colour ? "
" <unk> ! "
" pretty nearly , " she agreed , critically .
i took the soft <unk> between my fingers .
" poet ! "
she smiled .
" no , it is n't quite <unk> .
it 's nearer the <unk> of a tree i remember one autumn , in the white mountains , with the setting sun on it .
but that was n't what we were talking about .
laurels !
your laurels . "
" my laurels , " i repeated .
" such as they are , i fling them into your lap . "
" do you think they increase your value to me , <name> ? "
" i do n't know , " i said thickly .
she shook her head .
" no , it 's you i like  not the laurels . "
" but if you care for me  ? "
i began .
she lifted up her hands and folded them behind the knot of her hair .
" it 's extraordinary how little you have changed since we were children , <name> .
you are still sixteen years old , that 's why i like you .
if you got to be the sultan of <unk> yourself , i should n't like you any better , or any worse . "
" and yet you have just declared that power appeals to you ! "
" power  yes .
but a woman  a woman like me  wants to be first , or nothing . "
" you are first , " i asserted .
" you always have been , if you had only realized it . "
she gazed up at me dreamily .
" if you had only realized it !
if you had only realized that all i wanted of you was to be yourself .
it was n't what you achieved .
i did n't want you to be like <name> or the others . "
" myself ?
what are you trying to say ? "
" yourself .
yes , that is what i like about you .
if you had n't been in such a hurry  if you had n't misjudged me so .
it was the power in you , the craving , the ideal in you that i cared for  not the fruits of it .
the fruits would have come naturally .
but you forced them , <name> , for quicker results . "
" what kind of fruits ? "
i asked .
" ah , " she exclaimed , " how can i tell what they might have been !
you have striven and striven , you have done extraordinary things , but have they made you any happier ?
have you got what you want ? "
i stooped down and seized her wrists from behind her head .
" i want you , <name> , " i said .
" i have always wanted you .
you 're more wonderful to-day than you have ever been .
i could find myself  with you . "
she closed her eyes .
a dreamy smile was on her face , and she lay unresisting , very still .
in that tremendous moment , for which it seemed i had waited a lifetime , i could have taken her in my arms  and yet i did not .
i could not tell why : perhaps it was because she seemed to have passed beyond me  far beyond  in realization .
and she was so still !
" we have missed the way , <name> , " she whispered , at last .
" but we can find it again , if we seek it together , " i urged .
" ah , if i only could ! "
she said .
" i could have once .
but now i'm afraid  afraid of getting lost . "
slowly she straightened up , her hands falling into her lap .
i seized them again , i was on my knees in front of her , before the fire , and she , intent , looking down at me , into me , through me it seemed  at something beyond which yet was me .
" <name> , " she asked , " what do you believe ?
anything ? "
" what do i believe ? "
" yes .
i do n't mean any cant , <unk> morality .
the world is getting beyond that .
but have you , in your secret soul , any religion at all ?
do you ever think about it ?
i 'm not speaking about anything orthodox , but some religion  even a <name> speck of it , a germ  <unk> with life , with that power we feel in us we seek to express and continually violate . "
" <name> ! "
i exclaimed .
" answer me  answer me truthfully , " she said ... .
i was silent , my thoughts whirling like dust atoms in a storm .
" you have always taken things  taken what you wanted .
but they haven't satisfied you , convinced you that that is all of life . "
" do you mean  that we should renounce ? "
i faltered .
" i do n't know what i mean .
i am asking , <name> , asking .
have n't you any clew ?
is n't there any voice in you , anywhere , deep down , that can tell me ?
give me a hint ?
just a little one ? "
i was <unk> .
my passion had not left me , it seemed to be heightened , and i pressed her hands against her knees .
it was incredible that my hands should be there , in hers , feeling her .
her beauty seemed as fresh , as <unk> as the day , long since , when i despaired of her .
and yet and yet against the tumult and beating of this passion striving to throb down thought , thought strove .
though i saw her as a woman , my senses and my spirit commingled and swooned together .
" this is life , " i murmured , scarcely knowing what i said .
" oh , my dear ! "
she cried , and her voice pierced me with pain , " are we to be lost , overpowered , engulfed , swept down its stream , to come up below drifting  wreckage ?
where , then , would be your power ?
i 'm not speaking of myself .
is n't life more than that ?
is n't it in us , too ,  in you ?
think , <name> .
is there no god , anywhere , but this force we feel , restlessly creating only to destroy ?
you must answer  you must find out . "
i can not describe the pleading passion in her voice , as though hell and heaven were wrestling in it .
the woman i saw , tortured yet uplifted , did not seem to be <name> , yet it was the woman i loved more than life itself and always had loved .
" i ca n't think , " i answered desperately , " i can only feel  and i ca n't express what i feel .
it 's mixed , it 's dim , and yet bright and shining  it 's you . "
" no , it 's you , " she said vehemently .
" you must interpret it . "
her voice sank : " could it be god ? "
she asked .
" god ! "
i exclaimed sharply .
her hands fell away from mine ... .
the silence was broken only by the crackling of the wood fire as a log turned over and fell .
never before , in all our intercourse that i could remember , had she spoken to me about religion ... . with that apparent snap in continuity incomprehensible to the masculine <unk> feminine mood had changed .
elements i had never suspected , in <name> , awe , even a hint of despair , entered into it , and when my hand found hers again , the very quality of its convulsive pressure seemed to have changed .
i knew then that it was her soul i loved most ; i had been swept all unwittingly to its very altar .
" i believe it is god , " i said .
but she continued to gaze at me , her lips parted , her eyes questioning .
" why is it , " she demanded , " that after all these centuries of certainty we should have to start out to find him again ?
why is it when something happens like  like this , that we should suddenly be torn with doubts about him , when we have lived the best part of our lives without so much as thinking of him ? "
" why should you have <unk> ? "
i said .
" is n't this enough ?
and does n't it promise  all ? "
" i do n't know .
they 're not <unk>  in the old sense . "
she smiled down at me a little tearfully .
" <name> , do you remember when we used to go to sunday-school at dr .
pound 's church , and mrs. <unk> taught us ?
i really believed something then  that <name> brought down the ten commandments of god from the mountain , all written out definitely for ever and ever .
and i used to think of marriage " ( i felt a sharp twinge ) , " of marriage as something sacred and inviolable ,  something ordained by god himself .
it ought to be so  ought n't it ?
that is the ideal . "
" yes  but are n't you confusing  ? "
i began .
" i am confusing and confused .
i should n't be  i should n't care if there were n't something in you , in me , in our  friendship , something i can't explain , something that shines still through the fog and the smoke in which we have lived our lives  something which , i think , we saw clearer as children .
we have lost it in our hasty groping .
oh , <name> , i couldn't bear to think that we should never find it !
that it does n't really exist !
because i seem to feel it .
but can we find it this way , my dear ? "
her hand tightened on mine .
" but if the force drawing us together , that has always drawn us together , is god ? "
i objected .
" i asked you , " she said .
" the time must come when you must answer , <name> .
it may be too late , but you must answer . "
" i believe in taking life in my own hands , " i said .
" it ought to be life , " said <name> .
" it  it might have been life ... .
it is only when a moment , a moment like this comes that the quality of what we have lived seems so tarnished , that the atmosphere which we ourselves have helped to make is so sordid .
when i think of the intrigues , and <unk> , the <unk> ,  when i think of my own marriage  " her voice caught .
" how are we going to better it , <name> , this way ?
am i to get that part of you i love , and are you to get what you crave in me ?
can we just seize happiness ?
<name> it not elude us just as much as though we believed firmly in the ten commandments ? "
" no , " i declared obstinately .
she shook her head .
" what i 'm afraid of is that the world is n't made that way  for you  for me .
we 're permitted to seize those other things because they 're just <unk> , we 've both found out how worthless they are .
and the worst of it is they 've made me a coward , <name> .
it is n't that i could n't do without them , i 've come to depend on them in another way .
it 's because they give me a certain protection ,  do you see ?
they 've come to stand in the place of the real convictions we 've lost .
and  well , we 've taken the <unk> , can we reach out our hands and take  this ?
wo n't we be punished for it , frightfully punished ? "
" i do n't care if we are , " i said , and surprised myself .
" but i care .
it 's weak , it 's cowardly , but it 's so .
and yet i want to face the situation  i 'm trying to get you to face it , to realize how terrible it is . "
" i only know that i want you above everything else in the world  i'll take care of you  " i seized her arms , i <name> her down to me .
" do n't ! "
she cried .
" oh , do n't ! "
and struggled to her feet and stood before me panting .
" you must go away now  please , <name> .
i ca n't bear any more  i want to think . "
i released her .
she sank into the chair and hid her face in her hands ... . as may be imagined , the incident i have just related threw my life into a tangle that would have floored a less persistent <unk> and <unk> than myself , yet i became fairly accustomed to treading what the old <unk> called the devious paths of sin .
in my passion i had not hesitated to lay down the doctrine that the courageous and the strong took what they wanted ,  a doctrine of which i had been a consistent disciple in the professional and business realm .
a logical <unk> , <unk> , " master of life " would promptly have extended this doctrine to the realm of sex .
<name> was the mate for me , and <name> and i , our development , was all that mattered , especially my development .
let every man and woman look out for his or her development , and in the end the majority of people would be happy .
this was going <name> smith one better .
when it came to putting that theory into practice , however , one needed convictions : <name> had been right when she had implied that convictions were precisely what we lacked ; what our world in general lacked .
we had desires , yes convictions , no .
what we wanted we got not by defying the world , but by <unk> to it : we were ready to defy only when our desires overcame the resistance of our <unk> , and even then not until we should have exhausted every legal and conventional means .
a <unk> with a wife and family he had acquired before a great passion has made him a <unk> is in rather a predicament , especially if he be one who has achieved such <unk> as he possesses not by challenging laws and conventions , but by getting around them .
my wife and family loved me ; and paradoxically i still had affection for them , or thought i had .
but the <unk> creed is , " be yourself , realize yourself , no matter how cruel you may have to be in order to do so . "
one trouble with me was that remnants of the <name> element of pity still clung to me .
i would be cruel if i had to , but i hoped i should n't have to : something would turn up , something in the nature of an intervening miracle that would make it easy for me .
perhaps <name> would take the initiative and relieve me ... . <name> had appealed for a <unk> doctrine , and it was just what i did n't have and could n't evolve .
in the meanwhile it was quite in character that i should accommodate myself to a situation that might well be called anomalous .
this " accommodation " was not <unk> by fever .
my longing to realize my love for <name> kept me in a constant state of tension  of " nerves " ; for our relationship had merely gone one step farther , we had reached a point where we acknowledged that we loved each other , and paradoxically halted there ; <name> clung to her demand for new sanctions with a tenacity that amazed and puzzled and often irritated me .
and yet , when i look back upon it all , i can see that some of the difficulty lay with me : if she had her weakness  which she acknowledged  i had mine  and kept it to myself .
it was part of my romantic nature not to want to break her down .
perhaps i loved the ideal better than the woman herself , though that scarcely seems possible .
we saw each other constantly .
and though we had instinctively begun to be careful , i imagine there was some talk among our acquaintances .
it is to be noted that the gossip never became riotous , for we had always been friends , and <name> had a saving reputation for coldness .
it seemed incredible that <name> had not discovered my secret , but if she knew of it , she gave no sign of her knowledge .
often , as i looked at her , i wished she would .
i can think of no more expressive sentence in regard to her than the <unk> one that she pursued the even tenor of her way ; and i found the very perfection of her <unk> exasperating .
our relationship would , i thought , have been more <unk> if we had quarrelled .
and yet we had grown as far apart , in that big house , as though we had been separated by a continent ; i lived in my apartments , she in hers ; she consulted me about dinner parties and invitations ; for , since we had moved to <name> avenue , we entertained and went out more than before .
it seemed as though she were making every effort consistent with her integrity and self-respect to please me .
outwardly she <unk> to the mould ; but i had long been aware that inwardly a person had developed .
it had not been a spontaneous development , but one in resistance to pressure ; and was probably all the stronger for that reason .
at times her <name> revealed itself in astonishing and unexpected flashes , as when once she announced that she was going to change <name> 's school .
" he 's old enough to go to boarding-school , " i said .
" i 'll look up a place for him . "
" i do n't wish him to go to boarding-school yet , <name> , " she said quietly .
" but that 's just what he needs , " i objected .
" he ought to have the <unk> against other boys that boarding-school <name> give him .
<name> is timid , he should have learned to take care of himself .
and he <name> make friendships that <name> help him in a larger school . "
" i do n't intend to send him , " <name> said .
" but if i think it wise ? "
" you ought to have begun to consider such things many years ago .
you have always been too  busy to think of the children .
you have left them to me .
i am doing the best i can with them . "
" but a man should have something to say about boys .
he understands them . "
" you should have thought of that before . "
" they have n't been old enough . "
" if you had taken your share of responsibility for them , i would listen to you . "
" <name> ! "
i exclaimed reproachfully .
" no , <name> , " she went on , " you have been too busy making money .
you have left them to me .
it is my task to see that the money they are to inherit does n't ruin them . "
" you talk as though it were a great fortune , " i said .
but i did not press the matter .
i had a presentiment that to press it might lead to unpleasant results .
it was this sense of not being free , of having gained everything but freedom that was at times <unk> in the extreme : this sense of living with a woman for whom i had long ceased to care , a woman with a baffling <name> concealed beneath an unruffled and serene exterior .
at moments i looked at her across the table ; she did not seem to have aged much : her complexion was as fresh , apparently , as the day when i had first walked with her in the garden at elkington ; her hair the same wonderful colour ; perhaps she had grown a little <unk> .
there could be no doubt about the fact that her <name> was firmer , that certain lines had come into her face indicative of what is called character .
beneath her <unk> she was now all firmness ; the <unk> had become a mockery .
it can not be said that i went so far as to hate her for this ,  when it was in my mind ,  but my feelings were of a strong antipathy .
and then again there were rare moments when i was <unk> drawn to her , not by love and passion ; i melted a little in pity , perhaps , when my eyes were opened and i saw the tragedy , yet i am not referring now to such feelings as these .
i am speaking of the times when i beheld her as the blameless companion of the years , the mother of my children , the woman i was used to and should  by all canons i had known  have loved ... . and there were the children .
days and weeks passed when i scarcely saw them , and then some little incident would happen to give me an unexpected wrench and plunge me into unhappiness .
one evening i came home from a long talk with <name> that had left us both wrought up , and i had entered the library before i heard voices .
<name> was seated under the lamp at the end of the big room reading from " <name> <unk> " ; <name> and biddy were at her feet , and moreton , less attentive , at a little distance was taking apart a mechanical toy .
i would have tiptoed out , but biddy caught sight of me .
" it 's father ! "
she cried , getting up and flying to me .
" oh , father , do come and listen !
the story 's so exciting , is n't it , <name> ? "
i looked down into the boy 's eyes shining with an expression that suddenly pierced my heart with a poignant memory of myself .
<name> was far away among the mountains and castles of spain .
" <name> , " demanded his sister , " why did he want to go fighting with all those people ? "
" because he was <name> , " supplied moreton , who had an interesting habit of picking up slang .
" it was n't at all , " cried <name> , indignantly , interrupting <unk> rebuke of his brother .
" what was it , then ? "
moreton demanded .
" you would n't understand if i told you , " <name> was <unk> , when <name> put her hand on his lips .
" i think that 's enough for to-night , " she said , as she closed the book .
" there are lessons to do  and father wants to read his newspaper in quiet . "
this brought a protest from biddy .
" just a little more , mother !
ca n't we go into the schoolroom ?
we <unk> disturb father there . "
" i 'll read to them  a few minutes , " i said .
as i took the volume from her and sat down <name> shot at me a swift look of surprise .
even <name> glanced at me curiously ; and in his glance i had , as it were , a sudden revelation of the boy 's perplexity concerning me .
he was twelve , rather tall for his age , and the delicate <unk> of his face resembled my father 's .
he had begun to <unk> what did he think of me ?
biddy clapped her hands , and began to dance across the carpet .
" father 's going to read to us , father 's going to read to us , " she cried , finally clambering up on my knee and <unk> against me .
" where is the place ? "
i asked .
but <name> had left the room .
she had gone swiftly and silently .
" i 'll find it , " said moreton .
i began to read , but i scarcely knew what i was reading , my fingers tightening over biddy 's little knee ... .
presently miss <unk> , the governess , came in .
she had been sent by <name> .
there was <unk> in biddy 's voice as i kissed her good night .
" father , if you would only read oftener ! "
she said , " i like it when you read  better than anyone else . " ... .
<name> and i were alone that night .
as we sat in the library after our somewhat formal , <unk> dinner , i ventured to ask her why she had gone away when i had offered to read .
" i could n't bear it , <name> , " she answered .
" why ? "
i asked , intending to justify myself .
she got up abruptly , and left me .
i did not follow her .
in my heart i understood why ... .
some years had passed since <name> 's prophecy had come true , and <name> and the remaining <unk> had been " relieved " of the boyne street line .
the process need not be gone into in detail , being the <unk> one employed in the ribblevale affair of " running down " the line , or perhaps it would be better to say " showing it up . "
it had not justified its survival in our efficient days , it had held out  thanks to <name>  with absurd and <unk> persistence against the inevitable consolidation .
mr. tallant 's newspaper had published many complaints of the age and scarcity of the cars , etc .
; and alarmed holders of securities , in whose vaults they had lain since time immemorial , began to sell ... .
i saw little of <name> in those days , as i have explained , but one day i met him in the hambleton building , and he was white .
" your friends are doing thus , <name> , " he said .
" doing what ? "
" undermining the reputation of a company as sound as any in this city , a company that 's not <unk> , either .
and we 're giving better service right now than any of your consolidated lines . " ...
he was in no frame of mind to argue with ; the conversation was distinctly unpleasant .
i do n't remember what i said something to the effect that he was excited , that his language was extravagant .
but after he had walked off and left me i told dickinson that he ought to be given a chance , and one of our younger financiers , <unk> , went to <name> and pointed out that he had nothing to gain by obstruction ; if he were only reasonable , he might come into the new corporation on the same terms with the others .
all that <unk> got for his pains was to be ordered out of the office by <name> , who declared that he was being bribed to desert the other stockholders .
" he utterly failed to see the point of view , " <unk> reported in some astonishment to dickinson .
" what else did he say ? "
mr. dickinson asked .
<unk> hesitated .
" well  what ? "
the banker insisted .
" he was n't quite himself , " said <unk> , who was a comparative newcomer in the city and had a respect for the blackwood name .
" he said that that was the custom of thieves : when they were discovered , they offered to divide .
he swore that he would get justice in the courts . "
mr. dickinson smiled ... .
thus <name> , through his obstinacy and inability to adapt himself to new conditions , had gradually lost both caste and money .
he resigned from the boyne club .
i was rather sorry for him .
<name> naturally took the matter to heart , but he never spoke of it ; i found that i was seeing less of him , though we continued to dine there at intervals , and he still came to my house to see the children .
<name> continued to see <name> .
for me , the situation would have been more awkward had i been less occupied , had my relationship with <name> been a closer one .
neither did she mention <name> in those days .
the income that remained to him being sufficient for him and his family to live on comfortably , he began to devote most of his time to various societies of a <unk> nature until  in the spring of which i write his activities suddenly became concentrated in the organization of a " citizens union , " whose avowed object was to make a campaign against " graft " and political corruption the following autumn .
this announcement and the call for a <unk> in <unk> hall was received by the newspapers with a good-natured ridicule , and in influential quarters it was generally hinted that this was mr. blackwood 's method of " getting square " for having been deprived of the boyne street line .
it was quite characteristic of <name> hambleton that he should go , out of curiosity , to the gathering at <unk> hall , and drop into my office the next morning .
" well , hughie , they 're after you , " he said with a grin .
" after me ?
why not include yourself ? "
he sat down and stretched his long legs and his long arms , and smiled as he gaped .
" oh , they 'll never get me , " he said .
and i knew , as i gazed at him , that they never would .
" what sort of things did they say ? "
i asked .
" have n't you read the pilot and the mail and state ? "
" i just glanced over them .
did they call names ? "
" call names !
i should say they did .
they got drunk on it , worked themselves up like <unk> .
they did n't cuss you personally ,  <unk> come later , of course .
judd <name> got the heaviest shot , but they said he could n't exist a minute if it was n't for the <unk> crowd  capitalists , financiers , millionaires and their legal tools .
fact is , they spoke a good deal of truth , first and last , in a fool kind of way . "
" truth ! "
i exclaimed <unk> .
<name> laughed .
he was evidently enjoying himself .
" is any of it news to you , hughie , old boy ? "
" it 's an outrage . "
" i think it 's funny , " said <name> .
" we have n't had such a circus for years .
never had .
of course i should n't like to see you go behind the bars ,  not that .
but you fellows ca n't expect to go on forever skimming off the cream without having somebody squeal sometime .
you ought to be reasonable . "
" you 've skimmed as much cream as anybody else . "
" you 've skimmed the cream , hughie ,  you and dickinson and scherer and grierson and the rest ,  i 've only filled my jug .
well , these fellows are going to have a regular <unk> campaign , take the lid off of everything , dump out the <unk> district some of our friends are so fond of . "
" dump it where ? "
i asked curiously .
" oh , " answered <name> , " they did n't say .
out into the country , anywhere . "
" but that 's damned foolishness , " i declared .
" did n't say it was n't , " <name> admitted .
" they talked a lot of that , too , incidentally .
they 're going to close the saloons and dance halls and make this city sadder than heaven .
when they get through , it 'll all be over but the inquest . "
" what did <name> do ? "
i asked .
" well , he opened the meeting ,  made a nice , precise , gentlemanly speech .
greenhalge and a few young <unk> and a reformed crook named harrod did most of the <unk> .
they 're going to nominate greenhalge for mayor ; and he told 'em something about that little matter of the school board , and said he would talk more later on .
if one of the ablest lawyers in the city had n't been hired by the respectable crowd and a lot of other queer work done , the treasurer and purchasing agent would be doing time .
they seemed to be interested , all right . "
i turned over some papers on my desk , just to show <name> that he hadn't succeeded in disturbing me .
" who was in the audience ?
anyone you ever heard of ? "
i asked .
" sure thing .
your cousin <name> breck ; and that son-in-law of his  what 's his name ?
and some other representatives of our oldest families ,  <name> pound .
he 's a reformer now , you know .
they put him on the resolutions committee .
<name> ogilvy was there , he 'd be classed as <unk> conservative .
and one of the <unk> .
i could name a few others , if you pressed me .
that brother of fowndes who looks like an <unk> minister .
a lot of women  miller gorse 's sister , mrs. <unk> , who never approved of miller .
quite a genteel gathering , i give you my word , and all astonished and mad as hell when the speaking was over .
mrs. <unk> said she had been living in a den of iniquity and vice , and did n't know it . "
" it must have been amusing , " i said .
" it was , " said <name> .
" it 'll be more amusing later on .
oh , yes , there was another fellow who spoke i forgot to mention  that queer <name> who was in your class , krebs , got the school board evidence , looked as if he 'd come in by freight .
he was n't as popular as the rest , but he 's got more sense than all of them put together . "
" why was n't he popular ? "
" well , he did n't crack up the american people ,  said they deserved all they got , that they 'd have to learn to think straight and be straight before they could expect a square deal .
the truth was , they secretly envied these <name> men who were <unk> their city , and just as long as they envied them they had n't any right to complain of them .
he was going into this campaign to tell the truth , but to tell all sides of it , and if they wanted reform , they 'd have to reform themselves first .
i admired his nerve , i must say . "
" he always had that , " i remarked .
" how did they take it ? "
" well , they did n't like it much , but i think most of them had a respect for him .
i know i did .
he has a whole lot of assurance , an air of knowing what he 's talking about , and apparently he does n't give a continental whether he 's popular or not .
besides , greenhalge had cracked him up to the skies for the work he 'd done for the school board . "
" you talk as if he 'd converted you , " i said .
<name> laughed as he rose and stretched himself .
" oh , i 'm only the intelligent spectator , you ought to know that by this time , hughie .
but i thought it might interest you , since you 'll have to go on the stump and refute it all .
that 'll be a nice job .
so long . "
and he departed .
of course i knew that he had been <unk> me , his scent for the weaknesses of his friends being absolutely fiendish .
i was angry because he had succeeded ,  because he knew he had succeeded .
all the morning uneasiness possessed me , and i found it difficult to concentrate on the affairs i had in hand .
i felt <unk> , which i tried in vain to suppress , that the tide of the philosophy of power and might were starting to ebb : i scented vague calamities ahead , calamities i associated with krebs ; and when i went out to the club for lunch this sense of uneasiness , instead of being dissipated , was increased .
dickinson was there , and scherer , who had just got back from europe ; the talk fell on the citizens union , which scherer <unk> with an air of consequence and <unk> that struck me <unk> , and with an eye newly critical i detected in him a certain disintegration , deterioration .
having dismissed the reformers , he began to tell of his experiences abroad , referring in one way or another to the people of consequence who had entertained him .
" <name> , " said <name> dickinson to me as we walked to the bank together , " scherer <name> never be any good any more .
too much prosperity .
and he's begun to have his nails <unk> . "
after i had left the bank president an uncanny fancy struck me that in adolf scherer i had before me a concrete example of the effect of my philosophy on the individual ... .
nothing seemed to go right that spring , and yet nothing was absolutely wrong .
at times i became irritated , bewildered , out of tune , and unable to understand why .
the weather itself was uneasy , tepid , with long spells of hot wind and dust .
i no longer seemed to find refuge in my work .
i was unhappy at home .
after walking for many years in confidence and security along what appeared to be a certain path , i had suddenly come out into a vague country in which it was becoming more and more difficult to recognize landmarks .
i did not like to confess this ; and yet i heard within me occasional whispers .
could it be that i , <name> paret , who had always been so positive , had made a mess of my life ?
there were moments when the pattern of it appeared to have fallen apart , resolved itself into pieces that refused to fit into each other .
of course my relationship with <name> had something to do with this ... . one evening late in the spring , after dinner , <name> came into the library .
" are you busy , <name> ? "
she asked .
i put down my newspapers .
" because , " she went on , as she took a chair near the table where i was writing , " i wanted to tell you that i have decided to go to europe , and take the children . "
" to europe ! "
i exclaimed .
the significance of the announcement failed at once to register in my <name> , but i was aware of a shock .
" yes . "
" when ? "
i asked .
" right away .
the end of this month . "
" for the summer ? "
" i have n't decided how long i shall stay . "
i stared at her in bewilderment .
in contrast to the agitation i felt rising within me , she was extraordinarily calm , <unk> so .
" but where do you intend to go in europe ? "
" i shall go to london for a month or so , and after that to some quiet place in <name> , probably at the sea , where the children can learn french and <name> .
after that , i have no plans . "
" but  you talk as if you might stay indefinitely . "
" i have n't decided , " she repeated .
" but why  why are you doing this ? "
i would have recalled the words as soon as i had spoken them .
there was the slightest <unk> in her voice as she replied :  " is it necessary to go into that , <name> ?
would n't it be useless as well as a little painful ?
surely , going to europe without one 's husband is not an unusual thing in these days .
let it just be understood that i want to go , that the children have arrived at an age when it <name> do them good . "
i got up and began to walk up and down the room , while she watched me with a silent calm which was incomprehensible .
in vain i summoned my faculties to meet it .
i had not thought her capable of such initiative .
" i ca n't see why you want to leave me , " i said at last , though with a full sense of the inadequacy of the remark , and a suspicion of its hypocrisy .
" that is n't quite true , " she answered .
" in the first place , you don't need me .
i am not of the slightest use in your life , i have n't been a factor in it for years .
you ought never to have married me ,  it was all a terrible mistake .
i began to realize that after we had been married a few months  even when we were on our wedding trip .
but i was too inexperienced  perhaps too weak to acknowledge it to myself .
in the last few years i have come to see it plainly .
i should have been a fool if i had n't .
i am not your wife in any real sense of the word , i can not hold you , i can not even interest you .
it 's a situation that no woman with self-respect can endure . "
" are n't those rather modern sentiments , for you , <name> ? "
i said .
she flushed a little , but otherwise retained her remarkable composure .
" i do n't care whether they are 'modern ' or not , i only know that my position has become impossible . "
i walked to the other end of the room , and stood facing the carefully drawn curtains of the windows ; fantastically , they seemed to represent the <unk> to which my mind had come .
did she intend , ultimately , to get a divorce ?
i dared not ask her .
the word rang horribly in my ears , though <unk> ; and i knew then that i lacked her courage , and the knowledge was part of my agony .
i turned .
" do n't you think you 've <unk> things , <name> exaggerated them ?
no marriages are perfect .
you 've let your mind dwell until it has become inflamed on matters which really do n't amount to much . "
" i was never <unk> , <name> , " she replied instantly .
and indeed i was forced to confess that she looked it .
that new <name> i had seen emerging of late years seemed now to have found herself ; she was no longer the woman i had married ,  yielding , willing to overlook , anxious to please , living in me .
" i do n't influence you , or help you in any way .
i never have . "
" oh , that 's not true , " i protested .
but she cut me short , going on <unk> :  " i am merely your housekeeper , and rather a poor one at that , from your point of view .
you ignore me .
i am not blaming you for it  you are made that way .
it's true that you have always supported me in luxury ,  that might have been enough for another woman .
it is n't enough for me  i , too , have a life to live , a soul to be responsible for .
it 's not for my sake so much as for the children 's that i do n't want it to be crushed . "
" crushed ! "
i repeated .
" yes .
you are stifling it .
i say again that i 'm not blaming you , <name> .
you are made differently from me .
all you care for , really , is your career .
you may think that you care , at times , for  other things , but it is n't so . "
i took , involuntarily , a deep breath .
would she mention <name> ?
was it in reality <name> who had brought about this crisis ?
and did <name> suspect the <unk> of that relationship ?
suddenly i found myself begging her not to go ; the more astonishing since , if at any time during the past <name> this solution had presented itself to me as a possibility , i should eagerly have welcomed it !
but should i ever have had the courage to propose a separation ?
i even wished to <unk> myself now into believing that what she suggested was in reality not a separation .
i preferred to think of it as a trip ... . a vision of freedom thrilled me , and yet i was <unk> and torn .
i had an idea that she was suffering , that the ordeal was a terrible one for her ; and at that moment there crowded into my mind , melting me , incident after incident of our past .
" it seems to me that we have got along pretty well together , <name> .
i have been negligent  i 'll admit it .
but i 'll try to do better in the future .
and  if you 'll wait a month or so , i 'll go to europe with you , and we 'll have a good time . "
she looked at me sadly ,  <unk> , i thought .
" no , <name> , i 've thought it all out .
you really do n't want me .
you only say this because you are sorry for me , because you dislike to have your feelings wrung .
you need n't be sorry for me , i shall be much happier away from you . "
" think it over , <name> , " i pleaded .
" i shall miss you and the children .
i have n't paid much attention to them , either , but i am fond of them , and depend upon them , too . "
she shook her head .
" it 's no use , <name> .
i tell you i 've thought it all out .
you do n't care for the children , you were never meant to have any . "
" are n't you rather severe in your judgments ? "
" i do n't think so , " she answered .
" i 'm willing to admit my faults , that i am a failure so far as you are concerned .
your ideas of life and mine are far apart . "
" i suppose , " i exclaimed bitterly , " that you are referring to my professional practices . "
a note of weariness crept into her voice .
i might have known that she was near the end of her strength .
" no , i do n't think it 's that , " she said dispassionately .
" i prefer to put it down , that part of it , to a fundamental difference of ideas .
i do not feel qualified to sit in judgment on that part of your life , although i 'll admit that many of the things you have done , in common with the men with whom you are associated , have seemed to me unjust and inconsiderate of the rights and feelings of others .
you have alienated some of your best friends .
if i were to <unk> you at all , it would be on the score of <unk> .
but i suppose it is n't your fault , that you have n't any heart . "
" that 's unfair , " i put in .
" i do n't wish to be unfair , " she replied .
" only , since you ask me , i have to tell you that that is the way it seems to me .
i do n't want to introduce the question of right and wrong into this , <name> , i 'm not capable of <unk> it ; i ca n't put myself into your life , and see things from your point of view , weigh your problems and difficulties .
in the first place , you wo n't let me .
i think i understand you , partly  but only partly .
you have kept yourself shut up .
but why discuss it ?
i have made up my mind . "
the legal aspect of the matter occurred to me .
what right had she to leave me ?
i might refuse to support her .
yet even as these thoughts came i rejected them ; i knew that it was not in me to press this point .
and she could always take refuge with her father ; without the children , of course .
but the very notion sickened me .
i could not bear to think of <name> deprived of the children .
i had seated myself again at the table .
i put my hand to my forehead .
" do n't make it hard , <name> , " i heard her say , gently .
" believe me , it is best .
i know .
there wo n't be any talk about it ,  right away , at any rate .
people <name> think it natural that i should wish to go abroad for the summer .
and later  well , the point of view about such affairs has changed .
they are better understood . "
she had risen .
she was pale , still outwardly composed ,  but i had a strange , hideous feeling that she was weeping inwardly .
" are n't you coming back  ever ? "
i cried .
she did not answer at once .
" i do n't know , " she said , " i do n't know , " and left the room abruptly ... .
i wanted to follow her , but something withheld me .
i got up and walked around the room in a state of mind that was near to agony , taking one of the neglected books out of the shelves , glancing at its meaningless print , and replacing it ; i stirred the fire , opened the curtains and gazed out into the street and closed them again .
i looked around me , a sudden intensity of hatred seized me for this big , silent , luxurious house ; i recalled <name> 's presentiment about it .
then , thinking i might still dissuade her , i went slowly up the padded stairway  to find her door locked ; and a sense of the <unk> of her decision came over me .
i knew then that i could not alter it even were i to go all the lengths of <unk> .
nor could i , i knew , have brought myself to have feigned a love i did not feel .
what was it i felt ?
i could not define it .
amazement , for one thing , that <name> with her traditional , <name> view of marriage should have come to such a decision .
i went to my room , undressed mechanically and got into bed ... . she gave no sign at the breakfast table of having made the decision of the greatest moment in our lives ; she conversed as usual , asked about the news , reproved the children for being noisy ; and when the children had left the table there were no tears , reminiscences , recriminations .
in spite of the slight antagonism and envy of which i was conscious ,  that she was thus superbly in command of the situation , that she had developed her pinions and was thus splendidly able to use them ,  my admiration for her had never been greater .
i made an effort to achieve the frame of mind she suggested : since she took it so calmly , why should i be tortured by the tragedy of it ?
perhaps she had ceased to love me , after all !
perhaps she felt nothing but relief .
at any rate , i was grateful to her , and i found a certain consolation , a <unk> to my pride in the reflection that the initiative must have been hers to take .
i could not have deserted her .
" when do you think of leaving ? "
i asked .
" two weeks from saturday on the olympic , if that is convenient for you . "
her manner seemed one of friendly solicitude .
" you <name> remain in the house this summer , as usual , i suppose ? "
" yes , " i said .
it was a <name> , warm morning , and i went downtown in the motor almost <unk> .
it was the best solution after all , and i had been a fool to oppose it ... . at the office , there was much business awaiting me ; yet once in a while , during the day , when the tension relaxed , the recollection of what had happened flowed back into my consciousness .
<name> was going !
i had telephoned <name> , making an appointment for the afternoon .
sometimes  not too frequently  we were in the habit of going out into the country in one of her motors , a sort of <unk> , i believe , in which we were separated from the chauffeur by a glass screen .
she was waiting for me when i arrived , at four ; and as soon as we had shot clear of the city , " <name> is going away , " i told her .
" going away ? "
she repeated , struck more by the tone of my voice than by what i had said .
" she announced last night that she was going abroad indefinitely . "
i had been more than anxious to see how <name> would take the news .
a flush gradually deepened in her cheeks .
" you mean that she is going to leave you ? "
" it looks that way .
in fact , she as much as said so . "
" why ? "
said <name> .
" well , she explained it pretty thoroughly .
apparently , it is n't a sudden decision , " i replied , trying to choose my words , to speak composedly as i repeated the gist of our conversation .
<name> , with her face averted , listened in silence  a silence that continued some time after i had ceased to speak .
" she did n't  she did n't mention  ? "
the sentence remained unfinished .
" no , " i said quickly , " she did n't .
she must know , of course , but i'm sure that did n't enter into it . "
<name> 's eyes as they returned to me were wet , and in them was an expression i had never seen before ,  of pain , reproach , of questioning .
it frightened me .
" oh , <name> , how little you know ! "
she cried .
" what do you mean ? "
i demanded .
" that is what has brought her to this decision  you and i . "
" you mean that  that <name> loves me ?
that she is jealous ? "
i do n't know how i managed to say it .
" no woman likes to think that she is a failure , " murmured <name> .
" well , but she is n't really , " i insisted .
" she could have made another man happy  a better man .
it was all one of those terrible mistakes our modern life seems to emphasize so . "
" she is a woman , " <name> said , with what seemed a touch of vehemence .
" it 's useless to expect you to understand ... . do you remember what i said to you about her ?
how i appealed to you when you married to try to appreciate her ? "
" it was n't that i did n't appreciate her , " i interrupted , surprised that <name> should have recalled this , " she is n't the woman for me , we aren't made for each other .
it was my mistake , my fault , i admit , but i don't agree with you at all , that we had anything to do with her decision .
it is just the  the <unk> of a long period of <unk> .
she has come to realize that she has only one life to live , and she seems happier , more composed , more herself than she has ever been since our marriage .
of course i do n't mean to say it is n't painful for her ... .
but i am sure she is n't well , that it is n't because of our seeing one another , " i concluded <unk> .
" she is finer than either of us , <name> ,  far finer . "
i did not relish this statement .
" she 's fine , i admit .
but i ca n't see how under the circumstances any of us could have acted differently . "
and <name> not replying , i continued : " she has made up her mind to go ,  i suppose i could prevent it by taking extreme measures ,  but what good would it do ?
is n't it , after all , the most sensible , the only way out of a situation that has become impossible ?
times have changed , <name> , and you yourself have been the first to admit it .
marriage is no longer what it was , and people are coming to look upon it more sensibly .
in order to perpetuate the institution , as it was , segregation , insulation , was the only course .
men <unk> their wives , women their husbands ,  the only logical method of procedure , but it limited the individual .
our mothers and fathers thought it scandalous if husband or wife paid visits alone .
it was n't done .
but our modern life has changed all that .
a marriage , to be a marriage , should be proof against disturbing influences , should leave the individuals free ; the binding element should be love , not the force of an imposed authority .
you seemed to agree to all this . "
" yes , i know , " she admitted .
" but i can not think that happiness <name> ever grow out of unhappiness . "
" but <name> <name> not be unhappy , " i insisted .
" she <name> be happier , far happier , now that she has taken the step . "
" oh , i wish i thought so , " <name> exclaimed .
" <name> , you always believe what you want to believe .
and the children .
how can you bear to part with them ? "
i was torn , i had a miserable sense of inadequacy .
" i shall miss them , " i said .
" i have never really appreciated them .
i admit i do n't deserve to have them , and i am willing to give them up for you , for <name> ... " we had made one of our favourite drives among the hills on the far side of the <unk> , and at six were back at <name> 's house .
i did not go in , but walked slowly homeward up <name> avenue .
it had been a trying afternoon .
i had not expected , indeed , that <name> would have rejoiced , but her attitude , her silences , betraying , as they did , <unk> , seemed to threaten our future happiness .
xxii .
one evening two or three days later i returned from the office to gaze up at my house , to realize suddenly that it would be impossible for me to live there , in those great , empty rooms , alone ; and i told <name> that i would go to the club  during her absence .
i preferred to keep up the fiction that her trip would only be temporary .
she forbore from <unk> me , devoting herself efficiently to the task of closing the house , making it seem , somehow , a rite ,  the final rite in her capacity as housewife .
the drawing-room was shrouded , and the library ; the books wrapped neatly in paper ; a smell of camphor pervaded the place ; the cheerful schoolroom was dismantled ; trunks and travelling bags appeared .
the solemn butler packed my clothes , and i arranged for a room at the club in the wing that recently had been added for the accommodation of bachelors and deserted husbands .
one of the <unk> of those days was that the children began to suggest again possibilities of happiness i had missed  especially <name> .
with all his gentleness , the boy seemed to have a precocious understanding of the <unk> , and the capacity for suffering which as a child i had possessed .
but he had more self-control .
though he looked forward to the prospect of new scenes and experiences with the anticipation natural to his temperament , i thought he betrayed at moments a certain intuition as to what was going on .
" when are you coming over , father ? "
he asked once .
" how soon <name> your business let you ? "
he had been brought up in the belief that my business was a tyrant .
" oh , soon , <name> ,  sometime soon , " i said .
i had a feeling that he understood me , not intellectually , but <unk> .
what a companion he might have been ! ...
moreton and biddy moved me less .
they were more robust , more normal , less <unk> and imaginative ; europe meant nothing to them , but they were frankly delighted and excited at the prospect of going on the ocean , asking dozens of questions about the great ship , impatient to embark ... .. " i <name> n't need all that , <name> , " <name> said , when i handed her a letter of credit .
" i  i intend to live quite simply , and my chief expenses <name> be the children 's education .
i am going to give them the best , of course . "
" of course , " i replied .
" but i want you to live over there as you have been accustomed to live here .
it 's not exactly generosity on my part ,  i have enough , and more than enough . "
she took the letter .
" another thing  i 'd rather you did n't go to new york with us , <name> .
i know you are busy  " " of course i 'm going , " i started to protest .
" no , " she went on , firmly .
" i 'd rather you did n't .
the hotel people <name> put me on the steamer very comfortably ,  and there are other reasons why i do not wish it . "
i did not insist ... . on the afternoon of her departure , when i came uptown , i found her pinning some roses on her jacket .
" <name> and <name> sent them , " she informed me .
she maintained the friendly , impersonal manner to the very end ; but my soul , as we drove to the train , was full of <unk> wounds .
i had had roses put in her compartments in the car ; <name> and <name> peters were there with more roses , and little presents for the children .
their cheerfulness seemed forced , and i wondered whether they suspected that <name> 's absence would be prolonged .
" write us often , and tell us all about it , dear , " said <name> , as she sat beside <name> and held her hand ; <name> had biddy on his knee .
<name> was pale , but smiling and composed .
" i <name> to get a little villa in <name> , near the sea , " she said .
" i'll send you a photograph of it , <name> . "
" and <unk> , when she comes back , <name> be rattling off french like a native , " exclaimed <name> , giving her a hug .
" i hate french , " said biddy , and she looked at him solemnly .
" i wish you were coming along , uncle <name> . "
bells resounded through the great station .
the <name> warned us off .
i kissed the children one by one , scarcely realizing what i was doing .
i kissed <name> .
she received my embrace passively .
" good-bye , <name> , " she said .
i alighted , and stood on the platform as the train pulled out .
the children crowded to the windows , but <name> did not appear ... .
i found myself walking with <name> and <name> past hurrying travellers and porters to the <unk> street entrance , where my automobile stood waiting .
" i 'll take you home , <name> , " i said .
" we 're ever so much obliged , <name> , " she answered , " but the <unk> go almost to ferry 's door .
we 're dining there . "
her eyes were filled with tears , and she seemed taller , more ungainly than ever  older .
a sudden impression of her greatness of heart was borne home to me , and i grasped the value of such rugged friendship as hers  as <name> 's .
" we should n't know how to behave in an automobile , " he said , as though to soften her refusal .
and i stood watching their receding figures as they walked out into the street and hailed the huge electric car that came to a stop beyond them .
above its windows was painted " the <unk> traction company , " a label reminiscent of my professional activities .
then i heard the chauffeur ask :  " where do you wish to go , sir ? "
" to the club , " i said .
my room was ready , my personal belongings , my clothes had been laid out , my photographs were on the <unk> .
i took up , mechanically , the evening newspaper , but i could not read it ; i thought of <name> , of the children , memories flowed in upon me ,  a flood not to be <unk> ... .
presently the club valet knocked at my door .
he had a dinner card .
" <name> you be dining here , sir ? "
he inquired .
i went downstairs .
<name> grierson was the only man in the dining-room .
" hello , <name> , " he said , " come and sit down .
i hear your wife 's gone abroad . "
" yes , " i answered , " she thought she 'd try it instead of the south shore this summer . "
perhaps i imagined that he looked at me queerly .
i had made a great deal of money out of my association with grierson , i had valued very highly being an important member of the group to which he belonged ; but to-night , as i watched him eating and drinking greedily , i hated him even as i hated myself .
and after dinner , when he started talking with a ridicule that was a thinly disguised bitterness about the citizens union and their preparations for a campaign i left him and went to bed .
before a week had passed my painful emotions had largely subsided , and with my accustomed <unk> i had regained the feeling of self-respect so essential to my happiness .
i was free .
my only anxiety was for <name> , who had gone to new york the day after my last talk with her ; and it was only by <unk> to her house that i discovered when she was expected to return ... .
i found her sitting beside one of the open french windows of her salon , gazing across at the wooded hills beyond the <unk> .
she was serious , a little pale ; more exquisite , more desirable than ever ; but her manner implied the pressure of control , and her voice was not quite steady as she greeted me .
" you 've been away a long time , " i said .
" the <unk> , " she answered .
her colour rose a little .
" i thought they 'd never get through . "
" but why did n't you drop me a line , let me know when you were coming ? "
i asked , taking a chair beside her , and laying my hand on hers .
she <name> it gently away .
" what 's the matter ? "
i asked .
" i 've been thinking it all over  what we 're doing .
it does n't seem right , it seems terribly wrong . "
" but i thought we 'd gone over all that , " i replied , as patiently as i could .
" you 're putting it on an old-fashioned , moral basis . "
" but there must be same basis , " she urged .
" there are responsibilities , obligations  there must be !  that we ca n't get away from .
i ca n't help feeling that we ought to stand by our mistakes , and by our bargains ; we made a choice  it 's cheating , somehow , and if we take this  what we want  we shall be punished for it . "
" but i 'm willing to be punished , to suffer , as i told you .
if you loved me  " " <name> ! "
she exclaimed , and i was silent .
" you do n't understand , " she went on , a little breathlessly , " what i mean by punishment is deterioration .
do you remember once , long ago , when you came to me before i was married , i said we 'd both run after false gods , and that we could n't do without them ?
well , and now this has come ; it seems so wonderful to me , coming again like that after we had passed it by , after we thought it had gone forever ; it 's opened up visions for me that i never hoped to see again .
it ought to restore us , dear  that 's what i'm trying to say  to redeem us , to make us capable of being what we were meant to be .
if it does n't do that , if it is n't doing so , it 's the most horrible of <unk> , of <unk> .
if we gain life only to have it turn into death  slow death ; if we go to pieces again , utterly .
for now there 's <name> .
the more i think , the more clearly i see that we can't take any step without responsibilities .
if we take this , you 'll have me , and i 'll have you .
and if we do n't save each other  " " but we <name> , " i said .
" ah , " she exclaimed , " if we could start new , without any past .
i married ham with my eyes open . "
" you could n't know that he would become  well , as flagrant as he is .
you did n't really know what he was then . "
" there 's no reason why i should n't have anticipated it .
i ca n't claim that i was deceived , that i thought my marriage was made in heaven .
i entered into a contract , and ham has kept his part of it fairly well .
he has n't interfered with my freedom .
that is n't putting it on a high plane , but there is an obligation involved .
you yourself , in your law practice , are always insisting upon the sacredness of contract as the very basis of our civilization . "
here indeed would have been a home thrust , had i been vulnerable at the time .
so intent was i on overcoming her objections , that i resorted unwittingly to the modern argument i had more than once declared in court to be <unk> argument of the new reform in reference to the common law and the constitution .
" a contract , no matter how seriously entered into at the time it was made , that later is seen to violate the principles of humanity should be void .
and not only this , but you did n't consent that he should disgrace you . "
<name> winced .
" i never told you that he paid my father 's debts , i never told anyone , " she said , in a low voice .
" even then , " i answered after a moment , " you ought to see that it's too terrible a price to pay for your happiness .
and ham has n't ever pretended to consider you in any way .
it 's certain you did n't agree that he should do  what he is doing . "
" suppose i admitted it , " she said , " there remain <name> and your children .
their happiness , their future becomes my responsibility as well as yours . "
" but i do n't love <name> , and <name> does n't love me .
i <name> it 's my fault , that i did her a wrong in marrying her , but she is right in leaving me .
i should be doing her a double wrong .
and the children <name> be happy with her , they <name> be well brought up .
i , too , have thought this out , <name> , " i insisted , " and the fact is that in our respective marriages we have been , each of us , victims of our time , of our education .
we were born in a period of transition , we inherited views of life that do not fit conditions to-day .
it takes courage to achieve happiness , initiative to <unk> one 's self from a morality that begins to hamper and bind .
to stay as we are , to refuse to take what is offered us , is to remain between wind and water .
i do n't mean that we should do anything  hastily .
we can afford to take a reasonable time , to be dignified about it .
but i have come to the conclusion that the only thing that matters in the world is a love like ours , and its fulfilment .
achievement , success , are empty and meaningless without it .
and you do love me  you 've admitted it . "
" oh , i do n't want to talk about it , " she exclaimed , desperately .
" but we have to talk about it , " i persisted .
" we have to thrash it out , to see it straight , as you yourself have said . "
" you speak of convictions , <name> ,  new convictions , in place of the old we have discarded .
but what are they ?
and is there no such thing as conscience  even though it be only an intuition of happiness or unhappiness ?
i do care for you , i do love you  " " then why not let that suffice ? "
i exclaimed , leaning towards her .
she <name> back .
" but i want to respect you , too , " she said .
i was shocked , too shocked to answer .
" i want to respect you , " she repeated , more gently .
" i do n't want to think that  that what we feel for each other is  <unk> . "
" it <unk> itself , " i declared .
she shook her head .
" surely it has its roots in everything that is fine in both of us . "
" we both went wrong , " said <name> .
" we both sought to <unk> power and happiness from the world , to make our own laws .
how can we assert that  this is not merely a continuation of it ? "
" but ca n't we work out our beliefs together ? "
i demanded .
" wo n't you trust me , trust our love for one another ? "
her breath came and went quickly .
" oh , you know that i want you , <name> , as much as you want me , and more .
the time may come when i ca n't resist you . "
" why do you resist me ? "
i cried , seizing her hands convulsively , and swept by a gust of passion at her confession .
" try to understand that i am fighting for both of us ! "
she pleaded  an appeal that wrung me in spite of the pitch to which my feelings had been raised .
" <name> , dear , we must think it out .
do n't now . "
i let her hands drop ... .
beyond the range of hills rising from the far side of the <unk> was the wide valley in which was situated the <unk> country club , with its polo field , golf course and tennis courts ; and in this same valley some of our wealthy citizens , such as <name> ogilvy and <name> dickinson , had bought " farms , " week-end playthings for spring and autumn .
hambleton durrett had started the fashion .
capriciously , as he did everything else , he had become the owner of several hundred acres of pasture , woodland and orchard , acquired some seventy-five head of blooded stock , and proceeded to house them in model barns and milk by machinery ; for several months he had bored everyone in the boyne club whom he could entice into conversation on the subject of the records of <unk> cows , and spent many <unk> nights on the farm in company with those parasites who surrounded him when he was in town .
then another interest had intervened ; a feminine one , of course , and his energies were transferred ( so we understood ) to the reconstruction and furnishing of a little residence in new york , not far from fifth avenue .
the farm continued under the expert direction of a superintendent who was a graduate of the state agricultural college , and a select <unk> , which could afford to pay the prices , consumed the milk and cream and butter .
quite consistent with their <unk> relations was the fact that <name> should have taken a fancy to the place after <unk> interest had waned .
not that she cared for the <unk> , or <unk> , or whatever they may have been ; she evinced a sudden passion for simplicity ,  occasional simplicity , at least ,  for a contrast to and escape from a complicated life of luxury .
she built another house for the superintendent banished him from the little farmhouse ( where ham had kept two rooms ) ; banished along with the superintendent the stiff plush furniture , the <unk> carpets , the <unk> and the <unk> , and decked it out in bright <unk> , with <unk> to match , dainty muslin curtains , and <unk> rugs on the <unk> floors .
the <unk> porch over the doorway , which had suggested a cemetery , was removed , and a wide piazza added , furnished with wicker lounging chairs and tables , and shaded with <name> awnings .
here , to the farm , accompanied by a maid , she had been in the habit of retiring from time to time , and here she came in early july .
here , dressed in the simplest linen gowns of pink or blue or white , i found a <name> magically restored to <unk> ,  anew <name> , betraying only traces of the old , a new <name> in a new <name> .
we had all the setting , all the illusion of that perfect ideal of <unk> , love in a cottage .
<name> and i , who all our lives had spurned simplicity , laughed over the <name> we found in it : she made a high <name> of it , of course ; we had our simple dinners , which mrs. <unk> cooked and served in the open air ; sometimes on the porch , sometimes under the great <unk> tree spreading its shade over what in a more elaborate <unk> , would have been called a lawn ,  an uneven plot of grass of ridges and hollows that ran down to the orchard .
<name> 's eyes would meet mine across the little table , and often our gaze would wander over the pastures below , <unk> green in the level evening light , to the darkening woods beyond , <unk> in the setting sun .
there were fields of ripening yellow grain , of <unk> young corn that grew almost as we watched it : the warm winds of evening were heavy with the acrid odours of <unk> .
<unk> !
in that lay the elusive yet insistent charm of that country ; and <name> 's , of course , was the transforming touch that made it paradise .
it was thus , in the country , i suggested that we should spend the rest of our existence .
what was the use of <unk> money , when happiness was to be had so simply ?
" how long do you think you could stand it ? "
she asked , as she handed me a plate of blackberries .
" forever , with the right woman , " i announced .
" how long could the woman stand it ? " ... .
she <unk> , smilingly , my <unk> into our future , as though she had not the heart to deprive me of the pleasure .
" i simply ca n't believe in it , <name> , " she said when i pressed her for an answer .
" why not ? "
" i suppose it 's because i believe in continuity , i have n't the romantic temperament ,  i always see the <name> with the flaming sword .
it isn't that i want to see him . "
" but we shall redeem ourselves , " i said .
" it wo n't be curiosity and idleness .
we are not just taking this thing , and expecting to give nothing for it in return . "
" what can we give that is worth it ? "
she exclaimed , with one of her revealing flashes .
" we wo n't take it lightly , but seriously , " i told her .
" we shall find something to give , and that something <name> spring naturally out of our love .
we 'll read together , and think and plan together . "
" oh , <name> , you are <unk> , " was all she said .
the male tendency in me was forever strained to solve her , to deduce from her conversation and conduct a body of consistent law .
the effort was useless .
here was a realm , that of <name> 's soul , in which there was apparently no such thing as relevancy .
in the twilight , after dinner , we often walked through the orchard to a grassy bank beside the little stream , where we would sit and watch the dying glow in the sky .
after a rain its swollen waters were turbid , opaque <unk> with the <name> of the hills ; at other times it ran smoothly , <unk> , almost clear between the pasture grasses and wild flowers .
<name> declared that it reminded her of me .
we sat there , into the <unk> , warm nights , and the moon shone down on us , or again through long silences we searched the bewildering , starry chart of the heavens , with the <unk> of the <unk> of the fields in our ears .
sometimes she let my head rest upon her knee ; but when , throbbing at her touch , with the <unk> pulsing around us , i tried to take her in my arms , to bring her lips to mine , she resisted me with an energy of <name> and body that i could not overcome , i dared not overcome .
she acknowledged her love for me , she permitted me to come to her , she had the air of yielding but never yielded .
why , then , did she allow the words of love to pass ?
and how draw the line between caresses ?
i was maddened and disheartened by that elusive resistance in her  apparently so frail a thing !  that neither argument nor importunity could break down .
was there something lacking in me ?
or was it that i feared to mar or destroy the love she had .
this , surely , had not been the fashion of other loves , called unlawful , the classic instances celebrated by the poets of all ages rose to mock me .
" <unk> romantic , " she had called me , in calmer moments , when i was able to discuss our affair <unk> .
and once she declared that i had no sense of tragedy .
we read " <unk> " together , i remember , one rainy <name> .
the modern world , which was our generation , would seem to be cut off from all that preceded it as with a descending knife .
it was precisely from " the sense of tragedy " that we had been emancipated : from the " agonized conscience , " i should undoubtedly have said , had i been acquainted then with mr. <unk> 's later phrase .
conscience  the old kind of conscience ,  and nothing inherent in the deeds themselves , made the tragedy ; conscience was superstition , the fear of the wrath of the gods : conscience was the wrath of the gods .
eliminate it , and behold !
there were no consequences .
the gods themselves , that kind of gods , became as extinct as the deities of the <unk> , the greek fates , the terrible figures of <name> mythology .
yes , and as the god of <name> orthodoxy .
had any dire calamities overtaken the modern <unk> , of whose personal lives we happened to know something ?
had not these great ones broken with impunity all the laws of traditional morality ?
they ground the faces of the poor , played golf and went to church with serene minds , untroubled by criticism ; they appropriated , quite freely , other men's money , and some of them other men 's wives , and yet they were not haggard with remorse .
the gods remained silent .
<name> ministers regarded these modern <unk> of ancient laws <unk> and accepted their contributions .
here , indeed , were the <unk> of the mad <name> prophet and philosopher come to life , <unk> all classic tragedy .
it is true that some of these <unk> were occasionally swept away by disease , which in ancient days would have been regarded as a <unk> scourge , but was in fact nothing but the logical working of the laws of <unk> , the result of overwork .
such , though stated more <unk> , were my contentions when <name> did not cloud my <name> and make me incoherent .
and i did not fail to remind <name> , constantly , that this was the path on which her feet had been set ; that to waver now was to perish .
she smiled , yet she showed concern .
" but suppose you do n't get what you want ? "
she objected .
" what then ?
suppose one does n't become a <unk> ?
or a <unk> ?
what 's to happen to one ?
is there no god but the <unk> 's god , which is himself ?
are there no gods for those who ca n't be <unk> ?
or for those who may refuse to be <unk> ? "
to refuse , i maintained , were a weakness of the <name> .
" but there are other wills , " she persisted , " wills over which the <unk> may <unk> have no control .
suppose , for example , that you do n't get me , that my <name> <unk> , granting it to be conceivable that your future happiness and welfare , as you insist , depend upon your getting me  which i doubt . "
" you 've no reason to doubt it . "
" well , granting it , then .
suppose the <unk> and superstitions succeed in <unk> me .
i may not be a <unk> , but my <name> , or my conscience , if you choose , may be stronger than yours .
if you do n't get what you want , you are n't happy .
in other words , you fail .
where are your gods then ?
the trouble with you , my dear <name> , is that you have never failed , " she went on , " you 've never had a good , hard fall , you've always been on the winning side , and you 've never had the world against you .
no wonder you do n't understand the meaning and value of tragedy . "
" and you ? "
i asked .
" no , " she agreed , " nor i .
yet i have come to feel , instinctively , that somehow concealed in tragedy is the central fact of life , the true reality , that nothing is to be got by dodging it , as we have dodged it .
your <unk> , at least the kind of <unk> you portray , is petrified .
something vital in him , that should be plastic and sensitive , has turned to stone . "
" since when did you begin to feel this ? "
i inquired uneasily .
" since  well , since we have been together again , in the last month or two .
something seems to warn me that if we take  what we want , we <unk> get it .
that 's an <name> saying , i know , but it expresses my meaning .
i may be little , i may be superstitious , unlike the great women of history who have dared .
but it 's more than mere playing safe  my instinct , i mean .
you see , you are involved .
i believe i should n't hesitate if only myself were concerned , but you are the uncertain quantity  more uncertain than you have any idea ; you think you know yourself , you think you have analyzed yourself , but the truth is , <name> , you do n't know the meaning of struggle against real resistance . "
i was about to protest .
" i know that you have conquered in the world of men and affairs , " she hurried on , " against resistance , but it is n't the kind of resistance i mean .
it does n't differ essentially from the struggle in the animal kingdom . "
i bowed .
" thank you , " i said .
she laughed a little .
" oh , i have worshipped success , too .
perhaps i still do  that is n't the point .
an animal conquers his prey , he is in competition , in constant combat with others of his own kind , and perhaps he brings to bear a certain amount of intelligence in the process .
intelligence is n't the point , either .
i know what i 'm saying is <unk> , it 's <unk> , it sounds like <unk> , and perhaps it is , but there is so much confusion to-day that i think we are in danger of losing sight of the simpler <unk> , and that we must suffer for it .
your <unk> , your <unk> <unk> the other stags , but he never conquers himself , he never feels the need of it , and therefore he never <unk> what we call tragedy . "
" i gather your inference , " i said , smiling .
" well , " she admitted , " i have n't stated the case with the shade of delicacy it deserves , but i wanted to make my meaning clear .
we have raised up a class in <name> , but we have lost sight , a little  considerably , i think  of the distinguishing human characteristics .
the men you were <unk> are lords of the forest , more or less , and we women , who are of their own kind , what they have made us , surrender ourselves in submission and adoration to the lordly stag in the face of all the <unk> that have been painfully inaugurated by the race for the very purpose of distinguishing us from animals .
it is equivalent to saying that there is no moral law ; or , if there is , nobody can define it .
we deny , <unk> , a human realm as distinguished from the animal , and in the denial it seems to me we are cutting ourselves off from what is essential human development .
we are <unk> to the animal .
i have lost and you have lost  not entirely , perhaps , but still to a considerable extent  the bloom of that fervour , of that idealism , we may call it , that both of us possessed when we were in our teens .
we had occasional visions .
we did n't know what they meant , or how to set about their accomplishment , but they were not , at least , mere selfish aspirations ; they implied , unconsciously no doubt , an element of service , and certainly our ideal of marriage had something fine in it . "
" is n't it for a higher ideal of marriage that we are searching ? "
i asked .
" if that is so , " <name> objected , " then all the other elements of our lives are sadly out of tune with it .
even the most felicitous union of the sexes demands sacrifice , an adjustment of wills , and these are the very things we balk at ; and the trouble with our entire class in this country is that we wo n't acknowledge any responsibility , there 's no sacrifice in our eminence , we have no sense of the whole . "
" where did you get all these ideas ? "
i demanded .
she laughed .
" well , " she admitted , " i 've been thrashing around a little ; and i've read some of the <unk> , you know .
do you remember my telling you i did n't agree with them ?
and now this thing has come on me like a judgment .
i 've caught their mania for <name> , for self-realization  whatever they call it  but their remedies are vague , they fail to convince me that individuals achieve any quality by just taking what they want , regardless of others . " ... .
i was unable to meet this argument , and the result was that when i was away from her i too began to " thrash around " among the books in a vain search for a radical with a convincing and satisfying philosophy .
thus we fly to literature in crises of the heart !
there was no lack of writers who sought to deal  and deal triumphantly with the very situation in which i was immersed .
i marked many passages , to read them over to <name> , who was interested , but who accused me of being willing to embrace any philosophy , ancient or modern , that ran with the stream of my desires .
it is worth recording that the truth of this struck home .
on my way back to the city i reflected that , in spite of my protests against <name> 's going  protests wholly sentimental and impelled by the <name> to avoid giving pain on the spot  i had approved of her departure because i did n't want her .
on the other hand i had to acknowledge if i had n't wanted <name> , or rather , if i had become tired of her , i should have been willing to endorse her scruples ... .
it was not a comforting thought .
one morning when i was absently opening the mail i found at my office i picked up a letter from <name> watling , written from a seaside resort in maine , the contents of which surprised and touched me , troubled me , and compelled me to face a situation with which i was wholly unprepared to cope .
he announced that this was to be his last term in the senate .
he did not name the trouble his physician had discovered , but he had been warned that he must retire from active life .
" the specialist whom i saw in new york , " he went on , " wished me to resign at once , but when i pointed out to him how unfair this would be to my friends in the state , to my party as a whole  especially in these serious and unsettled times  he agreed that i might with proper care serve out the remainder of my term .
i have felt it my duty to write to <unk> and dickinson and one or two others in order that they might be prepared and that no time may be lost in choosing my successor .
it is true that the revolt within the party has never gained much headway in our state , but in these days it is difficult to tell when and where a conflagration may break out , or how far it <name> go .
i have ventured to recommend to them the man who seems to me the best equipped to <name> on the work i have been trying to do here  in short , my dear <name> , yourself .
the senate , as you know , is not a bed of roses just now for those who think as we do ; but i have the less hesitancy in making the recommendation because i believe you are not one to shun a fight for the convictions we hold in common , and because you would regard , with me , the election of a senator with the new views as a very real calamity .
if sound business men and lawyers should be eliminated from the senate , i could not contemplate with any peace of mind what might happen to the country .
in thus urging you , i know you <name> believe me when i say that my affection and judgment are equally involved , for it would be a matter of greater pride than i can express to have you follow me here as you have followed me at home .
and i beg of you seriously to consider it ... .
i understand that <name> and the children are abroad .
remember me to them affectionately when you write .
if you can find it convenient to come here , to maine , to discuss the matter , you may be sure of a welcome .
in any case , i expect to be in washington in <name> for a meeting of our special committee .
sincerely and affectionately yours , <name> watling . "
it was characteristic of him that the tone of the letter should be uniformly cheerful , that he should say nothing whatever of the blow this must be to his ambitions and hopes ; and my agitation at the new and disturbing prospect thus opened up for me was momentarily swept away by feelings of affection and sorrow .
a sharp realization came to me of how much i admired and loved this man , and this was followed by a pang at the thought of the disappointment my refusal would give him .
complications i did not wish to examine were then in the back of my mind ; and while i still sat holding the letter in my hand the telephone rang , and a message came from <name> dickinson begging me to call at the bank at once .
miller gorse was there , and tallant , waving a <unk> while sitting under the electric fan .
they were all very grave , and they began to talk about the suddenness of mr. watling 's illness and to speculate upon its nature .
<name> dickinson was the most moved of the three ; but they were all distressed , and showed it  even tallant , whom i had never credited with any feelings ; they spoke about the loss to the state .
at length gorse took a cigar from his pocket and lighted it ; the smoke , impelled by the fan , drifted over the <unk> partition into the bank .
" i suppose mr. watling mentioned to you what he wrote to us , " he said .
" yes , " i admitted .
" well , " he asked , " what do you think of it ? "
" i attribute it to mr. watling 's friendship , " i replied .
" no , " said gorse , in his businesslike manner , " watling 's right , there's no one else . "
considering the number of inhabitants of our state , this remark had its humorous aspect .
" that 's true , " dickinson put in , " there 's no one else available who understands the situation as you do , <name> , no one else we can trust as we trust you .
i had a wire from mr. <unk> this morning  he agrees .
we 'll miss you here , but now that watling <name> be gone we 'll need you there .
and he 's right  it 's something we 've got to decide on right away , and get started on soon , we ca n't afford to <unk> and run any chances of a revolt . "
" it is n't everybody the <unk> comes to on a platter  especially at your age , " said tallant .
" to tell you the truth , " i answered , addressing dickinson , " i 'm not prepared to talk about it now .
i appreciate the honour , but i 'm not at all sure i 'm the right man .
and i 've been considerably upset by this news of mr .
watling . "
" naturally you would be , " said the banker , sympathetically , " and we share your feelings .
i do n't know of any man for whom i have a greater affection than i have for <name> wading .
we should n't have mentioned it now , <name> , if watling had n't started the thing himself , if it weren't important to know where we stand right away .
we ca n't afford to lose the seat .
take your time , but remember you 're the man we depend upon . "
gorse nodded .
i was aware , all the time dickinson was speaking , of being surrounded by the strange , disquieting gaze of the counsel for the railroad ... .
i went back to my office to spend an uneasy morning .
my sorrow for mr. watling was genuine , but nevertheless i found myself compelled to consider an honour no man lightly refuses .
had it presented itself at any other time , had it been due to a happier situation than that brought about by the illness of a man whom i loved and admired , i should have thought the prospect dazzling indeed , part and parcel of my amazing luck .
but now  now i was in an emotional state that distorted the factors of life , all those things i hitherto had valued ; even such a prize as this i weighed in terms of one supreme <name> : how would the acceptance of the <unk> affect the accomplishment of this <name> ?
that was the question .
i began making rapid calculations : the actual election would take place in the legislature a year from the following <name> ; provided i were able to overcome <name> 's resistance  which i was determined to do  nothing in the way of divorce proceedings could be thought of for more than a year ; and i feared delay .
on the other hand , if we waited until after i had been duly elected to get my divorce and marry <name> my chances of <unk> would be small .
what did i care for the <unk> anyway  if i had her ?
and i wanted her now , as soon as i could get her .
she  a life with her represented new values , new values i did not define , that made all i had striven for in the past of little worth .
this was a <unk> compared with the companionship of the woman i loved , the woman intended for me , who would give me peace of mind and soul and develop those truer aspirations that had long been thwarted and starved for lack of her .
gradually , as she regained the ascendency over my mind she ordinarily held  and from which she had been temporarily displaced by the arrival of mr. watling 's letter and the talk in the bank  i became impatient and irritated by the intrusion .
but what answer should i give to dickinson and gorse ?
what excuse for declining such an offer ?
i decided , as may be imagined , to wait , to <unk> .
the irony of circumstances  of what might have been  prevented now my laying this trophy at <name> 's feet , for i knew i had only to mention the matter to be certain of losing her .
xxiii .
i had bought a small automobile , which i ran myself , and it was my custom to arrive at the farm every evening about five o'clock .
but as i look back upon those days they seem to have lost succession , to be fused together , as it were , into one <unk> period by the intense pressure of emotion ; unsatisfied emotion ,  and the state of physical and mental <unk> set up by it is in the retrospect not a little terrifying .
the world grew more and more distorted , its affairs were neglected , things upon which i had set high values became as nothing .
and even if i could summon back something of the sequence of our intercourse , it would be a mere repetition  growing on my part more irrational and insistent  of what i have already related .
there were long , troubled , and futile silences when we sat together on the porch or in the woods and fields ; when i wondered whether it were weakness or strength that caused <name> to hold out against my <unk> : the fears she professed of retribution , the <unk> effects of the conventional years , or the <unk> remnants of a <unk> which  as she proclaimed  had lost definite expression to persist as an intuition .
i recall something she said when she turned to me after one of these silences .
" do you know how i feel sometimes ?
as though you and i had wandered together into a strange country , and lost our way .
we have lost our way , <name>  it 's all so clandestine , so feverish , so unnatural , so unrelated to life , this existence we 're leading .
i believe it would be better if it were a mere case of physical passion .
i ca n't help it , " she went on , when i had exclaimed against this , " we are too  too complicated , you are too complicated .
it 's because we want the morning stars , do n't you see ? "
she wound her fingers tightly around mine .
" we not only want this , but all of life besides  you would n't be satisfied with anything less .
oh , i know it .
that 's your temperament , you were made that way , and i should n't be satisfied if you were n't .
the time would come when you would blame me i do n't mean <unk>  and i could n't stand that .
if you were n't that way , if that were n't your nature , i mean , i should have given way long ago . "
i made some sort of desperate protest .
" no , if i did n't know you so well i believe i should have given in long ago .
i 'm not thinking of you alone , but of myself , too .
i 'm afraid i should n't be happy , that i should begin to think  and then i couldn't stop .
the plain truth , as i 've told you over and over again , is that i'm not big enough . "
she continued smiling at me , a smile on which i could not bear to look .
" i was wrong not to have gone away , " i heard her say .
" i <name> go away . "
i was , at the time , too profoundly discouraged to answer ... . one evening after an exhausting talk we sat , inert , on the grass <unk> beside the stream .
heavy clouds had gathered in the sky , the light had deepened to <unk> , the valley was still , <unk> with expectancy , louder and louder the thunder rolled from behind the distant hills , and presently a veil descended to hide them from our view .
great drops began to fall , unheeded .
" we must go in , " said <name> , at length .
i followed her across the field and through the orchard .
from the porch we stood gazing out at the <unk> rain that blotted all save the nearer landscape , and the smell of wet , midsummer grasses <name> always be associated with the <unk> of that moment ... . at dinner , between the intervals of silence , our talk was of trivial things .
we made a mere pretence of eating , and i remember having my attention arrested by the sight of a strange , pitying expression on the face of mrs. <unk> , who waited on us .
before that the woman had been to me a mere <unk> automaton .
but she must have had ideas and opinions , this transported swedish peasant ... .
presently , having cleared the table , she retired ... .
the twilight deepened to dusk , to darkness .
the storm , having spent the intensity of its passion in those first moments of heavy downpour and wind , had relaxed to a gentle rain that <unk> on the roof , and from the stream came <unk> the dirge of the frogs .
all i could see of <name> was the dim outline of her head and shoulders : she seemed fantastically to be escaping me , to be fading , to be going ; in sudden desperation i dropped on my knees beside her , and i felt her hands <unk> with a light yet agonized touch , over my head .
" do you think i have n't suffered , too ?
that i do n't suffer ? "
i heard her ask .
some betraying note for which i had hitherto waited in vain must have pierced to my consciousness , yet the quiver of <name> and the swift , convulsive movement that followed it seemed one .
her strong , lithe body was straining in my arms , her lips returning my kisses ... . clinging to her hands , i strove to summon my faculties of realization ; and i began to speak in broken , endearing sentences .
" it 's stronger than we are  stronger than anything else in the world , " she said .
" but you 're not sorry ? "
i asked .
" i do n't want to think  i do n't care , " she replied .
" i only know that i love you .
i wonder if you <name> ever know how much ! "
the moments lengthened into hours , and she gently reminded me that it was late .
the lights in the little farmhouses near by had long been extinguished .
i pleaded to linger ; i wanted her , more of her , all of her with a fierce <name> that drowned rational thought , and i feared that something might still come between us , and cheat me of her .
" no , no , " she cried , with fear in her voice .
" we shall have to think it out very carefully  what we must do .
we ca n't afford to make any mistakes . "
" we 'll talk it all over to-morrow , " i said .
with a last , reluctant embrace i finally left her , walked blindly to where the motor car was standing , and started the engine .
i looked back .
outlined in the light of the doorway i saw her figure in what seemed an attitude of supplication ... .
i drove <unk> through the rain , mechanically taking the familiar turns in the road , barely missing a man in a buggy at a <unk> .
he shouted after me , but the world to which he belonged did n't exist .
i lived again those moments that had followed <name> 's surrender , seeking to recall and fix in my mind every word that had escaped from her lips  the trivial things that to lovers are so fraught with meaning .
i lived it all over again , as i say , but the reflection of it , though intensely emotional , differed from the reality in that now i was somewhat able to regard the thing , to regard myself , <unk> ; to define certain feelings that had flitted in filmy fashion through my consciousness , delicate shadows i recognized at the time as related to sadness .
when she had so amazingly yielded , the thought for which my mind had been vaguely groping was that the woman who lay there in my arms , obscured by the darkness , was not <name> at all !
it was as if this one precious woman i had so desperately pursued had , in the capture , lost her identity , had mysteriously become just woman , in all her significance , yes , and helplessness .
the particular had merged ( inevitably , i might have known ) into the general : the temporary had become the lasting , with a chain of consequences vaguely implied that even in my <name> gave me pause .
for the first time in my life i had a glimpse of what marriage might mean ,  marriage in a greater sense than i had ever conceived it , a sort of <unk> sense , implying obligations <unk> promises and contracts , calling for greatness of soul of a kind i had not hitherto imagined .
was there in me a grain of doubt of my ability to respond to such a high call ?
i began to perceive that such a union as we contemplated involved more obligations than one not opposed to traditional views of morality .
i fortified myself , however ,  if indeed i really needed fortification in a mood <unk> triumphant and exalted ,  with the thought that this love was different , the real thing , the love of maturity steeped in the ideals of youth .
here was a love for which i must be prepared to renounce other things on which i set a high value ; prepared , in case the world , for some reason , should not look upon us with kindliness .
it was curious that such reflections as these should have been delayed until after the achievement of my absorbing <name> , more curious that they should have followed so closely on the heels of it .
the affair had shifted suddenly from a basis of adventure , of uncertainty ; to one of fact , of <unk> ; i am exaggerating my concern in order to define it ; i was able to persuade myself without much difficulty that these little , cloudy currents in the stream of my <name> were due to a natural reaction from the tremendous strain of the past weeks , mere morbid fancies .
when at length i reached my room at the club i sat looking out at the rain falling on the shining pavements under the <unk> .
though waves of heat caused by some sudden recollection or impatient longing still ran through my body , a <unk> <name> of anticipation was succeeding emotional tumult , and i reflected that <name> had been right in insisting that we walk <unk> in spite of passion .
after all , i had outwitted circumstance , i had gained the prize , i could afford to wait a little .
we should talk it over to-morrow ,  no , to-day .
the luminous face of the city hall clock reminded me that midnight was long past ... .
i awoke with the consciousness of a new <name> , suddenly to identify it with <name> .
she was mine !
i kept repeating it as i dressed ; summoning her , not as she had lain in my arms in the darkness  though the intoxicating sweetness of that pervaded me  but as she had been before the completeness of her surrender , dainty , surrounded by things expressing an elusive , <unk> feminine personality .
i could afford to smile at the weather , at the obsidian sky , at the rain still falling persistently ; and yet , as i ate my breakfast , i felt a certain impatience to verify what i knew was a certainty , and hurried to the telephone booth .
i resented the instrument , its possibilities of betrayal , her voice sounded so matter-of-fact as she bade me good morning and deplored the rain .
" i 'll be out as soon as i can get away , " i said .
" i have a meeting at three , but it should be over at four . "
and then i added irresistibly : " <name> , you 're not sorry ?
you  you still  ? "
" yes , do n't be foolish , " i heard her reply , and this time the telephone did not completely disguise the note for which i strained .
i said something more , but the circuit was closed ... .
i shall not attempt to recount the details of our intercourse during the week that followed .
there were moments of stress and strain when it seemed to me that we could not wait , moments that strengthened <unk> resolution to leave immediately for the east : there were other , calmer periods when the wisdom of her going appealed to me , since our ultimate union would be hastened thereby .
we overcame by degrees the <unk> of the discussion of ways and means ... . we spent an <unk> <name> among the distant high hills , beside a little lake of our own discovery , its glinting waters sapphire and <unk> .
a grassy wood road , at the inviting entrance to which we left the automobile , led down through an undergrowth of <name> to a <unk> shore , and there we lunched ; there we lingered through the long summer afternoon , <name> with her back against a tree , i with my head in her lap gazing up at filmy clouds drifting imperceptibly across the sky , listening to the droning notes of the bees , notes that sometimes rose in a sharp <unk> , and again were suddenly hushed .
the smell of the <unk> mingled with the fainter scents of wild flowers .
she had brought along a volume by a modern poet : the verses , as <name> read them , moved me ,  they were filled with a new <name> to which my being responded , the <name> of the <unk> ; not the <name> of the anchor , but of the sail .
i repeated some of the lines as indications of a creed to which i had long been trying to convert her , though lacking the expression .
she had let the book fall on the grass .
i remember how she smiled down at me with the wisdom of the ages in her eyes , seeking my hand with a gesture that was almost maternal .
" you and the poets , " she said , " you never grow up .
i suppose that 's the reason why we love you  and these wonderful visions of freedom you have .
anyway , it 's nice to dream , to <unk> the world as one would like to have it . "
" but that 's what you and i are doing , " i insisted .
" we think we 're doing it  or rather you think so , " she replied .
" and sometimes , i admit that you almost persuade me to think so .
never quite .
what disturbs me , " she continued , " is to find you and the poets founding your new freedom on new <unk> , <unk> the old law only to make a new one ,  as though we could ever get away from necessities , escape from disagreeable things , except in dreams .
and then , this delusion of believing that we are masters of our own <name>  " she paused and pressed my fingers .
" there you <unk> to <unk> ! "
i exclaimed .
" i do n't go back to anything , or forward to anything , " she exclaimed .
" women are elemental , but i do n't expect you to understand it .
laws and codes are foreign to us , philosophies and dreams may dazzle us for the moment , but what we feel underneath and what we yield to are the primal forces , the great necessities ; when we refuse joys it 's because we know these forces by a sort of instinct , when we 're overcome it 's with a full knowledge that there 's a price .
you 've talked a great deal , <name> , about carving out our future .
i listened to you , but i resisted you .
it wasn't the morality that was taught me as a child that made me resist , it was something deeper than that , more fundamental , something i feel but ca n't yet perceive , and yet shall perceive some day .
it is n't that i'm clinging to the hard and fast rules because i fail to see any others , it is n't that i believe that all people should stick together whether they are happily married or not , but  i must say it even now  i have a feeling i ca n't define that divorce is n't for us .
i 'm not talking about right and wrong in the ordinary sense  it 's just what i feel .
i've ceased to think . "
" <name> ! "
i reproached her .
" i ca n't help it  i do n't want to be morbid .
do you remember my asking you about god ?  the first day this began ?
and whether you had a god ?
well , that 's the trouble with us all to-day , we have n't any god , we're wanderers , <unk> .
and now it 's just life that 's got hold of us , my dear , and swept us away together .
that 's our justification  if we needed one  it 's been too strong for us . "
she leaned back against the tree and closed her eyes .
" we 're like chips in the torrent of it , <name> . " ... .
it was not until the shadow of the forest had crept far across the lake and the darkening waters were still that we rose reluctantly to put the dishes in the tea basket and start on our homeward journey .
the <name> fires of the sunset were dying down behind us , the mist stealing , <unk> , into the valleys below ; in the sky a little moon curled like a freshly cut silver shaving , that presently turned to gold , the white <name> above it to fire .
where the valleys widened we came to silent , decorous little towns and villages where <unk> windows gleaming through the trees suggested refuge and peace , while we were wanderers in the night .
it was <unk> mood ; and now , in the evening 's chill , it recurred to me <unk> .
in one of these villages we passed a church , its doors flung open ; the congregation was singing a familiar hymn .
i slowed down the car ; i felt her shoulder pressing against my own , and reached out my hand and found hers .
" are you warm enough ? "
i asked ... . we spoke but little on that drive , we had learned the futility of words to express the greater joys and sorrows , the love that is compounded of these .
it was late when we turned in between the white dates and made our way up the little driveway to the farmhouse .
i bade her good night on the steps of the porch .
" you do love me , do n't you ? "
she whispered , clinging to me with a sudden , straining passion .
" you <name> love me , always no matter what happens ? "
" why , of course , <name> , " i answered .
" i want to hear you say it , 'i love you , i shall love you always . ' "
i repeated it fervently ... . " no matter what happens ? "
" no matter what happens .
as if i could help it , <name> !
why are you so sad to-night ? "
" ah , <name> , it makes me sad  i ca n't tell why .
it is so great , it is so terrible , and yet it 's so sweet and beautiful . "
she took my face in her hands and pressed a kiss against my forehead ... .
the next day was dark .
at two o'clock in the afternoon the electric light was still burning over my desk when the telephone rang and i heard <name> 's voice .
" is that you , <name> ? "
" yes . "
" i have to go east this afternoon . "
" why ? "
i asked .
her agitation had communicated itself to me .
" i thought you were n't going until thursday .
what 's the matter ? "
" i 've just had a telegram , " she said .
" ham 's been hurt  i do n't know how badly  he was thrown from a polo pony this morning at <unk> , in practice , and they 're taking him to boston to a private hospital .
the telegram 's from <name> <unk> .
i 'll be at the house in town at four . "
filled with forebodings i tried in vain to suppress i dropped the work i was doing and got up and paced the room , pausing now and again to gaze out of the window at the wet roofs and the grey skies .
i was aghast at the idea of her going to ham now even though he were hurt badly hurt ; and yet i tried to think it was natural , that it was fine of her to respond to such a call .
and she could n't very well refuse his summons .
but it was not the news of her husband 's accident that inspired the greater fear , which was quelled and soothed only to rise again when i recalled the note i had heard in her voice , a note eloquent of tragedy  of tragedy she had foreseen .
at length , unable to remain where i was any longer , i descended to the street and walked uptown in the rain .
the durrett house was closed , the blinds of its many windows drawn , but <name> was watching for me and opened the door .
so used had i grown to seeing her in the simple linen dresses she had worn in the country , a costume associated with exclusive possession , that the sight of her travelling suit and hat renewed in me an agony of apprehension .
the unforeseen event seemed to have transformed her once more .
her veil was drawn up , her face was pale , in her eyes were traces of tears .
" you 're going ? "
i asked , as i took her hands .
" <name> , i have to go . "
she led me through the dark , shrouded drawing room into the little salon where the windows were open on the silent <unk> .
i took her in my arms ; she did not resist , as i half expected , but clung to me with what seemed desperation .
" i have to go , dear  you wo n't make it too hard for me !
it's only  ordinary decency , and there 's no one else to go to him . "
she <name> me to the sofa , her eyes beseeching me .
" listen , dear , i want you to see it as i see it .
i know that you <name> , that you do .
i should never be able to forgive myself if i stayed away now , i  neither of us could ever be happy about it .
you do see , don't you ? "
she implored .
" yes , " i admitted <unk> .
her grasp on my hand tightened .
" i knew you would .
but it makes me happier to hear you say it . "
we sat for a moment in helpless silence , gazing at one another .
slowly her eyes had filled .
" have you heard anything more ? "
i managed to ask .
she <name> a telegram from her bag , as though the movement were a relief .
" this is from the doctor in boston  his name is <unk> .
they have got ham there , it seems .
a horse kicked him in the head , after he fell ,  he had just recovered consciousness . "
i took the telegram .
the wordy seemed meaningless , all save those of the last sentence .
" the situation is serious , but by no means hopeless . "
<name> had not spoken of that .
the ignorant cruelty of its convention !
the man must have known what hambleton durrett was !
<name> read my thoughts , and took the paper from my hand .
" <name> , dear , if it 's hard for you , try to understand that it 's terrible for me to think that he has any claim at all .
i realize now , as i never did before , how wicked it was in me to marry him .
i hate him , i can't bear the thought of going near him . "
she fell into wild weeping .
i tried to comfort her , who could not comfort myself ; i do n't remember my inadequate words .
we were overwhelmed , obliterated by the sense of calamity ... .
it was she who checked herself at last by an effort that was almost hysterical .
" i must n't yield to it ! "
she said .
" it 's time to leave and the train goes at six .
no , you must n't come to the station , <name>  i do n't think i could stand it .
i 'll send you a telegram . "
she rose .
" you must go now  you must . "
" you 'll come back to me ? "
i demanded thickly , as i held her .
" <name> , i am yours , now and always .
how can you doubt it ? "
at last i released her , when she had begged me again .
and i found myself a little later walking past the familiar , empty houses of those streets ... .
the front pages of the evening newspapers announced the accident to hambleton durrett , and added that mrs. durrett , who had been lingering in the city , had gone to her husband 's bedside .
the morning papers contained more of biography and ancestry , but had little to add to the bulletin ; and there was no lack of speculation at the club and elsewhere as to ham 's ability to rally from such a shock .
i could not bear to listen to these comments : they were violently distasteful to me .
the unforeseen accident and <name> 's sudden departure had thrown my life completely out of gear : i could not attend to business , i dared not go away lest the news from <name> be delayed .
i spent the hours in an exhausting mental state that <unk> between <name> and fear , a state of unmitigated , intense <name> , of balked realization , sometimes <unk> into that sheer terror i had felt when i had detected over the telephone that note in her voice that seemed of despair .
had she had a presentiment , all along , that something would occur to separate us ?
as i went back over the hours we had passed together since she had acknowledged her love , in spite of myself the conviction grew on me that she had never believed in the reality of our future .
indeed , she had expressed her disbelief in words .
had she been looking all along for a sign  a sign of wrath ?
and would she accept this accident of ham 's as such ?
<unk> left me trembling and almost sick .
it was not until the second morning after her departure that i received a telegram giving the name of her boston hotel , and saying that there was to be a consultation that day , and as soon as it had taken place she would write .
such consolation as i could gather from it was derived from four words at the end ,  she missed me dreadfully .
some tremor of pity for her entered into my consciousness , without <unk> greatly the wildness of my resentment , of my forebodings .
i could bear no longer the city , the club , the office , the daily contact with my associates and clients .
six hours distant , near <unk> , was a small resort in the mountains of which i had heard .
i telegraphed <name> to address me there , notified the office , packed my bag , and waited impatiently for midday , when i boarded the train .
at seven i reached a little station where a stage was waiting to take me to <unk> 's mill .
it was not until morning that i beheld my retreat , when little <unk> of vapour were <unk> over the surface of the lake , and the steep green slopes that rose out of the water on the western side were still in shadow .
the hotel , a much overgrown and altered farm-house , stood , surrounded by great trees , in an ancient clearing that sloped gently to the water 's edge , where an old-fashioned , octagonal <unk> overlooked a landing for rowboats .
the resort , indeed , was a survival of simpler times ... .
in spite of the <unk> guests , people of very moderate incomes who knew the place and had come here year after year , i was as much alone as if i had been the only <unk> .
the place was so remote , so peaceful in contrast to the city i had left , which had become intolerable .
and at night , during hours of <unk> , the music of the waters falling over the dam was soothing .
i used to walk down there and sit on the stones of the ruined mill ; or climb to the crests on the far side of the pond to gaze for hours westward where the green billows of the <unk> lost themselves in the haze .
i had discovered a new country ; here , when our trials should be over , i would bring <name> , and i found distraction in choosing sites for a bungalow .
in my soul <name> flowered with little watering .
uncertain news was good news .
after two days of an impatience all but intolerable , her first letter arrived , i learned that the <unk> had not been able to make a diagnosis , and i began to take heart again .
at times , she said , ham was delirious and difficult to manage ; at other times he sank into a condition of <unk> ; and again he seemed to know her and <name> , who had come up from southampton , where he had been spending the summer .
one doctor thought that ham 's remarkable vitality would pull him through , in spite of what his life had been .
the shock  as might have been surmised  had affected the <name> ... .
the letters that followed contained no additional news ; she did not dwell on the depressing reactions inevitable from the situation in which she found herself  one so much worse than mine ; she expressed a continual longing for me ; and yet i had trouble to convince myself that they did not lack the note of <unk> for which i strained as i eagerly scanned them  of <unk> that she had no intention of permitting her husband 's condition to interfere with that ultimate happiness on which it seemed my existence depended .
i tried to account for the absence of this note by reflecting that the letters were of necessity brief , hurriedly scratched off at odd moments ; and a natural delicacy would prevent her from referring to our future at such a time .
they recorded no change in ham 's condition save that the periods of <unk> had ceased .
the doctors were silent , awaiting the arrival in this country of a certain new york specialist who was abroad .
she spent most of her days at the hospital , returning to the hotel at night exhausted : the people she knew in the various resorts around boston had been most kind , sending her flowers , and calling when in town to inquire .
at length came the news that the new york doctor was home again ; and coming to boston .
in that letter was a sentence which rang like a cry in my ears : " oh , <name> , i think these doctors know now what the trouble is , i think i know .
they are only waiting for dr. jameson to confirm it . "
it was always an effort for me to control my impatience after the first rattling was heard in the morning of the stage that brought the mail , and i avoided the waiting group in front of the honeycombed partition of boxes beside the " office . "
on the particular morning of which i am now writing the proprietor himself handed me a letter of ominous thickness which i took with me down to the borders of the lake before tearing open the flap .
in spite of the calmness and restraint of the first lines , because of them , i felt creeping over me an <unk> sensation i knew for dread ... . " <name> , the new york doctor has been here .
it is as i have feared for some weeks , but i could n't tell you until i was sure .
ham is not exactly insane , but he is childish .
sometimes i think that is even worse .
i have had a talk with dr. jameson , who has simply confirmed the opinion which the other physicians have gradually been forming .
the accident has precipitated a kind of mental degeneration , but his health , otherwise , <name> not be greatly affected .
" jameson was kind , but very <name> , for which i was grateful .
he did not hesitate to say that it would have been better if the accident had been fatal .
ham wo n't be helpless , physically .
of course he wo n't be able to play polo , or take much active exercise .
if he were to be helpless , i could feel that i might be of some use , at least of more use .
he knows his friends .
some of them have been here to see him , and he talks quite rationally with them , with <name> , with me , only once in a while he says something silly .
it seems odd to write that he is not responsible , since he never has been ,  his condition is so queer that i am at a loss to describe it .
the other morning , before i arrived from the hotel and when the nurse was downstairs , he left the hospital , and we found him several blocks along commonwealth avenue , seated on a bench , without a hat  he was annoyed that he had forgotten it , and quite sensible otherwise .
we began by taking him out every morning in an automobile .
to-day he had a walk with <name> , and insisted on going into a club here , to which they both belong .
two or three men were there whom they knew , and he talked to them about his fall from the pony and told them just how it happened .
" at such times only a close observer can tell from his manner that everything is not right .
" <name> , who always could manage him , prevented his taking anything to drink .
he depends upon <name> , and it <name> be harder for me when he is not with us .
his attitude towards me is just about what it has always been .
i try to amuse him by reading the newspapers and with games ; we have a <unk> .
at times he seems grateful , and then he <name> suddenly grow tired and hard to control .
once or twice i have had to call in dr. <unk> , who owns the hospital .
" it has been terribly hard for me to write all this , but i had to do it , in order that you might understand the situation completely .
<name> dear , i simply ca n't leave him .
this has been becoming clearer and clearer to me all these weeks , but it breaks my heart to have to write it .
i have struggled against it , i have lain awake nights trying to find justification for going to you , but it is stronger than i. i am afraid of it  i suppose that 's the truth .
even in those <unk> days at the farm i was afraid of it , although i did not know what it was to be .
call it what you like , say that i am weak .
i am willing to acknowledge that it is weakness .
i wish no credit for it , it gives me no glow , the thought of it makes my heart sick .
i 'm not big enough i suppose that's the real truth .
i once might have been ; but i 'm not now ,  the years of the life i chose have made a coward of me .
it 's not a question of morals or duty it 's simply that i ca n't take the thing for which my soul <unk> .
it 's too late .
if i believed in prayer i 'd pray that you might pity and forgive me .
i really ca n't expect you to understand what i ca n't myself explain .
oh , i need pity  and i pity you , my dear .
i can only <name> that you <name> not suffer as i shall , that you <name> find relief away to work out your life .
but i <name> not change my decision , i can not change it .
do n't come on , do n't attempt to see me now .
i ca n't stand any more than i am standing , i should lose my mind . "
here the letter was blotted , and some words scratched out .
i was unable to reconstruct them .
" <name> and i , " she proceeded irrelevantly , " have got ham to agree to go to buzzard 's bay , and we have taken a house near <unk> .
write and tell me that you forgive and pity me .
i love you even more , if such a thing is possible , than i have ever loved you .
this is my only comfort and compensation , that i have had and have been able to feel such a love , and i know i shall always feel it.  <name> . "
the first effect of this letter was a paralyzing one .
i was unable to realize or believe the thing that had happened to me , and i sat stupidly holding the sheet in my hand until i heard voices along the path , and then i fled instinctively , like an animal , to hide my injury from any persons i might meet .
i wandered down the shore of the lake , striking at length into the woods , seeking some inviolable shelter ; nor was i conscious of physical effort until i found myself panting near the crest of the ridge where there was a pasture , which some ancient glacier had strewn with great boulders .
beside one of these i sank .
heralded by the deep tones of bells , two steers appeared above the shoulder of a hill and stood staring at me with <unk> curiosity , and fell to grazing again .
a fleet of white clouds , like ships pressed with sail , hurried across the sky as though racing for some determined port ; and the shadows they cast along the hillsides <unk> the high brightness of the day , emphasized the vivid and hateful beauty of the landscape .
my <unk> began to be penetrated by shooting pains , and i grasped little by little the fulness of my calamity , until i was in the state of wild rebellion of one whom life for the first time has <unk> in a supreme <name> .
there was no fate about this thing , it was just an absurd accident .
the operation of the laws of nature had sent a man to the ground : another combination of circumstances would have killed him , still another , and he would have arisen unhurt .
but because of this particular combination my happiness was ruined , and <name> 's !
she had not expected me to understand .
well , i did n't understand , i had no pity , in that hour i felt a resentment almost amounting to hate ; i could see only unreasoning superstition in the woman i wanted above everything in the world .
women of other days had indeed renounced great loves : the thing was not unheard of .
but that this should happen in these times  and to me !
it was unthinkable that <name> of all women should n't be emancipated from the <unk> of religious <unk> !
and if it was n't " conscience , " what was it ?
was it , as she said , weakness , lack of courage to take life when it was offered her ? ...
i was suddenly filled with the fever of composing arguments to change a decision that appeared to me to be the result of a monstrous <name> and delusion ; writing them out , as they occurred to me , in snatches on the backs of envelopes  her envelopes .
then i proceeded to make the draft of a letter , the effort required for composition <unk> me until the draft was finished ; when i started for the hotel , climbing fences , leaping streams , making my way across rock faces and through woods ; halting now and then as some <unk> argument occurred to me to write it into my draft at the proper place until the sheets were <unk> and blurred and almost illegible .
it was already three o'clock when i reached my room , and the mail left at four .
i began to copy and <unk> my scrawl , glancing from time to time at my watch , which i had laid on the table .
hurriedly washing my face and brushing my hair , i arrived downstairs just as the stage was leaving ... . after the letter had gone still other arguments i might have added began to occur to me , and i regretted that i had not softened some of the things i wrote and made others more emphatic .
in places argument had <unk> into abject entreaty .
never had my <name> been so importunate as now , when i was in continual terror of losing her .
nor could i see how i was to live without her , life lacking a motive being incomprehensible : yet the fire of optimism in me , though died down to ashes , would not be extinguished .
at moments it flared up into what almost amounted to a conviction that she could not resist my appeal .
i had threatened to go to her , and more than once i started packing ... . three days later i received a brief note in which she managed to convey to me , though tenderly and <unk> , that her decision was unalterable .
if i came on , she would refuse to see me .
i took the afternoon stage and went back to the city , to plunge into affairs again ; but for weeks my torture was so acute that it gives me pain to recall it , to dwell upon it to-day ... . and yet , amazing as it may seem , there came a time when <name> began to <name> again out of my despair .
perhaps my life had not been utterly shattered , after all : perhaps ham durrett would get well : such things happened , and <name> would no longer have an excuse for continuing to refuse me .
little by little my anger at what i had now become convinced was her weakness cooled , and  though paradoxically i had continued to love her in spite of the torture for which she was responsible , in spite of the resentment i felt , i melted toward her .
true to my habit of reliance on miracles , i tried to reconcile myself to a period of waiting .
nevertheless i was faintly aware  consequent upon if not as a result of this tremendous experience  of some change within me .
it was not only that i felt at times a novel sense of uneasiness at being a prey to accidents , subject to ravages of feeling ; the unity of mind that had hitherto enabled me to press forward continuously toward a concrete goal showed signs of breaking up :  the goal had lost its <unk> .
i seemed oddly to be <unk> into the states of questioning that had characterized my earlier years .
perhaps it would be an exaggeration to say that i actually began to speculate on the possible existence of a realm where the soul might find a refuge from the <unk> of life , from which the philosophy of prosperity was powerless to save it ... . xxiv .
it was impossible , of course , that my friends should have failed to perceive the state of <unk> i was in , and some of them at least must have guessed its cause .
dickinson , on his return from maine , at once begged me to go away .
i rather congratulated myself that <name> had chosen these months for a <unk> vacation in canada .
his passion for fishing still persisted .
in spite of the fact i have noted , that i had lost a certain zest for results , to keep busy seemed to be the only way to relieve my mind of an otherwise intolerable pressure : and i worked sometimes far into the evening .
in the background of my thoughts lay the necessity of coming to a decision on the question of the <unk> ; several times dickinson and gorse had spoken of it , and i was beginning to get letters from influential men in other parts of the state .
they seemed to take it for granted that there was no question of my refusing .
the time came when i had grown able to consider the matter with a degree of calmness .
what struck me first , when i began to debate upon it , was that the <unk> offered a new and possibly higher field for my energies , while at the same time the office would be a logical continuation of a signal legal career .
i was now unable to deny that i no longer felt any exhilaration at the prospect of future legal conquests similar to those of the past ; but once in the senate , i might regain something of that intense conviction of fighting for a just and sound cause with which <name> wading had once animated me : fighting there , in the capitol at washington , would be different ; no stigma of personal gain attached to it ; it offered a nearer approach to the ideal i had once more begun to seek , held out hopes of a renewal of my unity of mind .
mr. watling had declared that there was something to fight for ; i had even glimpsed that something , but i had to confess that for some years i had not been consciously fighting for it .
i needed something to fight for .
there was the necessity , however , of renewing my calculations .
if hambleton durrett should recover , even during the ensuing year , and if <name> relented it would not be possible for us to be divorced and married for some time .
i still clung <unk> to the belief that there were no relationships wholly unaffected by worldly triumphs , and as senator i should have strengthened my position .
it did not strike me  even after all my experience  that such a course as i now contemplated had a parallel in the one that i had pursued in regard to her when i was young .
it seemed fitting that <name> watling should be the first to know of my decision .
i went to washington to meet him .
it pained me to see him looking more worn , but he was still as cheerful , as mentally vigorous as ever , and i perceived that he did not wish to dwell upon his illness .
i did venture to <unk> with him on the risk he must be running in serving out his term .
we were sitting in the dining room of his house .
" we 've only one life to live , <name> , " he answered , smiling at me , " and we might as well get all out of it we can .
a few years more or less doesn't make much difference  and i ought to be satisfied .
i 'd resign now , to please my wife , to please my friends , but we ca n't trust this governor to appoint a safe man .
how little we suspected when we elected him that he 'd become infected .
you never can tell , in these days , can you ? "
it was the note of devotion to his cause that i had come to hear : i felt it renewing me , as i had hoped .
the threat of disease , the louder <unk> of the leaders of the mob had not sufficed to dismay him  though he admitted more concern over these .
my sympathy and affection were mingled with the admiration he never failed to inspire .
" but you , <name> , " he said <unk> , " you 're not looking very well , my son .
you must manage to take a good rest before coming here  before the campaign you 'll have to go through .
we ca n't afford to have anything happen to you  you 're too young . "
i wondered whether he had heard anything ... .
he spoke to me again about the work to be done , the work he looked to me to <name> on .
" we 'll have to watch for our opportunity , " he said , " and when it comes we can handle this new movement not by crushing it , but by guiding it .
i 've come to the conclusion that there is a true instinct in it , that there are certain things we have done which have been mistakes , and which we ca n't do any more .
but as for this theory that all wisdom resides in the people , it 's <unk> .
what we have to do is to work out a practical programme . "
his confidence in me had not diminished .
it helped to restore confidence in myself .
the weather was cool and bracing for <name> , and as we drove in a motor through the beautiful avenues of the city he pointed out a house for me on one of the circles , one of those distinguished residences , instances of a nascent good taste , that are helping to redeem the <unk> aspect of our national capital .
mr. watling spoke  rather <unk> , i thought  of <name> and the children , and ventured the surmise that they would be returning in a few months .
i interpreted this , indeed , as in rather the nature of a kindly hint that such a procedure would be wise in view of the larger life now dawning for me , but i made no comment ... .
he even sympathized with <name> durrett .
" she did the right thing , <name> , " he said , with the admirable casual manner he possessed of treating subjects which he knew to be delicate .
" <name> 's a fine woman .
poor devil ! "
this in reference to ham ... . mr. watling reassured me on the subject of his own trouble , maintaining that he had many years left if he took care .
he drove me to the station .
i travelled homeward somewhat lifted out of myself by this visit to him ; with some feeling of <unk> derived from washington itself , with its dignified presidential mansion among the trees , its granite shaft drawing the eye upward , with its winged capitol serene upon the hill .
should we deliver these heirlooms to the mob ?
surely democracy meant more than that !
all this time i had been receiving , at intervals , letters from <name> and the children .
<name> 's were the letters of a friend , and i found it easy to convince myself that their tone was genuine , that the separation had brought contentment to her ; and those independent and <unk> elements in her character i admired now rather than deplored .
at <unk> , which she found much to her taste , she was living quietly , but making friends with some american and english , and one french family of the same name , buffon , as the great naturalist .
the father was a retired silk manufacturer ; they now resided in <name> , and had been very kind in helping her to get an apartment in that city for the <name> .
she had chosen one on the avenue <unk> , not far from the arc .
it is interesting , after her arraignment of me , that she should have taken such pains to record their daily life for my benefit in her clear , conscientious handwriting .
i beheld biddy , her dresses tucked above slim little knees , playing in the sand on the beach , her hair flying in the wind and lighted by the sun which gave <name> to the sea .
i saw <name> herself in her beach chair , a book lying in her lap , its pages whipped by the breeze .
and there was moreton , who must be proving something of a handful , since he had fought with the french boys on the beach and thrown a " rock " through the windows of the buffon family .
i remember one of his letters  made perfect after much correcting and scratching ,  in which he denounced both <name> and the french , and appealed to me to come over at once to take him home .
<name> had enclosed it without comment .
this letter had not been written under <unk> , as most of his were .
<name> 's letters  he wrote faithfully once a week  i kept in a little pile by themselves and sometimes <unk> them .
i wondered whether it were because of the fact that i was his father  though a most inadequate one  that i thought them somewhat unusual .
he had learned french  <name> wrote  with remarkable ease .
i was particularly struck in these letters with the boy 's power of observation , with his facile use of language , with the vivid simplicity of his descriptions of the life around him , of his experiences at school .
the letters were thoughtful  not dashed off in a hurry ; they gave evidence in every line of the delicacy of feeling that was , i think , his most appealing quality , and i put them down with the impression strong on me that he , too , longed to return home , but would not say so .
there was a certain pathos in this youthful restraint that never failed to touch me , even in those times when i had been most <unk> with love and passion ... .
the curious effect of these letters was that of knowing more than they expressed .
he missed me , he wished to know when i was coming over .
and i was sometimes at a loss whether to be grateful to <name> or troubled because she had as yet given him no hint of our separation .
what effect would it have on him when it should be revealed to him ? ...
it was through <name> i began to apprehend certain elements in <name> i had both failed to note and appreciate ; her little <unk> that <name> , her habits of thought that exasperated , were forgotten , and i was forced to confess that there was something fine in the achievement of this attitude of hers that was without ill <name> or resentment , that tacitly acknowledged my continued rights and interest in the children .
it puzzled and troubled me .
the citizens union began its campaign early that autumn , long before the <unk> .
<name> parks and <name> <unk>  republican and democratic candidates for mayor  thought of going on the stump .
for several weeks the meetings were held in the small halls and club rooms of various societies and orders in obscure portions of the city .
the forces of " privilege and corruption " were not much alarmed .
<name> blackwood accused the newspapers of having agreed to a " conspiracy of silence " ; but , as judah b. tallant remarked , it was the business of the press to give the public what it wanted , and the public as yet hadn't shown much interest in the struggle being waged in its behalf .
when the meetings began to fill up it would be time to report them in the columns of the <name> .
meanwhile , however , the city had been quietly visited by an enterprising representative of a new york periodical of the new type that developed with the opening years of the century  one making a specialty of passionate " <unk> . "
and since the people of <name> love nothing better than being startled , <unk> 's weekly had acquired a circulation truly fabulous .
the <unk> of the paper had attended several of the citizens meetings ; interviewed , it seemed , many persons : the result was a revelation to make the blood of politicians , capitalists and corporation lawyers run cold .
i remember very well the day it appeared on our news stands , and the heated denunciations it evoked at the boyne club .
<name> hambleton was the only one who took it calmly , who seemed to derive a certain enjoyment from the affair .
had he been a less privileged person , they would have put him in <unk> .
<name> dickinson asserted that <unk> 's should be sued for libel .
" there 's just one objection to that , " said <name> .
" what ? "
asked the banker .
" it is n't libel . "
" i defy them to prove it , " dickinson snapped .
" it 's a d  d outrage !
there is n't a city or village in the country that has n't exactly the same conditions .
there is n't any other way to run a city  " " that 's what mr. krebs says , " <name> replied , " that the people ought to put judd <name> officially in charge .
he tells 'em that <name> is probably a more efficient man than democracy <name> be able to evolve in a <unk> age , that we ought to take him over , instead of letting the capitalists have him . "
" did krebs say that ? "
dickinson demanded .
" you ca n't have read the article very thoroughly , <name> , " <name> commented .
" i 'm afraid you only picked out the part of it that compliments you .
this fellow seems to have been struck by krebs , says he 's a coming man , that he 's making original contributions to the people 's cause .
quite a tribute .
you ought to read it . "
dickinson , who had finished his lunch , got up and left the table after lighting his cigar .
<name> 's look followed him <unk> .
" i 'm afraid it 's time to cash in and be good , " he observed .
" we 'll get that fellow krebs yet , " said grierson , wrathfully .
miller gorse alone made no remarks , but in spite of his silence he <unk> an animosity against reform and reformers that seemed to charge the very atmosphere , and would have repressed any man but <name> ... .
i sat in my room at the club that night and <unk> the article , and if its author could have looked into my soul and observed the emotions he had set up , he would , no doubt , have experienced a grim satisfaction .
for i , too , had come in for a share of the comment .
portions of the matter referring to me stuck in my <name> like tar , such as the reference to my father , to the honoured traditions of the <unk> and the <unk> which i had deliberately repudiated .
i had less excuse than many others .
the part i had played in various reprehensible transactions such as the riverside franchise and the dummy telephone company affair was dwelt upon , and i was dismissed with the <unk> comment that i was a graduate of harvard ... . my associates and myself were referred to collectively as a " gang , " with the name of our city <unk> ; we were linked up with and compared to the gangs of other cities  the <unk> used to describe us being that of the police reporter .
we " operated , " like burglars ; we " looted " : only , it was intimated in one place , " <unk> men " were angels compared to us , who had never seen the inside of a penitentiary .
here we were , all arraigned before the bar of public opinion , the relentless dickinson , the <unk> scherer , the <unk> grierson , the <unk> tallant .
i have forgotten what miller gorse was called ; nothing so classic as a <unk> ; judd <name> was a hairy spider who spread his net and lurked in darkness for his victims .
every adjective was called upon to do its duty ... .
even <name> watling did not escape , but it was intimated that he would be dealt with in another connection in a future number .
the article had a crude and terrifying power , and the pain it aroused , following almost immediately upon the suffering caused by my separation from <name> , was cumulative in character and effect , seeming actively to <unk> the unwelcome conviction i had been striving to suppress , that the world , which had long seemed so <unk> in <unk> itself to my desires , was turning against me .
though my hunger for <name> was still gnawing , i had begun to fear that i should never get her now ; and the fact that she would not even write to me seemed to confirm this .
then there was <name>  i could not bear to think that he would ever read that article .
in vain i tried that night to <unk> to myself its contentions and probable results , to summon up the heart to fight ; in vain i sought to reconstruct the point of view , to gain something of that renewed <name> and power , of devotion to a cause i had carried away from washington after my talk with <name> watling .
he , though stricken , had not wavered in his <name> .
why should i ?
whether or not as the result of the article in <unk> 's , which had been read more or less widely in the city , the campaign of the citizens union gained ground , and people began to fill the little halls to hear krebs , who was a candidate for district attorney .
evidently he was entertaining and rousing them , for his reputation spread , and some of the larger halls were hired .
dickinson and gorse became alarmed , and one morning the banker turned up at the club while i was eating my breakfast .
" look here , <name> , " he said , " we may as well face the fact that we 've got a fight ahead of us ,  we 'll have to start some sort of a <unk> right away . "
" you think greenhalge has a chance of being elected ? "
i asked .
" i 'm not afraid of greenhalge , but of this fellow krebs .
we ca n't afford to have him district attorney , to let a <unk> like him get a start .
the men the republicans and democrats have nominated are worse than useless .
parks is no good , and neither is <unk> .
if only we could have foreseen this thing we might have had better candidates put up  but there 's no use crying over spilt milk .
you 'll have to go on the stump , <name>  that 's all there is to it .
you can answer him , and the newspapers <name> print your speeches in full .
besides it <name> help you when it comes to the <unk> . "
the mood of extreme dejection that had followed the appearance of the article in <unk> 's did not last .
i had acquired <unk> : an <unk> , however , differing in quality from the feeling i once would have had ,  for this arose from resentment , not from belief .
it was impossible to live in the atmosphere created by the men with whom i associated  especially at such a time  without <unk> something of the emotions animating them ,  even though i had been free from these emotions myself .
i , too , had begun to be filled with a <name> for revenge ; and when this <name> was upon me i did not have in my mind a pack of reformers , or even the writer of the article in <unk> 's .
i thought of hermann krebs .
he was my <unk> ; it seemed to me that he always had been ... . " well , i 'll make speeches if you like , " i said to dickinson .
" i 'm glad , " he replied .
" we 're all agreed , gorse and the rest of us , that you ought to .
we 've got to get some <name> into this fight , and a good deal more money , i 'm afraid .
<name> sends word we 'll need more .
by the way , <name> , i wish you 'd drop around and talk to <name> and get his idea of how the land lies . "
i went , this time in the company of judah b. tallant .
naturally we did n't expect to see mr. <name> <unk> , nor was he .
he seemed to be in an odd , rather exultant mood  if he can be imagined as exultant .
we were not long in finding out what pleased him  nothing less than the fact that mr. krebs had proposed him for mayor !
" d  d if i would n't make a good one , too , " he said .
" d  d if i wouldn't show 'em what a real mayor is ! "
" i guess there 's no danger of your ever being mayor , judd , " tallant observed , with a somewhat uneasy <unk> .
" i guess there is n't , judah , " replied the boss , quickly , but with a peculiar <name> flash in his eyes .
" they wo n't ever make you mayor , either , if i can help it .
and i 've a notion i can .
i 'd rather see krebs mayor . "
" you do n't think he meant to propose you seriously , " tallant exclaimed .
" i 'm not a d  d fool , " said the boss .
" but i 'll say this , that he half meant it .
krebs has a <unk> on him , and i tell you if any of this reform <unk> is worth anything his is .
there 's some sense in what he's talking , and if all the voters was like him you might get a man like me for mayor .
but they 're not , and i guess they never <name> be . "
" sure , " said mr. <name> .
" the people are <name>  there ai n't one in ten thousand understands what he 's driving at when he gets off things like that .
they take it on the level . "
tallant reflected .
" by gum , i believe you 're right , " he said .
" you think they <name> blow up ? "
he added .
" krebs is the whole show , i tell you .
they would n't be anywhere without him .
the <unk> that listen to him do n't understand him , but somehow he gets under their skins .
have you seen him lately ? "
" never saw him , " replied tallant .
" well , if you had , you 'd know he was a sick man . "
" sick ! "
i exclaimed .
" how do you know ? "
" it 's my business to know things , " said judd <name> , and added to tallant , " that your reporters do n't find out . "
" what 's the matter with him ? "
tallant demanded .
a slight exultation in his tone did not escape me .
" you 've got me there , " said <name> , " but i have it pretty straight .
any one of your reporters <name> tell you that he looks sick . " ... .
the <name> took mr. <name> 's advice and began to publish those portions of krebs 's speeches that were seemingly <unk> to his own cause .
other conservative newspapers followed suit ... .
both tallant and i were surprised to hear these sentiments out of the mouth of mr. <name> .
" you do n't think that crowd 's going to win , do you ? "
asked the owner of the <name> , a trifle uneasily .
" win ! "
exclaimed the boss contemptuously .
" they 'll blow up , and you'll never hear of 'em .
i 'm not saying we wo n't need a little  powder , " he added  which was one of the matters we had come to talk about .
he gave us likewise a very accurate idea of the state of the campaign , mentioning certain things that ought to be done .
" you ought to print some of krebs 's speeches , judah , like what he said about me .
they're talking it all around that you 're afraid to . "
" print things like his proposal to make you mayor ! "
the information that i was to enter the lists against krebs was received with satisfaction and approval by those of our friends who were called in to assist at a council of war in the directors ' room of the corn national bank .
i was flattered by the confidence these men seemed to have in my ability .
all were in a state of anger against the reformers ; none of them seriously alarmed as to the actual outcome of the campaign ,  especially when i had given them the opinion of mr. <name> .
what disturbed them was the possible effect upon the future of the spread of <unk> , <unk> doctrines , and it was decided to organize a publicity bureau , independently of the two dominant political parties , to be in charge of a certain new york journalist who made a business of such affairs , who was to be paid a sum commensurate with the emergency .
he was to have <unk> <name> , even in the editorial columns of our newspapers .
he was also to flood the city with " literature . "
we had fought many wars before this , and we planned our campaign precisely as though we were dealing with one of those rebellions in the realm of finance of which i have given an instance .
but now the war chest of our opponents was <unk> ; and we were comforted by the thought that , however disagreeable the affair might be while it lasted , in the long run capital was invincible .
before setting to work to prepare my speeches it was necessary to make an attempt to <unk> myself with the seemingly unprecedented line of argument krebs had evolved  apparently as disconcerting to his friends as to his opponents .
it occurred to me , since i did not care to attend krebs 's meetings , to ask my confidential stenographer , miss <unk> , to go to turner 's hall and take down one of his speeches verbatim .
miss <unk> had never intruded on me her own views , and i took for granted that they <unk> with my own .
" i 'd like to get an accurate record of what he is saying , " i told her .
" do you mind going ? "
" no , i 'll be glad to go , mr. paret , " she said quietly .
" he 's doing more harm than we thought , " i remarked , after a moment .
" i 've known him for a good many years .
he 's clever .
he 's sowing seeds of discontent , starting trouble that <name> be very serious unless it is headed off . "
miss <unk> made no comment ... . before noon the next day she brought in the speech , neatly typewritten , and laid it on my desk .
looking up and catching her eye just as she was about to withdraw , i was suddenly impelled to ask :  " well , what did you think of it ? "
she actually flushed , for the first time in my dealings with her betraying a feeling which i am sure she deemed most <unk> .
" i liked it , mr. paret , " she replied simply , and i knew that she had <unk> .
it was quite apparent that krebs had captivated her .
i tried not to betray my annoyance .
" was there a good audience ? "
i asked .
" yes , " she said .
" how many do you think ? "
she hesitated .
" it is n't a very large hall , you know .
i should say it would hold about eight hundred people . "
" and  it was full ? "
 i persisted .
" oh , yes , there were <name> of people standing . "
i thought i detected in her <unk> it was not apologetic  a <name> to spare my feelings .
she hesitated a moment more , and then left the room , closing the door softly behind her ...
presently i took up the pages and began to read .
the language was simple and direct , an appeal to common sense , yet the words strangely seemed charged with an emotional power that i found myself resisting .
when at length i laid down the sheets i wondered whether it were imagination , or the uncomfortable result of memories of conversations i had had with him .
i was , however , confronted with the task of <unk> his arguments : but with exasperating ingenuity , he seemed to have taken the wind out of our sails .
it is difficult to answer a man who denies the cardinal principle of american democracy ,  that a good mayor or a governor may be made out of a <unk> .
he called this the <unk> theory : that any american , because he was an american , was fit for any job in the gift of state or city or government , from sheriff to ambassador to great britain .
krebs substituted for this fallacy what may be called the doctrine of <unk> .
if we inaugurated and developed a system of democratic education , based on scientific principles , and caught the <unk> , young enough , he might become a statesman or thinker or scientist and make his contribution to the welfare and progress of the nation : again , he might not ; but he would have had his chance , he would not be in a position to complain .
here was a doctrine , i immediately perceived , which it would be <unk> to attempt to refute .
it ought , indeed , to have been my line .
with a growing distaste i began to realize that all there was left for me was to flatter a populace that krebs , paradoxically , <unk> .
never in the history of american " uplift " had an <unk> been in this manner <unk> !
upbraided for expediency , a <unk> to demand immediate results , an unwillingness to think , yes , and an inability to think straight .
such an <unk> deserved to be led around by the nose by the <unk> and <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> .
yes , he had mentioned me .
that gave me a queer sensation .
how is one to handle an opponent who praises one with a delightful irony ?
we , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , etc. , had this virtue at least , and it was by no means the least of the virtues ,  that we did think .
we had a plan , a theory of government , and we carried it out .
he was inclined to believe that morality consisted largely , if not wholly , in clear thinking , and not in the precepts of the sunday-school .
that was the trouble with the so-called " reform " campaigns , they were conducted on lines of sunday-school morality ; the people worked themselves up into a sort of <unk> frenzy , an emotional state which , if the truth were told , was thoroughly immoral , unreasonable and hypocritical : like all <unk> , as a matter of course it died down after the campaign was over .
moreover , the american people had shown that they were unwilling to make any sacrifices for the permanent <unk> of conditions , and as soon as their incomes began to fall off they turned again to the bosses and capitalists like an abject flock of sheep .
he went on to explain that he was n't referring now to that part of the <unk> known as the labour element , the men who worked with their hands in mills , factories , etc .
they had their faults , yet they possessed at least the virtue of <unk> , a willingness to undergo sacrifices in order to advance the standard of conditions ; they too had a tenacity of purpose and a plan , such as it was , which the small business men , the clerks lacked ... . we must wake up to the fact that we should n't get <unk> by turning out mr. <name> and the highly efficient gentlemen who hired and <unk> him .
it was n't so simple as that .
<unk> was not an achievement after all , but an undertaking , a state of mind , the continued overcoming of resistance by a progressive education and effort .
and all this talk of political and financial " wickedness " was rubbish ; the wickedness they complained of did not reside merely in individuals it was a social disorder , or rather an order that no longer suited social conditions .
if the so-called good citizens would take the trouble to educate themselves , to think instead of allowing their thinking to be done for them they would see that the " evils " which had been published <unk> were merely the symptoms of that disease which had come upon the social body through their collective neglect and indifference .
they held up their hands in horror at the spectacle of a commercial , <unk> <unk> , they shunned the <unk> and the criminal ; but there was none of us , if honest , who would not exclaim when he saw them , " there , but for the <name> of god , go i ! "
what we still called " sin " was largely the result of lack of opportunity , and the active principle of society as at present organized tended more and more to restrict opportunity .
lack of opportunity , lack of proper <unk> ,  these made sinners by the wholesale ; made , too , nine-tenths of the inefficient of whom we <unk> complained .
we had a national philosophy that measured prosperity in dollars and cents , included in this measurement the profits of liquor dealers who were responsible for most of our idiots .
so long as we set our hearts on that kind of prosperity , so long as we failed to grasp the simple and practical fact that the greatest assets of a nation are healthy and sane and educated , <unk> human beings , just so long was <unk> logical , riverside <unk> , traction deals , judd <unk> , and the respectable gentlemen who continued to fill their <unk> out of the public purse inevitable .
the speaker turned his attention to the " respectable gentlemen " with the full <unk> , amongst whom i was by implication included .
we had simply succeeded under the rules to which society tacitly agreed .
that was our sin .
he ventured to say that there were few men in the hall who at the bottom of their hearts did not envy and even honour our success .
he , for one , did not deem these " respectable gentlemen " utterly reprehensible ; he was sufficiently emancipated to be sorry for us .
he suspected that we were not wholly happy in being winners in such a game ,  he even believed that we could wish as much as any others to change the game and the prizes .
what we represented was valuable energy <unk> and misplaced , and in a reorganized community he would not abolish us , but transform us : transform , at least , the individuals of our type , who were the builders gone wrong under the influence of an <unk> philosophy .
we might be made to serve the city and the state with the same effectiveness that we had served ourselves .
if the best among the scientists , among the university professors and physicians were willing to labour  and they were  for the advancement of humanity , for the very love of the work and service without <unk> <unk> , without the accumulation of a wealth difficult to spend , why surely these big business men had been moulded in infancy from no different <name> !
all were americans .
instance after instance might be cited of business men and lawyers of ability making sacrifices , giving up their personal affairs in order to take places of honour in the government in which the salary was comparatively small , proving that even these were open to inducements other than merely mercenary ones .
it was unfortunate , he went on , but true , that the vast majority of people of voting age in the united states to-day who thought they had been educated were under the obligation to <unk> themselves .
he suggested , <unk> , a vacation school for congress and all legislative bodies as a starter .
until the fact of the utter inadequacy of the old education were faced , there was little or no <name> of solving the problems that harassed us .
one thing was certain  that they couldn't be solved by a <unk> morality .
coincident with the appearance of these new and mighty problems , perhaps in response to them , a new and <unk> view of life itself was being developed by the world 's thinkers , new sciences were being evolved , correlated sciences ; a psychology making a truer analysis of human motives , impulses , of human possibilities ; an economics and a theory of government that took account of this psychology , and of the vast changes applied science had made in production and distribution .
we lived in a new world , which we sought to ignore ; and the new education , the new <unk> was in truth nothing but religion made practical .
it had never been thought practical before .
the motive that compelled men to work for humanity in science , in medicine , in <name>  yes , and in business , if we took the right view of it , was the religious motive .
the application of religion was to-day extending from the individual to society .
no religion that did not fill the needs of both was a true religion .
this meant the development of a new culture , one to be founded on the american tradition of equality of opportunity .
but culture was not a weed that grew overnight ; it was a <unk> that spread slowly and painfully , first <unk> a few who suffered and often died for it , that it might gradually affect the many .
the spread of culture implied the recognition of leadership : democratic leadership , but still leadership .
leadership , and the wisdom it implied , did not reside in the people , but in the leaders who sprang from the people and interpreted their needs and longings ... .
he went on to discuss a part of the programme of the citizens union ... . what struck me , as i laid down the typewritten sheets , was the extraordinary resemblance between the philosophies of hermann krebs and <name> watling .
only  krebs 's philosophy was the bigger , held the greater vision of the two ; i had reluctantly and rather bitterly to admit it .
the appeal of it had even reached and stirred me , whose task was to refute it !
here indeed was something to fight for  perhaps to die for , as he had said : and as i sat there in my office gazing out of the window i found myself repeating certain phrases he had used  the phrase about leadership , for instance .
it was a tremendous <name> of democracy , that of acquiescence to developed leadership made responsible ; a <name> i was compelled to confess <unk> mr. watling 's , loyal as i was to him ... .
i began to reflect how novel all this was in a political speech  although what i have quoted was in the nature of a <unk> .
it was a sermon , an educational sermon .
well , that is what sermons always had been ,  and even now pretended to be ,  educational and stirring , appealing to the emotions through the intellect .
it did n't read like the socialism he used to preach , it had the ring of religion .
he had called it religion .
with an effort of the <name> i turned from this ironical and dangerous vision of a <name> paret who might have been enlisted in an inspiring struggle , of a modern yet <unk> <name> kicking against the <unk> , condemned to go forth breathing fire against a doctrine that made a true appeal ; against the man i believed i hated just because he had made this appeal .
in the act of summoning my <unk> i was interrupted by the entrance of grierson .
he was calling on a matter of business , but began to talk about the extracts from krebs 's speech he had read in the mail and state .
" what in hell is this fellow driving at , paret ? "
he demanded .
" it sounds to me like the <unk> of a lunatic dervish .
if he thinks so much of us , and the way we run the town , what 's he <unk> about ? "
i looked at grierson , and conceived an intense aversion for him .
i wondered how i had ever been able to stand him , to work with him .
i saw him in a sudden flash as a cunning , cruel bird of prey , a gorged , drab vulture with <unk> eyes , a resemblance so extraordinary that i wondered i had never remarked it before .
for he had the hooked vulture nose , while the pink baldness of his head was relieved by a few scanty tufts of hair .
" the people seem to like what he 's got to say , " i observed .
" it beats me , " said grierson .
" they do n't understand a quarter of it  i 've been talking to some of 'em .
it 's their d  d curiosity , i guess .
you know how they 'll stand for hours around a street fakir . "
" it 's more than that , " i retorted .
grierson regarded me <unk> .
" well , we 'll put a <unk> in him , all right , " he said , with a laugh .
i was in an <unk> state of mind when he left me .
i had an impulse to send for miss <unk> and ask her if she had understood what krebs was " driving at , " but for reasons that must be fairly obvious i refrained .
i read over again that part of krebs 's speech which dealt with the immediate programme of the citizens union .
after paying a tribute to greenhalge as a man of common sense and <unk> who would make a good mayor , he went on to explain the principle of the new charter they hoped ultimately to get , which should put the management of the city in the hands of one man , an expert employed by a commission ; an expert whose duty it would be to conduct the affairs of the city on a business basis , precisely as those of any efficient corporation were conducted .
this plan had already been adopted , with encouraging results , in several smaller cities of the country .
he explained in some detail , with statistics , the waste and inefficiency and <unk> in various departments under the present system , dwelling particularly upon the deplorable state of affairs in the city hospital .
i need not dwell upon this portion of his remarks .
since then text-books and serious periodicals have dealt with these matters thoroughly .
they are now familiar to all thinking americans .
xxv .
my entrance into the campaign was accompanied by a blare of publicity , and during that fortnight i never picked up a morning or evening newspaper without reading , on the first <name> , some such <unk> as " crowds flock to hear paret . "
as a matter of fact , the crowds did flock ; but i never quite knew as i looked down from platforms on seas of faces how much of the flocking was spontaneous .
much of it was so , since the struggle had then become sufficiently dramatic to appeal to the larger public imagination that is but occasionally waked ; on the other hand , the magic of advertising can not be <unk> ; nor must the existence be ignored of an organized corps of shepherds under the vigilant direction of mr. judd <name> , whose duty it was to see that none of our meetings was lacking in <name> and enthusiasm .
there was always a demonstrative gathering overflowing the sidewalk in front of the entrance , swaying and cheering in the light of the street lamps , and on the floor within an ample scattering of suspiciously <unk> voters to start the stamping and applauding .
in spite of these known facts , the impression of popularity , of <unk> of reform by a large majority of level-headed inhabitants had reassuring and <unk> effects .
astute citizens , spectators of the fray  if indeed there were any  might have remarked an unique and significant feature of that campaign : that the usual recriminations between the two great parties were lacking .
mr .
parks , the republican candidate , did not denounce mr. <unk> , the democratic candidate .
republican and democratic speakers alike expended their breath in lashing mr. krebs and the citizens union .
it is difficult to record the fluctuations of my spirit .
when i was in the halls , speaking or waiting to speak , i <unk> to that phenomenon known as mob psychology , i became <unk> , even <unk> ; and in those earlier speeches i managed , i think , to strike the note for which i strove  the judicial note , suitable to a lawyer of weight and prominence , of <unk> rather than denunciation .
i sought to embody and voice a fine and calm sanity at a time when everyone else seemed in danger of losing their heads , and to a large extent achieved it .
i had known mr. krebs for more than twenty years , and while i did not care to criticise a <unk> of the bar , i would go so far as to say that he was visionary , that the changes he proposed in government would , if adopted , have grave and far-reaching results : we could not , for instance , support in idleness those who refused to do their share of the work of the world .
mr. krebs was well-meaning .
i refrained from dwelling too long upon him , passing to mr. greenhalge , also well-meaning , but a man of <unk> ability who would make a mess of the government of a city which would one day rival new york and chicago .
( loud cheers . )
and i pointed out that mr. <name> blackwood had been unable to manage the affairs of the boyne street road .
such men , <unk> though they might be , were <unk> to progress .
this led me naturally to a discussion of the riverside franchise and the traction consolidation .
i was one of those whose honesty and good <name> had been arraigned , but i would not stoop to refute the accusations .
i dwelt upon the benefits to the city , uniform service , electricity and large comfortable cars instead of <unk> conveyances , and the development of a large and growing population in the riverside neighbourhood : the continual extension of lines to suburban districts that enabled <unk> men to live out of the smoke : i called attention to the system of <unk> , the distance a passenger might be conveyed , and conveyed quickly , for the sum of five cents .
i spoke of our capitalists as men more sinned against than <unk> .
their money was always at the service of enterprises tending to the development of our metropolis .
when i was not in the meetings , however , and especially when in my room at night , i was continually trying to fight off a sense of loneliness that seemed to threaten to overwhelm me .
i wanted to be alone , and yet i feared to be .
i was aware , in spite of their congratulations on my efforts , of a growing dislike for my associates ; and in the appalling emptiness of the moments when my depression was greatest i was forced to the realization that i had no disinterested friend  not one  in whom i could confide .
<name> had failed me ; i had scarcely seen <name> peters that <name> , and it was out of the question to go to him .
for the third time in my life , and in the greatest crisis of all , i was feeling the need of something , of some sustaining and impelling power that must be presented humanly , possessing sympathy and understanding and love ... .
i think i had a glimpse just a pathetic glimpse  of what the church might be of human <unk> , comfort and support , of human tolerance , if stripped of the superstition of an ancient science .
my tortures were n't of the flesh , but of the mind .
my mind was the sheep which had gone astray .
was there no such thing , could there be no such thing as a human association that might at the same time be a divine organism , a fold and a refuge for the lost and divided minds ?
the source of all this trouble was social ... . then toward the end of that last campaign week , madness suddenly came upon me .
i know now how near the breaking point i was , but the immediate cause of my " flying to pieces "  to use a vivid expression  was a speech made by <unk> , one of the citizens union candidates for alderman , a young man of a radical type not uncommon in these days , though new to my experience : an educated man in the <unk> sense , yet lacking poise and perspective , with a certain <unk> and assurance .
he was a journalist , a correspondent of some eastern newspapers and periodicals .
in this speech , which was reported to me  for it did not get into the newspapers  i was the particular object of his attack .
men of my kind , and not the judd <unk> ( for whom there was some excuse ) were the least <unk> tools of the capitalists , the greatest menace to civilization .
we were absolutely lacking in principle , we were ready at any time to <unk> our profession by <unk> steals ; we fouled our nests with dirty fees .
not all that he said was <unk> , for he knew something of the modern theory of the law that legal <unk> had begun to proclaim , and even to teach in some tolerant universities .
the next night , in the middle of a prepared speech i was delivering to a large crowd in kingdom hall there had been jeers from a group in a corner at some assertion i made .
<unk> 's accusations had been <unk> in my mind .
the faces of the people grew blurred as i felt anger boiling , rising within me ; suddenly my control gave way , and i launched forth into a denunciation of greenhalge , krebs , <unk> and even of <name> blackwood that must have been without license or bounds .
i can recall only fragments of my remarks : greenhalge wanted to be mayor , and was willing to put the stigma of slander on his native city in order to gain his ambition ; krebs had made a failure of his profession , of everything save in bringing shame on the place of his adoption ; and on the single occasion heretofore when he had been before the public , in the school board <unk> , the officials <unk> on his supposed evidence had triumphantly been <unk>  , <unk> was gaining money and notoriety out of his <unk> ; <name> blackwood was acting out of spite ... .
i returned to krebs , declaring that he would be the boss of the city if that ticket were elected , demanding whether they wished for a boss an <unk> itching for power and recognition ... .
i was conscious at the moment only of a wild relief and <name> in letting myself go , feelings heightened by the clapping and cheers with which my <unk> were received .
the fact that the cheers were mingled with hisses merely served to drive me on .
at length , when i had returned to krebs , the hisses were redoubled , <unk> me the more because of the evidence they gave of friends of his in my audiences .
perhaps i had made some of these friends for him !
a voice shouted out above the uproar :  " i know about krebs .
he 's a d  d sight better man than you . "
and this started a struggle in a corner of the hall ... .
i managed , somehow , when the commotion had subsided , to regain my poise , and ended by uttering the conviction that the common sense of the community would repudiate the citizens union and all it stood for ... .
but that night , as i lay awake listening to the street noises and staring at the glint from a street lamp on the brass knob of my bedstead , i knew that i had failed .
i had committed the supreme violation of the self that leads inevitably to its final dissolution ... .
even the <unk> headlines of the newspapers handed me by the club servant in the morning brought but little relief .
on the saturday morning before the tuesday of election there was a conference in the directors ' room of the corn national .
the city reeked with smoke and acrid , stale gas , the electric lights were turned on to dispel the november gloom .
it was not a cheerful conference , nor a confident one .
for the first time in a collective experience the men gathered there were confronted with a situation which they doubted their ability to control , a situation for which there was no precedent .
they had to reckon with a new and <unk> equation in politics and finance ,  the independent <unk> .
there was an element of desperation in the discussion .
recriminations passed .
dickinson implied that gorse with all his knowledge of political affairs ought to have foreseen that something like this was sure to happen , should have managed better the conventions of both great parties .
the railroad counsel retorted that it had been as much dickinson 's fault as his .
grierson expressed a regret that i had broken out against the reformers ; it had <unk> , he said ,  and this was just enough to sting me to <unk> that things had been done in the campaign , chiefly through his initiative , that were not only unwise , but might land some of us in the penitentiary if krebs were elected .
" well , " grierson exclaimed , " whether he 's elected or not , i wouldn't give much now for your chances of getting to the senate .
we ca n't afford to fly in the face of the dear public . "
a tense silence followed this remark .
in the street below the rumble of the traffic came to us muffled by the heavy plate-glass windows .
i saw tallant glance at gorse and dickinson , and i knew the matter had been decided between themselves , that they had been merely withholding it from me until after election .
i was <unk> , for the present at least .
" i think you <name> do me the justice , gentlemen , " i remember saying slowly , with the excessive and rather ridiculous formality of a man who is near the end of his <unk> , " that the idea of representing you in the senate was yours , not mine .
you begged me to take the appointment against my wishes and my judgment .
i had no <name> to go to washington then , i have less to-day .
i have come to the conclusion that my usefulness to you is at an end . "
i got to my feet .
i beheld miller gorse sitting impassive , with his <unk> stare , the strongest man of them all .
a change of <unk> would not move him .
but dickinson had risen and put his hand on my shoulder .
it was the first time i had ever seen him white .
" hold on , <name> , " he exclaimed , " i guess we 're all a little <unk> today .
this confounded campaign has got on our nerves , and we say things we do n't mean .
you must n't think we 're not grateful for the services you 've rendered us .
we 're all in the same boat , and there is n't a man who 's been on our side of this fight who could take a political office at this time .
we 've got to face that fact , and i know you have the sense to see it , too .
i , for one , wo n't be satisfied until i see you in the senate .
it 's where you belong , and you deserve to be there .
you understand what the public is , how it blows hot and cold , and in a few years they 'll be howling to get us back , if these <unk> win .
" sure , " chimed in grierson , who was frightened , " that 's right , <name> .
i did n't mean anything .
nobody appreciates you more than i do , old man . "
tallant , too , added something , and <unk> ,  i 've forgotten what .
i was tired , too tired to meet their advances halfway .
i said that i had a speech to get ready for that night , and other affairs to attend to , and left them grouped together like crestfallen conspirators  all save miller gorse , whose <unk> gaze seemed to follow me after i had closed the door .
an elevator took me down to the lobby of the corn bank building .
i paused for a moment , aimlessly regarding the streams of humanity hurrying in and out , <unk> the white marble floor with the wet filth of the streets .
someone spoke my name .
it was bitter , judd <unk> " legal " tool , and i permitted myself to be dragged out of the eddies into a quiet corner by the cigar stand .
" say , i guess we 've got krebs 's goat all right , this time , " he told me confidentially , in a voice a little above a whisper ; " he was busy with the <unk> girls last year , you remember , when they were striking .
well , one of 'em , one of the strike leaders , has taken to easy street ; she 's agreed to send him a letter to-night to come 'round to her room after his meeting , to say that she 's sick and wants to see him .
he'll go , all right .
we 'll have some fun , we 'll be ready for him .
do you get me ?
so long .
the old man 's waiting for me . "
it may seem odd that this piece of information did not produce an immediately revolting effect .
i knew that similar practices had been tried on krebs , but this was the first time i had heard of a definite plan , and from a man like bitter .
as i made my way out of the building i had , indeed , a <unk> feeling ; <name> 's " lawyer " was a dirty little man , smelling of stale cigars , with a blue-black , unshaven face .
in spite of the shocking nature of his confidence , he had actually not succeeded in <unk> the current of my thoughts ; these were still running over the scene in the directors ' room .
i had listened to him passively while he had held my buttonhole , and he had detained me but an instant .
when i reached the street i was wondering whether gorse and dickinson and the others , grierson especially , could possibly have entertained the belief that i would turn traitor ?
i told myself that i had no intention of this .
how could i turn traitor ?
and what would be the object ?
revenge ?
the <unk> feeling grew more acute ... .
reaching my office , i shut the door , sat down at my desk , summoned my <name> , and began to jot down random notes for the part of my speech i was to give the newspapers , notes that were mere silly fragments of arguments i had once thought effective .
i could no more concentrate on them than i could have written a poem .
gradually , like the smoke that settled down on our city until we lived in darkness at midday , the horror of what bitter had told me began to <unk> my mind , until i was in a state of terror .
had i , <name> paret , fallen to this , that i could stand by consenting to an act which was worse than assassination ?
was any cause worth it ?
could any cause survive it ?
but my attempts at reasoning might be likened to the <unk> of a <unk> lost on a mountain side to pick his way in the gathering dusk .
i had just that desperate feeling of being lost , and with it went an acute sense of an imminent danger ; the ground , no longer firm under my feet , had become a sliding shale sloping toward an unseen precipice .
perhaps , like the <unk> , my fears were the sharper for the memory of the beauty of the morning on that same mountain , when , filled with vigour , i had gazed on it from the plain below and beheld the sun breaking through the mists ... .
the necessity of taking some action to avert what i now realized as an infamy pressed upon me , yet in conflict with the pressure of this necessity there persisted that old rebellion , that bitterness which had been growing all these years against the man who , above all others , seemed to me to represent the forces setting at nought my achievements , bringing me to this pass ... .
i thought of appealing to <name> dickinson , who surely , if he knew of it , would not permit this thing to be done ; and he was the only man with the possible exception of miller gorse who might be able to restrain judd <name> .
but i delayed until after the luncheon hour , when i called up the bank on the telephone , to discover that it was closed .
i had forgotten that the day was saturday .
i was prepared to say that i would withdraw from the campaign , warn krebs myself if this kind of tactics were not suppressed .
but i could not get the banker .
then i began to have doubts of dickinson 's power in the matter .
judd <name> had never been <unk> , by any means ; he had always maintained a considerable independence of the financial powers , and to-day not only financial control , but the <unk> of <name> himself was at stake .
he would fight for it to the last ditch , and make use of any means .
no , it was of no use to appeal to him .
what then ?
well , there was a reaction , or an attempt at one .
krebs had not been born yesterday , he had avoided the wiles of the politicians heretofore , he would n't be fool enough to be taken in now .
i told myself that if i were not in a state bordering on a nervous breakdown , i should laugh at such morbid fears , i steadied myself sufficiently to dictate the extract from my speech that was to be published .
i was to make addresses at two halls , alternating with parks , the <unk> candidate .
at four o'clock i went back to my room in the club to try to get some rest ... . <unk> 's hall , the place of my first meeting , was jammed that saturday night .
i went through my speech automatically , as in a dream , the habit of long years asserting itself .
and yet  so i was told afterwards  my delivery was not mechanical , and i actually achieved more emphasis , gave a greater impression of conviction than at any time since the night i had lost my control and violently denounced the reformers .
by some astonishing <unk> process i had regained my manner , but the applause came to me as from a distance .
not only was my mind not there ; it did not seem to be anywhere .
i was dazed , nor did i feel  save once  a fleeting surge of contempt for the mob below me with their silly faces upturned to mine .
there may have been intelligent expressions among them , but they failed to catch my eye .
i remember being stopped by grierson as i was going out of the side entrance .
he took my hand and squeezed it , and there was on his face an odd , surprised look .
" that was the best yet , <name> , " he said .
i went on past him .
looking back on that evening now , it would almost seem as though the volition of another possessed me , not my own : seemingly , i had every intention of going on to the national theatre , in which parks had just spoken , and as i descended the narrow stairway and emerged on the side street i caught sight of my chauffeur awaiting me by the curb .
" i 'm not going to that other meeting , " i found myself saying .
" i'm pretty tired . "
" shall i drive you back to the club , sir ? "
he inquired .
" no  i 'll walk back .
wait a moment . "
i entered the ear , turned on the light and scribbled a hasty note to andrews , the chairman of the meeting at the national , telling him that i was too tired to speak again that night , and to ask one of the younger men there to take my place .
then i got out of the car and gave the note to the chauffeur .
" you 're all right , sir ? "
he asked , with a note of anxiety in his voice .
he had been with me a long time .
i reassured him .
he started the car , and i watched it absently as it gathered speed and turned the corner .
i began to walk , slowly at first , then more and more rapidly until i had gained a breathless pace ; in ten minutes i was in west street , standing in front of the <unk> 's hall where the meeting of the citizens union west in progress .
now that i had arrived there , doubt and uncertainty assailed me .
i had come as it were in spite of myself , thrust onward by an impulse i did not understand , which did not seem to be mine .
what was i going to do ?
the proceeding suddenly appeared to me as ridiculous , tinged with the <unk> of <unk> .
i revolted , walked away , got as far as the corner and stood beside a lamp post , pretending to be waiting for a car .
the street lights were reflected in perpendicular , <unk> ribbons on the wet asphalt , and i stood staring with foolish <unk> at this phenomenon , wondering how a painter would get the effect in oils .
again i was walking back towards the hall , <unk> the acknowledgment to myself that i had a plan , a plan that i did not for a moment believe i would <name> out .
i was shivering .
i climbed the steps .
the wide vestibule was empty except for two men who stopped a <unk> conversation to look at me .
i wondered whether they recognized me ; that i might be recognized was an alarming possibility which had not occurred to me .
" who is speaking ? "
i asked .
" mr. krebs , " answered the taller man of the two .
the hum of applause came from behind the swinging doors .
i pushed them open cautiously , passing suddenly out of the cold into the reeking , heated atmosphere of a building packed with human beings .
the space behind the rear seats was filled with men standing , and those nearest glanced around with annoyance at the interruption of my entrance .
i made my way along the wall , finally reaching a side aisle , whence i could get sight of the platform and the speaker .
i heard his words distinctly , but at first lacked the faculty of stringing them together , or rather of extracting their collective sense .
the phrases indeed were set ringing through my mind , i found myself repeating them without any reference to their meaning ; i had reached the peculiar pitch of excitement that <unk> abnormal calm , and all sense of strangeness at being there in that meeting had passed away .
i began to wonder how i might warn krebs , and presently decided to send him a note when he should have finished speaking  but i could n't make up my mind whether to put my name to the note or not .
of course i <unk> have entered the hall at all : i might have sent in my note at the side door .
i must have wished to see krebs , to hear him speak ; to observe , perhaps , the effect on the audience .
in spite of my inability to take in what he was saying , i was able to regard him <unk> ,  <unk> , in a restricted sense .
i noticed that he had grown even thinner ; the flesh had fallen away from under his cheek-bones , and there were sharp , deep , almost perpendicular lines on either side of his mouth .
he was emaciated , that was the word .
once in a while he thrust his hand through his dry , ashy hair which was of a tone with the paleness of his face .
such was his only gesture .
he spoke quietly , leaning with one elbow against the side of his reading stand .
the occasional <unk> of applause were almost immediately hushed , as though the people feared to lose even a word that should fall from his dry lips .
what was it he was talking about ?
i tried to concentrate my attention , with only partial success .
he was explaining the new theory of city government that did not attempt to evade , but dealt frankly with the human needs of to-day , and sought to meet those needs in a positive way ... what had happened to me , though i did not realize it , was that i had gradually come under the influence of a tragic spell not <unk> to the words i heard , existing independently of them , pervading the spacious hall , weaving into unity <unk> minds .
and then , with what seemed a retarded rather than sudden <unk> , i knew that he had stopped speaking .
once more he ran his hand through his hair , he was seemingly groping for words that would not come .
i was pierced by a strange agony  the amazing source of which , seemed to be a smile on the face of hermann krebs , an ineffable smile illuminating the place like a flash of light , in which suffering and tragedy , comradeship and loving kindness  all were mingled .
he stood for a moment with that smile on his face  swayed , and would have fallen had it not been for the quickness of a man on the platform behind him , and into whose arms he sank .
in an instant people had risen in their seats , men were hurrying down the aisles , while a peculiar human murmur or wail persisted like an undertone beneath the confusion of noises , striking the very note of my own feelings .
above the heads of those about me i saw krebs being carried off the platform ... .
the chairman motioned for silence and inquired if there were a physician in the audience , and then all began to talk at once .
the man who stood beside me clutched my arm .
" i <name> he is n't dead !
say , did you see that smile ?
my god , i 'll never forget it ! "
the exclamation <unk> voiced the esteem in which krebs was held .
as i was thrust along out of the hall by the ebb of the crowd still other expressions of this esteem came to me in fragments , expressions of sorrow and dismay , of a loyalty i had not imagined .
mingled with these were occasional remarks of <unk> shaken , in human fashion , by the suggestion of the inevitable end that never fails to sober and terrify humanity .
" i guess he was a bigger man than we thought .
there was a lot of sense in what he had to say . "
" there sure was , " the companion of this speaker answered .
they spoke of him in the past tense .
i was seized and <unk> by the fear that i should never see him again , and at the same moment i realized sharply that this was the one thing i wanted  to see him .
i pushed through the people , gained the street , and fairly ran down the alley that led to the side entrance of the hall , where a small group was gathered under the light that <name> above the doorway .
there stood on the step , a little above the others , a young man in a grey flannel shirt , evidently a mechanic .
i addressed him .
" what does the doctor say ? "
before replying he surveyed me with surprise and , i think , with instinctive suspicion of my clothes and bearing .
" what can he say ? "
he retorted .
" you mean  ? "
i began .
" i mean mr. krebs ought n't never to have gone into this campaign , " he answered , <unk> a trifle , perhaps at the tone of my voice .
" he knew it , too , and some of us fellows tried to stop him .
but we could n't do nothing with him , " he added <unk> .
" what is  the trouble ? "
i asked .
" they tell me it 's his heart .
he would n't talk about it . "
" when i think of what he done for our union ! "
exclaimed a <unk> man , plainly a steel worker .
" he 's just wore himself out , fighting that crooked gang . "
he stared with sudden <unk> at me .
" have n't i seen you <unk> ? "
he demanded .
a denial was on my lips when the sharp , sinister strokes of a <name> were heard coming nearer .
" it 's the ambulance , " said the man on the step .
glancing up the alley beyond the figures of two policemen who had arrived and were holding the people back , i saw the hood of the conveyance as it came to a halt , and immediately a hospital doctor and two assistants carrying a <unk> hurried towards us , and we made way for them to enter .
after a brief interval , they were heard coming slowly down the steps inside .
by the white , cruel light of the arc i saw krebs lying motionless ... .
i laid hold of one of the men who had been on the platform .
he did not resent the act , he seemed to anticipate my question .
" he 's conscious .
the doctors expect him to rally when he gets to the hospital . "
i walked back to the club to discover that several inquiries had been made about me .
reporters had been there , republican headquarters had telephoned to know if i were ill. leaving word that i was not to be disturbed under any circumstances , i went to my room , and spent most of the night in distracted thought .
when at last morning came i breakfasted early , searching the newspapers for accounts of the occurrence at <unk> 's hall ; and the fact that these were neither conspicuous nor circumstantial was in the nature of a triumph of self-control on the part of editors and reporters .
news , however sensational , had severely to be condensed in the interest of a cause , and at this critical stage of the campaign to make a tragic hero of hermann krebs would have been the height of folly .
there were a couple of paragraphs giving the gist of his speech , and a statement at the end that he had been taken ill and conveyed to the presbyterian hospital ... .
the hospital itself loomed up before me that <name> morning as i approached it along <unk> street , a diluted <name> washing the extended , businesslike facade of grimy , yellow brick .
we were proud of that hospital in the city , and many of our foremost citizens had contributed large sums of money to the building , scarcely ten years old .
it had been one of <name> 's interests .
i was ushered into the reception room , where presently came the physician in charge , a dr. castle , one of those <unk> , modern young medical men who bear on their persons the very stamp of efficiency , of the dignity of a scientific profession .
his greeting implied that he knew all about me , his presence seemed to increase the agitation i tried not to betray , and must have betrayed .
" can i do anything for you , mr .
paret ? "
he asked .
" i have come to inquire about mr. krebs , who was brought here last night , i believe . "
i was aware for an instant of his penetrating , professional glance , the only indication of the surprise he must have felt that hermann krebs , of all men , should be the object of my solicitude .
" why , we sent him home this morning .
nineteen twenty six fowler street .
he wanted to go , and there was no use in his staying . "
" he <name> recover ? "
i asked .
the physician shook his head , gazing at me through his glasses .
" he may live a month , mr. paret , he may die to-morrow .
he ought never to have gone into this campaign , he knew he had this trouble .
<unk> warned him three months ago , and there 's no man who knows more about the heart than <unk> . "
" then there 's no <name> ? "
i asked .
" absolutely none .
it 's a great pity . "
he added , after a moment , " mr. krebs was a remarkable man . "
" nineteen twenty-six fowler street ? "
i repeated .
" yes . "
i held out my hand mechanically , and he pressed it , and went with me to the door .
" nineteen twenty-six fowler street , " he repeated ...
the mean and sordid aspect of fowler street emphasized and seemed to <unk> my despair , the pungent coal smoke stifled my lungs even as it stifled my spirit .
ugly factories , which were little more than <unk> , wore an empty , menacing , " <name> " look , and the faint november sunlight glistened on dirty pavements where children were making a semblance of play .
monotonous rows of red houses succeeded one another , some pushed forward , others thrust back behind little plots of stamped earth .
into one of these i turned .
it seemed a little cleaner , better kept , less sordid than the others .
i pulled the <name> , and presently the door was opened by a woman whose arms were bare to the elbow .
she wore a <unk> calico apron that came to her throat , but the apron was clean , and her firm though furrowed face gave evidences of recent <unk> exertions .
her eyes had the strange look of the cheerfulness that is intimately acquainted with sorrow .
she did not seem surprised at seeing me .
" i have come to ask about mr. krebs , " i told her .
" oh , yes , " she said , " there 's been so many here this morning already .
it 's wonderful how people love him , all kinds of people .
no , sir , he do n't seem to be in any pain .
two gentlemen are up there now in his room , i mean . "
she wiped her arms , which still bore traces of <unk> , and then , with a gesture natural and <unk> , lifted the corner of her apron to her eyes .
" do you think i could see him  for a moment ? "
i asked .
" i 've known him for a long time . "
" why , i do n't know , " she said , " i guess so .
the doctor said he could see some , and he wants to see his friends .
that 's not strange  he always did .
i 'll ask .
<name> you tell me your name ? "
i took out a card .
she held it without glancing at it , and invited me in .
i waited , unnerved and feverish , pulsing , in the dark and narrow hall beside the flimsy rack where several coats and hats were <name> .
once before i had visited krebs in that <unk> in cambridge long ago with something of the same feelings .
but now they were greatly intensified .
now he was dying ... .
the woman was descending .
" he says he wants to see you , sir , " she said rather breathlessly , and i followed her .
in the semi-darkness of the stairs i passed the three men who had been with krebs , and when i reached the open door of his room he was alone .
i hesitated just a second , swept by the heat wave that follows sudden shyness , embarrassment , a sense of folly it is too late to avert .
krebs was propped up with pillows .
" well , this is good of you , " he said , and reached out his hand across the spread .
i took it , and sat down beside the shiny oak bedstead , in a chair covered with <unk> plush .
" you feel better ? "
i asked .
" oh , i feel all right , " he answered , with a smile .
" it 's queer , but i do . "
my eye fell upon the long line of <unk> <unk> that lined one side of the room .
" why , you 've got quite a library here , " i observed .
" yes , i 've managed to get together some good books .
but there is so much to read nowadays , so much that is really good and new , a man has the hopeless feeling he can never catch up with it all .
a thousand writers and students are making contributions today where fifty years ago there was one . "
" i 've been following your speeches , after a fashion ,  i wish i might have been able to read more of them .
your argument interested me .
it's new , unlike the ordinary <unk> of  " " of agitators , " he supplied , with a smile .
" of agitators , " i agreed , and tried to return his smile .
" an <unk> who appears to suggest the foundations of a constructive programme and who is n't afraid to criticise the man with a vote as well as the capitalist is an unusual phenomenon . "
" oh , when we realize that we 've only got a little time left in which to tell what we think to be the truth , it does n't require a great deal of courage , paret .
i did n't begin to see this thing until a little while ago .
i was only a crude , hot-headed <unk> .
god knows i 'm crude enough still .
but i began to have a glimmering of what all these new fellows in the universities are driving at . "
he waved his hand towards the <unk> .
" driving at collectively , i mean .
and there are attempts , worthy attempts , to <unk> and <unk> the sciences .
what i have been saying is not strictly original .
i took it on the stump , that 's all .
i did n't expect it to have much effect in this campaign , but it was an opportunity to sow a few seeds , to start a sense of personal dissatisfaction in the minds of a few voters .
what is it browning says ?
it 's in bishop <unk> , i believe .
'when the fight begins within himself , a man 's worth something . '
it 's an intellectual fight , of course . "
his words were spoken quietly , but i realized suddenly that the mysterious force which had drawn me to him now , against my <name> , was an intellectual rather than apparently sentimental one , an intellectual force seeming to <unk> within it all other human attractions .
and yet i felt a sudden contrition .
" see here , krebs , " i said , " i did n't come here to bother you about these matters , to tire you .
i must n't stay .
i 'll call in again to see how you are  from time to time . "
" but you 're not tiring me , " he protested , stretching forth a thin , <unk> hand .
" i do n't want to rot , i want to live and think as long as i can .
to tell you the truth , paret , i 've been wishing to talk to you  i 'm glad you came in . "
" you 've been wishing to talk to me ? "
i said .
" yes , but i did n't expect you 'd come in .
i <name> you wo n't mind my saying so , under the circumstances , but i 've always rather liked you , admired you , even back in the cambridge days .
after that i used to blame you for going out and taking what you wanted , and i had to live a good many years before i began to see that it 's better for a man to take what he wants than to take nothing at all .
i took what i wanted , every man worth his salt does .
there 's your great banker friend in new york whom i used to think was the <unk> .
he took what he wanted , and he took a good deal , but it happened to be good for him .
and by piling up his corporations , <unk> on <unk> , he is <unk> the way for a logical economic evolution .
how can a man in our time find out what he does want unless he takes something and gives it a trial ? "
" until he begins to feel that it <unk> with him , " i said .
" but then , " i added involuntarily , " then it may be too late to try something else , and he may not know what to try . "
this remark of mine might have surprised me had it not been for the feeling  now grown definite  that krebs had something to give me , something to pass on to me , of all men .
indeed , he had hinted as much , when he acknowledged a wish to talk to me .
" what seems so strange , " i said , as i looked at him lying back on his pillows , " is your <name> that we shall be able to bring order out of all this chaos  your belief in democracy . "
" democracy 's an adventure , " he replied , " the great adventure of mankind .
i think the trouble in many minds lies in the fact that they persist in regarding it as something to be made safe .
all that can be done is to try to make it as safe as possible .
but no adventure is safe  life itself is an adventure , and neither is that safe .
it 's a hazard , as you and i have found out .
the moment we try to make life safe we lose all there is in it worth while . "
i thought a moment .
" yes , that 's so , " i agreed .
on the table beside the bed in company with two or three other volumes , lay a bible .
he seemed to notice that my eye fell upon it .
" do you remember the story of the prodigal son ? "
he asked .
" well , that's the parable of democracy , of self-government in the individual and in society .
in order to arrive at salvation , paret , most of us have to take our journey into a far country . "
" a far country ! "
i exclaimed .
the words struck a reminiscent chord .
" we have to leave what seem the safe things , we have to wander and suffer in order to realize that the only true safety lies in development .
we have first to cast off the leading strings of authority .
it 's a delusion that we can insure ourselves by remaining within its walls  we have to risk our lives and our souls .
it is discouraging when we look around us to-day , and in a way the <unk> are right when they say we do n't see democracy .
we see only what may be called the first stage of it ; for democracy is still in a far country eating the husks of individualism , <unk> .
what we see is not true freedom , but freedom run to riot , men struggling for themselves , spending on themselves the fruits of their inheritance ; we see a government intent on one object alone  <unk> of this inheritance in order to achieve what it calls prosperity .
and god is far away . "
" and  we shall turn ? "
i asked .
" we shall turn or perish .
i believe that we shall turn . "
he fixed his eyes on my face .
" what is it , " he asked , " that brought you here to me , to-day ? "
i was silent .
" the motive , paret  the motive that sends us all wandering into is divine , is inherited from god himself .
and the same motive , after our eyes shall have been opened , after we shall have seen and known the tragedy and misery of life , after we shall have made the mistakes and committed the sins and experienced the emptiness  the same motive <name> lead us back again .
that , too , is an adventure , the greatest adventure of all .
because , when we go back we shall not find the same god  or rather we shall recognize him in ourselves .
<unk> is <unk> , knowledge is <unk> .
we went away cringing , superstitious , we saw everywhere omens and evidences of his wrath in the earth and sea and sky , we burned candles and sacrificed animals in the vain <name> of <unk> <unk> and other calamities .
but when we come back it <name> be with a knowledge of his ways , gained at a price ,  the price he , too , must have paid  and we shall be able to stand up and look him in the face , and all our childish superstitions and <unk> shall have been burned away . "
some <name> indeed had given him strength to renounce those things in life i had held dear , driven him on to fight until his exhausted body failed him , and even now that he was physically helpless sustained him .
i did not ask myself , then , the nature of this <name> .
in its presence it could no more be questioned than the light .
it was light ; i felt bathed in it .
now it was soft , suffused : but i remembered how the night before in the hall , just before he had fallen , it had flashed forth in a smile and illumined my soul with an ecstasy that yet was anguish ... . " we shall get back , " i said at length .
my remark was not a question  it had escaped from me almost unawares .
" the <name> is in the journey , " he answered .
" the secret is in the search . "
" but for me ? "
i exclaimed .
" we 've all been lost , paret .
it would seem as though we have to be . "
" and yet you are  saved , " i said , hesitating over the word .
" it is true that i am content , even happy , " he asserted , " in spite of my wish to live .
if there is any secret , it lies , i think , in the struggle for an open mind , in the keeping alive of a <name> to know more and more .
that <name> , strangely enough , has n't lost its strength .
we don't know whether there is a future life , but if there is , i think it must be a continuation of this . "
he paused .
" i told you i was glad you came in  i 've been thinking of you , and i saw you in the hall last night .
you ask what there is for you  i 'll tell you ,  the new generation . "
" the new generation . "
" that 's the task of every man and woman who wakes up .
i 've come to see how little can be done for the great majority of those who have reached our age .
it 's hard  but it 's true .
superstition , sentiment , the habit of wrong thinking or of not thinking at all have struck in too deep , the habit of unreasoning acceptance of authority is too paralyzing .
some may be stung back into life , spurred on to find out what the world really is , but not many .
the <name> lies in those who are coming after us  we must do for them what was n't done for us .
we really did n't have much of a chance , paret .
what did our instructors at harvard know about the age that was dawning ?
what did anybody know ?
you can educate yourself  or rather <unk> yourself .
all this "  and he waved his hand towards his <unk>  " all this has sprung up since you and i were at cambridge ; if we do n't try to become familiar with it , if we fail to grasp the point of view from which it 's written , there 's little <name> for us .
go away from all this and get straightened out , make yourself acquainted with the modern trend in literature and criticism , with modern history , find out what 's being done in the field of education , read the modern sciences , especially biology , and psychology and <unk> , and try to get a glimpse of the fundamental human needs underlying such phenomena as the labour and woman 's movements .
god knows i 've just begun to get my glimpse , and i 've floundered around ever since i left college ... .
i do n't mean to say we can ever see the whole , but we can get a clew , an idea , and pass it on to our children .
you have children , have n't you ? "
" yes , " i said ... .
he said nothing  he seemed to be looking out of the window .
" then the scientific point of view in your opinion has n't done away with religion ? "
i asked presently .
" the scientific point of view is the religious point of view , " he said earnestly , " because it 's the only self-respecting point of view .
i can't believe that god intended to make a creature who would not ultimately weigh his beliefs with his reason instead of accepting them blindly .
that 's immoral , if you like  especially in these days . "
" and are there , then , no <unk> ' ? "
i said , remembering the expression in something i had read .
" that seems to me a relic of the method of ancient science , which was upside down ,  a mere confusion with <name> .
<name> and belief are two different things ; <name> is the emotion , the steam , if you like , that drives us on in our search for truth .
theories , at a stretch , might be identified with <unk> ' but when it comes to confusing our theories with facts , instead of recognizing them as theories , when it comes to living by <unk> ' that have no basis in reason and observed facts ,  that is fatal .
it 's just the trouble with so much of our <unk> to-day  unreasoning acceptance without thought . "
" then , " i said , " you admit of no other faculty than reason ? "
" i confess that i do n't .
a great many <unk> that we seem to get from what we call intuition i think are due to the reason , which is unconsciously at work .
if there were another faculty that equalled or <unk> reason , it seems to me it would be a very dangerous thing for the world 's progress .
we 'd come to rely on it rather than on ourselves the trouble with the world is that it has been relying on it .
reason is the mind  it leaps to the stars without realizing always how it gets there .
it is through reason we get the self-reliance that <unk> us . "
" but you ! "
i exclaimed .
" you rely on something else besides reason ? "
" yes , it is true , " he explained gently , " but that thing <unk> we feel stirring in us is power , and that power , or the source of it , seems to have given us our reason for guidance  if it were not so we should n't have a semblance of freedom .
for there is neither virtue nor development in finding the path if we are guided .
we do rely on that power for movement  and in the moments when it is withdrawn we are helpless .
both the power and the reason are god 's . "
" but the church , " i was moved by some <unk> thought to ask , " you believe there is a future for the church ? "
" a church of all those who <unk> truth , <name> <unk> , serve humanity and <unk> <name> , " he replied  but as though he were speaking to himself , not to me ... . a few moments later there was a knock at the door , and the woman of the house entered to say that dr. <unk> had arrived .
i rose and shook krebs 's hand : sheer inability to express my emotion drove me to <unk> .
" i 'll come in soon again , if i may , " i told him .
" do , paret , " he said , " it 's done me good to talk to you  more good than you imagine . "
i was unable to answer him , but i glanced back from the doorway to see him smiling after me .
on my way down the stairs i bumped into the doctor as he ascended .
the dingy brown parlour was filled with men , standing in groups and talking in subdued voices .
i hurried into the street , and on the sidewalk stopped face to face with <name> blackwood .
" <name> ! "
he exclaimed .
" what are you doing here ? "
" i came to inquire for krebs , " i answered .
" i 've seen him . "
" you  you 've been talking to him ? "
<name> demanded .
i nodded .
he stared at me for a moment with an astonishment to which i was wholly indifferent .
he did not seem to know just how to act .
" well , it was decent of you , <name> , i must say .
how does he seem ? "
" not at all like  like what you 'd expect , in his manner . "
" no , " agreed <name> <unk> , " no , he would n't .
my god , we 've lost a big man in him . "
" i think we have , " i said .
he stared at me again , gave me his hand awkwardly , and went into the house .
it was not until i had walked the length of the block that i began to realize what a shock my presence there must have been to him , with his head full of the contrast between this visit and my former attitude .
could it be that it was only the night before i had made a speech against him and his associates ?
it is interesting that my mind rejected all sense of anomaly and inconsistency .
krebs possessed me ; i must have been in reality extremely agitated , but this sense of being possessed seemed a quiet one .
an amazing thing had happened  and yet i was not amazed .
the krebs i had seen was the man i had known for many years , the man i had ridiculed , despised and oppressed , but it seemed to me then that he had been my friend and intimate all my life : more than that , i had an odd feeling he had always been a part of me , and that now had begun to take place a <unk> of personality .
nor could i feel that he was a dying man .
he would live on ... .
i could not as yet sort and <unk> , reduce to order the possessions he had wished to turn over to me .
it was noon , and people were walking past me in the watery , diluted sunlight , men in black coats and top hats and women in bizarre , complicated costumes bright with colour .
i had reached the more respectable portion of the city , where the churches were emptying .
these very people , whom not long ago i would have acknowledged as my own kind , now seemed mildly animated <unk> , wax figures .
the day was like hundreds of sundays i had known , the city familiar , yet passing strange .
i walked like a ghost through it ... . xxvi .
accompanied by young dr. strafford , i went to california .
my physical illness had been brief .
dr. <name> had taken matters in his own hands and ordered an absolute rest , after dwelling at some length on the vicious pace set by modern business and the lack of consideration and knowledge shown by men of affairs for their bodies .
there was a limit to the <unk> and strain which the human organism could stand .
he must of course have suspected the presence of disturbing and <unk> factors , but he confined himself to telling me that only an exceptional constitution had saved me from a serious illness ; he must in a way have comprehended why i did not wish to go abroad , and have my family join me on the <unk> , as <name> peters proposed .
california had been my choice , and dr. <name> recommended the climate of <name> <name> .
high up on the <unk> hills i found a villa beside the gateway of one of the deep canons that furrow the mountain side , and day after day i lay in a chair on the <name> terrace , with a continually recurring amazement at the brilliancy of my surroundings .
in the early morning i looked down on a feathery mist hiding the world , a mist presently to be shot with silver and <unk> , dissolved by slow enchantment until there lay revealed the plain and the shimmering ocean with its distant islands trembling in the haze .
at sunset my eyes sought the mountains , mountains unreal , like glorified scenery of grand opera , with <name> shadows in the wooded canon <unk> , and crags of pink <unk> and <name> against the skies .
all day long in the tempered heat flowers blazed around me , insects hummed , lizards darted in and out of the terrace wall , birds flashed among the checkered shadows of the live oaks .
that grove of gnarled oaks summoned up before me visions of some classic villa poised above grecian seas , shining amidst dark foliage , the refuge of forgotten kings .
below me , on the slope , the <unk> orange trees were heavy with golden fruit .
after a while , as i grew stronger , i was driven down and allowed to walk on the wide beach that stretched in front of the <name> houses facing the sea .
<unk> dived under the long rollers that came crashing in from the pacific ; gulls wheeled and screamed in the soft wind ; alert little birds darted here and there with incredible swiftness , leaving <name> footprints across the ribs and furrows of the wet sand .
far to the southward a dark barrier of mountains rose out of the sea .
sometimes i sat with my back against the <unk> watching the drag of the <unk> water rolling the pebbles after it , making a gleaming floor for the light to dance .
at first i could not bear to recall the events that had preceded and followed my visit to krebs that <name> morning .
my illness had begun that night ; on the monday <name> peters had come to the club and insisted upon my being taken to his house ... .
when i had recovered sufficiently there had been rather a pathetic renewal of our friendship .
<name> came to see me .
their attitude was one of apprehension not unmixed with wonder ; and though they , knew of the existence of a mental crisis , suspected , in all probability , some of the causes of it , they refrained carefully from all comments , contenting themselves with telling me when i was well enough that krebs had died quite suddenly that <name> afternoon ; that his death  occurring at such a crucial moment  had been sufficient to turn the tide of the election and make <name> greenhalge mayor .
thousands who had failed to understand hermann krebs , but whom he had nevertheless stirred and troubled , suddenly awoke to the fact that he had had elements of greatness ... . my feelings in those first days at <name> <name> may be likened , indeed , to those of a man who has passed through a terrible accident that has deprived him of sight or hearing , and which he wishes to forget .
what i was most conscious of then was an aching sense of loss  an ache that by degrees became a throbbing pain as life flowed back into me , <unk> once more my being with protest and passion , arousing me to revolt against the fate that had overtaken me .
i even began at moments to feel a fierce <name> to go back and take up again the fight from which i had been so strangely removed  removed by the agency of things still obscure .
i might get <name> yet , beat down her resistance , overcome her , if only i could be near her and see her .
but even in the midst of these surges of passion i was conscious of the birth of a new force i did not understand , and which i resented , that had arisen to give battle to my passions and desires .
this struggle was not mentally reflected as a debate between right and wrong , as to whether i should or should not be justified in taking <name> if i could get her : it seemed as though some new and small yet dogged intruder had forced an entrance into me , an insignificant <unk> who did not hesitate to bar the pathway of the reviving giant of my desires .
these contests <unk> my strength .
it seemed as though in my isolation i loved <name> , i missed her more than ever , and the flavour she gave to life .
then hermann krebs began to press himself on me .
i use the word as expressive of those early resentful feelings ,  i rather pictured him then as the <unk> of an hostile element in the universe that had brought about my miseries and accomplished my downfall ; i attributed the disagreeable <unk> of my impulses to his agency ; i did not wish to think of him , for he stood somehow for a vague future i feared to contemplate .
yet the illusion of his presence , once begun , continued to grow upon me , and i find myself utterly unable to describe that struggle in which he seemed to be fighting as against myself for my confidence ; that process whereby he gradually grew as real to me as though he still lived  until i could almost hear his voice and see his smile .
at moments i resisted wildly , as though my survival depended on it ; at other moments he seemed to bring me peace .
one day i recalled as vividly as though it were taking place again that last time i had been with him ; i seemed once more to be listening to the calm yet <name> talk ranging over so many topics , politics and government , economics and science and religion .
i did not yet grasp the <unk> he had made of them all , but i saw them now all focussed in him elements he had drawn from human lives and human experiences .
i think it was then i first felt the <unk> of a new life to be born in <unk> and pain ... . wearied , yet exalted , i sank down on a stone bench and gazed out at the little island of <name> <name> afloat on the shimmering sea .
i have mentioned my inability to <unk> the terrible struggle that went on in my soul .
it seems strange that <unk>  that most ruthless of philosophers to the romantic mind !  should express it for me .
" the genius of the heart , from contact with which every man goes away richer , not <unk> ' and overcome , ... but richer himself , fresher to himself than before , opened up , breathed upon and sounded by a thawing wind ; more uncertain , perhaps , more delicate , more bruised ; but full of hopes which as yet lack names , full of a new <name> and striving , full of a new unwillingness and counterstriving . " ...
such was my experience with hermann krebs .
how keenly i remember that new unwillingness and <unk> !
in spite of the years it has not wholly died down , even to-day ... .
almost coincident with these <unk> of which i have spoken was the consciousness of a hunger stronger than the craving for bread and meat , and i began to meditate on my ignorance , on the utter inadequacy and <unk> of my early education , on my neglect of the new learning during the years that had passed since i left harvard .
and i remembered krebs 's words  that we must " <unk> ourselves . "
what did i know ?
a system of law , inherited from another social order , that was utterly unable to cope with the <unk> and miseries and <unk> of a modern industrial world .
i had spent my days in <unk> an inadequate and archaic code  why ?
in order that i might learn how to evade it ?
this in itself condemned it .
what did i know of life ?
of the shining universe that surrounded me ?
what did i know of the insect and the flower , of the laws that moved the planets and made incandescent the suns ?
of the human body , of the human soul and its instincts ?
was this knowledge acquired at such cost of labour and life and love by my fellow-men of so little worth to me that i could ignore it ?
declare that it had no significance for me ?
no bearing on my life and conduct ?
if i were to rise and go forward  and i now felt something like a continued impulse , in spite of <unk> and <unk>  i must master this knowledge , it must be my guide , form the basis of my creed .
i  who never had had a creed , never felt the need of one !
for lack of one i had been rudely jolted out of the frail shell i had thought so secure , and stood , as it were , naked and shivering to the storms , staring at a world that was no function of me , after all .
my problem , indeed , was how to become a function of it ... .
i resolved upon a course of reading , but it was a question what books to get .
krebs could have told me , if he had lived .
i even thought once of writing <name> blackwood to ask him to make a list of the volumes in krebs 's little library ; but i was ashamed to do this .
dr. strafford still remained with me .
not many years out of the medical school , he had inspired me with a liking for him and a respect for his profession , and when he informed me one day that he could no longer conscientiously accept the sum i was paying him , i begged him to stay on .
he was a big and wholesome young man , companionable , yet quiet and unobtrusive , watchful without appearing to be so , with the innate as well as the cultivated knowledge of psychology characteristic of the best modern physicians .
when i grew better i came to feel that he had given his whole mind to the study of my case , though he never betrayed it in his conversation .
" strafford , " i said to him one morning with such an air of unconcern as i could muster , " i 've an idea i 'd like to read a little science .
could you recommend a work on biology ? "
i chose biology because i thought he would know something about it .
" popular biology , mr .
paret ? "
" well , not too popular , " i smiled .
" i think it would do me good to use my mind , to chew on something .
besides , you can help me over the tough places . "
he returned that afternoon with two books .
" i 've been rather fortunate in getting these , " he said .
" one is fairly elementary .
they had it at the library .
and the other  " he paused delicately , " i did n't know whether you might be interested in the latest speculations on the subject . "
" speculations ? "
i repeated .
" well , the philosophy of it . "
he almost achieved a blush under his tan .
he held out the second book on the philosophy of the organism .
" it's the work of a <name> scientist who stands rather high .
i read it last <name> , and it interested me .
i got it from a clergyman i know who is spending the <name> in <name> <name> . "
" a clergyman ! "
strafford laughed .
" an <unk> ' clergyman , " he explained .
" oh , a lot of them are reading science now .
i think it 's pretty decent of them . "
i looked at strafford , who towered six feet three , and it suddenly struck me that he might be one of the <unk> of a type our universities were about to turn out .
i wondered what he believed .
of one thing i was sure , that he was not in the medical profession to make money .
that was a <name> in itself .
i began with the elementary work .
" you 'd better borrow a century dictionary , " i said .
" that 's easy , " he said , and actually achieved it , with the <unk> aid .
the absorption in which i fought my way through those books may prove interesting to future generations , who , at sunday-school age , when the fable of <name> and <name> was painfully being drummed into me ( without any mention of its application ) , <name> be learning to think straight , acquiring easily in early youth what i failed to learn until after forty .
and think of all the trouble and tragedy that <name> have been averted .
it is true that i had read some biology at cambridge , which i had promptly forgotten ; it had not been especially emphasized by my instructors as related to life  certainly not as related to religion : such incidents as that of <name> and <name> occupied the religious field exclusively .
i had been compelled to commit to memory , temporarily , the matter in those books ; but what i now began to perceive was that the matter was secondary compared to the view point of science  and this had been utterly neglected .
as i read , i experienced all the excitement of an old-fashioned romance , but of a romance of such significance as to touch the very springs of existence ; and above all i was impressed with the integrity of the scientific method  an integrity commensurate with the dignity of man  that scorned to quibble to make out a case , to affirm something that could not be proved .
little by little i became familiar with the principles of embryonic evolution , <unk> , and of <unk> evolution , <unk> ; realized , for the first time , my own history and that of the ancestors from whom i had developed and descended .
i , this marvellously complicated being , torn by desires and <unk> , was the result of the union of two microscopic cells .
" all living things come from the egg , " such had been <name> 's <unk> .
the result was like the tonic of a cold <unk> .
i began to feel cleansed and purified , as though something <unk> which all my life had clung to me had been washed away .
yet a question arose , an insistent question that forever presses itself on the mind of man ; how could these apparently chemical and mechanical processes , which the author of the book contented himself with recording , account for me ?
the <unk> darts for the egg , and <unk> it ; personal history begins .
but what mysterious shaping force is it that repeats in the individual the history of the race , <unk> the orderly division of the cells , by degrees <unk> the symmetry , sets aside the skeleton and digestive tract and <unk> the structure ?
i took up the second book , that on the philosophy of the organism , to read in its preface that a <unk> british nobleman had established a foundation of lectures in a scotch university for <unk> the study of a natural theology .
the term possessed me .
unlike the old theology woven of <unk> and a fanciful philosophy of the <unk> period of greece , natural theology was founded on science itself , and scientists were among those who sought to develop it .
here was a <unk> that made a powerful appeal , one of the many signs and <unk> of a new <name> of which i was dimly becoming cognizant ; and now that i looked for signs , i found them everywhere , in my young doctor , in krebs , in references in the texts ; indications of a new order beginning to make itself felt in a muddled , chaotic human world , which might  which must have a parallel with the order that revealed itself in the egg !
might not both , physical and social , be due to the influence of the same invisible , experimenting , creating hand ?
my thoughts lingered lovingly on this theology so well named " natural , " on its <unk> , its refusal to affirm what it did not prove , on its lack of <unk> <unk> and infallible revelations ; yet it gave me the vision of a new sanction whereby man might order his life , a sanction from which was eliminated fear and superstition and romantic <name> , a sanction whose doctrines  unlike those of the sentimental theology  did not fly in the face of human instincts and needs .
nor was it a theology devoid of inspiration and poetry , though poetry might be called its complement .
with all that was beautiful and true in the <unk> dear to mankind it did not conflict , <unk> only the vicious <unk> of literal interpretation .
in this connection i remembered something that krebs had said  in our talk about poetry and <name> ,  that these were emotion , religion expressed by the tools reason had evolved .
music , he had declared , came nearest to the cry of the human soul ... . that theology cleared for <name> an open road , made of <name> a reasonable thing , yet did not <name> it of a sense of high adventure ; cleansed it of the <unk> of thrift and selfish concern .
in this <unk> of <unk> there might be a future , yes , an individual future , yet it was far from the <unk> <name> of salvation .
here was a <name> conferred by the freedom of truth ; a <name> that lost and regained itself in life ; it was dynamic in its operation ; for , as <unk> said , the searching after truth , and not its possession , gives happiness to man .
in the words of an american scientist , taken from his book on heredity , " the <unk> idea has forced man to consider the probable future of his own race on earth and to take measures to control that future , a matter he had previously left largely to fate . "
here indeed was another sign of the times , to find in a strictly scientific work a sentence truly religious !
as i continued to read these works , i found them suffused with religion , religion of a kind and quality i had not imagined .
the birthright of the spirit of man was freedom , freedom to experiment , to determine , to create  to create himself , to create society in the image of god !
spiritual creation the function of <unk> man through the coming ages , the task that was to make him divine .
here indeed was the germ of a new sanction , of a new motive , of a new religion that strangely <unk> with the <unk> of the old  once the dynamic power of these was revealed .
i had been thinking of my family  of my family in terms of <name>  and yet with a growing yearning that embraced them all .
i had not informed <name> of my illness , and i had managed to warn <name> peters not to do so .
i had simply written her that after the campaign i had gone for a rest to california ; yet in her letters to me , after this information had reached her , i detected a restrained anxiety and affection that troubled me .
<unk> of words curiously convey meanings and <unk> that <unk> their literal sense , true thoughts and feelings are difficult to disguise even in written speech .
could it be possible after all that had happened that <name> still loved me ?
i continually put the thought away from me , but continually it returned to haunt me .
suppose <name> could not help loving me , in spite of my weaknesses and faults , even as i loved <name> in spite of hers ?
love is no logical thing .
it was <name> i wanted , <name> of whom i thought , and trivial , long-forgotten incidents of the past kept recurring to me constantly .
i still received his weekly letters ; but he did not ask why , since i had taken a vacation , i had not come over to them .
he represented the medium , the link between <name> and me that no <unk> , no separation could break .
all this new vision of mine was for him , for the coming generation , the soil in which it must be sown , the americans of the future .
and who so well as <name> , sensitive yet brave , would respond to it ?
i wished not only to give him what i had begun to grasp , to study with him , to be his companion and friend , but to spare him , if possible , some of my own mistakes and sufferings and punishments .
but could i go back ?
happy coincidences of desires and convictions had been so characteristic of that other self i had been struggling to cast off : i had so easily been persuaded , when i had had a chance of getting <name> , that it was the right thing to do !
and now , in my loneliness , was i not growing just as eager to be convinced that it was my duty to go back to the family which in the hour of <unk> i had cast off ?
i had believed in divorce then  why not now ?
well , i still believed in it .
i had thought of a union with <name> as something that would bring about the " self-realization that springs from the gratification of a great passion , "  an appealing phrase i had read somewhere .
but , it was at least a favourable symptom that i was willing now to confess that the " self-realization " had been a secondary and sentimental consideration , a <name> , <unk> halo to give a moral and religious sanction to my <name> .
was i not trying to do that very thing now ?
it tortured me to think so ; i strove to achieve a detached consideration of the problem ,  to arrive at length at a thought that seemed illuminating : that the it " <unk> " or " <unk> , " utility and happiness of all such unions depend upon whether or not they become a part of the <unk> and warp of the social fabric ; in other words , whether the gratification of any particular love by divorce and <unk> does or does not tend to destroy a portion of that fabric .
<name> certainly would have been justified in divorce .
it did not seem in the retrospect that i would have been : surely not if , after i had married <name> , i had developed this view of life that seemed to me to be the true view .
i should have been powerless to act upon it .
but the chances were i should not have developed it , since it would seem that any salvation for me at least must come precisely through suffering , through not getting what i wanted .
was this <unk> ?
my mistake had been in marrying <name> instead of <name>  a mistake largely due to my <unk> with a false idea of life .
would not the attempt to cut loose from the consequences of that mistake in my individual case have been futile ?
but there was a remedy for it  the remedy krebs had suggested : i might still prevent my children from making such a mistake , i might help to create in them what i might have been , and thus find a solution for myself .
my errors would then assume a value .
but the question tortured me : would <name> wish it ?
would it be fair to her if she did not ?
by my long neglect i had forfeited the right to go .
and would she agree with my point of view if she did permit me to stay ?
i had less concern on this score , a feeling that that development of hers , which once had irritated me , was in the same direction as my own ... .
i have still strangely to record moments when , in spite of the aspirations i had achieved , of the <unk> vision i had gained , at the thought of returning to her i revolted .
at such times recollections came into my mind of those characteristics in her that had seemed most responsible for my <unk> ... . that demon i had fed so mightily still lived .
by what right  he seemed to ask  had i nourished him all these years if now i meant to starve him ?
thus sometimes he defied me , took on <unk> <unk> , blustered , <unk> , <unk> , managed to make me believe that to starve him would be to starve myself , to sap all there was of power in me .
let me try and see if i could do it !
again he whispered , to what purpose had i gained my <name> , if now i renounced it ?
i could not live in fetters , even though the fetters should be <unk> .
i was lonely now , but i would get over that , and life lay before me still .
fierce and tenacious , steel in the cruelty of his desires , fearful in the havoc he had wrought , could he be subdued ?
<unk> , he tore and rent me ... . one morning i rode up through the shady canon , fragrant with bay , to the open slopes stained <unk> by the wild lilac , where the twisted <unk> grows .
as i sat gazing down on <name> headlands jutting out into a vast ocean my paralyzing indecision came to an end .
i turned my horse down the trail again .
i had seen at last that life was bigger than i , bigger than <name> , bigger than our individual wishes and desires .
i felt as though heavy shackles had been struck from me .
as i neared the house i spied my young doctor in the garden path , his hands in his pockets watching a humming-bird poised over the poppies .
he greeted me with a look that was not wholly surprise at my early return , that seemed to have in it something of gladness .
" strafford , " i said , " i 've made up my mind to go to europe . "
" i have been thinking for some time , mr. paret , " he replied , " that a <unk> is just what you need to set you on your feet . "
i started eastward the next morning , arriving in new york in time to catch one of the big liners sailing for havre .
on my way across the continent i decided to send a cable to <name> at <name> , since it were only fair to give her an opportunity to reflect upon the manner in which she would meet the situation .
save for an impatience which at moments i restrained with difficulty , the moods that succeeded one another as i journeyed did not differ greatly from those i had experienced in the past month .
i was alternately exalted and depressed ; i hoped and doubted and feared ; my courage , my confidence rose and fell .
and yet i was aware of the <unk> within me of an element that gave me a stability i had hitherto lacked : i had made my decision , and i felt the stronger for it .
it was early in march .
the annual rush of my countrymen and women for foreign shores had not as yet begun , the huge steamer was far from crowded .
the faint throbbing of her engines as she glided out on the north river tide found its <name> within me as i leaned on the heavy rail and watched the towers of the city receding in the mist ; they became blurred and <unk> , fantastic in the grey distance , sad , appealing with a strange beauty and power .
once the sight of them , sunlit , standing forth sharply against the high blue of american skies , had stirred in me that passion for wealth and power of which they were so marvellously and <unk> the embodiment .
i recalled the bright day of my home-coming with <name> , when she too had felt that passion drawing me away from her , after the briefest of possessions ... . well , i had had it , the power .
i had stormed and gained entrance to the citadel itself .
i might have lived here in new york , secure , defiant of a <unk> public opinion that envied while it strove to sting .
why was i flinging it all away ?
was this a sudden resolution of mine , forced by events , precipitated by a failure to achieve what of all things on earth i had most desired ?
or was it the inevitable result of the development of the <name> paret of earlier days , who was not meant for that kind of power ?
the vibration of the monster ship increased to a strong , electric <unk> , the water hummed along her sides , she felt the swell of the open sea .
a fine rain began to fall that hid the land  yes , and the life i was leaving .
i made my way across the glistening deck to the saloon where , my newspapers and periodicals neglected , i sat all the morning beside a window gazing out at the limited , <unk> zone of waters around the ship .
we were headed for the old world .
the wind rose , the rain became pelting , mingling with the <unk> of the <unk> racing madly past : within were warmth and luxury , electric lights , open fires , easy chairs , and men and women reading , conversing as unconcernedly as though the perils of the deep had ceased to be .
in all this i found an impelling interest ; the naive capacity in me for wonder , so long dormant , had been marvellously opened up once more .
i no longer thought of myself as the important man of affairs ; and when in the progress of the voyage i was accosted by two or three men i had met and by others who had heard of me it was only to feel amazement at the remoteness i now felt from a world whose realities were stocks and bonds , railroads and corporations and the detested new politics so <unk> to the smooth conduct of " business . "
it all sounded like a language i had forgotten .
it was not until near the end of the passage that we ran out of the storm .
a morning came when i went on deck to survey spaces of a blue and white sea swept by the white march sunlight ; to discern at length against the horizon toward which we sped a cloud of the <unk> and most delicate texture and design .
suddenly i divined that the cloud was <name> !
little by little , as i watched , it took on substance .
i made out headlands and cliffs , and then we were coasting beside them .
that night i should be in <name> with <name> .
my bag was packed , my steamer trunk closed .
i strayed about the decks , in and out of the saloons , wondering at the indifference of other passengers who sat reading in <unk> or wrote last letters to be posted at havre .
i was filled with impatience , anticipation , yes , with anxiety concerning the adventure that was now so imminent ; with wavering doubts .
had i done the wisest thing after all ?
i had the familiar experience that often comes just before reunion after absence of recalling intimate and forgotten impressions of those whom i was about to see again the tones of their voices , little gestures ... . how would they receive me ?
the great ship had slowed down and was entering the harbour , carefully threading her way amongst smaller craft , the passengers lining the rails and gazing at the animated scene , at the quaint and cheerful french city bathed in sunlight ... .
i had reached the dock and was making my way through the hurrying and shifting groups toward the steamer train when i saw <name> .
she was standing a little aside , scanning the faces that passed her .
i remember how she looked at me , expectantly , yet timidly , almost fearfully .
i kissed her .
" you 've come to meet me ! "
i exclaimed stupidly .
" how are the children ? "
" they 're very well , <name> .
they wanted to come , too , but i thought it better not . "
her restraint struck me as extraordinary ; and while i was thankful for the relief it brought to a situation which might have been awkward , i was conscious of resenting it a little .
i was impressed and puzzled .
as i walked along the platform beside her she seemed almost a stranger : i had difficulty in realizing that she was my wife , the mother of my children .
her eyes were clear , more serious than i recalled them , and her physical as well as her moral tone seemed to have improved .
her cheeks glowed with health , and she wore a becoming suit of dark blue .
" did you have a good trip , <name> ? "
she asked .
" splendid , " i said , forgetting the storm .
we took our seats in an empty compartment .
was she glad to see me ?
she had come all the way from <name> to meet me !
all the embarrassment seemed to be on my side .
was this composure a controlled one or had she indeed attained to the <unk> her manner and presence implied ?
such were the questions running through my head .
" you 've really liked <name> ? "
i asked .
" yes , <name> , and it 's been very good for us all .
of course the boys like <name> better , but they 've learned many things they would n't have learned at home ; they both speak french , and biddy too .
even i have improved . "
" i 'm sure of it , " i said .
she flushed .
" and what else have you been doing ? "
" oh , going to galleries .
<name> often goes with me .
i think he quite appreciates the pictures .
sometimes i take him to the theatre , too , the <unk> .
both boys ride in the bois with a riding master .
it 's been rather a restricted life for them , but it wo n't have hurt them .
it's good discipline .
we have little excursions in an automobile on fine days to versailles and other places of interest around <name> , and <name> and i have learned a lot of history .
i have a professor of literature from the <unk> come in three times a week to give me lessons . "
" i did n't know you cared for literature . "
" i did n't know it either . "
she smiled .
" <name> loves it .
monsieur <unk> declares he has quite a gift for language . "
<name> had already begun <name> 's education !
" you see a few people ? "
i inquired .
" a few .
and they have been very kind to us .
the <unk> , whom i met at <unk> , and some of their friends , mostly educated french people . "
the little railway carriage in which we sat rocked with speed as we flew through the french landscape .
i caught glimpses of solid , <name> farm buildings , of towers and keeps and delicate <unk> , and quaint towns ; of bare <unk> swaying before the march gusts , of green fields ablaze in the afternoon sun .
i took it all in <unk> .
here was <name> beside me , but a <name> i had difficulty in recognizing , whom i did not understand : who talked of a life she had built up for herself and that seemed to satisfy her ; one with which i had nothing to do .
i could not tell how she regarded my <unk> .
as she continued to talk , a feeling that was almost desperation grew upon me .
i had things to say to her , things that every moment of this sort of intercourse was making more difficult .
and i felt , if i did not say them now , that perhaps i never should : that now or never was the appropriate time , and to delay would be to drift into an impossible situation wherein the chance of an understanding would be remote .
there was a pause .
how little i had anticipated the courage it would take to do this thing !
my blood was hammering .
" <name> , " i said abruptly , " i suppose you 're wondering why i came over here . "
she sat gazing at me , very still , but there came into her eyes a frightened look that almost unnerved me .
she seemed to wish to speak , to be unable to .
passively , she let my hand rest on hers .
" i 've been thinking a great deal during the last few months , " i went on unsteadily .
" and i 've changed a good many of my ideas  that is , i 've got new ones , about things i never thought of before .
i want to say , first , that i do not put forth any claim to come back into your life .
i know i have forfeited any claim .
i 've neglected you , and i 've neglected the children .
our marriage has been on a false basis from the start , and i 've been to blame for it .
there is more to be said about the chances for a successful marriage in these days , but i 'm not going to dwell on that now , or attempt to shoulder off my shortcomings on my bringing up , on the civilization in which we have lived .
you 've tried to do your share , and the failure has n't been your fault .
i want to tell you first of all that i recognize your right to live your life from now on , independently of me , if you so <name> .
you ought to have the children  " i hesitated a moment .
it was the hardest thing i had to say .
" i 've never troubled myself about them , i 've never taken on any responsibility in regard to their bringing up . "
" <name> ! "
she cried .
" wait  i 've got more to tell you , that you ought to know .
i shouldn't be here to-day if <name> durrett had consented to  to get a divorce and marry me .
we had agreed to that when this accident happened to ham , and she went back to him .
i have to tell you that i still love her  i can't say how much , or define my feelings toward her now .
i 've given up all idea of her .
i do n't think i 'd marry her now , even if i had the chance , and you should decide to live away from me .
i do n't know .
i 'm not so sure of myself as i once was .
the fact is , <name> , circumstances have been too much for me .
i 've been beaten .
and i 'm not at all certain that it was n't a cowardly thing for me to come back to you at all . "
i felt her hand trembling under mine , but i had not the courage to look at her .
i heard her call my name again a little cry , the very <unk> of pity and distress .
it almost unnerved me .
" i knew that you loved her , <name> , " she said .
" it was only  only a little while after you married me that i found it out .
i guessed it  women do guess such things  long before you realized it yourself .
you ought to have married her instead of me .
you would have been happier with her . "
i did not answer .
" i , too , have thought a great deal , " she went on , after a moment .
" i began earlier than you , i had to . "
i looked up suddenly and saw her smiling at me , faintly , through her tears .
" but i 've been thinking more , and learning more since i 've been over here .
i 've come to see that that our failure has n't been as much your fault as i once thought , as much as you yourself declare .
you have done me a wrong , and you 've done the children a wrong .
oh , it is frightful to think how little i knew when i married you , but even then i felt instinctively that you did n't love me as i deserved to be loved .
and when we came back from europe i knew that i could n't satisfy you , i could n't look upon life as you saw it , no matter how hard i tried .
i did try , but it was n't any use .
you 'll never know how much i 've suffered all these years .
" i have been happier here , away from you , with the children ; i 've had a chance to be myself .
it is n't that i 'm  much .
it is n't that i do n't need guidance and counsel and  sympathy .
i 've missed those , but you 've never given them to me , and i 've been learning more and more to do without them .
i do n't know why marriage should suddenly have become such a mockery and failure in our time , but i know that it is , that ours hasn't been such an exception as i once thought .
i 've come to believe that divorce is often justified . "
" it is justified so far as you are concerned , <name> , " i replied .
" it is not justified for me .
i have forfeited , as i say , any rights over you .
i have been the aggressor and <unk> from the start .
you have been a good wife and a good mother , you have been faithful , i have had absolutely nothing to complain of . "
" sometimes i think i might have tried harder , " she said .
" at least i might have understood better .
i was stupid .
but everything went wrong .
and i saw you growing away from me all the time , <name> , growing away from the friends who were fond of you , as though you were fading in the distance .
it was n't wholly because  because of <name> that i left you .
that gave me an excuse  an excuse for myself .
long before that i realized my helplessness , i knew that whatever i might have done was past doing . "
" yes , i know , " i assented .
we sat in silence for a while .
the train was skirting an ancient town set on a hill , crowned with a castle and a gothic church whose windows were afire in the setting sun .
" <name> , " i said , " i have not come to plead , to appeal to your pity as against your judgment and reason .
i can say this much , that if i do not love you , as the word is generally understood , i have a new respect for you , and a new affection , and i think that these <name> grow .
i have no doubt that there are some fortunate people who achieve the kind of mutual love for which it is human to yearn , whose passion is naturally <unk> into a feeling that may be even finer , but i am inclined to think , even in such a case , that some effort and unselfishness are necessary .
at any rate , that has been denied to us , and we can never know it from our own experience .
we can only <name> that there is such a thing ,  yes , and believe in it and work for it . "
" work for it , <name> ? "
she repeated .
" for others  for our children .
i have been thinking about the children a great deal in the last few months especially about <name> . "
" you always loved him best , " she said .
" yes , " i admitted .
" i do n't know why it should be so .
and in spite of it , i have neglected him , neglected them , failed to appreciate them all .
i did not deserve them .
i have reproached myself , i have suffered for it , not as much as i deserved .
i came to realize that the children were a bond between us , that their existence meant something greater than either of us .
but at the same time i recognized that i had lost my right over them , that it was you who had proved yourself worthy ... .
it was through the children that i came to think differently , to feel differently toward you .
i have come to you to ask your forgiveness . "
" oh , <name> ! "
she cried .
" wait , " i said ... . " i have come to you , through them .
i want to say again that i should not be here if i had obtained my desires .
yet there is more to it than that .
i think i have reached a stage where i am able to say that i am glad i did n't obtain them .
i see now that this coming to you was something i have wanted to do all along , but it was the cowardly thing to do , after i had failed , for it was not as though i had conquered the desires , the desires conquered me .
at any rate , i couldn't come to you to <unk> you , to be a drag upon you .
i felt that i must have something to offer you .
i 've got a plan , <name> , for my life , for our lives .
i do n't know whether i can make a success of it , and you are entitled to decline to take the risk .
i do n't fool myself that it <name> be all plain sailing , that there wo n't be difficulties and <unk> .
but i 'll promise to try . "
" what is it ? "
she asked , in a low voice .
" i  i think i know . "
" perhaps you have guessed it .
i am willing to try to devote what is left of my life to you and to them .
and i need your help .
i acknowledge it .

" the life we have missed ! "
she said .
" yes .
my mistakes , my failures , have brought us to the edge of a precipice .
we must prevent , if we can , those mistakes and failures for them .
the remedy for unhappy marriages , for all mistaken , selfish and artificial relationships in life is a <unk> one .
my plan is that we try to educate ourselves together , take advantage of the <unk> knowledge that is helping men and women to cope with the problems , to think straight .
we can then teach our children to think straight , to avoid the pitfalls into which we have fallen . "
i paused .
<name> did not reply .
her face was turned away from me , towards the red glow of the setting sun above the hills .
" you have been doing this all along , you have had the vision , the true vision , while i lacked it , <name> .
i offer to help you .
but if you think it is impossible for us to live together , if you believe my feeling toward you is not enough , if you do n't think i can do what i propose , or if you have ceased to care for me  " she turned to me with a swift movement , her eyes filled with tears .
" oh , <name> , do n't say any more .
i ca n't stand it .
how little you know , for all your thinking .
i love you , i always have loved you .
i grew to be ashamed of it , but i 'm not any longer .
i have n't any pride any more , and i never want to have it again . "
" you 're willing to take me as i am ,  to try ? "
i said .
" yes , " she answered , " i 'm willing to try . "
she smiled at me .
" and i have more <name> than you , <name> .
i think we 'll succeed . " ... .
at nine o'clock that night , when we came out through the gates of the big , noisy station , the children were awaiting us .
they had changed , they had grown .
biddy kissed me shyly , and stood staring up at me .
" we 'll take you out to-morrow and show you how we can ride , " said moreton .
<name> smiled .
he stood very close to me , with his hand through my arm .
" you 're going to stay , father ? "
he asked .
" i 'm going to stay , <name> , " i answered , " until we all go back to <name> . " ... .

what 's in heredity honora leffingwell is the original name of our heroine .
she was born in the last quarter of the nineteenth century , at nice , in <name> , and she spent the early years of her life in st. <name> , a somewhat conservative old city on the banks of the mississippi river .
her father was <name> leffingwell , and he died in the early flower of his manhood , while filling with a <name> that many remember the post of united states consul at nice .
as a <unk> he was a phenomenon , and his photograph in the tortoise-shell frame proves indubitably , to anyone acquainted with the fashions of 1870 , that he was a master of that <unk> of all arts , dress .
he had gentle blood in his veins , which came from <name> through kentucky in a coach and six , and he was the equal in appearance and manners of any duke who lingered beside classic seas .
honora has often pictured to herself a <name> villa set high above the curving shore , the <unk> depths shading into <name> , laced with milk-white foam , the vivid colours of the town , the <name> costumes ; the excursions , the <unk> presided over by the immaculate young consul in three languages , and the guests chosen from the <unk> <unk> of europe .
such was the vision in her youthful mind , added to by degrees as she grew into <unk> and surreptitiously became familiar with the writings of <name> and the duchess , and other literature of an <unk> cosmopolitan nature .
honora 's biography should undoubtedly contain a sketch of mrs. <name> leffingwell .
beauty and dash and a knowledge of how to seat a table seem to have been the <name> 's chief characteristics ; the only daughter of a carefully dressed and carefully , preserved widower , likewise a <unk> ,  whose <unk> tastes and the limited straits to which he , the remaining <unk> of an old southern family , had been reduced by a gentlemanly contempt for money , led him 'to choose <name> rather than new york as a place of residence .
one of the occasional and carefully planned trips to the <unk> proved fatal to the beautiful but reckless <name> <name> .
she , who might have chosen counts or dukes from the <unk> to the danube , or even crossed the channel ; took the dashing but <unk> american consul , with a <name> in his future that was sublime .
without going over too carefully the upward path which led to the post of their country 's representative at the court of st. <name> , neither had the slightest doubt that <name> leffingwell would tread it .
it is needless to dwell upon the chagrin of honora 's maternal grandfather , <name> <name> <unk> , over this turn of affairs , this unexpected <unk> , as he spoke of it in private to his friends in his parisian club .
for many years he had watched the personal attractions of his daughter grow , and a brougham and certain other delights not to be mentioned had gradually become , in his mind , synonymous with old age .
the brougham would have on its panels the <name> crest , and his distinguished ( and titled ) son-in-law would drop in occasionally at the little apartment on the boulevard <unk> .
alas , for visions , for legitimate hopes shattered forever !
on the day that <name> leffingwell led miss <name> down the aisle of the english church the vision of the brougham and the other delights faded .
<name> <name> went back to his club .
three years later , while on an excursion with sir <name> baker and a <name> party on the italian <name> , the horses behind which mr. and mrs. leffingwell were driving with their host ran away , and in the flight managed to precipitate the vehicle , and themselves , down the side of one of the numerous deep valleys of the streams seeking the mediterranean .
thus , by a singular <name> of <name> honors was deprived of both her parents at a period which  some chose to believe  was the height of their combined glories .
<name> leffingwell lived long enough to be taken back to nice , and to <unk> his infant daughter and sundry other <unk> problems to his brother <name> .
brother <name>  or uncle <name> , as we must call him with honora  cheerfully accepted the charge .
for his <unk> in life had been chiefly blessings in disguise .
he was paying teller of the prairie bank , and the thermometer registered something above 90 deg .
<unk> on the july morning when he stood behind his wicket reading a letter from <name> <name> , <unk> , relative to his niece .
mr. leffingwell was at this period of his life forty-eight , but the habit he had acquired of assuming responsibilities and burdens seemed to have had the effect of making his age indefinite .
he was six feet tall , broad-shouldered , his mustache and hair already turning ; his eyebrows were a trifle bushy , and his eyes reminded men of one eternal and highly prized quality  honesty .
they were blue grey .
ordinarily they shed a light which sent people away from his window the happier without knowing why ; but they had been known , on rare occasions , to flash on <unk> and fraud like the lightnings of the lord .
mr. <unk> , the president of the bank , coined a phrase about him .
he said that <name> leffingwell was <unk> honest .
although he had not risen above the position of paying teller , <name> leffingwell had a unique place in the city of his birth ; and the esteem in which he was held by capitalists and clerks proves that character counts for something .
on his father 's failure and death he had entered the prairie bank , at eighteen , and never left it .
if he had owned it , he could not have been treated by the customers with more respect .
the city , save for a few notable exceptions , like mr. <unk> , called him mr. leffingwell , but behind his back often spoke of him as <name> .
on the particular hot morning in question , as he stood in his <unk> coat reading the unquestionably pompous letter of mr. <name> announcing that his niece was on the high seas , he returned the greetings of his friends with his usual kindness and cheer .
in an adjoining compartment a long-legged boy of fourteen was busily stamping letters .
" <name> , " said mr. leffingwell , " go ask mr. <unk> if i may see him . "
it is advisable to remember the boy 's name .
it was <name> <name> , and he was a favourite in the bank , where he had been introduced by mr. leffingwell himself .
he was an orphan and lived with his grandmother , an <unk> old <name> with good blood in her veins who boarded in <name> 's row , on <name> street .
suffice it to add , at this time , that he worshipped mr. leffingwell , and that he was back in a twinkling with the information that mr. <unk> was awaiting him .
the president was seated at his desk .
in spite of the thermometer he gave no appearance of discomfort in his frock-coat .
he had scant , <unk> whiskers , a tightly closed and smooth-shaven upper lip , a nose <unk> decided ridge , and rather small but penetrating eyes in which the blue pigment had been used sparingly .
his habitual mode of speech was both brief and sharp , but people remarked that he modified it a little for <name> leffingwell .
" come in , <name> , " he said .
" anything the matter ? "
" mr. <unk> , i want a week off , to go to new york . "
the request , from <name> leffingwell , took mr. <unk> 's breath .
one of the bank president 's characteristics was an extreme interest in the private affairs of those who came within his zone of influence and especially when these affairs evinced any irregularity .
" <name> again ? "
he asked quickly .
<name> walked to the window , and stood looking out into the street .
his voice shook as he answered : " ten days ago i learned that my brother was dead , mr .
<unk> . "
the president glanced at the broad back of his teller .
mr. <unk> 's voice was firm , his face certainly betrayed no feeling , but a flitting gleam of satisfaction might have been seen in his eye .
" of course , <name> , you may go , " he answered .
thus came to pass an event in the lives of uncle <name> and aunt <name> , that journey to new york ( their first ) of two nights and two days to fetch honora .
we need not dwell upon all that befell them .
the first view of the hudson , the first whiff of the salt air on this unwonted holiday , the sights of this crowded city of wealth ,  all were tempered by the thought of the child coming into their lives .
they were standing on the pier when the windows were crimson in the early light , and at nine o'clock on that summer 's morning the <unk> was <unk> , and the passengers came crowding down the gang-plank .
prosperous tourists , most of them , with servants and stewards carrying bags of english design and checked steamer rugs ; and at last a <unk> <unk> with streamers and a bundle of ribbons and laces  honora  honora , aged eighteen months , gazing at a <unk> world .
" what a beautiful child !
exclaimed a woman on the pier . "
was it instinct or <unk> that led them to accost the <unk> ?
" oui , leffingwell ! "
she cried , gazing at them in some perplexity .
three children of various sizes clung to her skirts , and a younger nurse carried a <unk> little girl of honora 's age .
a <name> and gentleman followed .
the <name> was beginning to look <unk> , and no second glance was required to perceive that she was a person of opinion and character .
mr. holt was smaller than his wife , neat in dress and unobtrusive in appearance .
in the <name> mrs. holt , the friend of the <name> <unk> , aunt <name> was prepared to find a more <unk> fashionable personage , and had schooled herself forthwith .
" you are mrs. <name> leffingwell ? "
she asked .
" well , i am relieved . "
the <name> 's eyes , travelling rapidly over aunt <name> 's sober bonnet and brooch and gown , made it appear that these features in honora 's future guardian gave her the relief in question .
" honora , this is your aunt . "
honora smiled from amidst the laces , and aunt <name> , only too ready to <unk> , surrendered .
she held out her arms .
tears welled up in the <unk> 's eyes as she abandoned her charge .
" <unk> <unk> ! "
she cried .
but mrs. holt rebuked the nurse sharply , in french ,  a language with which neither aunt <name> nor uncle <name> was familiar .
fortunately , perhaps .
mrs. holt 's remark was to the effect that honora was going to a sensible home .
" <name> loves her better than my own children , " said that <name> .
honora seemed quite content in the arms of aunt <name> , who was gazing so earnestly into the child 's face that she did not at first hear mrs. holt 's invitation to take breakfast with them on <name> avenue , and then she declined politely .
while <unk> on the steamer , mrs. holt had decided quite clearly in her mind just what she was going to say to the child 's future guardian , but there was something in aunt <name> 's voice and manner which made these remarks seem unnecessary  although mrs. holt was secretly disappointed not to deliver them .
" it was fortunate that we happened to , be in nice at the time , " she said with the evident feeling that some explanation was due .
" i did not know poor mrs. <name> leffingwell very  very intimately , or mr. leffingwell .
it was such a sudden  such a terrible affair .
but mr. holt and i were only too glad to do what we could . "
" we feel very grateful to you , " said aunt <name> , quietly .
mrs. holt looked at her with a still more distinct approval , being tolerably sure that mrs. <name> leffingwell understood .
she had cleared her skirts of any possible implication of intimacy with the late mrs. <name> , and done so with a master touch .
in the meantime honora had passed to uncle <name> .
after securing the little trunk , and settling certain matters with mr. holt , they said good-by to her late kind <unk> , and started off for the nearest <unk> , honora pulling uncle <name> 's mustache .
more than one pedestrian paused to look back at the tall man carrying the beautiful child , <unk> like a young <name> , and more than one passenger in the street cars smiled at them both .
chapter ii .
<unk> recalled saint <name> , or that part of it which is called by dealers in real estate the choice residence section , grew westward .
and uncle <name> might be said to have been in the vanguard of the movement .
in the days before honora was born he had built his little house on what had been a farm on the <name> street road , at the crest of the second ridge from the river .
up this ridge , with clanking traces , toiled the <unk> that carried uncle <name> downtown to the bank and aunt <name> to market .
fleeing westward , likewise , from the smoke , friends of uncle <name> 's and aunt <name> 's gradually surrounded them  building , as a rule , the high victorian mansions in favour at that period , which were placed in the centre of commodious yards .
for the friends of uncle <name> and aunt <name> were for the most part <name> , and belonged , as did they , to the older families of the city .
mr. dwyer 's house , with its picture gallery , was across the street .
in the midst of such imposing company the little dwelling which became the home of our heroine sat well back in a plot that might almost be called a garden .
in summer its white wooden front was nearly hidden by the quivering leaves of two tall pear trees .
on the other side of the brick walk , and near the iron fence , was an elm and a flower bed that was uncle <name> 's pride and the admiration of the neighbourhood .
honora has but to shut her eyes to see it aflame with tulips at <unk> .
the eastern wall of the house was a mass of <name> creeper , and beneath that another flower bed , and still another in the <unk> behind the lattice fence covered with cucumber vine .
there were , besides , two maples and two apricot trees , relics of the farm , and of blessed memory .
such apricots !
visions of hot summer evenings come back , with uncle <name> , in his <unk> coat , with his green <unk> , bending over the beds , and aunt <name> seated upright in her chair , looking up from her knitting with a loving eye .
behind the lattice , on these summer evenings , stands the militant figure of that old <unk> , <name> the cook , her stout arms <unk> , ready to engage in vigorous banter should honora deign to approach .
" <unk> , <unk> <unk> , it 's a young <name> yell be soon , and the <unk> a-comin ' 'round ! "
she would cry , and throw back her head and laugh until the tears were in her eyes .
and the <name> , a slim figure in an immaculate linen frock with red ribbons which aunt <name> had copied from <unk> 's london catalogue , would reply with dignity : " <name> , i wish you would try to remember that my name is honora . "
another spasm of laughter from <name> .
" listen to that now ! "
she would cry to another ancient <unk> , <name> <name> , the housemaid , whose kitchen chair was tilted up against the side of the woodshed .
" it 'll be miss honora next , and <name> hanbury here to-day with his eye through a <unk> in the fence , out of his head for a sight of ye . "
<name> hanbury was honora 's cousin , and she did not deem his admiration a subject fit for discussion with <name> .
" sure , " declared <name> <name> , " it 's the air of a <name> the child has . "
that she should be thought a <name> did not appear at all remarkable to honora at twelve years of age .
<unk> may have had such dreams .
she had been born , she knew , in some wondrous land by the shores of the summer seas , not at all like st. <name> , and friends and relatives had not hesitated to remark in her hearing that she resembled  her father ,  that handsome father who surely must have been a <name> , whose <unk> photograph in the tortoise-shell frame was on the bureau in her little room .
so far as <name> leffingwell was concerned , <unk> had not been invented for nothing .
other records of him remained which honora had likewise seen : one end of a <unk> villa  which honora thought was a wing of his palace ; a coach and four he was driving , and which had chanced to belong to an englishman , although the photograph gave no evidence of this ownership .
neither aunt <name> nor uncle <name> had ever sought  for reasons perhaps obvious  to correct the child 's impression of an extraordinary <unk> .
aunt <name> was a puritan of southern ancestry , and her father had been a presbyterian minister , uncle <name> was a member of the vestry of a church still under puritan influences .
as a consequence for honora , there were <name> afternoons  periods when the imaginative faculty , in which she was by no means lacking , was given full play .
she would sit by the hour in the swing uncle <name> had <name> for her under the <name> near the lattice , while castles rose on distant heights against blue skies .
there was her real home , in a <unk> chamber that overlooked mile upon mile of rustling forest in the valley ; and when the wind blew , the sound of it was like the sea .
honora did not remember the sea , but its music was often in her ears .
she would be aroused from these dreams of greatness by the appearance of old <name> , her nurse , on the side porch , reminding her that it was time to wash for supper .
no <name> could have had a more humble <unk> than <name> .
honora can not be <unk> blamed .
when she reached the " little house under the hill " ( as <name> called the chamber beneath the eaves ) , she beheld reflected in the mirror an image like a tall , white flower that might indeed have belonged to a <name> .
her hair , the colour of burnt <unk> , fell evenly to her shoulders ; her features even then had regularity and <unk> ; her legs , in their black silk stockings , were straight ; and the simple white lawn frock made the best of a slender figure .
those frocks of honora 's were a continual source of wonder and sometimes of envy  to aunt <name> 's friends ; who returned from the seaside in the autumn , after a week among the fashions in boston or new york , to find honora in the latest models , and better dressed than their own children .
aunt <name> made no secret of the methods by which these seeming miracles were performed , and showed cousin <name> hanbury the fashion plates in the english periodicals .
cousin <name> sighed .
" <name> , you are wonderful , " she would say .
" honora 's clothes are <unk> than those i buy in the east , at such fabulous prices , from <unk> . "
indeed , no woman was ever farther removed from personal vanity than aunt <name> .
she looked like a little <unk> .
her silvered hair was parted in the middle and had , in spite of palpable efforts towards <unk> and repression , a perceptible ripple in it .
grey was her only concession to colour , and her gowns and bonnets were of a <unk> which belonged to the past .
repression , or perhaps compression , was her note , for the energy confined within her little body was a thing to have astounded scientists : and honora grew to womanhood and reflection before she had .
guessed or considered that her aunt was possessed of intense emotions which had no outlet .
her features were regular , her shy eye had the clearness of a forest pool .
she believed in <unk> , which is to say that she was a <unk> ; and while she steadfastly continued to regard this world as a place of sorrow and trials , she concerned herself very little about her participation in a future life .
old dr. <unk> , the rector of st. <name> 's , while <unk> that no better or more charitable woman existed , found it so exceedingly difficult to talk to her , on the subject of religion that he had never tried it but once .
such was aunt <name> .
the true student of human nature should not find it surprising that she spoiled honora and strove  at what secret expense , care , and self-denial to uncle <name> and herself , none <name> ever know  to adorn the child that she might appear <unk> among companions whose parents were more fortunate in this world 's goods ; that she denied herself to educate honora as these other children were educated .
nor is it astonishing that she should not have understood the highly complex organism of the young <name> we have chosen for our heroine , who was shaken , at the age of thirteen , by <unk> longings .
very early in life honora learned to dread the summer , when one by one the families of her friends departed until the city itself seemed a remote and distant place from what it had been in the spring and <name> .
the great houses were closed and blinded , and in the evening the servants who had been left behind chattered on the front steps .
honora could not bear the sound of the trains that drifted across the night , and the sight of the trunks piled in the <unk> ' hall , in <unk> square , always filled her with a sickening longing .
would the day ever come when she , too , would depart for the bright places of the earth ?
sometimes , when she looked in the mirror , she was filled with a fierce belief in a <name> to sit in the high seats , to receive homage and dispense <unk> , to discourse with great intellects , to know london and <name> and the <unk> and centres of the world as her father had .
to escape  only to escape from the prison walls of a <unk> existence , and to soar !
let us , if we can , reconstruct an <name> day when all ( or nearly all ) of honora 's small friends were gone eastward to the mountains or the seaside .
in " the little house under the hill , " the surface of which was a hot slate roof , honora would awake about seven o'clock to find old <name> bending over her in a dun-coloured calico dress , with the light fiercely beating against the closed shutters that braved it so <unk> throughout the day .
" the birds are before ye , miss honora , <name> , and your uncle <unk> his roses this half-hour . "
uncle <name> was indeed an early <unk> .
as honora dressed ( <name> assisting as at a ceremony ) , she could see him , in his <unk> coat , bending tenderly over his beds ; he lived enveloped in a peace which has since struck wonder to honora 's soul .
she lingered in her dressing , even in those days , falling into reveries from which <name> gently and deferentially aroused her ; and uncle <name> would be carving the beefsteak and aunt <name> pouring the coffee when she finally arrived in the dining room to nibble at one of <name> 's <unk> rolls or hot biscuits .
uncle <name> had his joke , and at <unk> eight precisely he would kiss aunt <name> and walk to the corner to wait for the <unk> <unk> that was to take him to the bank .
sometimes honora went to the corner with him , and he waved her good-by from the platform as he felt in his pocket for the nickel that was to pay his fare .
when honora returned , aunt <name> had donned her apron , and was industriously aiding <name> <name> to wash the dishes and maintain the customary high polish on her husband 's share of the leffingwell silver which , standing on the side table , shot hither and thither rays of green light that filtered through the shutters into the darkened room .
the child partook of aunt <name> 's pride in that silver , made for a kentucky great-grandfather leffingwell by a famous philadelphia <unk> three-quarters of a century before .
honora sighed .
" what 's the matter , honora ? "
asked aunt <name> , without pausing in her vigorous rubbing .
" the <unk> used to be great once upon a time , did n't they , aunt <name> ? "
" your uncle <name> , " answered aunt <name> , quietly , " is the greatest man i know , child . "
" and my father must have been a great man , too , " cried honora , " to have been a consul and drive coaches . "
aunt <name> was silent .
she was not a person who spoke easily on difficult subjects .
" why do n't you ever talk to me about my father , aunt <name> ?
uncle <name> does . "
" i did n't know your father , honora . "
" but you have seen him ? "
" yes , " said aunt <name> , dipping her cloth into the whiting ; " i saw him at my wedding .
but he was very , young . "
" what was he like ? "
honora demanded .
" he was very handsome , was n't he ? "
" yes , child . "
" and he had ambition , did n't he , aunt <name> ? "
aunt <name> paused .
her eyes were troubled as she looked at honora , whose head was thrown back .
" what kind of ambition do you mean , honora ? "
" oh , " cried honora , " to be great and <name> and powerful , and to be somebody . "
" who has been putting such things in your head , my dear ? "
" no one , aunt <name> .
only , if i were a man , i should n't rest until i became great . "
alas , that aunt <name> , with all her <name> , should have such limited powers of expression !
she resumed her <unk> of the silver before she spoke .
" to do one 's duty , to accept cheerfully and like a <name> the responsibilities and burdens of life , is the highest form of greatness , my child .
your uncle <name> has had many things to trouble him ; he has always worked for others , and not for himself .
and he is respected and loved by all who know him . "
" yes , i know , aunt <name> .
but  " " but what , honora ? "
" then why is n't he <name> , as my father was ? "
" your father was n't <name> , my dear , " said aunt <name> , sadly .
" why , aunt <name> ! "
honora exclaimed , " he lived in a beautiful house , and owned horses .
is n't that being <name> ? "
poor aunt <name> !
" honora , " she answered , " there are some things you are too young to understand .
but try to remember , my dear , that happiness does n't consist in being <name> . "
" but i have often heard you say that you wished you were <name> , aunt <name> , and had nice things , and a picture gallery like mr .
dwyer . "
" i should like to have beautiful pictures , honora . "
" i do n't like mr. dwyer , " declared honora , abruptly .
" you must n't say that , honora , " was aunt <name> 's reproof .
" mr. dwyer is an upright , <unk> man , and he thinks a great deal of your uncle <name> . "
" i ca n't help it , aunt <name> , " said honora .
" i think he enjoys being  well , being able to do things for a man like uncle <name> . "
neither aunt <name> nor honora guessed what a subtle criticism this was of mr. dwyer .
aunt <name> was troubled and puzzled ; and she began to speculate ( not for the first time ) why the lord had given a person with so little imagination a child like honora to bring up in the straight and narrow path .
" when i go on <name> afternoons with uncle <name> to see mr. <unk> pictures , " honora persisted , " i always feel that he is so glad to have what other people have n't or he would n't have any one to show them to . "
aunt <name> shook her head .
once she had given her loyal friendship , such faults as this became as nothing .
" and when " said honora , " when mrs. dwyer has <unk> for celebrated people who come here , why does she invite you in to see the table ? "
" out of kindness , honora .
mrs. dwyer knows that i enjoy looking at beautiful things . "
" why does n't she invite you to the dinners ? "
asked honora , hotly .
" our family is just as good as mrs .
dwyer 's . "
the extent of aunt <name> 's distress was not apparent .
" you are talking nonsense , my child , " she said .
" all my friends know that i am not a person who can entertain distinguished people , and that i do not go out , and that i have n't the money to buy evening dresses .
and even if i had , " she added , " i have n't a pretty neck , so it 's just as well . "
a philosophy distinctly aunt <name> 's .
uncle <name> , after he had listened without comment that evening to her account of this conversation , was of the opinion that to take honora to task for her fancies would be waste of breath ; that they would right themselves as she grew up .
" i 'm afraid it 's inheritance , <name> , " said aunt <name> , at last .
" and if so , it ought to be counteracted .
we 've seen other signs of it .
you know honora has little or no idea of the value of money  or of its ownership . "
" she sees little enough of it , " uncle <name> remarked with a smile .
" <name> . "
" well . "
" sometimes i think i 've done wrong not to dress her more simply .
i'm afraid it 's given the child a taste for  for <unk> . "
" i once had a fond belief that all women possessed such a taste , " said uncle <name> , with a quizzical look at his own exception .
" to tell you the truth , i never classed it as a fault . "
" then i do n't see why you married me , " said aunt <name>  a periodical remark of hers .
" but , <name> , i do wish her to appear as well as the other children , and ( aunt <name> actually blushed ) the child has good looks . "
" why do n't you go as far as old <name> , and call her a <name> ? "
he asked .
" do you want me to ruin her utterly ? "
exclaimed aunt <name> .
uncle <name> put his hands on his wife 's shoulders and looked down into her face , and smiled again .
although she held herself very straight , the top of her head was very little above the level of his <name> .
" it strikes me that you are entitled to some little indulgence in life , <name> , " he said .
one of the curious contradictions of aunt <name> 's character was a never dying interest , which held no taint of envy , in the doings of people more fortunate than herself .
in the long summer days , after her silver was cleaned and her housekeeping and <unk> finished , she read in the <unk> periodicals of <name> marriages , embassy balls , of great town and country houses and their owners at home and abroad .
and she knew , by means of a correspondence with cousin <name> hanbury and other intimates , the kind of cottages in which her friends <unk> at the seashore or in the mountains ; how many rooms they had , and how many servants , and very often who the servants were ; she was likewise informed on the climate , and the ease with which it was possible to obtain fresh vegetables .
and to all of this information uncle <name> would listen , smiling but genuinely interested , while he carved at dinner .
one evening , when uncle <name> had gone to play <unk> with mr. <unk> , who was ill , honora further surprised her aunt by exclaiming : " how can you talk of things other people have and not want them , aunt <name> ? "
" why should i <name> what i can not have , my dear ?
i take such pleasure out of my friends ' possessions as i can . "
" but you want to go to the seashore , i know you do .
i 've heard you say so , " honora protested .
" i should like to see the open ocean before i die , " admitted aunt <name> , unexpectedly .
" i saw new york harbour once , when we went to meet you .
and i know how the salt water smells  which is as much , perhaps , as i have the right to <name> for .
but i have often thought it would be nice to sit for a whole summer by the sea and listen to the waves dashing upon the beach , like those in the <name> picture in mr. dwyer 's gallery . "
aunt <name> little guessed the unspeakable rebellion aroused in honora by this acknowledgment of being fatally circumscribed .
would n't uncle <name> ever be <name> ?
aunt <name> shook her head  she saw no prospect of it .
but other men , who were not half so good as uncle <name> , got <name> .
uncle <name> was not the kind of man who cared for riches .
he was content to do his duty in that sphere where god had placed him .
poor aunt <name> .
honora never asked her uncle such questions : to do so never occurred to her .
at peace with all men , he gave of his best to children , and honora remained a child .
next to his flowers , walking was uncle <name> 's chief recreation , and from the time she could be guided by the hand she went with him .
his very presence had the gift of <unk> longings , even in the young ; the gift of compelling delight in simple things .
of a <name> afternoon , if the heat were not too great , he would take honora to the wild park that stretches westward of the city , and something of the depth and intensity of his pleasure in the birds , the forest , and the wild flowers would communicate itself to her .
she learned all unconsciously ( by suggestion , as it were ) to take delight in them ; a delight that was to last her lifetime , a never failing resource to which she was to turn again and again .
in <name> , they went to the botanical gardens or the <unk> .
uncle <name> had a passion for animals , and mr. <unk> , who was a director , gave him a pass through the gates .
the keepers knew him , and spoke to him with kindly respect .
nay , it seemed to honora that the very animals knew him , and offered themselves <unk> to be stroked by one whom they recognized as friend .
jaded horses in the street lifted their noses ; stray , homeless cats rubbed against his legs , and vagrant dogs looked up at him <unk> with wagging tails .
yet his goodness , as <name> would have said , had some edge to it .
honora had seen the light of anger in his blue eye  a divine <name> .
once he had <unk> her for telling aunt <name> a lie ( she could not have lied to him ) and honora had never forgotten it .
the anger of such a man had indeed some element in it of the divine ; terrible , not in volume , but in righteous intensity .
and when it had passed there was no occasion for future warning .
the memory of it lingered .
chapter iii .
concerning providence what quality was it in honora that compelled <name> to stop her <unk> on <unk> in order to make hot <unk> for a young woman who was late to breakfast ?
<name> , who would have filled the kitchen with righteous wrath if aunt <name> had <unk> the rules of the house , which were like the laws of the medes and persians !
and in honora 's early youth <name> <name> , the housemaid , spent more than one painful evening writing home for <unk> shells and other articles to propitiate our <name> , who rewarded her with a winning smile and a kiss , which invariably melted the honest girl into tears .
the <name> of scots never had a more devoted chamber woman than old <name> ,  who would have gone to the stake with a smile to save her little <name> a single childish ill , and who spent her savings , until severely taken to task by aunt <name> , upon objects for which a casual wish had been expressed .
the saints themselves must at times have been <unk> from hearing honora 's name .
not to speak of christmas !
christmas in the little house was one wild delirium of <name> .
the night before the festival was , to all outward appearances , an ordinary evening , when uncle <name> sat by the fire in his slippers , as usual , scouting the idea that there would be any christmas at all .
aunt <name> sewed , and talked with maddening calmness of the news of the day ; but for honora the air was charged with coming events of the first magnitude .
the very furniture of the little sitting-room had a different air , the room itself wore a mysterious aspect , and the <unk> fire seemed to give forth a special quality of unearthly light .
" is to-morrow christmas ? "
uncle <name> would exclaim .
" bless me !
honora , i am so glad you reminded me . "
" now , uncle <name> , you knew it was christmas all the time ! "
" kiss your uncle good night , honora , and go right to sleep , dear , "  from aunt <name> .
the unconscious irony in that command of aunt <name> 's !  to go right to sleep !
many times was a head lifted from a small pillow , straining after the meaning of the <unk> noises that came up from below !
not <name> claus .
honora 's belief in him had merged into a blind <name> in a larger and even more benevolent , if material providence : the kind of providence which mr. <name> <unk> , and which was to say to <unk> : " here's your <unk> ; " a particular providence which , at the proper time , gave uncle <name> money , and commanded , with a smile , " buy this for honora  she wants it . "
<unk> reason !
<unk> philosophy , to which honora was to cling for many years of life .
it is amazing how much can be wrung from a reluctant world by the mere belief in this kind of providence .
sleep came at last , in the darkest of the hours .
and still in the dark hours a stirring , a delicious sensation preceding reason , and the consciousness of a figure stealing about the room .
honora sat up in bed , shivering with cold and delight .
" is it awake ye are , <unk> , and it but four o'clock the morn ! "
" what are you doing , <name> ? "
" <unk> , it 's to mass i 'm going , to ask the mother of god to give ye many happy <unk> the like of this , miss honora . "
and <name> 's arms were about her .
" oh , it 's christmas , <name> , is n't it ?
how could i have forgotten it ! "
" now go to sleep , <name> .
your aunt and uncle would n't like it at all at all if ye was to make noise in the middle of the night  and it 's little better it is . "
sleep !
a despised waste of time in childhood .
<name> went to mass , and after an eternity , the grey december light began to sift through the shutters , and human endurance had reached its limit .
honora , still shivering , seized a fleecy wrapper ( the handiwork of aunt <name> ) and crept , a diminutive ghost , down the creaking stairway to the sitting-room .
a sitting-room which now was not a sitting-room , but for to-day a place of magic .
as though by a <unk> salute of the gods ,  at honora 's entrance the fire burst through the thick blanket of fine coal which uncle <name> had laid before going to bed , and with a little gasp of <name> that was almost pain , she paused on the threshold .
that one flash , like <unk> 's first sunrise over peru , gilded the edge of infinite possibilities .
needless to enumerate them .
the whole world , as we know , was in a conspiracy to spoil honora .
the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , and i know not how many others had sent their <unk> , and honora 's second cousins , the <unk> , from the family mansion behind the stately elms of <unk> square  of which something anon .
a miniature mahogany desk , a <unk> and <unk> which the <unk> had brought home from new york , endless volumes of a more secular and ( to honora ) <unk> nature ; roller skates ; skates for real ice , when it should appear in the form of sleet on the sidewalks ; a sled ; humbler gifts from <name> , <name> <name> , and <name> , and a wonderful coat , with hat to match , of a certain dark green <name> .
when aunt <name> appeared , an hour or so later , honora was surveying her magnificence in the glass .
" oh , aunt <name> ! "
she cried , with her arms tightly locked around her aunt 's neck , " how lovely !
did you send all the way to new york for it ? "
" no , honora , " said her aunt , " it did n't come from new york . "
aunt <name> did not explain that this coat had been her one <unk> occupation for six weeks , at such times when honora was out or tucked away safely in bed .
perhaps honora 's face fell a little .
aunt <name> scanned it rather anxiously .
" does that cause you to like it any less , honora ? "
she asked .
" aunt <name> ! "
exclaimed honora , in a tone of <unk> .
and added after a little , " i suppose mademoiselle made it . "
" does it make any difference who made it , honora ? "
" oh , no indeed , aunt <name> .
may i wear it to cousin <name> 's to-day ? "
" i gave it to you to wear , honora . "
not in honora 's memory was there a christmas breakfast during which <name> <name> did not appear , bringing gifts .
<name> <name> , of whom we caught a glimpse doing an errand for uncle <name> in the bank .
with the complacency of the sun honora was wont to regard this most constant of her satellites .
her awakening powers of observation had discovered him in bondage , and in bondage he had been ever since : for their acquaintance had begun on the first <name> afternoon after <unk> arrival in st. <name> at the age of eighteen months .
it <name> be remembered that honora was even then a <unk> , and as she sat in her new <unk> under the pear tree , <unk> outrageously with <name> , who stood on one foot from embarrassment .
" why , <name> , " uncle <name> had said slyly , " why do n't you kiss her ? "
that kiss had been <name> 's seal of service .
and he became , on <name> afternoons , a sort of <unk> for <name> .
he took an amazing delight in wheeling honora up and down the yard , and up and down the sidewalk .
<unk> or <name> <name> never wielded a power more absolute , nor had an <unk> more satisfactory ; and of all his remarkable talents , none were more conspicuous than his abilities to tell a story and to choose a present .
emancipated from the <unk> , honora would watch for him at the window , and <unk> to the gate to meet him , a <unk> whose zeal , however arduous , never flagged .
on this particular christmas morning , when she heard the gate slam , honora sprang up from the table to <name> her green <name> coat .
poor <name> !
as though his subjugation could be more complete !
" it 's the postman , " suggested uncle <name> , wickedly .
" it 's <name> ! "
cried honora , triumphantly , from the hall as she <unk> open the door , letting in a breath of cold christmas air out of the sunlight .
it was <name> , but a <name> who has changed some since <unk> days ,  just as honora has changed some .
a <name> who , instead of fourteen , is six and twenty ; a full-fledged lawyer , in the office of that most celebrated of st. <name> <unk> , judge <name> <name> .
for the <name> <unk> of this world are queer creatures , and move rapidly without appearing to the <unk> to move at all .
a great many things have happened to <name> since he had been a messenger boy in the bank .
needless to say , uncle <name> had taken an interest in him .
and , according to <name> , this fact accounted for all the good fortune which had followed .
shortly before the news came of his brother 's death , uncle <name> had discovered that the boy who did his errands so willingly was going to night school , and was the grandson of a gentleman who had fought with credit in the mexican war , and died in misfortune : the grandmother was <name> 's only living relative .
through uncle <name> , mr. <unk> became interested , and judge <name> .
there was a certain <unk> in the washington university which <name> obtained , and he worked his way through the law school afterwards .
a simple story , of which many a duplicate could be found in this country of ours .
in the course of the dozen years or so of its <unk> the grandmother had died , and <name> had become , to all intents and purposes , a member of uncle <name> 's family .
a place was set for him at <name> dinner ; and , if he did not appear , at <name> tea .
sometimes at both .
and here he was , as usual , on christmas morning , his arms so full that he had had to push open the gate with his foot .
" well , well , well , well ! "
he said , stopping short on the doorstep and surveying our <unk> <name> , " i 've come to the wrong house . "
the <name> stuck her finger into her cheek .
" do n't be silly , <name> ! "
she said ; " and <name> christmas ! "
" <name> christmas ! "
he replied , edging sidewise in at the door and depositing his parcels on the mahogany horsehair sofa .
he chose one , and seized the <name>  <name> coat and all !  in his arms and kissed her .
when he released her , there remained in her hand a <unk> diary , marked with her monogram , and destined to contain high matters .
" how could you know what i wanted , <name> ? "
she exclaimed , after she had divested it of the tissue paper , <name> , and red ribbon in which he had so carefully wrapped it .
for it is a <name> trait to thank with the same <unk> and warmth the <unk> of the humblest and the greatest offerings .
there was a <unk> for uncle <name> , and a <unk> for aunt <name> , and a dress apiece for <name> , <name> , and <name> <name> , none of whom <name> ever forgot .
although the smoke was even at that period beginning to creep westward , the sun poured through the lace curtains into the little dining-room and danced on the silver <unk> as aunt <name> poured out <name> 's cup , and the blue <name> breakfast plates were <unk> than ever because it was christmas .
the humblest of familiar articles took on the air of a present .
and after breakfast , while aunt <name> occupied herself with that immemorial institution ,  which was to lure <unk> so many prominent citizens of st. <name> during the day ,  <unk> , <name> surveyed the offerings which transformed the sitting-room .
the table had been pushed back against the <unk> , the chairs knew not their <unk> places , and white paper and red ribbon littered the floor .
uncle <name> , <unk> to a corner , pretended to read his newspaper , while honora flitted from <name> 's knees to his , or sat cross-legged on the hearth-rug investigating a bottomless stocking .
" what in the world are we going to do with all these things ? "
said <name> .
" we ? "
cried honora .
" when we get married , i mean , " said <name> , smiling at uncle <name> .
" let's see ! "
and he began counting on his fingers , which were long but very strong  so strong that honora could never loosen even one of them when they gripped her .
" one  two  three  eight <unk> before you are twenty-one .
we 'll have enough things to set us up in housekeeping .
or perhaps you 'd rather get married when you are eighteen ? "
" i 've always told you i was n't going to marry you , <name> , " said honora , with decision .
" why by not ? "
he always asked that question .
honora sighed .
" i 'll make a good husband , " said <name> ; " i 'll promise .
ugly men are always good husbands . "
" i did n't say you were ugly , " declared the ever considerate honora .
" only my nose is too big , " he quoted ; " and i am too long one way and not wide enough . "
" you have a certain air of distinction in spite of it , " said honora .
uncle <name> 's newspaper began to shake , and he read more industriously than ever .
" you 've been reading  novels ! "
said <name> , in a terrible judicial voice .
honora flushed <unk> , and resumed her inspection of the stocking .
miss <unk> , a maiden <name> of somewhat romantic tendencies , was librarian of the book club that year .
and as a result a book called " <name> 's quest , " by an author who shall be nameless , had come to the house .
and it was <name> who had had " a certain air of distinction . "
" it is n't very kind of you to make fun of me when i pay you a compliment , " replied honora , with dignity .
" i was naturally put out , " he declared gravely , " because you said you would n't marry me .
but i do n't intend to give up .
no man who is worth his salt ever gives up . "
" you are old enough to get married now , " said honora , still considerate .
" but i am not <name> enough , " said <name> ; " and besides , i want you . "
one of the first entries in the morocco diary  which had a lock and key to it  was a description of honora 's future husband .
we can not violate the lock , nor steal the key from under her pillow .
but this much , alas , may be said with discretion , that he bore no resemblance to <name> <name> .
it may be guessed , however , that he contained something of <name> , and more of <name> leffingwell ; and that he did not live in st. <name> .
an event of christmas , after church , was the dinner of which uncle <name> and aunt <name> and honora partook with cousin <name> hanbury , who had been a leffingwell , and was a first cousin of honora 's father .
honora loved the atmosphere of the massive , yellow stone house in <unk> square , with its tall polished mahogany doors and thick carpets , with its deferential darky servants , some of whom had been the slaves of her great uncle .
to honora , gifted with imagination , the house had an odour all its own ; a <name> , clean odour significant , in later life , of wealth and luxury and spotless housekeeping .
and she knew it from top to bottom .
the spacious upper floor , which in ordinary dwellings would have been an attic , was the realm of young <name> and his sisters , <name> and <name> ( aunt <name> 's namesake ) .
rainy saturdays , all too brief , honora had passed there , when the big dolls ' house in the <unk> became the scene of domestic dramas which <name> rehearsed after she went to bed , although <name> took them more calmly .
in his <unk> years , honora even fired <name> , and riots occurred which took the combined efforts of cousin <name> and mammy <name> to quell .
it may be remarked , in passing , that cousin <name> looked with suspicion upon this imaginative gift of honora 's , and had several serious conversations with aunt <name> on the subject .
it was true , in a measure , that honora quickened to life everything she touched , and her arrival in <unk> square was invariably greeted with shouts of <name> .
there was no doll on which she had not bestowed a history , and by dint of her <unk> their <unk> clung to them with all the reality of a fate not by any means to be lived down .
if <name> rode the huge <unk> , he was <name> revere , or some equally historic figure , and sometimes , to <name> 's terror , he was compelled to assume the role of <unk> , when honora submitted to <unk> with a fortitude amounting to <unk> .
hide and seek was altogether too tame for her , a stake of life and death , or imprisonment or treasure , being a necessity .
and many times was <name> extracted from the recesses of the cellar in a condition bordering on hysterics , the day ending <unk> with a bible story or a selection from " little women " read by cousin <name> .
in autumn , and again in spring and early summer before the annual departure of the hanbury family for the sea , the pleasant yard with its wide shade trees and its shrubbery was a land of enchantment threatened by a <name> .
black bias , the family coachman , polishing the fat carriage horses in the stable yard , was the <name> ; and <name> the intrepid knight who , spurred by honora , would dash in and pinch bias in a part of his anatomy which the honest darky had never seen .
an ideal <name> , for he could assume an astonishing fierceness at <name> .
" i 'll git you yit , marse <name> ! "
had it not been for honora , her cousins would have found the paradise in which they lived a commonplace spot , and indeed they never could realize its tremendous possibilities in her absence .
what would the mediterranean sea and its adjoining countries be to us unless the wanderings of <name> and <unk> had made them real ?
and what would cousin <name> 's yard have been without honora ?
whatever there was of romance and <unk> in uncle <name> 's library honora had extracted at an early age , and with astonishing ease had avoided that which was dry and uninteresting .
the result was a nomenclature for aunt <name> 's yard , in which there was even a <name> <unk> <unk> <unk> travellers never returned , but were transformed into wild beasts or monkeys .
although they acknowledged her leadership , <name> and <name> were sorry for honora , for they knew that if her father had lived she would have had a house and garden like theirs , only larger , and beside a blue sea where it was warm always .
honora had told them so , and colour was lent to her assertions by the fact that their mother , when they repeated this to her , only smiled sadly , and brushed her eyes with her handkerchief .
she was even more beautiful when she did so , <name> told her ,  a remark which caused mrs. hanbury to scan her younger daughter closely ; it smacked of honora .
" was cousin <name> handsome ? "
<name> demanded .
mrs. hanbury started , so vividly there arose before her eyes a brave and dashing figure , clad in grey english cloth , walking by her side on a <name> autumn morning in the rue de la <unk> .
well she remembered that trip abroad with her mother , <name> 's aunt , and how attentive he was , and showed them the best restaurants in which to dine .
he had only been in <name> a short time , but his knowledge of restaurants and the world in general had been amazing , and his acquaintances legion .
he had a way , which there was no resisting , of taking people by storm .
" yes , dear , " answered mrs. hanbury , absently , when the child repeated the question , " he was very handsome . "
" honora says he would have been president , " put in <name> .
" of course i do n't believe it .
she said they lived in a palace by the sea in the south of <name> , with gardens and fountains and a lot of things like that , and princesses and princes and <unk>  " " and what ! "
exclaimed mrs. hanbury , aghast .
" i know , " said <name> , contemptuously , " she got that out of the arabian nights . "
but this suspicion did not prevent him , the next time honora <unk> them with more adventures of the palace by the summer seas , from listening with a rapt attention .
no two tales were ever alike .
his admiration for honora did not <unk> , but increased .
it differed from that of his sisters , however , in being a tribute to her creative faculties , while <name> 's breathless <name> pictured her cousin as having passed through as many adventures as <name> <name> .
<name> paid her a characteristic compliment , but <unk> <name> her aside to bestow it .
he was not one to mince matters .
" you 're a wonder , honora , " he said .
" if i could lie like that , i would n't want a pony . "
he was forced to draw back a little from the heat of the conflagration he had kindled .
" <name> hanbury , " she cried , " do n't you ever speak to me again !
never !
do you understand ? "
it was thus that <name> , at some cost , had made a considerable discovery which , for the moment , shook even his <unk> .
honora believed it all herself .
cousin <name> hanbury was a person , or personage , who took a deep and abiding interest in her <unk> , and the old clothes of the hanbury family went <unk> to the <unk> whose figures most resembled those of the original owners .
for mrs. hanbury had a wide but comparatively unknown <name> list .
she was , secretly , one of the many providence which honora accepted collectively , although it is by no means certain whether honora , at this period , would have thanked her cousin for tuition at miss farmer 's school , and for her daily tasks at french and music concerning which aunt <name> was so particular .
on the memorable christmas morning when , arrayed in green <name> , she arrived with her aunt and uncle for dinner in <unk> square , cousin <name> <name> aunt <name> into her bedroom and shut the door , and handed her a sealed envelope .
without opening it , but guessing with much accuracy its contents , aunt <name> handed it back .
" you are doing too much , <name> , " she said .
mrs. hanbury was likewise a direct person .
" i <name> , take it back on one condition , <name> .
if you <name> tell me that <name> has finished paying <name> 's debts . "
mrs. leffingwell was silent .
" i thought not , " said mrs. hanbury .
" now <name> was my own cousin , and i insist . "
aunt <name> turned over the envelope , and there followed a few <unk> silence , broken only by the distant clamour of tin horns and other musical instruments of the season .
" i sometimes think , <name> , that honora is a little like <name> , <unk> <name> .
of course , i did not know her . "
" neither did i , " said aunt <name> .
" <name> , " said mrs. hanbury , again , " i realize how you worked to make the child that <name> coat .
do you think you ought to dress her that way ? "
" i do n't see why she should n't be as well dressed as the children of my friends , <name> . "
mrs. hanbury laid her hand impulsively on aunt <name> 's .
" no child i know of dresses half as well , " said mrs. hanbury .
" the trouble you take  " " is rewarded , " said aunt <name> .
" yes , " mrs. hanbury agreed .
" if my own daughters were half as good looking , i should be content .
and honora has an air of race .
oh , <name> , ca n't you see ?
i am only thinking of the child 's future . "
" do you expect me to take down all my mirrors , <name> ?
if she has good looks , " said aunt <name> , " she has not learned it from my lips . "
it was true : even aunt <name> 's enemies , and she had some , could not accuse her of the weakness of flattery .
so mrs. hanbury smiled , and dropped the subject .
chapter iv .
of temperament we have the word of mr. <name> meeker that honora did not have to learn to dance .
the <name> came to her naturally .
of mr. <name> meeker , whose <unk> , at the age of five and sixty , are waxed as tight as ever , and whose little legs to-day are as nimble as of yore .
he has a memory like mr. gladstone 's , and can give you a social history of the city that is well worth your time and attention .
he <name> tell you how , for instance , he was kicked by the <name> feet of mr. <name> hanbury on the occasion of his first lesson to that distinguished young gentleman ; and how , although mr. meeker 's shins were sore , he pleaded nobly for mr. <name> , who was sent home in the carriage by himself ,  a punishment , by the way , which mr. <name> desired above all things .
this celebrated incident occurred in the new ballroom at the top of the new house of young mrs. <name> , where the meetings of the dancing class were held weekly .
today the soot , like the ashes of vesuvius , spouting from ten thousand <unk> craters , has buried that house and the whole district fathoms deep in social obscurity .
and beautiful mrs. <name> what has become of her ?
and <name> <name> , that <unk> darling of the gods ?
all this belongs , however , to another history , which may some day be written .
this one is honora 's , and must be got on with , for it is to be a chronicle of lightning changes .
happy we if we can follow honora , and we must be prepared to make many friends and drop them in the process .
shortly after mrs. <name> had built that palatial house ( which had a high fence around its grounds and a driveway leading to a <unk> ) and had given her initial ball , the dancing class began .
it was on a blue afternoon in late november that aunt <name> and honora , with cousin <name> and the two girls , and <name> <unk> in a corner of the carriage , were driven through the gates behind bias and the fat horses of the <unk> .
honora has a vivid remembrance of the impression the house made on her , with its polished floors and spacious rooms filled with a new and mysterious and altogether inspiring fashion of things .
mrs. <name> represented the outposts in the days of richardson and davenport  had honora but known it .
this great house was all so different from anything she ( and many others in the city ) had ever seen .
and she stood gazing into the drawing room , with its curtains and <unk> drawn shades , in a rapture which her aunt and cousins were far from guessing .
" come , honora , " said her aunt .
" what 's the matter , dear ? "
how could she explain to aunt <name> that the sight of beautiful things gave her a sort of pain  when she did not yet know it herself ?
there was the massive stairway , for instance , which they ascended , softly lighted by a great <unk> window of stained glass on the first landing ; and the spacious bedrooms with their shining brass beds and lace spreads ( another innovation which honora resolved to adopt when she married ) ; and at last , far above all , its <unk> windows looking out above the trees towards the park a mile to the westward , the ballroom ,  the ballroom , with its mirrors and high chandeliers , and chairs of gilt and blue set against the walls , all of which made no impression whatever upon <name> and <name> and <name> , but gave honora a thrill .
no wonder that she learned to dance quickly under such an inspiration !
and how pretty mrs. <name> looked as she came forward to greet them and kissed honora !
she had been <name> grey , and scarce had had a gown to her back when she had married the elderly <name> <name> , who had built her this house and presented her with a <unk> ,  a <unk> which <name> believed to be like the widow 's <unk> of <unk> .
alas , those days of picnics and balls ; of dinners at that recent innovation , the club ; of <unk> and excursions to baseball games between the young men in mrs. <name> 's train ( and all young men were ) who played at harvard or yale or princeton ; those days were too <unk> to have endured .
" aunt <name> , " asked honora , when they were home again in the lamplight of the little sitting-room , " why was it that mr. meeker was so polite to cousin <name> , and asked her about my dancing instead of you ? "
aunt <name> smiled .
" because , honora , " she said , " because i am a person of no importance in mr. meeker 's eyes . "
" if i were a man , " cried honora , fiercely , " i should never rest until i had made enough money to make mr. meeker wriggle . "
" honora , come here , " said her aunt , gazing in troubled surprise at the tense little figure by the mantel .
" i do n't know what could have put such things into your head , my child .
money is n't everything .
in times of real trouble it can not save one . "
" but it can save one from humiliation ! "
exclaimed honora , unexpectedly .
another sign of a peculiar <unk> , at fourteen , with which aunt <name> was finding herself unable to cope .
" i would rather be killed than humiliated by mr .
meeker . "
whereupon she flew out of the room and upstairs , where old <name> , in dismay , found her sobbing a little later .
poor aunt <name> !
few people guessed the spirit which was bound up in her , aching to extend its sympathy and not knowing how , save by an <unk> and <unk> devotion .
her words of comfort were as few as her silent deeds were many .
but honora continued to go to the dancing class , where she treated mr. meeker with a <unk> that astonished him , amused <name> <name> , and perplexed cousin <name> .
mr. meeker 's cringing soul responded , and in a month honora was the leading spirit of the class , led the marches , and was pointed out by the little dancing master as all that a <name> should be in deportment and bearing .
this treatment , which succeeded so well in mr. meeker 's case , honora had previously applied to others of his sex .
like most people with a future , she began young .
of late , for instance , mr. <name> hanbury had shown a tendency to regard her as his personal property ; for <name> had a high-handed way with him ,  boys being an enigma to his mother .
even in those days he had a bullet head and a red face and square shoulders , and was rather <unk> for his age  which was honora 's .
needless to say , <name> did not approve of the dancing class ; and let it be known , both by words and deeds , that he was there under protest .
nor did he regard with favour honora 's triumphal progress , but sat in a corner with several congenial spirits whose feelings ranged from scorn to despair , commenting in loud whispers upon those of his sex to whom the <unk> <name> came more naturally .
upon one algernon <unk> , for example , whose striking likeness to the van <unk> portrait of a young king had been more than once commented upon by his elders , and whose <unk> suits enhanced the resemblance .
algernon , by the way , was the favourite male pupil of mr. meeker ; and , on occasions , algernon and honora were called upon to give exhibitions for the others , the sight of which filled <name> with contemptuous rage .
algernon danced altogether too much with honora ,  so <name> informed his cousin .
the simple result of <name> 's protests was to make honora dance with algernon the more , evincing , even at this period of her career , a commendable determination to resent dictation .
<name> should have lived in the middle ages , when the spirit of modern american womanhood was as yet unborn .
once he contrived , by main force , to drag her out into the hall .
" <name> , " she said , " perhaps , if you 'd let me alone perhaps i 'd like you better . "
" perhaps , " he retorted fiercely , " if you would n't make a fool of yourself with those mother 's darlings , i 'd like you better . "
" <name> , " said honora , " learn to dance . "
" never ! "
he cried , but she was gone .
while hovering around the door he heard mrs. <name> 's voice .
" unless i am tremendously mistaken , my dear , " that <name> was remarking to mrs. dwyer , whose daughter <name> 's future millions were powerless to compel youths of fourteen to dance with her , although she is now happily married , " unless i am mistaken , honora <name> have a career .
the child <name> be a raving beauty .
and she has to perfection the <name> of managing men . "
" as her father had the <name> of managing women , " said mrs. dwyer .
" dear me , how well i remember <name> !
i would have followed him to  to <name> . "
mrs. <name> laughed .
" he never would have gone to <name> , i imagine , " she said .
" he never looked at me , and i have reason to be profoundly thankful for it , " said mrs. dwyer .
<name> <name> bit her lip .
she remembered a saying of mrs. <name> , " blessed are the ugly , for they shall not be tempted . "
" they say that poor <name> leffingwell has not yet finished paying his debts , " continued mrs. dwyer , " although his uncle , <name> <unk> father , <unk> what <name> had had from him in his <name> .
it was twenty-five thousand dollars .
<name> hanbury , you remember , had him appointed consul at nice .
<name> leffingwell gave the impression of conferring a favour when he borrowed money .
i can not understand why he married that penniless and <unk> beauty . "
" perhaps , " said mrs. <name> , " it was because of his ability to borrow money that he felt he could afford to . "
the eyes of the two ladies unconsciously followed honora about the room .
" i never knew a better or a more honest woman than <name> leffingwell , but i tremble for her .
she is utterly incapable of managing that child .
if honora is a complicated mechanism now , what <name> she be at twenty ?
she has elements in her which poor <name> never dreamed of .
i overheard her with <name> , and she talks like a grown-up person . "
mrs. <name> 's <unk> deepened .
" better than some grown-up women , " she said .
" she sat in my room while i dressed the other afternoon .
mrs. leffingwell had sent her with a note about that french governess .
and , by the way , she speaks french as though she had lived in <name> . "
little mrs. dwyer raised her hands in protest .
" it does n't seem natural , somehow .
it does n't seem exactly  moral , my dear . "
" nonsense , " said mrs. <name> .
" mrs. leffingwell is only giving the child the advantages which her companions have  <name> has french , has n't she ? "
" but <name> ca n't speak it  that way , " said mrs. dwyer .
" i do n't blame <name> leffingwell .
she thinks she is doing her duty , but it has always seemed to me that honora was one of those children who would better have been brought up on bread and butter and jam . "
" honora would only have eaten the jam , " said mrs. <name> .
" but i love her . "
" i , too , am fond of the child , but i tremble for her .
i am afraid she has that terrible thing which is called temperament . "
<name> hanbury made a second heroic rush , and dragged honora out once more .
" what is this disease you 've got ? "
he demanded .
" disease ? "
she cried ; " i have n't any disease . "
" mrs dwyer says you have temperament , and that it is a terrible thing . "
honora stopped him in a corner .
" because people like mrs. dwyer have n't got it , " she declared , with a warmth which <name> found inexplicable .
" what is it ? "
he demanded .
" you 'll never know , either , <name> , " she answered ; " it 's soul . "
" soul ! "
he repeated ; " i have one , and its immortal , " he added promptly .
in the summer , that season of desolation for honora , when <name> hanbury and algernon <unk> and other young gentlemen were at the seashore learning to sail boats and to play tennis , <name> <name> came to his own .
nearly every evening after dinner , while the light was still lingering under the shade trees of the street , and aunt <name> still placidly sewing in the wicker chair on the lawn , and uncle <name> making the tour of flowers with his watering pot , the gate would slam , and <name> 's tall form appear .
it never occurred to honora that had it not been for <name> those evenings would have been even less <unk> than they were .
to sit indoors with a light and read in a st. <name> midsummer was not to be thought of .
<name> played <unk> with her on the front steps , and later on  chess .
sometimes they went for a walk as far as grand avenue .
and sometimes when honora grew older  she was permitted to go with him to <unk> 's cave .
those were memorable occasions indeed !
what saint <unk> of the last generation does not remember <unk> cave ?
nor look without regret upon the thing which has replaced it , called a coliseum ?
the very name , <unk> 's cave , sent a shiver of delight down one 's spine , and many were the conjectures one made as to what might be enclosed in that half a block of <unk> brick wall , over which the great trees stretched their branches .
honora , from comparative infancy , had her own theory , which so possessed the mind of <name> hanbury that she would not look at the wall when they passed in the carriage .
it was a still and sombre place by day ; and sometimes , if you listened , you could hear the whisperings of the forty thieves on the other side of the wall .
but no one had ever dared to cry " open , <unk> ! "
at the great wooden gates .
at night , in the warm season , when well brought up children were at home or at the seashore , strange things were said to happen at <unk> 's cave .
honora was a tall slip of a girl of sixteen before it was given her to know these mysteries , and the <name> baba theory a thing of the past .
other theories had replaced it .
nevertheless she clung tightly to <name> 's arm as they walked down locust street and came in sight of the wall .
above it , and under the big trees , shone a thousand glittering lights : there was a crowd at the gate , and instead of saying , " open , <unk> , " <name> slipped two bright <unk> pieces to the red-faced <name> <unk> , and in they went .
first and most astounding of <unk> of passing childhood , it was not a cave at all !
and yet the word " <unk> " does not apply .
it was , after all , the most enchanting and exciting of spots , to make one's eye shine and one 's heart beat .
under the trees were hundreds of tables surrounded by hovering <unk> angels in white , and if you were <name> , they brought you beer ; if american , ice-cream .
beyond the tables was a stage , with <unk> already set and orchestra <unk> up , and a curtain on which was represented a gentleman making decorous love to a <name> beside a fountain .
as in a dream , honora followed <name> to a table , and he handed her a programme .
" oh , <name> , " she cried , " it 's going to be <unk> ' ! "
honora 's eyes shone like stars , and elderly people at the neighbouring tables turned more than once to smile at her that evening .
and <name> turned more than once and smiled too .
but honora did not consider <name> .
he was merely providence in one of many disguises , and providence is accepted by his <unk> as a matter of fact .
the rapture of a young <name> of temperament is a difficult thing to picture .
the bird may feel it as he <unk> , on a bright <name> morning , high above <name> cliffs jutting out into indigo seas ; the novelist may feel it when the four walls of his room magically disappear and the profound secrets of the universe are on the point of revealing themselves .
honora gazed , and listened , and lost herself .
she was no longer in <unk> 's cave , but in the great world , her soul <unk> with harmonies .
" <unk> , " although a comic opera , held something tragic for honora , and opened the <unk> to dizzy sensations which she did not understand .
how little <name> , who drummed on the table to the tune of : " give three cheers and one cheer more for the hearty captain of the <unk> , " imagined what was going on beside him !
there were two factors in his pleasure ; he liked the music , and he enjoyed the delight of honora .
what is <name> ?
let us cease looking at him through honora 's eyes and taking him like daily bread , to be eaten and not thought about .
from one point of view , he is twenty-nine and elderly , with a sense of humour unsuspected by young persons of temperament .
strive as we <name> , we have only been able to see him in his role of providence , or of the <name> .
has he no existence , no purpose in life outside of that perpetual gentleman in waiting ?
if so , honora has never considered it .
after the <unk> had been <name> and the curtain dropped for the last time , honora sighed and walked out of the garden as one in a trance .
once in a while , as he found a way for them through the crowd , <name> glanced down at her , and something like a smile tugged at the corners of a decidedly masculine mouth , and lit up his eyes .
suddenly , at locust street , under the lamp , she stopped and surveyed him .
she saw a very real , very human individual , clad in a dark nondescript suit of clothes which had been bought ready-made , and plainly without the <unk> of much thought , on fifth street .
the fact that they were a comparative fit was in itself a tribute to the enterprise of the excelsior clothing company , for honora 's observation that he was too long one way had been just .
he was too tall , his shoulders were too high , his nose too prominent , his eyes too <unk> ; and he wore a straw hat with the brim turned up .
to honora his appearance was as familiar as the picture of the pope which had always stood on <name> 's bureau .
but to-night , by <name> of some added power of vision , she saw him with new and critical eyes .
she was surprised to discover that he was possessed of a quality with which she had never associated him  youth .
not to put it too strongly  comparative youth .
" <name> , " she demanded , " why do you dress like that ? "
" like what ? "
he said .
honora seized the <unk> of his coat .
" like that , " she repeated .
" do you know , if you wore different clothes , you might almost be distinguished looking .
do n't laugh .
i think it's horrid of you always to laugh when i tell you things for your own good . "
" it was the idea of being almost distinguished looking that  that gave me a shock , " he assured her <unk> .
" you should dress on a different principle , " she insisted .
<name> appeared dazed .
" i could n't do that , " he said .
" why not ? "
" because  because i do n't dress on any principle now . "
" yes , you do , " said honora , firmly .
" you dress on the principle of the wild beasts and fishes .
it 's all in our natural history at miss farmer 's .
the crab is the colour of the seaweed , and the deer of the thicket .
it 's a device of nature for the protection of weak things . "
<name> <name> himself up proudly .
" i have always understood , miss leffingwell , that the king of beasts was somewhere near the shade of the jungle . "
honora laughed in spite of this apparent refutation of her theory of his apparel , and shook her head .
" do be serious , <name> .
you 'd make much more of an impression on people if you wore clothes that had  well , a little more distinction . "
" what 's the use of making an impression if you ca n't follow it up ? "
he said .
" you can , " she declared .
" i never thought of it until to-night , but you must have a great deal in you to have risen all the way from an errand boy in the bank to a lawyer . "
" look out ! "
he cautioned her ; " i shall become <unk> conceited . "
" a little more conceit would n't hurt you , " said honora , critically .
" you 'll forgive me , <name> , if i tell you from time to time what i think .
it 's for your own good . "
" i try to realize that , " replied <name> , humbly .
" how do you wish me to dress  like mr .
<unk> ? "
the picture evoked of <name> arrayed like mr. <name> <unk> , who had sent flowers to two generations and was preparing to send more to a third , was irresistible .
every city , hamlet , and village has its <name> <unk> .
he need not be explained .
but honora soon became grave again .
" no , but you ought to dress as though you were somebody , and different from the ordinary man on the street . "
" but i 'm not , " objected <name> .
" oh , " cried honora , " do n't you want to be ?
i ca n't understand any man not wanting to be .
if i were a man , i would n't stay here a day longer than i had to . "
<name> was silent as they went in at the gate and opened the door , for on this festive occasion they were provided with a <unk> .
he turned up the light in the hall to behold a transformation quite as wonderful as any contained in the " arabian nights " or <unk> 's " <name> mythology . "
this was not the honora with whom he had left the house scarce three hours before !
the <unk> dress , to be sure , was still no longer than the tops of her ankles and the hair still <name> in a heavy braid down her back .
these were positively all that remained of the original honora , and the change had occurred in the incredibly brief space required for the production of the opera " <unk> . "
this honora was a woman in a strange and disturbing state of exaltation , whose eyes beheld a vision .
and <name> , although he had been the subject of her conversation , well knew that he was not included in the vision .
he smiled a little as he looked at her .
it is becoming apparent that he is one of those unfortunate <unk> beings incapable of great illusions .
" you 're not going ! "
she exclaimed .
he glanced significantly at the hall clock .
" why , it 's long after bedtime , honora . "
" i do n't want to go to bed .
i feel like talking , " she declared .
" come , let 's sit on the steps awhile .
if you go home , i <name> n't go to sleep for hours , <name> . "
" and what would aunt <name> say to me ? "
he inquired .
" oh , she would n't care .
she would n't even know it . "
he shook his head , still smiling .
" i 'd never be allowed to take you to <unk> 's cave , or anywhere else , again , " he replied .
" i 'll come to-morrow evening , and you can talk to me then . "
" i <name> n't feel like it then , " she said in a tone that implied his opportunity was now or never .
but seeing him still obdurate , with startling suddenness she flung her arms mound his neck  a method which at times had succeeded marvellously  and pleaded <unk> : " only a quarter of an hour , <name> .
i 've got so many things to say , and i know i shall forget them by to-morrow . "
it was a night of wonders .
to her astonishment the hitherto <unk> <name> , who only existed in order to do her <name> , became transformed into a <unk> masculine creature which she did not recognize .
with a movement that was almost rough he released himself and fled , calling back a " good night " to her out of the darkness .
he did not even wait to assist her in the process of locking up .
honora , profoundly puzzled , stood for a while in the doorway gazing out into the night .
when at length she turned , she had forgotten him entirely .
it was true that she did not sleep for hours , and on awaking the next morning another phenomenon awaited her .
the " little house under the hill " was immeasurably shrunken .
poor aunt <name> , who did not understand that a performance of " <unk> " could give birth to the <unk> longings which result in the creation of high things , spoke to uncle <name> a week later concerning an astonishing and apparently abnormal access of industry .
" she 's been reading all day long , <name> , or else shut up in her room , where <name> tells me she is writing .
i 'm afraid <name> hanbury is right when she says i do n't understand the child .
and yet she is the same to me as though she were my own . "
it was true that honora was writing , and that the door was shut , and that she did not feel the heat .
in one of the <unk> she had chanced upon that immortal biography of dr. <name> , and upon the letters of another prodigy of her own sex , madame <unk> , whose romantic <unk> as an <unk> was inspiration in itself .
honora actually quivered when she read of dr. <name> 's first conversation with miss <unk> .
to write a book of the existence of which even one 's own family did not know , to publish it under a nom de plume , and to awake one day to <unk> and fame would be indeed to live !
unfortunately honora 's novel no longer exists , or the world might have discovered a second <name> .
a regard for truth compels the statement that it was never finished .
but what rapture while the fever lasted !
merely to take up the pen was to pass magically through marble <unk> into the great world itself .
the sir <name> <unk> of this novel was , needless to say , not <name> <name> .
he was none other than mr. <name> leffingwell , under a very thin disguise .
chapter v. in which providence <unk> <name> two more years have gone by , limping in the summer and flying in the <name> , two more years of conquests .
for our heroine appears to be one of the daughters of <name> , born to make trouble for warriors and others  and even for innocent bystanders like <name> <name> .
<name> was debarred from entering those brilliant lists in which apparel played so great a part .
<name> hanbury , <name> <unk> , algernon <unk> , eliphalet hopper dwyer  familiarly known as " <unk> "  and other young gentlemen whose names are now but memories , each had his brief day of triumph .
arrayed like <name> in wonderful clothes from the mysterious and luxurious east , they returned at <unk> and <name> from college to break lances over honora .
let us say it boldly  she was like that : she had the <unk> knack of sowing discord and despair in the souls of young men .
she was  as those who had known that fascinating gentleman were not slow to remark  <name> leffingwell over again .
during the festival seasons , uncle <name> <unk> , they wore out the latch on the front gate .
if their families possessed horses to spare , they took honora driving in forest park ; they escorted her to those anomalous dances peculiar to their innocent age , which are neither children's parties nor full-fledged balls ; their presents , while of no intrinsic value  as one young gentleman said in a presentation speech  had an enormous , if shy , significance .
" what a beautiful ring you are wearing , honora , " uncle <name> remarked slyly one <name> morning at breakfast ; " let me see it . "
honora blushed , and hid her hand under the table-cloth .
and the <unk> it to say that her little finger was exactly <unk> in a <unk> piece from which everything had been removed but the <unk> : removed with infinite loving <name> by mr. <unk> , and at the expense of much history and philosophy and other less important things , in his college bedroom at new haven .
honora wore it for a whole week ; a triumph indeed for mr. <unk> ; when it was placed in a box in honora 's bedroom , which contained other gifts  not all from him  and many letters , in the writing of which learning had likewise suffered .
the immediate cause of the putting away of this ring was said to be the renowned <name> <unk> , who was on the harvard football eleven , and who visited mr. <name> hanbury that <name> .
fortunate indeed the tailor who was called upon to practise his <name> on an adonis like mr. <unk> , and it was remarked that he scarcely left honora 's side at the garden party and dance which mrs. dwyer gave in honour of the returning heroes , on the monday of <name> week .
this festival , on which we should like to linger , but can not , took place at the new dwyer residence .
for six months the victorian mansion opposite uncle <name> 's house had been sightless , with blue blinds drawn down inside the plate glass windows .
and the yellow stone itself was not so yellow as it once had been , but had now the appearance of soiled <unk> wrapping paper , with black streaks here and there where the soot had run .
the new dwyer house was of grey stone , georgian and palatial , with a <unk> twice the size of the old one ; a magnificent and fitting pioneer in a new city of palaces .
westward the <name> of empire  away from the smoke .
the dwyer mansion , with its lawns and gardens and heavily <unk> terrace , faced the park that stretched away like a private estate to the south and west .
that same park with its huge trees and black forests that was <unk> <unk> in honora 's childhood ; in the open places there had been real farms and <unk> which she used to slide down with <name> while uncle <name> looked for wild flowers in the fields .
it had been separated from the city in those days by an endless country road , like a via <name> stretching towards mysterious <unk> forests , and it was deemed a feat for <name> to ride thither on his <unk> bicycle .
forest park was the country , and all that the country represented in <unk> childhood .
for uncle <name> on a summer 's day to hire a surrey at <unk> 's livery stable and drive thither was like  to what shall that bliss be compared in these days when we go to europe with indifference ?
and now <unk> road  the via <name> of long , ago  had become <unk> boulevard , with <unk> sidewalks .
and the dreary fields through which it had formerly run were bristling with new houses in no sense victorian , and which were the first <unk> of a national sense of the artistic .
the old <unk> with the clanging chains had disappeared , and you could take an electric to within a block of the imposing <unk> that surrounded the dwyer grounds .
westward the <name> !
fading fast was the <name> of that bright new district on top of the second hill from the river where uncle <name> was a pioneer .
soot had killed the pear trees , the apricots behind the lattice fence had withered away ; asphalt and soot were slowly <unk> the vitality of the maples on the sidewalk ; and sometimes uncle <name> 's roses looked as though they might advantageously be given a coat of paint , like those in <name> in wonderland .
honora should have lived in the <unk> ' <unk> who are capable of judging said so .
people who saw her at the garden party said she had the air of belonging in such surroundings much more than <name> , whom even budding womanhood had not made beautiful .
and eliphalet hopper dwyer , if his actions meant anything , would have welcomed her to that house , or built her another twice as fine , had she <unk> to give him the least encouragement .
<name> !
this was what she <unk> called herself one july morning of that summer she was eighteen .
<name> in more senses than one , for never had the city seemed more dirty or more deserted , or indeed , more stifling .
<name> and its festivities were a dream laid away in moth balls .
surely <unk> life had held no greater contrasts !
to this day the odour of matting brings back to honora the sense of closed shutters ; of a stifling south wind stirring their slats at noonday ; the vision of aunt <name> , cool and placid in a <unk> <unk> , sewing by the window in the upper hall , and the sound of fruit <unk> crying in the street , or of <unk> in the alley  " rags , bottles , old iron ! "
what memories of endless , burning , lonely days come rushing back with those words !
when the sun had sufficiently heated the bricks of the surrounding houses in order that he might not be forgotten during the night , he slowly departed .
if honora took her book under the <name> tree in the yard , she was confronted with that hideous wooden sign " to let " on the dwyer 's iron fence opposite , and the grass behind it was unkempt and overgrown with weeds .
aunt <name> took an unceasing and ( to honora 's mind ) morbid interest in the future of that house .
" i suppose it <name> be a boarding-house , " she would say , " it 's much too large for poor people to rent , and only poor people are coming into this district now . "
" oh , aunt <name> ! "
" well , my dear , why should we complain ?
we are poor , and it is appropriate that we should live among the poor .
sometimes i think it is a pity that you should have been thrown all your life with <name> people , my child .
i am afraid it has made you discontented .
it is no disgrace to be poor .
we ought to be thankful that we have everything we need . "
honora put down her sewing .
for she had learned to sew  aunt <name> had insisted upon that , as well as french .
she laid her hand upon her aunt 's .
" i am thankful , " she said , and her aunt little guessed the intensity of the emotion she was seeking to control , or imagined the hidden fires .
" but sometimes  sometimes i try to forget that we are poor .
perhaps  some day we shall not be . "
it seemed to honora that aunt <name> derived a real pleasure from the contradiction of this <name> .
she shook her head vigorously .
" we shall always be , my child .
your uncle <name> is getting old , and he has always been too honest to make a great deal of money .
and besides , " she added , " he has not that kind of ability . "
uncle <name> might be getting old , but he seemed to honora to be of the same age as in her childhood .
some people never grow old , and uncle <name> was one of these .
fifteen years before he had been promoted to be the cashier of the prairie bank , and he was the cashier to-day .
he had the same quiet smile , the same quiet humour , the same calm acceptance of life .
he seemed to bear no grudge even against that ever advancing enemy , the soot , which made it increasingly difficult for him to raise his flowers .
those which would still grow he washed tenderly night and morning with his <unk> .
the greatest wonders are not at the ends of the earth , but near us .
it was to take many years for our heroine to realize this .
strong <name> alone could have withstood the continued contact with such a determined <unk> as aunt <name> 's , and yet it is interesting to note that honora 's belief in her providence never wavered .
a <name> was to come who was to bear her away from the <unk> and the <unk> and the soot : and incidentally and in spite of herself , aunt <name> was to come too , and uncle <name> .
and sometimes when she sat reading of an evening under the <name> , her book would fall to her lap and the advent of this personage become so real a thing that she bounded when the gate slammed  to find that it was only <name> .
it was preposterous , of course , that <name> should be a <name> in disguise .
<name> who , despite her efforts to teach him distinction in dress , insisted upon wearing the same kind of clothes .
a mild kind of providence , <name> , whose modest functions were not unlike those of the third horse which used to be hitched on to the street car at the foot of the <unk> hill : it was <name> 's task to help pull honora through the interminable summers .
<unk> 's cave was an old story now : mysteries were no longer to be expected in st. <name> .
there was a great panorama  or something to that effect  in the wilderness at the end of one of the new electric lines , where they sometimes went to behold the white squadron of the new united states navy engaged in battle with mimic forts on a mimic sea , on the very site where the country place of madame <name> had been .
the mimic sea , surrounded by wooden stands filled with common people eating peanuts and <unk> , was none other than madame <name> 's pond , which honora remembered as a spot of enchantment .
and they went out in the open cars with these same people , who stared at honora as though she had got in by mistake , but always politely gave her a seat .
and <name> thanked them .
sometimes he fell into conversations with them , and it was noticeable that they nearly always shook hands with him at parting .
honora did not approve of this familiarity .
" but they may be clients some day , " he argued  a frivolous answer to which she never <unk> to reply .
just as one used to take for granted that third horse which pulled the car uphill , so <name> was taken for granted .
he might have been on the <unk> to a renown like that of chief justice <name> , and honora had been none the wiser .
" well , <name> , " said uncle <name> at dinner one evening of that memorable summer , when aunt <name> was helping the blackberries , and incidentally <unk> that she did not live in the country , because of the cream one got there , " i saw judge <name> in the bank to-day , and he tells me you covered yourself with <name> in that iron foundry suit . "
" the judge must have his little joke , mr. leffingwell , " replied <name> , but he reddened nevertheless .
honora thought winning an iron foundry suit a strange way to cover one's self with <name> .
it was not , at any rate , her idea of <name> .
what were lawyers for , if not to win suits ?
and <name> was a lawyer .
" in five years , " said uncle <name> , " the firm <name> be <unk> and <name> ' .
you <name> my words .
and by that time , " he added , with a twinkle in his eye , " you 'll be ready to marry honora . "
" <name> , " reproved aunt <name> , gently , " you ought n't to say such things . "
this time there was no doubt about <name> 's blush .
he fairly burned .
honora looked at him and laughed .
" <name> is meant for an old bachelor , " she said .
" if he remains a bachelor , " said uncle <name> , " he 'll be the greatest waste of good material i know of .
and if you succeed in getting him , honora , you 'll be the <unk> young woman of my acquaintance . "
" <name> , " said aunt <name> , " it was all very well to talk that way when honora was a child .
but now  she may not wish to marry <name> .
and <name> may not wish to marry her . "
even <name> joined in the laughter at this literal and characteristic statement of the case .
" it 's more than likely , " said honora , wickedly .
" he has n't kissed me for two years . "
" why , <name> , " said uncle <name> , " you act as though it were warm to-night .
it was only seventy when we came in to dinner . "
" take me out to the park , " commanded honora .
" <name> , " said aunt <name> , as she stood on the step and watched them cross the street , " i wish the child would marry him .
not now , of course , " she added hastily ,  a little frightened by her own admission , " but later .
sometimes i worry over her future .
she needs a strong and sensible man .
i do n't understand honora .
i never did .
i always told you so .
sometimes i think she may be capable of doing something foolish like  like <name> . "
uncle <name> patted his wife on the shoulder .
" do n't borrow trouble , <name> , " he said , smiling a little .
" the child is only full of spirits .
but she has a good heart .
it is only human that she should want things that we can not give her . "
" i wish , " said aunt <name> , " that she were not quite so good-looking . "
uncle <name> laughed .
" you need n't tell me you 're not proud of it , " he declared .
" and i have given her , " she continued , " a taste for dress . "
" i think , my dear , " said her husband , " that there were others who contributed to that . "
" it was my own vanity .
i should have <unk> the tendency in her , " said aunt <name> .
" if you had dressed honora in calico , you could not have changed her , " replied uncle <name> , with conviction .
in the meantime honora and <name> had mounted the electric car , and were speeding westward .
they had a seat to themselves , the very first one on the " grip "  that survival of the days of cable cars .
honora 's eyes brightened as she held on to her hat , and the stray <unk> of hair about her neck stirred in the breeze .
" oh , i wish we would never stop , until we came to the pacific ocean ! "
she exclaimed .
" would you be content to stop then ? "
he asked .
he had a trick of looking downward with a quizzical expression in his dark grey eyes .
" no , " said honora .
" i should want to go on and see everything in the world worth seeing .
sometimes i feel positively as though i should die if i had to stay here in st .
<name> . "
" you probably would die  eventually , " said <name> .
honora was <unk> irritated .
" i could shake you , <name> ! "
he laughed .
" i 'm afraid it would n't do any good , " he answered .
" if i were a man , " she proclaimed , " i should n't stay here .
i 'd go to new york  i 'd be somebody  i 'd make a national reputation for myself . "
" i believe you would , " said <name> sadly , but with a glance of admiration .
" that 's the worst of being a woman  we have to sit still until something happens to us . "
" what would you like to happen ? "
he asked , curiously .
and there was a note in his voice which she , intent upon her thoughts , did not remark .
" oh , i do n't know , " she said ; " anything  anything to get out of this <unk> and be something in the world .
it 's dreadful to feel that one has power and not be able to use it . "
the car stopped at the terminal .
thanks to the early hour of aunt mary's dinner , the western sky was still aglow with the sunset over the forests as they walked past the closed <unk> of the dwyer mansion into the park .
children rolled on the grass , while mothers and fathers , tired out from the heat and labour of a city day , sat on the benches .
<name> stooped down and lifted a small boy , painfully thin , who had fallen , weeping , on the gravel walk .
he took his handkerchief and wiped the scratch on the child 's forehead .
" there , there ! "
he said , smiling , " it 's all right now .
we must expect a few tumbles . "
the child looked at him , and suddenly smiled through his tears .
the father appeared , a red-headed irishman .
" thank you , mr. <name> ; i 'm sure it 's very kind of you , sir , to bother with him , " he said gratefully .
" it 's that thin he is with the heat , i take him out for a bit of country air . "
" why , <name> , it 's you , is it ? "
said <name> .
" he 's the janitor of our building down town , " he explained to honora , who had remained a silent witness to this simple scene .
she had been , in spite of herself , impressed by it , and by the mingled respect and affection in the janitor 's manner towards <name> .
it was so with every one to whom he spoke .
they walked on in silence for a few moments , into a path leading to a lake , which had stolen the flaming <unk> of the sky .
" i suppose , " said honora , slowly , " it would be better for me to wish to be contented where i am , as you are .
but it 's no use trying , i ca n't . "
<name> was not a preacher .
" oh , " he said , " there are lots of things i want . "
" what ? "
demanded honora , interested .
for she had never conceived of him as having any desires whatever .
" i want a house like mr. dwyer 's , " he declared , pointing at the distant imposing roof line against the fading eastern sky .
honora laughed .
the idea of <name> wishing such a house was indeed ridiculous .
then she became grave again .
" there are times when you seem to forget that i have at last grown up , <name> .
you never <name> talk over serious things with me . "
" what are serious things ? "
asked <name> .
" well , " said honora vaguely , " ambitions , and what one is going to make of themselves in life .
and then you make fun of me by saying you want mr. dwyer 's house . "
she laughed again .
" i ca n't imagine you in that house ! "
" why not ? "
he asked , stopping beside the pond and thrusting his hands in his pockets .
he looked very solemn , but she knew he was smiling inwardly .
" why  because i ca n't , " she said , and hesitated .
the question had forced her to think about <name> .
" i ca n't imagine you living all alone in all that luxury .
it is n't like you . "
" why i all alone ? "
asked <name> .
" do n't  do n't be ridiculous , " she said ; " you would n't build a house like that , even if you were twice as <name> as mr. dwyer .
you know you would n't .
and you 're not the marrying kind , " she added , with the superior knowledge of eighteen .
" i 'm waiting for you , honora , " he announced .
" you know i love you , <name> , "  so she tempered her reply , for <unk> feelings were tender .
what man , even <name> , would not have married her if he could ?
of course he was in <name> , despite his <unk> tone , " but i never could  marry you . "
" not even if i were to offer you a house like mr .
dwyer 's ? "
he said .
a remark which betrayed  although not to her  his knowledge of certain earthly strains in his goddess .
the colours faded from the water , and it blackened .
as they walked on side by side in the twilight , a consciousness of repressed masculine force , of reserve power , which she had never before felt about <name> <name> , invaded her ; and she was seized with a strange uneasiness .
ridiculous was the thought ( which she lost no time in rejecting ) that pointed out the true road to happiness in marrying such a man as he .
in the gathering darkness she slipped her hand through his arm .
" i wish i could marry you , <name> , " she said .
he was fain to take what comfort he could from this expression of good-will .
if he was not the <name> charming of her dreams , she would have liked him to be .
a little reflection on his part ought to have shown him the absurdity of the <name> charming having been there all the time , and in ready-made clothes .
and he , too , may have had dreams .
we are not concerned with them .
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... .
if we listen to the still , small voice of <unk> , intense longing is always followed by disappointment .
nothing should have happened that summer , and providence should not have come disguised as the postman .
it was a sultry day in early <unk> is to say that it was comparatively cool  a blue day , with occasional great drops of rain <unk> on the brick walk .
and honora was reclining on the hall sofa , reading about mr. <unk> and his duchess , when she perceived the postman 's grey uniform and smiling face on the far side of the screen door .
he greeted her cordially , and gave her a single letter for aunt <name> , and she carried it <unk> upstairs .
" it 's from cousin <name> , " honora volunteered .
aunt <name> laid down her sewing , smoothed the ruffles of her <unk> , adjusted her spectacles , opened the envelope , and began to read .
presently the letter fell to her lap , and she wiped her glasses and glanced at honora , who was deep in her book once more .
and in <unk> <name> , as she read , was ringing the refrain of the prisoner : " orleans , <unk> !
notre dame de <unk> !
vendome !
vendome !
<unk> chagrin , <unk> <unk> de <unk> <unk> la <unk> <name> <unk> , <name> <unk> ! " .
the verse appealed to honora strangely ; just as it had appealed to <unk> .
was she not , too , a prisoner .
and how often , during the summer days and nights , had she listened to the <unk> of the pilgrim church near by ?
" one , two , three , four !
one , two , three , four ! "
after uncle <name> had watered his flowers that evening , aunt <name> followed him upstairs and locked the door of their room behind her .
silently she put the letter in his hand .
here is one paragraph of it : " i have never asked to take the child from you in the summer , because she has always been in perfect health , and i know how lonely you would have been without her , my dear <name> .
but it seems to me that a <name> at sutcliffe , with my girls , would do her a world of good just now .
i need not point out to you that honora is , to say the least , remarkably good looking , and that she has developed very rapidly .
and she has , in spite of the strict training you have given her , certain ideas and ambitions which seem to me , i am sorry to say , more or less prevalent among young american women these days .
you know it is only because i love her that i am so <name> .
miss turner 's influence <name> , in my opinion , do much to counteract these tendencies . "
uncle <name> folded the letter , and handed it back to his wife .
" i feel that we ought not to refuse , <name> .
and i am afraid <name> is right . "
" well , <name> , we 've had her for seventeen years .
we ought to be willing to spare her for  how many months ? "
" nine , " said aunt <name> , promptly .
she had counted them .
" and <name> says she <name> be home for two weeks at christmas .
seventeen years !
it seems only yesterday when we brought her home , <name> .
it was just about this time of day , and she was asleep in your arms , and <name> opened the door for us . "
aunt <name> looked out of the window .
" and do you remember how she used to play under the <name> there , with her dolls ? "
uncle <name> produced a very large handkerchief , and blew his nose .
" there , there , <name> , " he said , " nine months , and two weeks out at christmas .
nine months in eighteen years . "
" i suppose we ought to be very thankful , " said aunt <name> .
" but , <name> , the time is coming soon  " " tut tut , " exclaimed uncle <name> .
he turned , and his eyes beheld a work of <name> .
nothing less than a porcelain plate , <name> in brackets on the wall , decorated by honora at the age of ten with wild roses , and presented with much ceremony on an anniversary morning .
he pretended not to notice it , but aunt <name> 's eyes were too quick .
she seized a photograph on her bureau , a photograph of honora in a little white frock with a red sash .
" it was the year that was taken , <name> . "
he nodded .
the scene at the breakfast table came back to him , and the sight of <name> standing respectfully in the hall , and of honora , in the red sash , making the courtesy the old woman had taught her .
honora recalled afterwards that uncle <name> joked even more than usual that evening at dinner .
but it was aunt <name> who asked her , at length , how she would like to go to boarding-school .
such was the matter-of-fact manner in which the portentous news was announced .
" to boarding-school , aunt <name> ? "
her aunt poured out her uncle 's <unk> coffee .
" i 've spilled some , my dear .
get another saucer for your uncle . "
honora went mechanically to the <name> closet , her heart thumping .
she did not stop to reflect that it was the rarest of occurrences for aunt <name> to spill the coffee .
" your cousin <name> has invited you to go this <name> with <name> and <name> to sutcliffe . "
sutcliffe !
no need to tell honora what sutcliffe was  her cousins had talked of little else during the past <name> ; and shown , if the truth be told , just a little commiseration for honora .
sutcliffe was not only a famous girls ' school , sutcliffe was the world  that world which , since her earliest remembrances , she had been longing to see and know .
in a desperate attempt to realize what had happened to her , she found herself staring hard at the open <name> closet , at aunt <name> 's best gold dinner set resting on the pink lace paper that had been changed only last week .
that dinner set , somehow , was always an <unk> of festival  when , on the rare occasions aunt <name> entertained , the little dining room was transformed by it and the leffingwell silver into a glorified and altogether <unk> state , in which any miracle seemed possible .
honora pushed back her chair .
her lips were parted .
" oh , aunt <name> , is it really true that i am going ? "
she said .
" why , " said uncle <name> , " what zeal for learning ! "
" my dear , " said aunt <name> , who , you may be sure , knew all about that school before cousin <name> 's letter came , " miss turner insists upon hard work , and the discipline is very strict . "
" no young men , " added uncle <name> .
" that , " declared aunt <name> , " is certainly an advantage . "
" and no chocolate cake , and bed at ten o'clock , " said uncle <name> .
honora , dazed , only half heard them .
she laughed at uncle <name> because she always had , but tears were shining in her eyes .
young men and chocolate cake !
what were these privations compared to that magic word change ?
suddenly she rose , and flung her arms about uncle <name> 's neck and kissed his rough cheek , and then embraced aunt <name> .
they would be lonely .
" aunt <name> , i ca n't bear to leave you  but i do so want to go !
and it wo n't be for long  <name> it ?
only until next spring . "
" until next summer , i believe , " replied aunt <name> , gently ; " <name> is a summer <unk> n't it , <name> ? "
" it <name> be a summer month without question next year , " answered uncle <name> , <unk> .
it has been remarked that that day was sultry , and a fine rain was now washing uncle <name> 's flowers for him .
it was he who had applied that term " washing " since the <name> of <unk> .
incredible as it may seem , life proceeded as on any other of a thousand rainy nights .
the lamps were lighted in the sitting-room , uncle <name> unfolded his gardening periodical , and aunt <name> her embroidery .
the gate slammed , with its more subdued , <unk> sound .
" it 's <name> , " said honora , flying downstairs .
and she caught him , astonished , as he was folding his umbrella on the step .
" oh , <name> , if you tried until to-morrow morning , you never could guess what has happened . "
he stood for a moment , motionless , staring at her , a tall figure , careless of the rain .
" you are going away , " he said .
" how did you guess it ? "
she exclaimed in surprise .
" yes  to boarding-school .
to sutcliffe , on the hudson , with <name> and <name> .
are n't you glad ?
you look as though you had seen a ghost . "
" do i ? "
said <name> .
" do n't stand there in the rain , " commanded honora ; " come into the parlour , and i 'll tell you all about it . "
he came in .
she took the umbrella from him , and put it in the rack .
" why do n't you congratulate me ? "
she demanded .
" you 'll never come back , " said <name> .
" what a horrid thing to say !
of course i shall come back .
i shall come back next <name> , and you 'll be at the station to meet me . "
" and  what <name> uncle <name> and aunt <name> do  without you ? "
" oh , " said honora , " i shall miss them dreadfully .
and i shall miss you , <name> . "
" very much ? "
he asked , looking down at her with such a queer expression .
and his voice , too , sounded queer .
he was trying to smile .
suddenly honora realized that he was suffering , and she felt the pangs of contrition .
she could not remember the time when she had been away from <name> , and it was natural that he should be stricken at the news .
<name> , who was the complement of all who loved and served her , of aunt <name> and uncle <name> and <name> , and who somehow embodied them all .
<name> , the eternally <unk> .
she found it natural that the light should be temporarily removed from his firmament while she should be at boarding-school , and yet in the tenderness of her heart she pitied him .
she put her hands impulsively upon his shoulders as he stood looking at her with that queer expression which he believed to be a smile .
" <name> , you dear old thing , indeed i shall miss you !
i do n't know what i shall do without you , and i 'll write to you every single week . "
gently he disengaged her arms .
they were standing under that which , for courtesy 's sake , had always been called the chandelier .
it was in the centre of the parlour , and uncle <name> always covered it with <name> and <unk> at christmas .
" why do you say i 'll never come back ? "
asked honora .
" of course i shall come back , and live here all the rest of my life . "
<name> shook his head slowly .
he had recovered something of his customary quizzical manner .
" the east is a strange country , " he said .
" the first thing we know you 'll be marrying one of those people we read about , with more millions than there are cars on the <name> street line . "
honora was a little indignant .
" i wish you would n't talk so , <name> , " she said .
" in the first place , i <name> n't see any but girls at sutcliffe .
i could only see you for a few minutes once a week if you were there .
and in the second place , it isn't exactly  well  dignified to compare the east and the west the way you do , and speak about people who are very <name> and live there as though they were different from the people we know here .
comparisons , as shakespeare said , are odorous . "
" honora , " he declared , still shaking his head , " you 're a fraud , but i ca n't help loving you . "
for a long time that night honora lay in bed staring into the darkness , and trying to realize what had happened .
she heard the whistling and the puffing of the trains in the <unk> valley to the southward , but the quality of these sounds had changed .
they were music now .
chapter <name> .
honora has a glimpse of the world it is simply impossible to give any adequate notion of the industry of the days that followed .
no sooner was uncle <name> out of the house in the morning than <name> <name> marched into the sitting-room and took command , and turned it , into a <unk> establishment .
<name> <name> , who deserves more than a passing mention , one of the institutions of honora 's youth , who sewed for the first families , and knew much more about them than mr. meeker , the <unk> .
if you enjoyed her confidence ,  as aunt <name> did ,  she would tell you of her own accord who gave their servants enough to eat , and who did n't .
<name> <name> was a sort of inquisition all by herself , and would have made a valuable chief of police .
the reputations of certain elderly gentlemen of wealth might have remained to this day intact had it not been for her ; she had a <unk> knack of discovering <unk> .
<name> <name> knew the gentlemen by sight , and the gentlemen did not know <name> <name> .
uncle <name> she held to be somewhere in the calendar of the saints .
there is not time , alas , to linger over <name> <name> or the new histories which she whispered to aunt <name> when honora was out of the room .
at last the eventful day of departure arrived .
honora 's new trunk  her first  was packed by aunt <name> 's own hands , the dainty clothes and the dresses folded in tissue paper , while old <name> stood sniffing by .
after dinner  sign of a great occasion  a carriage came from <unk> livery stable , and uncle <name> held the horses while the driver carried out the trunk and strapped it on .
<name> , <name> <name> , and <name> , all weeping , were kissed good-by , and off they went through the dusk to the station .
not the old union depot , with its wooden sheds , where honora had gone so often to see the <unk> off , that grimy gateway to the fairer regions of the earth .
this new station , of brick and stone and glass and tiles , would hold an army corps with ease .
and when they alighted at the carriage entrance , a tall figure came forward out of the shadow .
it was <name> , and he had a package under his arm .
<name> checked honora 's trunk , and <name> had got the permission  through judge <name>  which enabled them all to pass through the <unk> and down the long walk beside which the train was standing .
they entered that hitherto mysterious conveyance , a sleeping-car , and spoke to old mrs. <name> , who was going east to see her married daughter , and who had gladly agreed to take charge of honora .
afterwards they stood on the platform , but in spite of the valiant efforts of uncle <name> and <name> , conversation was a mockery .
" honora , " said aunt <name> , " do n't forget that your trunk key is in the little pocket on the left side of your bag . "
" no , aunt <name> . "
" and your little new testament at the bottom .
and your lunch is arranged in three packages .
and do n't forget to ask cousin <name> about the walking shoes , and to give her my note . "
cries <unk> under the great glass dome , and trains pulled out with deafening roars .
honora had a strange feeling , as of pressure from within , that caused her to take deep breaths of the smoky air .
she but half heard what was being said to her : she wished that the train would go , and at the same time she had a sudden , surprising , and fierce longing to stay .
she had been able to eat scarcely a mouthful of that <unk> dinner which <name> had spent the afternoon in preparing , comprised wholly of forbidden dishes of her childhood , for which <name> and aunt <name> were justly famed .
such is the irony of life .
visions of one of aunt <name> 's rare <unk> and of a small girl peeping <unk> through a crack in the dining-room door , and of the gold <name> set , rose before her .
but she could not eat .
" bread and jam and tea at miss turner 's , " uncle <name> had said , and she had tried to smile at him .
and now they were standing on the platform , and the train might start at any moment .
" i trust you wo n't get like the new <unk> , honora , " said aunt <name> .
" do you remember how stiff they were , <name> ? "
she was still in the habit of referring to that memorable trip when they had brought honora home .
" and they say now that they hold their heads higher than ever . "
" that , " said uncle <name> , gravely , " is a local disease , and comes from staring at the tall buildings . "
" uncle <name> ! "
<name> presented the parcel under his arm .
it was a box of <name> , and very heavy , on which much thought had been spent .
" they are some of the things you like , " he said , when he had returned from putting it in the berth .
" how good of you , <name> !
i shall never be able to eat all that . "
" i <name> there is a doctor on the train , " said uncle <name> .
" <unk> , " answered the black <name> , who had been listening with evident relish , " right good <unk>  <unk> <unk> . "
even aunt <name> laughed .
" <name> , " asked honora , " ca n't you get judge <name> to send you on to new york this <name> on law business ?
then you could come up to sutcliffe to see me . "
" i 'm afraid of miss turner , " declared <name> .
" oh , she would n't mind you , " exclaimed honora .
" i could say you were an uncle .
it would be almost true .
and perhaps she would let you take me down to new york for a <unk> . "
" and how about my ready-made clothes ? "
he said , looking down at her .
he had never forgotten that .
honora laughed .
" you do n't seem a bit sorry that i 'm going , " she replied , a little breathlessly .
" you know i 'd be glad to see you , if you were in rags . "
" all aboard ! "
cried the <name> , grinning sympathetically .
honora threw her arms around aunt <name> and clung to her .
how small and frail she was !
somehow honora had never realized it in all her life before .
" good-by , darling , and remember to put on your thick clothes on the cool days , and write when you get to new york . "
then it was uncle <name> 's turn .
he gave her his usual vigorous hug and kiss .
" it wo n't be long until christmas , " he whispered , and was gone , helping aunt <name> off the train , which had begun to move .
<name> remained a moment .
" good-by , honora .
i 'll write to you often and let you know how they are .
and perhaps  you 'll send me a letter once in a while . "
" oh , <name> , i <name> , " she cried .
" i ca n't bear to leave you  i didn't think it would be so hard  " he held out his hand , but she ignored it .
before he realized what had happened to him she had drawn his face to hers , kissed it , and was pushing him off the train .
then she watched from the platform the three receding figures in the yellow smoky light until the car slipped out from under the roof into the blackness of the night .
some faint , <unk> <unk> of what they represented of immutable love in a changing , heedless , selfish world came to her ; rocks to which one might cling , successful or failing , happy or unhappy .
for unconsciously she thought of them , all three , as one , a human <name> in which her <name> had never been betrayed .
she felt a warm moisture on her cheeks , and realized that she was crying with the first real sorrow of her life .
she was leaving them  for what ?
honora did not know .
there had been nothing imperative in cousin <name> 's letter .
she need not have gone if she had not wished .
something within herself , she felt , was impelling her .
and it is curious to relate that , in her mind , going to school had little or nothing to do with her journey .
she had the feeling of faring forth into the world , and she had known all along that it was destined she should .
what was the cause of this longing to break the fetters and fly away ?
fetters of love , they seemed to her now  and were .
and the world which she had seen afar , filled with sunlit palaces , seemed very dark and dreary to her to-night .
" the <name> 's asking for you , miss , " said the <name> .
she made a heroic attempt to talk to mrs. <name> .
but at the sight of <name> 's <name> , when she opened it , she was blinded once more .
dear <name> !
that box was eloquent with the care with which he had studied her slightest desires and caprices .
<unk> <unk> , and <unk> , and certain chocolates which had received the stamp of her approval  and she could not so much as eat one !
the <name> made the berths .
and there had been a time when she had asked nothing more of fate than to travel in a sleeping-car !
far into the night she lay wide awake , <unk> , watching the <unk> streets of the little towns they passed , or staring at the <unk> and pastures in the darkness ; thinking of the home she had left , perhaps forever , and wondering whether they were sleeping there ; picturing them to-morrow at breakfast without her , and uncle <name> leaving for the bank , aunt <name> going through the silent rooms alone , and dear old <name> haunting the little chamber where she had slept for seventeen years  almost her lifetime .
a hundred vivid scenes of her childhood came back , and familiar objects oddly intruded themselves ; the red and green <unk> on the parlour mantel  a present many years ago from cousin <name> ; the <unk> , with its funny curly legs , and the bare spot near the lock on the door of the cake closet in the dining room !
youth , however , has its <unk> powers .
the next day the excitement of the journey held her , the sight of new cities and a new countryside .
but when she tried to eat the lunch aunt <name> had so carefully put up , new memories assailed her , and she went with mrs. <name> into the dining car .
the <name> dusk was made lurid by <unk> <unk> that reddened the heavens ; and later , when she went to bed , sharp air and towering <unk> told her of the mountains .
mountains which her great-grandfather had crossed on horse back , with that very family silver in his saddle-bags which shone on aunt <name> 's table .
and then  she awoke with the light shining in her face , and barely had time to dress before the conductor was calling out " jersey city . "
once more the morning , and with it new and wonderful sensations that dispelled her sorrows ; the ferry , the <unk> river rolling in the morning sun , alive with dodging , hurrying craft , each bent upon its destination with an energy , <unk> , and selfishness of purpose that fascinated honora .
each , with its shrill , protesting whistle , seemed to say : " my business is the most important .
make way for me . "
and yet , through them all , towering , stately , imperturbable , a great ocean steamer glided slowly towards the bay , by very might and majesty holding her way serene and undisturbed , on a nobler errand .
honora thrilled as she gazed , as though at last her dream were coming true , and she felt within her the pulse of the world 's artery .
that irksome sense of <unk> seemed to fly , and she was part and parcel now of the great , moving things , with sure pinions with which to soar .
standing rapt upon the forward deck of the ferry , she saw herself , not an atom , but one whose going and coming was a thing of consequence .
it seemed but a simple step to the deck of that steamer when she , too , would be travelling to the other side of the world , and the journey one of the small incidents of life .
the ferry bumped into its slip , the <unk> sang loudly as they took up the chains , the gates folded back , and honora was forced with the crowd along the <unk> passage to the right .
suddenly she saw cousin <name> and the girls awaiting her .
" honora , " said <name> , when the greetings were over and they were all four in the carriage , which was making its way slowly across the dirty and irregularly paved open space to a narrow street that opened between two saloons , " honora , you do n't mean to say that <name> <name> made that street dress ?
mother , i believe it 's <unk> than the one i got at <unk> 's . "
" it 's very simple , " , said honora .
" and she looks fairly radiant , " cried <name> , seizing her cousin 's hand .
" it 's quite wonderful , honora ; nobody would ever guess that you were from the west , and that you had spent the whole summer in st .
<name> . "
cousin <name> smiled a little as she contemplated honora , who sat , fascinated , gazing out of the window at novel scenes .
there was a colour in her cheeks and a <name> in her eyes .
they had reached <name> square .
<name> square , on a bright morning in late <name> , seen for the first time by an ambitious young <name> who had never been out of st. <name> !
the <unk> appointed vehicles , the <unk> horses , the glittering shops , the well-dressed women and <unk> men  all had an <unk> de corps which she found inspiring .
on such a morning , and amidst such a scene , she felt that there was no limit to the possibilities of life .
until this year , cousin <name> had been a conservative in the matter of hotels , when she had yielded to <name> 's entreaties to go to one of the " new ones . "
hotels , indeed , that <unk> transient existence .
this one , on the avenue , had a giant in a long blue livery coat who opened their carriage door , and a hall in yellow and black <unk> , and maids and <unk> .
after breakfast , when honora sat down to write to aunt <name> , she described the suite of rooms in which they lived ,  the brass beds , the electric night lamps , the mahogany french furniture , the heavy carpets , and even the <unk> bathroom .
there was a marvellous arrangement in the walls with which <name> was never tired of playing , a circular plate covered with legends of every conceivable want , from a newspaper to a needle and thread and a scotch whiskey <unk> .
at breakfast , more stimulants  of a mental nature , of course .
<name> in all his <name> had never broken eggs in such a dining room .
it had <unk> pillars , too , and gilt furniture , and table after table of the whitest <unk> stretched from one end of it to the other .
the glass and silver was all of a special pattern , and an obsequious waiter handed honora a menu in a silver frame , with a handle .
one side of the menu was in english , and the other in french .
all around them were well-dressed , well-fed , <unk> people , talking and laughing in subdued tones as they ate .
and honora had a strange feeling of being one of them , of being as <name> and prosperous as they , of coming into a <unk> inheritance .
the mad excitement of that day in new york is a faint memory now , so much has honora lived since then .
we descendants of rigid puritans , of pioneer <unk> and frontiersmen , take naturally to a luxury such as the world has never seen  as our right .
we have abolished kings , in order that as many of us as possible may abide in palaces .
in one day honora forgot the seventeen years spent in the " little house under the hill , " as though these had never been .
cousin <name> , with a delightful sense of wrong-doing , yielded to the temptation to adorn her ; and the <unk> , who knew mrs. hanbury , made <unk> .
such a figure and such a face , and just enough of height !
two new gowns were ordered , to be tried on at sutcliffe , and as many hats , and an ulster , and heaven knows what else .
memory fails .
in the evening they went to a new comic opera , and it is the music of that which brings back the day most vividly to honora 's mind .
in the morning they took an early train to sutcliffe <unk> , on the hudson .
it is an historic place .
first of all , after leaving the station , you climb through the little town clinging to the hillside ; and honora was struck by the quaint houses and shops which had been places of barter before the revolution .
the age of things appealed to her .
it was a brilliant day at the very end of <name> , the air sharp , and here and there a creeper had been struck crimson .
beyond the town , on the slopes , were other new sights to stimulate the imagination : country houses  not merely houses in the country , but mansions  <unk> hidden among great trees in a way to <unk> honora 's curiosity as she pictured to herself the blissful quality of the life which their owners must lead .
long , curving <unk> led up to the houses from occasional lodges ; and once , as though to complete the impression , a young man and two women , superbly mounted , came trotting out of one of these <unk> , talking and laughing gayly .
honora took a good look at the man .
he was not handsome , but had , in fact , a distinguished and haunting ugliness .
the girls were <unk> and conventional to the last degree .
presently they came to the avenue of elms that led up to the long , low buildings of the school .
little more <name> be necessary , in the brief account of honora 's life at boarding-school , than to add an humble word of praise on the excellence of miss turner 's establishment .
that <name> , needless to say , did not advertise in the magazines , or issue a <unk> .
parents were more or less in the situation of the candidates who desired the honour and privilege of <unk> <name> sawyer 's fence .
if you were a parent , and were allowed to confide your daughter to miss turner , instead of demanding a <unk> , you gave thanks to heaven , and spoke about it to your friends .
the life of the young ladies , of course , was regulated on the strictest principles .
early rising , prayers , breakfast , studies ; the daily walk , rain or shine , under the watchful convoy of miss hood , the girls in columns of twos ; tennis on the school court , or skating on the school pond .
cotton <unk> himself could not have disapproved of the sundays , nor of the discourse of the elderly doctor <unk> ( which you heard if you were not a presbyterian ) , although the reverend gentleman was distinctly <unk> in appearance and manners .
sometimes honora felt devout , and would follow the service with the utmost attention .
her religion came in waves .
on the sundays when the heathen prevailed she studied the congregation , grew to distinguish the local country families ; and , if the truth must be told , watched for several sundays for that ugly yet handsome young man whom she had seen on horseback .
but he never appeared , and presently she forgot him .
had there been a <unk> ( which is ridiculous !
) , the great secret of miss turner 's school could not very well have been mentioned in it .
the english language , it is to be feared , is not quite flexible enough to mention this secret with delicacy .
did honora know it ?
who can say ?
self-respecting young ladies do not talk about such things , and honora was nothing if not self-respecting .
" sutcliffe <unk> , october 15th .
" dearest aunt <name> : as i wrote you , i continue to miss you and uncle <name> dreadfully ,  and dear old <name> , too ; and <name> and <name> and <name> <name> .
and i hate to get up at seven o'clock .
and miss hood , who takes us out walking and teaches us composition , is such a ridiculously strict old maid  you would laugh at her .
and the sundays are terrible .
miss turner makes us read the bible for a whole hour in the afternoon , and reads to us in the evening .
and uncle <name> was right when he said we should have nothing but jam and bread and butter for supper : oh , yes , and cold meat .
i am always <unk> hungry .
i count the days until christmas , when i shall have some really good things to eat again .
and of course i can not wait to see you all .
" i do not mean to give you the impression that i am not happy here , and i never can be thankful enough to dear cousin <name> for sending me .
some of the girls are most attractive .
among others , i have become great friends with <name> wing , who is tall and blond and good-looking ; and her clothes , though simple , are beautiful .
to hear her imitate miss turner or miss hood or dr. <unk> is almost as much fun as going to the theatre .
you must have heard of her father  he is the mr. wing who owns all the railroads and other things , and they have a house in newport and another in new york , and a country place and a yacht .
" i like <name> <unk> very much .
she was brought up abroad , and we lead the french class together .
her father has a house in <name> , which they only use for a month or so in the year : an hotel , as the french call it .
and then there is <name> <unk> , from philadelphia , whose father is secretary of war .
i have now to go to my class in english composition , but i <name> write to you again on saturday .
" your loving niece , " honora . "
the christmas holidays came , and went by like <unk> from the window of an express train .
there was a glee club : there were dances , and private theatricals in mrs. dwyer 's new house , in which it was imperative that honora should take part .
there was no such thing as getting up for breakfast , and once she did not see uncle <name> for two whole days .
he asked her where she was staying .
it was the first christmas she remembered spending without <name> .
his present appeared , but perhaps it was fortunate , on the whole , that he was in texas , trying a case .
it seemed almost no time at all before she was at the station again , clinging to aunt <name> : but now the separation was not so hard , and she had <name> and <name> for company , and <name> , a dignified and responsible sophomore at harvard .
owing to the sudden withdrawal from school of little <name> simpson , the cincinnati girl who had shared her room during the first term , honora had a new <unk> after the holidays , <name> holt .
<name> was not beautiful , but she was good .
her nose turned up , her hair honora described as a negative colour , and she wore it in defiance of all prevailing modes .
if you looked very hard at <name> ( which few people ever did ) , you saw that she had remarkable blue eyes : they were the eyes of a saint .
she was neither tall nor short , and her complexion was not all that it might have been .
in brief , <name> was one of those girls who go through a whole term at boarding  school without any particular notice from the more brilliant <unk> and <name> wings .
in some respects , <name> was an ideal <unk> .
she read the bible every night and morning , and she wrote many letters home .
her ruling passion , next to religion , was order , and she took it upon herself to arrange honora 's bureau drawers .
it is needless to say that honora accepted these ministrations and that she found <name> 's admiration an entirely natural sentiment .
<name> was <unk> , and she enjoyed listening to honora 's views on all topics .
<name> , like <name> , was taken for granted .
she came from somewhere , and after school was over , she would go somewhere .
she lived in new york , honora knew , and beyond that was not curious .
we never know when we are entertaining an <name> unawares .
one evening , early in may , when she went up to prepare for supper she found <name> sitting in the window reading a letter , and on the floor beside her was a photograph .
honora picked it up .
it was the picture of a large country house with many chimneys , taken across a wide green lawn .
" <name> , what 's this ? "
<name> looked up .
" oh , it 's silverdale .
my brother <name> took it . "
" silverdale ? "
repeated honora .
" it 's our place in the country , " <name> replied .
" the family moved up last week .
you see , the trees are just beginning to <name> . "
honora was silent a moment , gazing at the picture .
" it 's very beautiful , is n't it ?
you never told me about it . "
" did n't i ? "
said <name> .
" i think of it very often .
it has always seemed much more like home to me than our house in new york , and i love it better than any spot i know . "
honora gazed at <name> , who had resumed her reading .
" and you are going there when school is over . "
" oh , yes , " said <name> ; " i can hardly wait . "
suddenly she put down her letter , and looked at honora .
" and you , " she asked , " where are you going ? "
" i do n't know .
perhaps  perhaps i shall go to the sea for a while with my cousins . "
it was foolish , it was wrong .
but for the life of her honora could not say she was going to spend the long hot summer in st. <name> .
the thought of it had haunted her for weeks : and sometimes , when the other girls were discussing their plans , she had left them abruptly .
and now she was aware that <name> 's blue eyes were fixed upon her , and that they had a strange and penetrating quality she had never noticed before : a certain tenderness , an understanding that made honora redden and turn .
" i wish , " said <name> , slowly , " that you would come and stay awhile with me .
your home is so far away , and i do n't know when i shall see you again . "
" oh , <name> , " she murmured , " it 's awfully good of you , but i 'm afraid  i could n't . "
she walked to the window , and stood looking out for a moment at the budding trees .
her heart was beating faster , and she was strangely uncomfortable .
" i really do n't expect to go to the sea , <name> , " she said .
" you see , my aunt and uncle are all alone in st. <name> , and i ought to go back to them .
if  if my father had lived , it might have been different .
he died , and my mother , when i was little more than a year old . "
<name> was all sympathy .
she slipped her hand into honora 's .
" where did he live ? "
she asked .
" abroad , " answered honora .
" he was consul at nice , and had a villa there when he died .
and people said he had an unusually brilliant career before him .
my aunt and uncle brought me up , and my cousin , mrs. hanbury , <name> 's mother , and <name> 's , sent me here to school . "
honora breathed easier after this confession , but it was long before sleep came to her that night .
she wondered what it would be like to visit at a great country house such as silverdale , what it would be like to live in one .
it seemed a strange and cruel piece of irony on the part of the fates that <name> , instead of honora , should have been chosen for such a life : <name> , who would have been quite as happy spending her summers in st. <name> , and taking excursions in the electric cars : <name> , who had never experienced that dreadful , <unk> feeling , who had no ambitious craving to be satisfied .
mingled with her <unk> of affection for <name> was a certain queer feeling of contempt , of which honora was ashamed .
nevertheless , in the days that followed , a certain metamorphosis seemed to have taken place in <name> .
she was still the same modest , <unk> , helpful <unk> , but in honora 's eyes she had changed  honora could no longer separate her image from the vision of silverdale .
and , if the naked truth must be told , it was due to silverdale that <name> owes the honour of her first mention in those descriptive letters from sutcliffe , which aunt <name> has kept to this day .
four days later <name> had a letter from her mother containing an astonishing discovery .
there could be no mistake ,  mrs. holt had brought honora to this country as a baby .
" why , <name> , " cried honora , " you must have been the other baby . "
" but you were the beautiful one , " replied <name> , generously .
" i have often heard mother tell about it , and how every one on the ship noticed you , and how <name> cried when your aunt and uncle took you away .
and to think we have been <unk> together all these months and did not know that we were really  old friends .
" and honora , mother says you must come to silverdale to pay us a visit when school closes .
she wants to see you .
i think , " added <name> , smiling , " i think she feels responsible , for you .
she says that you must give me your aunts address , and that she <name> write to her . "
" oh , i 'd so like to go , <name> .
and i do n't think aunt <name> would object  for a little while . "
honora lost no time in writing the letter asking for permission , and it was not until after she had posted it that she felt a sudden , sharp regret as she thought of them in their loneliness .
but the postponement of her <unk> would only be for a fortnight at best .
and she had seen so little !
in due time aunt <name> 's letter arrived .
there was no mention of loneliness in it , only of <name> that honora was to have the opportunity to visit such a place as silverdale .
aunt <name> , it seems , had seen pictures of it long ago in a magazine of the book club , in an article concerning one of mrs. holt 's charities  a model home for indiscreet young women .
at the end of the year , aunt <name> added , she had bought the number of the magazine , because of her natural interest in mrs. holt on <unk> account .
honora cried a little over that letter , but her determination to go to silverdale was unshaken .
<name> came at last , and the end of school .
the subject of miss <unk> annual talk was <unk> .
miss turner saw signs , she regretted to say , of a lowering in the ideals of american women : of a restlessness , of a <name> for what was a false consideration and recognition ; for power .
some of her own pupils , alas !
were not free from this fault .
<name> wing , who was next to honora , nudged her and laughed , and passed her some of maillard 's chocolates , which she had in her pocket .
woman's place , continued miss turner , was the home , and she hoped they would all make good wives .
she had done her best to prepare them to be such .
independence , they would find , was only relative : no one had it completely .
and she hoped that none of her scholars would ever descend to that base competition to <unk> one 's neighbours , so characteristic of the country to-day .
the friends , and even the enemies , were kissed good-by , with <unk> of eternal friendship .
cousin <name> hanbury came for <name> and <name> , and hoped honora would enjoy herself at silverdale .
dear cousin <name> !
her heart was large , and her <name> unpretentious .
she slipped into honora 's fingers , as she embraced her , a <unk> with some gold coins in it , and bade her not to forget to write home very often .
" you know what pleasure it <name> give them , my dear , " she said , as she stepped on the train for new york .
" and i am going home soon , cousin <name> , " replied honora , with a little touch of homesickness in her voice .
" i know , dear , " said mrs. hanbury .
but there was a peculiar , almost wistful expression on her face as she kissed honora again , as of one who <unk> to a fiction in order to humour a child .
as the train pulled out , <name> wing waved to her from the midst of a group of girls on the wide rear platform of the last car .
it was mr. wing 's private car , and was going to newport .
" be good , honora ! "
she cried .
volume 2 .
chapter vii .
the <unk> order lying back in the chair of the pullman and gazing over the wide hudson shining in the afternoon sun , honora 's imagination ran riot until the seeming possibilities of life became infinite .
at every click of the rails she was drawing nearer to that great world of which she had dreamed , a world of country houses inhabited by an <unk> order .
to be sure , <name> , who sat reading in the chair behind her , was but a humble representative of that order  but providence sometimes makes use of such instruments .
the picture of the tall and brilliant <name> wing standing behind the brass rail of the platform of the car was continually recurring to honora as emblematic : of <name> , in a blue <unk> gown trimmed with buff braid , and which fitted her slender figure with military exactness .
her hair , the colour of the <unk> of gold , in the manner of its finish seemed somehow to give the impression of that metal ; and the militant effect of the costume had been heightened by a small colonial cocked hat .
if the truth be told , honora had secretly <unk> miss wing , and had found her <unk> , frankness , and tendency to ridicule delightful .
militant  that was indeed <unk> note  militant and positive .
" you 're not going home with <name> ! "
she had exclaimed , making a little face when honora had told her .
" they say that silverdale is as slow as a nunnery  and you 're on your knees all the time .
you ought to have come to newport with me . "
it was characteristic of miss wing that she seemed to have taken no account of the fact that she had neglected to issue this alluring invitation .
life at silverdale slow !
how could it be slow amidst such beauty and magnificence ?
the train was stopping at a new little station on which <name> the legend , in gold letters , " sutton . "
the sun was well on his journey towards the western hills .
<name> had touched her on the shoulder .
" here we are , honora , " she said , and added , with an unusual tremor in her voice , " at last ! "
on the far side of the platform a yellow , <unk> wagon was waiting , and away they drove through the village , with its old houses and its sleepy streets and its orchards , and its ancient tavern <unk> from stage-coach days .
just outside of it , on the <unk> slope of a long hill , was a modern brick building , exceedingly practical in appearance , surrounded by spacious grounds enclosed in a paling fence .
that , <name> said , was the sutton home .
" your mother 's <name> ? "
a light came into the girl 's eyes .
" so you have heard of it ?
yes , it is the thing that interests mother more than anything else in the world . "
" oh , " said honora , " i <name> she <name> let me go through it . "
" i 'm sure she <name> want to take you there to-morrow , " answered <name> , and she smiled .
the road wound upwards , by the valley of a <name> , through the hills , now wooded , now spread with pastures that shone golden green in the evening light , the herds gathering at the <unk> .
presently they came to a <unk> stone building , with a mediaeval bridge thrown across the stream in front of it , and massive gates flung open .
as they passed , honora had a glimpse of a blue driveway under the arch of the forest .
an elderly woman looked out at them through the open half of a <unk> lattice .
" that 's the chamberlin estate , " <name> volunteered .
" mr. chamberlin has built a castle on the top of that hill . "
honora caught her breath .
" are many of the places here like that ? "
she asked .
<name> laughed .
" some people do n't think the place is very  appropriate , " she contented herself with replying .
a little later , as they climbed higher , other houses could be discerned dotted about the country-side , nearly all of them varied expressions of the passion for a new architecture which seemed to possess the <name> .
most of them were in conspicuous positions , and surrounded by wide acres .
each , to honora , was an inspiration .
" i had no idea there were so many people here , " she said .
" i 'm afraid sutton is becoming fashionable , " answered <name> .
" and do n't you want it to ? "
asked honora .
" it was very nice before , " said <name> , quietly .
honora was silent .
they turned in between two simple stone pillars that divided a low wall , overhung from the inside by shrubbery growing under the forest .
<name> seized her friend 's hand and pressed it .
" i 'm always so glad to get back here , " she whispered .
" i <name> you'll like it . "
honora returned the pressure .
the grey road forked , and forked again .
suddenly the forest came to an end in a sort of <unk> tangle of wild garden , and across a wide lawn the great house loomed against the western sky .
its architecture was of the <unk> 's and <unk> 's , with a wide <unk> that sheltered the high entrance doors .
these were both flung open , a butler and two footmen were standing <unk> beside them , and a neat maid within .
honora climbed the steps as in a dream , followed <name> through a hall with a <unk> , fretted staircase , and where she caught a glimpse of two huge chinese vases , to a porch on the other side of the house spread with wicker chairs and tables .
out of a group of people at the farther end of this porch arose an elderly <name> , who came forward and clasped <name> in her arms .
" and is this honora ?
how do you do , my dear ?
i had the pleasure of knowing you when you were much younger . "
honora , too , was gathered to that ample bosom .
released , she beheld a <name> in a <unk> satin gown , at the throat of which a <unk> brooch was fastened .
mrs. holt 's face left no room for conjecture as to the character of its possessor .
her hair , of a <unk> blend , parted in the middle , fitted tightly to her head .
she wore earrings .
in short , her appearance was in every way suggestive of momentum , of a force which the wise would respect .
" where are you , <name> ? "
she said .
" this is the baby we brought from nice .
come and tell me whether you would recognize her . "
mr. holt released his  daughter .
he had a mild blue eye , white <unk> whiskers , and very thin hands , and his tweed suit was decidedly the worse for wear .
" i ca n't say that i should , <name> , " he replied ; " although it is not hard to believe that such a beautiful baby should , prove to be such a  er  good-looking young woman . "
" i 've always felt very grateful to you for bringing me back , " said honora .
" tut , tut , child , " said mrs. holt ; " there was no one else to do it .
and be careful how you pay young women compliments , <name> .
they grow vain enough .
by the way , my dear , what ever became of your maternal grandfather , old mr. <name>  was n't that his name ? "
" he died when i was very young , " replied honora .
" he was too fond of the good things of this life , " said mrs. holt .
" my dear <name> ! "
her husband protested .
" i ca n't help it , he was , " retorted that <name> .
" i am a judge of human nature , and i was relieved , i can tell you , my dear " ( to honora ) , " when i saw your uncle and aunt on the wharf that morning .
i knew that i had confided you to good hands . "
" they have done everything for me , mrs. holt , " said honora .
the good <name> patted her approvingly on the shoulder .
" i 'm sure of it , my dear , " she said .
" and i am glad to see you appreciate it .
and now you must renew your acquaintance with the family . "
a sister and a brother , honora had already learned from <name> , had died since she had crossed the ocean with them .
<name> and <name> , <name> , remained .
both were <unk> , with rather stern faces , both had close-cropped , tan-coloured <unk> and wide jaws , with blue eyes like <name> 's .
both were , with women at least , what the french would call difficult  <name> less so than <name> .
they greeted honora <unk> and  she could not help feeling  a little suspiciously .
and their appearance was something of a shock to her ; they did not , somehow , " go with the house , " and they dressed even more carelessly than <name> <name> .
this was particularly true of <name> , whose low , <unk> collar revealed a porous , brick-red , and extremely <unk> neck , and whose clothes were creased at the knees and across the back .
as for their wives , mrs. <name> was a <name> , <unk> little <name> already <unk> to <unk> , and honora felt at home with her at once .
mrs. <name> was tall and thin , with an <name> face and dark eyes which gave the impression of an uncomfortable penetration .
she was dressed simply in a <unk> and a dark skirt , but honora thought her striking looking .
the grandchildren , playing on and off the porch , seemed legion , and they were besieging <name> .
in reality there were seven of them , of all sizes and sexes , from the third <name> with a <unk> to the youngest who was weeping at being sent to bed , and holding on to her aunt <name> with desperation .
when honora had greeted them all , and kissed some of them , she was informed that there were two more upstairs , safely tucked away in cribs .
" i 'm sure you love children , do n't you ? "
said mrs. <name> .
she spoke impulsively , and yet with a kind of childlike shyness .
" i adore them , " exclaimed honora .
a <unk> <unk> ( which some years later would have been called a <unk> ) led from the porch up the hill to an old-fashioned summer-house on the crest .
and thither , presently , <name> led honora for a view of the distant western hills <unk> in black against a flaming western sky , before escorting her to her room .
the vastness of the house , the width of the staircase , and the size of the <unk> hall impressed our heroine .
" i 'll send a maid to you later , dear , " <name> said .
" if you care to lie down for half an hour , no one <name> disturb you .
and i <name> you <name> be comfortable . "
comfortable !
when the door had closed , honora glanced around her and sighed , " comfort " seemed such a strangely inadequate word .
she was reminded of the illustrations she had seen of english country houses .
the bed alone would almost have filled her little room at home .
on the farther side , in an alcove , was a huge <unk> ; a fire was laid in the grate of the marble mantel , the curtains in the bay window were tightly drawn , and near by was a lounge with a <unk> .
a huge mahogany wardrobe occupied one corner ; in another stood a pier glass , and in another , near the lounge , was a small bookcase filled with books .
honora looked over them curiously .
" <name> <unk> " and a life of christ , " mr. <unk> , " a book of sermons by an eminent clergyman , " innocents abroad , " hare 's " walks in rome , " " when a man 's single , " by <name> , a book of meditations , and " organized charities for women . "
adjoining the bedroom was a bathroom in proportion , evidently all her own ,  with a huge porcelain tub and a table set with toilet bottles containing liquids of various colours .
dreamily , honora slipped on the new dressing-gown aunt <name> had made for her , and took a book out of the bookcase .
it was the volume of sermons .
but she could not read : she was forever looking about the room , and thinking of the family she had met downstairs .
of course , when one lived in a house like this , one could afford to dress and act as one liked .
she was aroused from her reflections by the soft but penetrating notes of a japanese gong , followed by a gentle knock on the door and the entrance of an elderly maid , who informed her it was time to dress for dinner .
" if you 'll excuse me , miss , " said that hitherto silent individual when the operation was completed , " you do look lovely . "
honora , secretly , was of that opinion too as she surveyed herself in the long glass .
the simple summer silk , of a deep and glowing pink , <unk> the colour in her cheeks , and contrasted with the dark and shining masses of her hair ; and on her neck glistened a little pendant of her mother 's jewels , which aunt <name> , with cousin <name> 's assistance , had had set in new york .
honora 's figure was that of a woman of five and twenty : her neck was a slender column , her head well set , and the look of race , which had been hers since childhood , was at nineteen more <unk> .
all this she saw , and went down the stairs in a kind of exultation .
and when on the threshold of the drawing-room she paused , the conversation suddenly ceased .
mr. holt and his sons got up somewhat precipitately , and mrs. holt came forward to meet her .
" i <name> you were n't waiting for me , " said honora , timidly .
" no indeed , my dear , " said mrs. holt .
<unk> honora 's hand under her arm , she led the way majestically to the dining-room , a large apartment with a dimly lighted conservatory at the farther end , presided over by the decorous butler and his assistants .
a huge chandelier with prisms <name> over the flowers at the centre of the table , which sparkled with glass and silver , while dishes of vermilion and yellow fruits relieved the whiteness of the cloth .
honora found herself beside mr. holt , who looked more shrivelled than ever in his evening clothes .
and she was about to address him when , with a movement as though to <unk> her , he leaned forward convulsively and began a mumbling <name> .
the dinner itself was more like a ceremony than a meal , and as it proceeded , honora found it increasingly difficult to rid herself of a curious feeling of being on probation .
<name> , who sat on her other side and ate prodigiously , scarcely addressed a word to her ; but she gathered from his remarks to his father and brother that he was interested in cows .
and mr. holt was almost exclusively occupied in slowly <unk> the special dishes which the butler impressively laid before him .
he asked her a few questions about miss turner 's school , but it was not until she had admired the mass of <unk> in the centre of the table that his eyes brightened , and he smiled .
" you like flowers ? "
he asked .
" i love them , " slid honora .
" i am the gardener here , " he said .
" you must see my garden , miss leffingwell .
i am in it by half-past six every morning , rain or shine . "
honora looked up , and surprised mrs. <name> 's eyes fixed on her with the same strange expression she had noticed on her arrival .
and for some senseless reason , she flushed .
the conversation was chiefly carried on by kindly little mrs. <name> and by mrs. holt , who seemed at once to preside and to <unk> .
she praised honora 's gown , but left a lingering impression that she thought her <unk> , without definitely saying so .
and she made innumerable  and often embarrassing  inquiries about honora 's aunt and uncle , and her life in st. <name> , and her friends there , and how she had happened to go to sutcliffe to school .
sometimes honora blushed , but she answered them all good-naturedly .
and when at length the meal had marched <unk> down to the fruit , mrs. holt rose and <name> honora out of the dining room .
" it is a little hard on you , my dear , " she said , " to give you so much family on your arrival .
but there are some other people coming to-morrow , when it <name> be <unk> , i <name> , for you and <name> . "
" it is so good of you and <name> to want me , mrs. holt , " replied honora , " i am enjoying it so much .
i have never been in a big country house like this , and i am glad there is no one else here .
i have heard my aunt speak of you so often , and tell how kind you were to take charge of me , that i have always hoped to know you sometime or other .
and it seems the strangest of coincidences that i should have <unk> with <name> at sutcliffe . "
" <name> has grown very fond of you , " said mrs. holt , graciously .
" we are very glad to have you , my dear , and i must own that i had a curiosity to see you again .
your aunt struck me as a good and sensible woman , and it was a positive relief to know that you were to be confided to her care . "
mrs. holt , however , shook her head and regarded honora , and her next remark might have been taken as a clew to her thoughts .
" but we are not very <name> at silverdale , honora . "
honora 's quick intuition detected the implication of a frivolity which even her sensible aunt had not been able to eradicate .
" oh , mrs. holt , " she cried , " i shall be so happy here , just seeing things and being among you .
and i am so interested in the little bit i have seen already .
i caught a glimpse of your girls ' home on my way from the station .
i <name> you <name> take me there . "
mrs. holt gave her a quick look , but beheld in honora 's clear eyes only eagerness and <unk> .
the change in the elderly <name> 's own expression , and incidentally in the atmosphere which enveloped her , was remarkable .
" would you really like to go , my dear ? "
" oh , yes indeed , " cried honora .
" you see , i have heard so much of it , and i should like to write my aunt about it .
she is interested in the work you are doing , and she has kept a magazine with an article in it , and a picture of the institution . "
" dear me ! "
exclaimed the <name> , now visibly pleased .
" it is a very modest little work , my dear .
i had no idea that  out in st. <name>  that the beams of my little candle had carried so far .
indeed you shall see it , honora .
we <name> go down the first thing in the morning . "
mrs. <name> , who had been sitting on the other side of the room , rose abruptly and came towards them .
there was something very like a smile on her face ,  although it was n't really a smile  as she bent over and kissed her mother-in-law on the cheek .
" i am glad to hear you are interested in  charities , miss leffingwell , " she said .
honora 's face grew warm .
" i have not so far had very much to do with them , i am afraid , " she answered .
" how should she ? "
demanded mrs. holt .
" gwendolen , you 're not going up already ? "
" i have some letters to write , " said mrs. <name> .
" <name> has helped me immeasurably , " said mrs. holt , looking after the tall figure of her <unk> , " but she has a curious , reserved character .
you have to know her , my dear .
she is not at all like <name> , for instance . "
honora awoke the next morning to a <name> , and lay for some minutes in a delicious <unk> , wondering where she was .
presently she discovered that the notes were those of a bird on a tree immediately outside of her window  a tree of wonderful perfection , the lower branches of which swept the ground .
other symmetrical trees , of many varieties , dotted a <name> lawn , which formed a great natural terrace above the <unk> valley of silver <name> .
on the grass , <unk> cobwebs gleamed in the early sun , and the breeze that stirred the curtains was charged with the damp , fresh odours of the morning .
voices caught her ear , and two figures appeared in the distance .
one she recognized as mr. holt , and the other was evidently a gardener .
the gilt clock on the mantel pointed to a quarter of seven .
it is far too late in this history to pretend that honora was , by preference , an early <unk> , and therefore it must have been the excitement caused by her surroundings that made her bathe and dress with alacrity that morning .
a housemaid was dusting the stairs as she descended into the empty hall .
she crossed the lawn , took a path through the trees that bordered it , and came suddenly upon an old-fashioned garden in all the freshness of its early morning colour .
in one of the winding paths she stopped with a little exclamation .
mr. holt rose from his knees in front of her , where he had been digging industriously with a trowel .
his greeting , when contrasted with his comparative <unk> at dinner the night before , was almost <unk>  and a little pathetic .
" my dear young <name> , " he exclaimed , " up so early ? "
he held up <unk> a <unk> palm .
" i ca n't shake hands with you . "
honora laughed .
" i could n't resist the temptation to see your garden , " she said .
a gentle light gleamed in his blue eyes , and he paused before a trellis of <name> roses .
with his gardening knife he cut three of them , and held them gallantly against her white gown .
her sensitive colour responded as she thanked him , and she pinned them deftly at her waist .
" you like gardens ? "
he said .
" i was brought up with them , " she answered ; " i mean , " she corrected herself swiftly , " in a very modest way .
my uncle is passionately fond of flowers , and he makes our little yard bloom with them all summer .
but of course , " honora added , " i 've never seen anything like this . "
" it has been a life work , " answered mr. holt , proudly , " and yet i feel as though i had not yet begun .
come , i <name> show you the <unk>  they are at their best  before i go in and make myself respectable for breakfast . "
ten minutes later , as they approached the house in amicable and even lively conversation , they beheld <name> and mrs. <name> standing on the steps under the <unk> , watching them .
" why , honora , " cried <name> , " how energetic you are !
i actually had a shock when i went to your room and found you 'd gone .
i 'll have to write miss turner . "
" do n't , " pleaded honora ; " you see , i had every inducement to get up . "
" she has been well occupied , " put in mr. holt .
" she has been admiring my garden . "
" indeed i have , " said honora .
" oh , then , you have won father 's heart ! "
cried <name> .
gwendolen holt smiled .
her eyes were fixed upon the roses in honora 's belt .
" good morning , miss leffingwell , " she said , simply .
mr. holt having removed the loam from his hands , the whole family , excepting <name> , <name> , and including an indefinite number of children , and <name> , the dignified butler , and <name> , the elderly maid , trooped into the library for prayers .
mr. holt sat down before a <unk> table at the end of the room , on which reposed a great , <unk> bible .
adjusting his spectacles , he read , in a mild but impressive voice , a chapter of <name> , while mrs. <name> tried to quiet her youngest .
honora sat staring at a figure on the carpet , uncomfortably aware that mrs. <name> was still studying her .
mr. holt closed the bible reverently , and announced a prayer , whereupon the family knelt upon the floor and leaned their elbows on the seats of their chairs .
honora did likewise , wondering at the facility with which mr. holt worded his appeal , and at the number of things he found to pray for .
her knees had begun to ache before he had finished .
at breakfast such a cheerful spirit prevailed that honora began almost to feel at home .
even <name> indulged occasionally in <unk> .
" where in the world is <name> ? "
asked mrs. holt , after they were seated .
" i forgot to tell you , mother , " little mrs. <name> <unk> up , " that he got up at an unearthly hour , and went over to grafton to look at a cow . "
" a cow ! "
sighed mrs. holt .
" oh , dear , i might have known it .
you must understand , honora , that every member of the holt family has a hobby .
<name> 's is <unk> . "
" i 'm sure i should adore them if i lived in the country , " honora declared .
" if you and <name> would only take that <name> farm , and build a house , <name> , " said mr. holt , munching the dried bread which was specially prepared for him , " i should be completely happy .
then , " he added , turning to honora , " i should have both my sons settled on the place .
<name> and <name> are sensible in building . "
" it 's cheaper to live with you , <unk> , " laughed mrs. <name> .
" <name> says if we do that , he has more money to buy cows . "
at this moment a footman entered , and presented mrs. holt with some mail on a silver tray .
" the vicomte de <unk> is coming this afternoon , <name> , " she announced , reading rapidly from a sheet on which was visible a large crown .
" he landed in new york last week , and writes to know if i could have him . "
" another of mother 's menagerie , " remarked <name> .
" i do n't think that 's nice of you , <name> , " said his mother .
" the vicomte was very kind to your father and me in <name> , and invited us to his chateau in <unk> . "
<name> was sceptical .
" are you sure he had one ? "
he insisted .
even mr. holt laughed .
" <name> , " said his mother , " i wish <name> could induce you to travel more .
perhaps you would learn that all foreigners are n't <unk> . "
" i 've had an opportunity to observe the ones who come over here , mother . "
" i wo n't have a prospective guest discussed , " mrs. holt declared , with <unk> .
" <name> , you remember my telling you last spring that <name> spence 's son called on me ? "
she asked .
" he is in business with a man named dallam , i believe , and making a great deal of money for a young man .
he is just a year younger than you , <name> . "
" do you mean that fat , <unk> boy that used to come up here and eat melons and ride my pony ? "
inquired <name> .
" <name> spence ? "
mrs. holt smiled .
" he is n't fat any longer , <name> .
indeed , he 's quite good-looking .
since his mother died , i had lost trace of him .
but i found a photograph of hers when i was clearing up my desk some months ago , and sent it to him , and he came to thank me .
i forgot to tell you that i invited him for a fortnight any time he chose , and he has just written to ask if he may come now .
i regret to say that he 's on the stock exchange  but i was very fond of his mother .
it does n't seem to me quite a legitimate business . "
" why ! "
exclaimed little mrs. <name> , unexpectedly , " i 'm given to understand that the stock exchange is quite aristocratic in these days . "
" i 'm afraid i am old-fashioned , my dear , " said mrs. holt , rising .
" it has always seemed to me little better than a gambling place .
honora , if you still wish to go to the girls ' home , i have ordered the carriage in a quarter of an hour . "
chapter viii .
a chapter of conquests honora 's interest in the institution was so lively , and she asked so many questions and praised so highly the work with which the indiscreet young women were occupied that mrs. holt patted her hand as they drove homeward .
" my dear , " she said , " i begin to wish i 'd adopted you myself .
perhaps , later on , we can find a husband for you , and you <name> marry and settle down near us here at silverdale , and then you can help me with the work . "
" oh , mrs. holt , " she replied , " i should so like to help you , i mean .
and it would be wonderful to live in such a place .
and as for marriage , it seems such a long way off that somehow i never think of it . "
" naturally , " ejaculated mrs. holt , with approval , " a young girl of your age should not .
but , my dear , i am afraid you are destined to have many admirers .
if you had not been so well brought up , and were not naturally so sensible , i should fear for you . "
" oh , mrs .
holt ! "
exclaimed honora , <unk> , and blushing very prettily .
" whatever else i am , " said mrs. holt , vigorously , " i am not a <unk> .
i am telling you something for your own good  which you probably know already . "
honora was discreetly silent .
she thought of the proud and <unk> <name> hanbury , whom she had cast down from the tower of his sophomore dignity with such apparent ease ; and of certain gentlemen at home , young and middle-aged , who had behaved foolishly during the christmas holidays .
at lunch both the roberts and the <unk> were away .
afterwards , they romped with the children  she and <name> .
they were shy at first , especially the third <name> , but honora captivated him by playing two sets of tennis in the broiling sun , at the end of which exercise he regarded her with a new-born admiration in his eyes .
he was thirteen .
" i did n't think you were that kind at all , " he said .
" what kind did you think i was ? "
asked honora , passing her arm around his shoulder as they walked towards the house .
the boy grew <name> .
" oh , i did n't think you  you could play tennis , " he stammered .
honora stopped , and seized his <name> and tilted his face upward .
" now , <name> , " she said , " look at me and say that over again . "
" well , " he replied desperately , " i thought you would n't want to get all <unk> up and hot . "
" that 's better , " said honora .
" you thought i was vain , did n't you ? "
" but i do n't think so any more , " he avowed passionately .
" i think you're a trump .
and we 'll play again to-morrow , wo n't we ? "
" we 'll play any day you like , " she declared .
it is unfair to suppose that the arrival of a real vicomte and of a young , good-looking , and successful member of the new york stock exchange were responsible for honora 's appearance , an hour later , in the embroidered linen gown which cousin <name> had given her that spring .
tea was already in progress on the porch , and if a hush in the conversation and the scraping of chairs is any sign of a sensation , this happened when our heroine appeared in the doorway .
and mrs. holt , in the act of lifting the <unk> kettle ; put it down again .
whether or not there was approval in the <name> 's <unk> eye , honora could not have said .
the vicomte , with the graceful facility of his race , had differentiated himself from the group and stood before her .
as soon as the words of introduction were pronounced , he made a bow that was a tribute in itself , exaggerated in its respect .
" it is a pleasure , mademoiselle , " he murmured , but his eyes were more eloquent .
a description of him in his own language leaped into honora 's mind , so much did he appear to have walked out of one of the many <unk> novels she had read .
he was not tall , but beautifully made , and his coat was quite absurdly cut in at the waist ; his mustache was <unk> , and its points resembled those of the spanish bayonets in the conservatory : he might have been three and thirty , and he was what the novels described as 'un <unk> <unk> ' which means that he had seen the world : his eyes were extraordinarily bright , black , and impenetrable .
a greater contrast to the vicomte than mr. <name> spence would have been difficult to find .
he was honora 's first glimpse of finance , of the powers that travelled in private cars and despatched ships across the ocean .
and in our modern mythology , he might have stood for the god of prosperity .
prosperity is pink , and so was mr. spence , in two places ,  his smooth-shaven cheeks and his shirt .
his flesh had a certain firmness , but he was not stout ; he was merely well fed , as prosperity should be .
his features were comparatively regular , his mustache a light brown , his eyes <name> .
the fact that he came from that mysterious metropolis , the heart of which is wall street , not only excused but <unk> the pink shirt and the neatly knotted green tie , the <unk> check suit that was loose and at the same time <unk> , and the jewelled ring on his plump little finger .
on the whole , mr. spence was not only prepossessing , but he contrived to give honora , as she shook his hand , the impression of being brought a step nearer to the national source of power .
unlike the vicomte , he did not appear to have been instantly and mortally wounded upon her arrival on the scene , but his greeting was flattering , and he remained by her side instead of returning to that of mrs. <name> .
" when did you come up ? "
he asked .
" only yesterday , " answered honora .
" new york , " said mr. spence , producing a gold cigarette case on which his monogram was largely and somewhat elaborately engraved , " new york is played out this time of year  is n't it ?
i dropped in at <name> 's last night for dinner , and there were n't thirty people there . "
honora had heard of <name> 's as a restaurant where one dined <unk> , and she tried to imagine the cosmopolitan and blissful existence which permitted " dropping in at " such a place .
moreover , mr. spence was plainly under the impression that she too " came up " from new york , and it was impossible not to be a little pleased .
" it must be a relief to get into the country , " she ventured .
mr. spence glanced around him <unk> , and then looked at her with a slight smile .
the action and the smile  to which she could not refrain from responding  seemed to establish a tacit understanding between them .
it was natural that he should look upon silverdale as a slow place , and there was something delicious in his taking , for granted that she shared this opinion .
she wondered a little wickedly what he would say when he knew the truth about her , and this was the birth of a resolution that his interest should not flag .
" oh , i can stand the country when it is properly inhabited , " he said , and their eyes met in laughter .
" how many inhabitants do you require ? "
she asked .
" well , " he said <unk> , " the right kind of inhabitant is worth a thousand of the wrong kind .
it is a good rule in business , when you come across a gilt-edged security , to make a specialty of it . "
honora found the compliment somewhat singular .
but she was prepared to forgive new york a few sins in the matter of commercial slang : new york , which evidently dressed as it liked , and talked as it liked .
but not knowing any more of a gilt-edged security than that it was something to mr. spence 's taste , a retort was out of the question .
then , as though she were doomed that day to <unk> , her eyes chanced to encounter an appealing glance from the vicomte , who was searching with the courage of despair for an english word , which his hostess awaited in <unk> silence .
he was trying to give his impressions of silverdale , in comparison to country places abroad , while mrs. <name> regarded him <unk> , and <name> sympathetically .
honora had an almost irresistible <name> to laugh .
" ah , madame , " he cried , still looking at honora , " <name> you have the kindness to permit me to walk about ever so little ? "
" certainly , vicomte , and i <name> go with you .
get my parasol , <name> .
perhaps you would like to come , too , <name> , " she added to mr. spence ; " it has been so long since you were here , and we have made many changes . "
" and you , mademoiselle , " said the vicomte to honora , " you <name> come  yes ?
you are interested in landscape ? "
" i love the country , " said honora .
" it is a pleasure to have a guest who is so appreciative , " said mrs. holt .
" miss leffingwell was up at seven this morning , and in the garden with my husband . "
" at seven ! "
exclaimed the vicomte ; " you american young ladies are wonderful .
for example  " and he was about to approach her to enlarge on this congenial theme when <name> arrived with the parasol , which mrs. holt put in his hands .
" we 'll begin , i think , with the view from the summer house , " she said .
" and i <name> show you how our famous american landscape architect , mr. <unk> , has treated the slope . "
there was something humorous , and a little pathetic in the contrasted figures of the vicomte and their hostess crossing the lawn in front of them .
mr. spence paused a moment to light his cigarette , and he seemed to derive infinite pleasure from this <unk> .
" got left ,  did n't he ? "
he said .
to this observation there was , obviously , no answer .
" i 'm not very strong on foreigners , " he declared .
" an american is good enough for me .
and there 's something about that fellow which would make me a little slow in trusting him with a woman i cared for . "
" if you are beginning to worry over mrs. holt , " said honora , " we'd better walk a little faster . "
mr. spence 's delight at this <name> was so unrestrained as to cause the couple ahead to turn .
the vicomte 's expression was reproachful .
" where 's <name> ? "
asked mrs. holt .
" i think she must have gone in the house , " honora answered .
" you two seem to be having a very good time . "
" oh , we 're hitting it off fairly well , " said mr. spence , no doubt for the benefit of the vicomte .
and he added in a confidential tone , " aren't we ? "
" not on the subject of the vicomte , " she replied promptly .
" i like him .
i like french people . "
" what ! "
he exclaimed , halting in his steps , " you do n't take that man seriously ? "
" i have n't known him long enough to take him seriously , " said honora .
" there 's a blindness about women , " he declared , " that's incomprehensible .
they 'll invest in almost any old thing if the certificates are beautifully engraved .
if you were a man , you wouldn't trust that frenchman to give you change for five dollars . "
" french people , " proclaimed honora , " have a light touch of which we americans are incapable .
we do not know how to relax . "
" a light touch ! "
cried mr. spence , delightedly , " that about describes the vicomte . "
" i 'm sure you do him an injustice , " said honora .
" we 'll see , " said mr. spence .
" mrs. holt is always picking up queer people like that .
she 's noted for it . "
he turned to her .
" how did you happen to come here ? "
" i came with <name> , " she replied , <unk> , " from boarding-school at sutcliffe . "
" from boarding-school ! "
she rather enjoyed his surprise .
" you do n't mean to say you are <name> 's age ? "
" how old did you think i was ? "
she asked .
" older than <name> , " he said surveying her .
" no , i 'm a mere child , i 'm nineteen . "
" but i thought  " he began , and paused and lighted another cigarette .
her eyes lighted mischievously .
" you thought that i had been out several years , and that i 'd seen a good deal of the world , and that i lived in new york , and that it was strange you did n't know me .
but new york is such an enormous place i suppose one ca n't know everybody there . "
" and  where do you come from , if i may ask ? "
he said .
" st. <name> .
i was brought to this country before i was two years old , from <name> .
mrs. holt brought me .
and i have never been out of st. <name> since , except to go to sutcliffe .
there you have my history .
mrs. holt would probably have told it to you , if i had n't . "
" and mrs. holt brought you to this country ? "
honora explained , not without a certain enjoyment .
" and how do you happen to be here ? "
she demanded .
" are you a member of  of the menagerie ? "
he had the habit of throwing back his head when he laughed .
this , of course , was a thing to laugh over , and now he deemed it audacity .
five minutes before he might have given it another name there is no use in saying that the recital of honora 's biography had not made a difference with mr. <name> pence , and that he was not a little mortified at his mistake .
what he had supposed her to be must remain a matter of conjecture .
he was , however , by no means aware how thoroughly this unknown and inexperienced young woman had read his thoughts in her regard .
and if the truth be told , he was on the whole relieved that she was nobody .
he was just an ordinary man , provided with no sixth sense or <unk> small voice to warn him that masculine creatures are often in real danger at the moment when they feel most secure .
it is certain that his manner changed , and during the rest of the walk she listened demurely when he talked about wall street , with casual references to the powers that be .
it was evident that mr. <name> spence was one who had his fingers on the pulse of affairs .
ambition leaped in him .
they reached the house in advance of mrs. holt and the vicomte , and honora went to her room .
at dinner , save for a little matter of a casual remark when mr. holt had assumed the curved attitude in which he asked <name> , mr. spence had a veritable triumph .
self-confidence was a quality which honora admired .
he was undaunted by mrs. holt , and advised mrs. <name> , if she had any <unk> , to buy new york central ; and he predicted an <name> of prosperity which would be <unk> in the annals of the country .
among other powers , he quoted the father of honora 's schoolmate , mr. <name> wing , as authority for this prophecy .
he sat next to <name> , who maintained her usual <unk> silence , but honora , from time to time , and as though by accident , caught his eye .
even mr. holt , when not munching his dried bread , was tempted to make some inquiries about the market .
" so far as i am concerned , " mrs. holt announced suddenly , " nothing can convince me that it is not gambling . "
" my dear <name> ! "
protested mr. holt .
" i ca n't help it , " said that <name> , stoutly ; " i 'm old-fashioned , i suppose .
but it seems to me like <unk> gambling . "
mr. spence took this somewhat severe arraignment of his career in admirable good nature .
and if these be such a thing as an implied wink , honora received one as he proceeded to explain what he was pleased to call the <unk> nature of the transactions of dallam and spence .
a discussion ensued in which , to her surprise , even the ordinarily <unk> <name> took a part , and maintained that the buying and selling of blooded stock was equally gambling .
to this his father laughingly agreed .
the vicomte , who sat on mrs. holt 's right , and who apparently was determined not to suffer a total eclipse without a struggle , gallantly and unexpectedly came to his hostess ' rescue , though she treated him as a doubtful ally .
this was because he declared with engaging frankness that in <name> the young men of his <unk> had a <unk> : he , who spoke to them , had gambled ; everybody gambled in <name> , where it was regarded as an innocent amusement .
he had friends on the <unk> , and he could see no difference in principle between betting on the red at <name> <name> and the rise and fall of the shares of la <unk> des <unk> , for example .
after completing his argument , he glanced triumphantly about the table , until his restless black eyes encountered honora 's , seemingly seeking a verdict .
she smiled impartially .
the subject of finance lasted through the dinner , and the vicomte proclaimed himself amazed with the evidences of wealth which confronted him on every side in this marvellous country .
and once , when he was at a loss for a word , honora astonished and enchanted him by supplying it .
" ah , mademoiselle , " he exclaimed , " i was sure when i first beheld you that you spoke my language !
and with such an accent ! "
" i have studied it all my life , vicomte , " she said , modestly , " and i had the honour to be born in your country .
i have always wished to see it again . "
monsieur de <unk> ventured the fervent <name> that her wish might soon be gratified , but not before he returned to <name> .
he expressed himself in french , and in a few moments she found herself deep in a discussion with him in that tongue .
while she talked , her veins seemed filled with fire ; and she was dimly and automatically aware of the disturbance about her , as though she were creating a magnetic storm that interfered with all other communication .
mr. holt 's nightly <unk> , which he played with <name> , did not seem to be going as well as usual , and elsewhere conversation was a palpable pretence .
mr. spence , who was attempting to entertain the two <unk> , was clearly <unk>  if his glances meant anything .
<name> and <name> had not appeared , and mrs. holt , at the far end of the room under the lamp , regarded honora from time to time over the edge of the evening newspaper .
in his capacity as a student of american manners , an unsuspected if scattered knowledge on honora 's part of that portion of french literature included between <unk> <unk> and <unk> at once dumfounded and delighted the vicomte de <unk> .
and he was curious to know whether , amongst american young ladies , miss leffingwell was the exception or the rule .
those eyes of his , which had paid to his hostess a tender respect , snapped when they spoke to our heroine , and presently he boldly abandoned literature to declare that the fates alone had sent her to silverdale at the time of his visit .
it was at this interesting juncture that mrs. holt rattled her newspaper a little louder than usual , arose majestically , and addressed mrs. <name> .
" <name> , perhaps you <name> play for us , " she said , as she crossed the room , and added to honora : " i had no idea you spoke french so well , my dear .
what have you and monsieur de <unk> been talking about ? "
it was the vicomte who , springing to his feet , replied nimbly : " mademoiselle has been teaching me much of the customs of your country . "
" and what , " inquired mrs. holt , " have you been teaching mademoiselle ? "
the vicomte laughed and shrugged his shoulders <unk> .
" ah , madame , i wish i were qualified to be her teacher .
the education of american young ladies is truly extraordinary . "
" i was about to tell monsieur de <unk> , " put in honora , wickedly , " that he must see your institution as soon as possible , and the work your girls are doing . "
" madame , " said the vicomte , after a scarcely perceptible pause , " i await my opportunity and your kindness . "
" i <name> take you to-morrow , " said mrs. holt .
at this instant a sound closely resembling a sneeze caused them to turn .
mr. spence , with his handkerchief to his mouth , had his back turned to them , and was studiously regarding the <unk> .
after honora had gone upstairs for the night she opened her door in response to a knock , to find mrs. holt on the threshold .
" my dear , " said that <name> , " i feel that i must say a word to you .
i suppose you realize that you are attractive to men . "
" oh , mrs .
holt . "
" you 're no fool , my dear , and it goes without saying that <unk> realize it  in the most innocent way , of course .
but you have had no experience in life .
mind you , i do n't say that the vicomte de <unk> is n't very much of a gentleman , but the french ideas about the relations of young men and young women are quite different and , i regret to say , less innocent than ours .
i have no reason to believe that the vicomte has come to this country to  to mend his fortunes .
i know nothing about his property .
but my sense of responsibility towards you has led me to tell him that you have no <name> , for you somehow manage to give the impression of a young woman of fortune .
not purposely , my dear  i did not mean that . "
mrs. holt tapped gently honora 's flaming cheek .
" i merely felt it my duty to drop you a word of warning against monsieur de <unk>  because he is a frenchman . "
" but , mrs. holt , i had no idea of  of falling in love with him , " protested honora , as soon as she could get her breath .
he seemed so kind  and so interested in everything .
" i dare say , " said mrs. holt , dryly .
" and i have always been led to believe that that is the most dangerous sort .
i am sure , honora , after what i have said , you <name> give him no encouragement . "
" oh , mrs. holt , " cried honora again , " i should n't think of such a thing ! "
" i am sure of it , honora , now that you are <unk> .
and your suggestion to take him to the institution was not a bad one .
i meant to do so anyway , and i think it <name> be good for him .
good night , my dear . "
after the good <name> bad gone , honora stood for some moments motionless .
then she turned out the light .
chapter ix .
in which the vicomte continues his studies mr. <name> holt , honora learned at breakfast , had two <unk> .
she had never heard of what is called <unk> , and had always believed the wood of her country to be inexhaustible .
it had never occurred to her to think of a wild forest as an example of nature 's extravagance , and so flattering was her attention while <name> explained the primary principles of caring for trees that he actually offered to show her one of the tracts on the estate which he was treating .
he could not ,  he regretted to say , take her that morning .
his other hobby was golf .
he was president of the sutton golf club , and had arranged to play a match with mr. spence .
this gentleman , it appeared , was likewise an enthusiast , and had brought to silverdale a leather bag filled with sticks .
" wo n't you come , too , miss leffingwell ? "
he said , as he took a second cup of coffee .
somewhat to the astonishment of the holt family , <name> seconded the invitation .
" i 'll bet , <name> , " said mr. spence , gallantly , " that miss leffingwell can put it over both of us . "
" indeed , i ca n't play at all , " exclaimed honora in confusion .
" and i should n't think of spoiling your match .
and besides , i am going to drive with <name> . "
" we can go another day , honora , " said <name> .
but honora would not hear of it .
" come over with me this afternoon , then , " suggested mr. spence , " and i 'll give you a lesson . "
she thanked him gratefully .
" but it wo n't be much fun for you , i 'm afraid , " she added , as they left the dining room .
" do n't worry about me , " he answered cheerfully .
he was dressed in a checked golf costume , and wore a pink shirt of a new pattern .
and he stood in front of her in the hall , glowing from his night 's sleep , evidently in a high state of amusement .
" what 's the matter ? "
she demanded .
" you did for the vicomte all right , " he said .
" i 'd give a good deal to see him going through the institution . "
" it would n't have hurt you , either , " she retorted , and started up the stairs .
once she glanced back and saw him looking after her .
at the far end of the second story hall she perceived the vicomte , who had not appeared at breakfast , coming out of his room .
she paused with her hand on the walnut post and laughed a little , so ludicrous was his expression as he approached her .
" ah , mademoiselle , que vous <unk> <unk> ! "
he exclaimed .
" but i forgive you , if you <name> not go off with that <unk> .
it must be that i see the home sometime , and if i go now it is over .
i forgive you .
it is in the bible that we must forgive our neighbour  how many times ? "
" seventy times seven , " said honora .
" but i make a condition , " said the vicomte , " that my neighbour shall be a woman , and young and beautiful .
then i care not how many times .
mademoiselle , if you would but have your portrait painted as you are , with your hand on the post , by sargent or <unk> <unk> , there would be some noise in the salon . "
" is that you , vicomte ? "
came a voice from the foot of the stairs  mrs. holt 's voice .
" i come this instant , madame , " he replied , looking over the <unk> , and added : " <unk> que je <unk> !
perhaps , when i return , you <name> show me a little of the garden . "
the duty of exhibiting to guests the sights of silverdale and the neighbourhood had so often devolved upon <name> , who was methodical , that she had made out a route , or <unk> , for this purpose .
there were some notes to leave and a sick woman and a child to see , which caused her to vary it a little that morning ; and honora , who sat in the sunlight and held the horse , wondered how it would feel to play the <name> bountiful .
" i am so glad to have you all to myself for a little while , honora , " <name> said to her .
" you are so popular that i begin to fear that i shall have to be unselfish , and share you . "
" oh , <name> , " she said , " every one has been so kind .
and i ca n't tell you how much i am enjoying this experience , which i feel i owe to you . "
" i am so happy , dear , that it is giving you pleasure , " said <name> .
" and do n't think , " exclaimed honora , " that you wo n't see lots of me , for you <name> . "
her heart warmed to <name> , yet she could not but feel a secret pity for her , as one unable to make the most of her opportunities in the wonderful neighbourhood in which she lived .
as they drove through the roads and in and out of the well-kept places , everybody they met had a bow and a smile for her friend  a greeting such as people give to those for whom they have only good-will .
young men and girls waved their <unk> at her from the <unk> ; and honora envied them and wished that she , too , were a part of the <name> life she saw , and were playing instead of being driven <unk> about .
she admired the trim , new houses in which they lived , set upon the slopes of the hills .
pleasure houses , they seemed to her , built expressly for joys which had been denied her .
" do you see much of  of these people , <name> ? "
she asked .
" not so much as i 'd like , " replied <name> , seriously .
" i never seem to get time .
we nearly always have guests at silverdale , and then there are so many things one has to attend to .
perhaps you have noticed , " she added , smiling a little , " that we are very serious and old-fashioned . "
" oh , no indeed , " protested honora .
" it is such a wonderful experience for me to be here ! "
" well , " said <name> , " we 're having some young people to dinner to-night , and others next week  that 's why i 'm leaving these notes .
and then we shall be a little livelier . "
" really , <name> , you must n't think that i 'm not having a good time .
it is exciting to be in the same house with a real french vicomte , and i like mr. spence tremendously . "
her friend was silent .
" do n't you ? "
demanded honora .
to her surprise , the usually tolerant <name> did not wholly approve of mr. spence .
" he is a guest , and i ought not to criticise him , " she answered .
" but since you ask me , honora , i have to be honest .
it seems to me that his ambitions are a little sordid  that he is too intent upon growing <name> . "
" but i thought all new <unk> were that way , " exclaimed honora , and added hastily , " except a few , like your family , <name> . "
<name> laughed .
" you should marry a <unk> , my dear , " she said .
" after all , perhaps i am a little harsh .
but there is a spirit of selfishness and  and of vulgarity in modern , fashionable new york which appears to be catching , like a disease .
the worship of financial success seems to be in every one 's blood . "
" it is power , " said honora .
<name> glanced at her , but honora did not remark the expression on her friend 's face , so intent was she on the reflections which <name> 's words had aroused .
they had reached the far end of the silverdale domain , and were driving along the shore of the lake that lay like a sapphire set amongst the green hills .
it was here that the new house of the <name> <unk> was building .
presently they came to <name> 's dairy farm , and <name> himself was standing in the doorway of one of his immaculate barn honora put her hand on <name> 's arm .
" ca n't we see the cows ? "
she asked .
<name> looked surprised .
" i did n't know you were interested in cows , honora . "
" i am interested in everything , " said honora : " and i think your brother is so attractive . "
it was at this moment that <name> , with his hands in his pockets , demanded what his sister was doing there .
" miss leffingwell wants to look at the cattle , <name> , " called <name> .
" wo n't you show them to me , mr. holt , " begged honora .
" i 'd like so much to see some really good cattle , and to know a little more about them . "
<name> appeared incredulous .
but , being of the male sex , he did not hide the fact that he was pleased , " it seems strange to have somebody really want to see them , " he said .
" i tried to get spence to come back this way , but the idea did n't seem to appeal to him .
here are some of the records . "
" records ? "
repeated honora , looking at a mass of typewritten figures on the wall .
" do you mean to say you keep such an exact account of all the milk you get ? "
<name> laughed , and explained .
she walked by his side over the concrete <unk> to the first of the varnished stalls .
" that , " he said , and a certain pride had come into his voice , " is <name> <unk> , and those ribbons are the prizes she has taken on both sides of the water . "
" is n't she a dear ! "
exclaimed honora ; " why , she 's actually beautiful .
i did n't know cows could be so beautiful . "
" she is n't bad , " admitted <name> .
" of course the good points in a cow are n't necessarily features of beauty for instance , these bones here , " he added , pointing to the hips .
" but they seem to add , somehow , to the thoroughbred appearance , " honora declared .
" that 's absolutely true , " replied <name> ,  whereupon he began to talk .
and honora , still asking questions , followed him from stall to stall .
" there are some more in the pasture , " he said , when they had reached the end of the second building .
" oh , could n't i see them ? "
she asked .
" surely , " replied <name> , with more of alacrity than one would have believed him capable .
" i 'll tell <name> to drive on , and you and i <name> walk home across the fields , if you like . "
" i should love to , " said honora .
it was not without astonishment that the rest of the holt family beheld them returning together as the gongs were sounding for luncheon .
mrs. holt , upon perceiving them , began at once to shake her head and laugh .
" my dear , it ca n't be that you have captivated <name> ! "
she exclaimed , in a tone that implied the carrying of a stronghold hitherto thought impregnable .
honora blushed , whether from victory or embarrassment , or both , it is impossible to say .
" i 'm afraid it 's just the other way , mrs. holt , " she replied ; " mr. holt has captivated me . "
" we 'll call it mutual , miss leffingwell , " declared <name> , which was for him the height of gallantry .
" i only <name> he has n't bored you , " said the good-natured mrs. <name> .
" oh , dear , no , " exclaimed honora .
" i do n't see how any one could be bored looking at such magnificent animals as that hardicanute . "
it was at this moment that her eyes were drawn , by a seemingly resistless attraction , to mrs. <name> 's face .
her comment upon this latest conquest , though <unk> , was disquieting .
and in spite of herself , honora blushed again .
at luncheon , in the midst of a general conversation , mr. spence made a remark sotto voce which should , in the ordinary course of events , have remained a secret .
" <name> , " he said , " your friend miss leffingwell is a <unk> .
she's got <name> 's scalp , too , and he thought it a pretty good joke because i offered to teach her to play golf this afternoon . "
it appeared that <name> 's eyes could flash indignantly .
perhaps she resented mr. spence 's calling her by her first name .
" honora leffingwell is the most natural and <unk> person i know , " she said .
there is , undoubtedly , a keen pleasure and an ample reward in teaching a pupil as apt and as eager to learn as honora .
and mr. spence , if he attempted at all to account for the swiftness with which the hours of that long afternoon slipped away , may have attributed their flight to the discovery in himself of hitherto latent talent for instruction .
at the little <unk> , he had bought , from the professional in charge of the course , a <name> 's driver ; and she practised with exemplary <name> the <name> of carrying one 's hands through and of using the wrists in the stroke .
" not quite , miss leffingwell , " he would say , " but so . "
honora would try again .
" that 's unusually good for a beginner , but you are inclined to chop it off a little still .
let it swing all the way round . "
" oh , dear , how you must hate me ! "
" hate you ? "
said mr. spence , searching in vain for words with which to obliterate such a false impression .
" anything but that ! "
" is n't it a wonderful , spot ? "
she exclaimed , gazing off down the <unk> , <name> green in the afternoon light between its forest walls .
in the distance , silver <name> was gleaming amidst the meadows .
they sat down on one of the benches and watched the groups of players pass .
mr. spence produced his cigarette case , and presented it to her playfully .
" a little quiet whiff , " he suggested .
" there 's not much chance over at the convent , " and she gathered that it was thus he was pleased to designate silverdale .
in one instant she was doubtful whether or not to be angry , and in the next grew ashamed of the <unk> which had caused her to suspect an insult .
she took a cigarette , and he produced a gold match case , lighted a match , and held it up for her .
honora blew it out .
" you did n't think seriously that i smoked ? "
she asked , glancing at him .
" why not ? "
he asked ; " any number of girls do . "
she tore away some of the rice paper and lifted the tobacco to her nose , and made a little <unk> .
" do you like to see women smoke ? "
she asked .
mr. spence admitted that there was something <unk> about the custom , when it was well done .
" and i imagine , " he added , " that you 'd do it well . "
" i 'm sure i should make a frightful mess of it , " she protested modestly .
" you do everything well , " he said .
" even golf ? "
she inquired mischievously .
" even golf , for a beginner and  and a woman ; you 've got the swing in an astonishingly short time .
in fact , you 've been something of an <unk> to me , " he declared .
" if i had been betting , i should have placed the odds about twenty to one against your coming from the west . "
this eastern complacency , although it did not lower mr. spence in her estimation , aroused honora 's pride .
" that shows how little new <unk> know of the west , " she replied , laughing .
" did n't you suppose there were any <unk> there ? "
" <unk> , " repeated mr. spence , as though puzzled by the word , " <unk> , yes .
but you might have been born anywhere . "
even her sense of loyalty to her native place was not strong enough to <unk> this compliment .
" i like a girl with some dash and go to her , " he proclaimed , and there could be no doubt about the one to whom he was attributing these qualities .
" <unk> faire , as the french call it , and all that .
i don't know much about that language , but the way you talk it makes mrs. <unk> french and <name> 's sound silly .
i watched you last night when you were stringing the vicomte . "
" oh , did you ? "
said honora , demurely .
" you may have thought i was talking to mrs. <name> , " he said .
" i was n't thinking anything about you , " replied honora , indignantly .
" and besides , i was n't i stringing ' the vicomte .
in the west we don't use anything like so much slang as you seem to use in new york . "
" oh , come now ! "
he exclaimed , laughingly , and apparently not the least out of countenance , " you made him think he was the only pebble on the beach .
i have no idea what you were talking about . "
" literature , " she said .
" perhaps that was the reason why you couldn't understand it . "
" he may be interested in literature , " replied mr. spence , " but it would n't be a bad guess to say that he was more interested in stocks and bonds . "
" he does n't talk about them , at any rate , " said honora .
" i 'd respect him more if he did , " he announced .
" i know those <unk> make love to every woman they meet .
i saw him eying you at lunch . "
honora laughed .
" i imagine the vicomte could make love charmingly , " she said .
mr. spence suddenly became very solemn .
" merely as a <unk> , miss leffingwell  " he began , when she sprang to her feet , her eyes dancing , and finished the sentence .
" you would advise me to be on my guard against him , because , although i look twenty-five and experienced , i am only nineteen and inexperienced .
thank you . "
he paused to light another cigarette before he followed her across the turf .
but she had the incomprehensible feminine satisfaction of knowing , as they walked homeward , that the usual serenity of his disposition was slightly ruffled .
a sudden <name> impelled her , in the privacy of her bedroom that evening , to draw his portrait for <name> <name> .
the complacency of new york men was most amusing , she wrote , and the amount of slang they used would have been deemed vulgar in st. <name> .
nevertheless , she liked people to be sure of themselves , and there was something " insolent " about new york which appealed to her .
<name> , when he read that letter , seemed to see mr. <name> spence in the flesh ; or arrayed , rather , in the kind of cloth <unk> draped in the <unk> of fashionable tailors .
for honora , all unconsciously , wrote literature .
literature was invented before <unk> , and <name> endure after them .
<name> could hear mr. spence talk , for a part of that gentleman 's conversation  a characteristic part  was faithfully <unk> .
and <name> detected a strain of admiration running even through the ridicule .
<name> showed that letter to aunt <name> , whom it troubled , and to uncle <name> , who laughed over it .
there was also a <unk> portrait of the vicomte , followed by the comment that he was charming , but very french ; but the meaning of this last , but quite obvious , attribute remained obscure .
he was possessed of one of the oldest titles and one of the oldest <unk> in <name> .
( although she did not say so , honora had this on no less authority than that of the vicomte himself . )
mrs. holt  with her victorian brooch and <unk> and her watchful <unk> eyes that somehow haunted one even when she was out of sight , with her ample bosom and the really kind heart it contained  was likewise depicted ; and mr. holt , with his dried bread , and his garden which honora wished uncle <name> could see , and his prayers that lacked imagination .
<name> and his cows , <name> and his forest , <name> and her charities , the institution , jolly mrs. <name> and <unk> mrs. <name>  all were there : and even a picture of the dinner-party that evening , when honora sat next to a young mr. patterson with glasses and a studious manner , who knew <name> hanbury at harvard .
the other guests were a <unk> miss chamberlin , whose person loudly proclaimed possessions , and a thin miss <unk> , who rented one of the silverdale cottages and sketched .
honora was seeing life .
she sent her love to <name> , and begged him to write to her .
the next morning a mysterious change seemed to have passed over the members of the family during the night .
it was <name> .
honora , when she left her room , heard a <unk> on the stairs  mrs. <name> , stiffly arrayed for the day .
even mrs. <name> <unk> , but mrs. holt , in a <unk> silk , <unk> most of all as she entered the library after a brief errand to the housekeeper 's room .
mr. holt was already arranging his <unk> in the bible , while <name> and <name> , in black <unk> that seemed to have the <unk> and paralyzing effect of <unk> , wandered aimlessly about the room , as though its walls were the limit of their movements .
the children had a subdued and <unk> air that reminded honora of her own youth .
it was not until prayers were over and the solemn gathering seated at the breakfast table that mr. spence burst upon it like an <name> .
his flannel suit was of the lightest of grays ; he wore white tennis shoes and a red tie , and it was plain , as he cheerfully bade them good morning , that he was wholly unaware of the enormity of his costume .
there was a choking , breathless moment before mrs. holt broke the silence .
" surely , <name> , " she said , " you 're not going to church in those clothes . "
" i had n't thought of going to church , " replied mr. spence , helping himself to cherries .
" what do you intend to do ? "
asked his hostess .
" read the stock reports for the week as soon as the newspapers arrive . "
" there is no such thing as a <name> newspaper in my house , " said mrs. holt .
" no <name> newspapers ! "
he exclaimed .
and his eyes , as they encountered honora 's ,  who sought to avoid them ,  expressed a genuine dismay .
" i am afraid , " said mrs. holt , " that i was right when i spoke of the pernicious effect of wall street upon young men .
your mother did not approve of <name> newspapers . "
during the rest of the meal , although he made a valiant attempt to hold his own , mr. spence was , so to speak , <unk> .
<name> and <name> must have had a secret sympathy for him .
one of them mentioned the vicomte .
" the vicomte is a foreigner , " declared mrs. holt .
" i am in no sense responsible for him . "
the vicomte was at that moment propped up in bed , complaining to his valet about the weakness of the coffee .
he made the remark ( which he afterwards repeated to honora ) that weak coffee and the protestant religion seemed inseparable ; but he did not attempt to discover the whereabouts , in sutton , of the church of his fathers .
he was not in the best of humours that morning , and his toilet had advanced no further when , an hour or so later , he perceived from behind his lace curtains mr. <name> spence , dressed with comparative <unk> , handing honora into the omnibus .
the incident did not serve to improve the cynical mood in which the vicomte found himself .
indeed , the vicomte , who had a theory concerning mr. <unk> <unk> , was not far from wrong .
as may have been suspected , it was to honora that credit was due .
it was honora whom mr. spence sought after breakfast , and to whom he declared that her presence alone prevented him from leaving that afternoon .
it was honora who told him that he ought to be ashamed of himself .
and it was to honora , after church was over and they were walking homeward together along the <name> road , that mr. spence remarked by way of a delicate compliment that " the morning had not been a total loss , after all ! "
the little presbyterian church stood on a hillside just outside of the village and was , as far as possible , the possession of the holt family .
the morning <name> illuminated the angels in the holt memorial window , and the inmates of the holt institution occupied all the back pews .
mrs. <name> played the organ , and <name> , with several young women and a young man with a long coat and plastered hair , sang in the choir .
the sermon of the elderly minister had to do with beliefs rather than deeds , and was the subject of discussion at luncheon .
" it is very like a sermon i found in my room , " said honora .
" i left that book in your room , my dear , in the <name> that you would not overlook it , " said mrs. holt , approvingly .
" <name> , i wish you would read that sermon aloud to us . "
" oh , do , mr .
holt ! "
begged honora .
the vicomte , who had been acting very strangely during the meal , showed unmistakable signs of a futile anger .
he had asked honora to walk with him .
" of course , " added mrs. holt , " no one need listen who does n't wish to .
since you were good enough to reconsider your decision and attend divine service , <name> , i suppose i should be satisfied . "
the reading took place in the library .
through the open window honora perceived the form of <name> asleep in the hammock , his <name> coat all twisted under him .
it worried her to picture his attire when he should wake up .
once mrs. <name> looked in , smiled , said nothing , and went out again .
at length , in a wicker chair under a distant tree on the lawn , honora beheld the dejected outline of the vicomte .
he was trying to read , but every once in a while would lay down his book and gaze <unk> at the house , stroking his mustache .
the low song of the bees around the shrubbery vied with mr. holt 's slow reading .
on the whole , the situation delighted honora , who bit her lip to refrain from smiling at m. de <unk> .
when at last she emerged from the library , he rose precipitately and came towards her across the lawn , lifting his hands towards the pitiless puritan skies .
" <unk> ! "
he exclaimed <unk> .
" ah , mademoiselle , never in my life have i passed such a day ! "
" are you ill , vicomte ? "
she asked .
" ill !
were it not for you , i would be gone .
you alone sustain me  it is for the pleasure of seeing you that i suffer .
what kind of a <unk> is this , then , where i am walked around institutions , where i am forced to listen to the exposition of doctrines , where the coffee is weak , where <name> , which the bon dieu set aside for a <unk> de <unk> resembles to a day in purgatory ? "
" but , vicomte , " honora laughed , " you must remember that you are in <name> , and that you have come here to study our manners and customs . "
" ah , no , " he cried , " ah , no , it can not all be like this !
i <name> not believe it .
mr. holt , who sought to entertain me before luncheon , offered to show me his collection of chinese carvings !
i , who might be at <unk> or <unk> !
if it were not for you , mademoiselle , i should not stay here  not one little minute , " he said , with a slow intensity .
" behold what i suffer for your sake ! "
" for my sake ? "
echoed honora .
" for what else ? "
demanded the vicomte , gazing upon her with the eyes of martyrdom .
" it is not for my health , alas !
between the coffee and this <unk> i have the <unk> . "
honora laughed again at the memory of the dizzy <name> afternoons of her childhood , when she had been taken to see mr. <unk> 's <unk> .
" you are cruel , " said the vicomte ; " you laugh at my tortures . "
" on the contrary , i think i understand them , " she replied .
" i have often felt the same way . "
" my instinct was true , then , " he cried triumphantly ; " the first time my eyes fell on you , i said to myself , 'ah !
there is one who understands . '
and i am seldom mistaken . "
" your experience with the opposite sex , " ventured honora , " must have made you infallible . "
he shrugged and smiled , as one whose modesty forbade the mention of conquests .
" you do not belong here either , mademoiselle , " he said .
" you are not like these people .
you have temperament , and a future  believe me .
why do you waste your time ? "
" what do you mean , vicomte ? "
" ah , it is not necessary to explain what i mean .
it is that you do not choose to understand  you are far too clever .
why is it , then , that you bore yourself by regarding institutions and listening to sermons in your <unk> ?
it is all very well for mademoiselle <name> , but you are not created for a <unk> .
and again , it pleases you to spend hours with the <unk> , who is as lacking in <unk> as the bull of <name> .
he is no companion for you . "
" i am afraid , " she said <unk> , " that you do not understand mr .
spence . "
" par <unk> ! "
cried the vicomte ; " have i not seen hundreds ' like him ?
do not they come to <name> and live in the great hotels and demand <unk> and read the stock reports and send <unk> all the day long ?
and go to the <unk> <unk> , and yawn ?
nom de nom , of what does his conversation consist ?
of the price of railroads ;  is it not so ?
i , who speak to you , have talked to him .
does he know how to make love ? "
" that accomplishment is not thought of very highly in <name> , " honora replied .
" it is because you are a new country , " he declared .
" and you are mad over money .
money has taken the place of love . "
" is money so despised in <name> ? "
she asked .
" i have heard  that you married for it ! "
" touch ! "
cried the vicomte , laughing .
" you see , i am <name> with you .
we marry for money , yes , but we do not make a god of it .
it is our servant .
you make it , and we enjoy it .
yes , and you , mademoiselle  you , too , were made to enjoy .
you do not belong here , " he said , with a <unk> sweep of the arm .
" ah , i have solved you .
you have in you the germ of the <unk> .
you were born there . "
honora wondered if what he said were true .
was she different ?
she was having a great deal of pleasure at silverdale ; even the sermon reading , which would have bored her at home , had interested and amused her .
but was it not from the novelty of these episodes , rather than from their special characters , that she received the stimulus ?
she glanced curiously towards the vicomte , and met his eye .
they had been walking the while , and had crossed the lawn and entered one of the many paths which it had been <name> 's pastime to cut through the woods .
and at length they came out at a rustic summer-house set over the wooded valley .
honora , with one foot on the ground , sat on the railing gazing over the tree-tops ; the vicomte was on the bench beside her .
his eyes sparkled and snapped , and suddenly she tingled with a sense that the situation was not without an element of danger .
" i had a feeling about you , last night at dinner , " he said ; " you reminded me of a line of <name> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ne <unk> pas <name> que <unk> des <unk> . ' "
" nonsense , " said honora ; " last night at dinner you were too much occupied with miss chamberlin to think of me . "
" ah , mademoiselle , you have read me strangely if you think that .
i talked to her with my lips , yes  but it was of you i was thinking .
i was thinking that you were born to play a part in many dramas , that you have the fatal beauty which is rare in all ages . "
the vicomte bent towards her , and his voice became caressing .
" you can not realize how beautiful you are , " he sighed .
suddenly he seized her hand , and before she could withdraw it she had the satisfaction of knowing the sensation of having it kissed .
it was a strange sensation indeed .
and the fact that she did not tingle with anger alone made her all the more angry .
trembling , her face burning , she leaped down from the railing and fled into the path .
and there , seeing that he did not follow , she turned and faced him .
he stood staring at her with eyes that had not ceased to <name> .
" how cowardly of you ! "
she cried .
" ah , mademoiselle , " he answered fervently , " i would risk your anger a thousand times to see you like that once more .
i can not help my feelings  they were dead indeed if they did not respond to such an inspiration .
let them plead for my pardon . "
honora felt herself melting a little .
after all , there might have been some excuse for it , and he made love divinely .
when he had caught up with her , his <unk> was such that she was willing to believe he had not meant to insult her .
and then , he was a frenchman .
as a proof of his <unk> , if not of his good <name> , he talked of neutral matters on the way back to the house , with the charming ease and lightness that was the gift of his race and class .
on the borders of the wood they encountered the <name> <unk> , walking with their children .
" madame , " said the vicomte to gwendolen , " your silverdale is enchanting .
we have been to that little summer-house which commands the valley . "
" and are you still learning things about our country , vicomte ? "
she asked , with a glance at honora .
chapter x .
in which honora widens her horizon if it were not a digression , it might be interesting to speculate upon the reason why , in view of their expressed opinions of silverdale , both the vicomte and mr. spence remained during the week that followed .
<name> , who went off in the middle of it with his family to the seashore , described it to honora as a normal week .
during its progress there came and went a missionary from <name> , a <unk> , an english <name> who had heard of the institution , a southern <unk> with literary gifts , a youthful architect who had not built anything , and a young lawyer interested in settlement work .
the missionary presented our heroine with a book he had written about the <unk> ; the southern <name> suspected her of literary gifts ; the architect walked with her through the woods to the rustic shelter where the vicomte had kissed her hand , and told her that he now comprehended the feelings of <name> wren when he conceived st. <name> 's cathedral , of <name> <name> when he painted the <unk> chapel .
even the serious young lawyer succumbed , though not without a struggle .
when he had first seen miss leffingwell , he confessed , he had thought her frivolous .
he had done her an injustice , and wished to acknowledge it before he left .
and , since she was interested in settlement work , he hoped , if she were going through new york , that she would let him know .
it would be a real pleasure to show her what he was doing .
best of all , honora , by her unselfishness , <unk> herself to her hostess .
" i ca n't tell you what a real help you are to me , my dear , " said that <name> .
" you have a remarkable gift with people for so young a girl , and i do you the credit of thinking that it all springs from a kind heart . "
in the meantime , unknown to mrs. holt , who might in all conscience have had a knowledge of what may be called social chemistry , a drama was slowly unfolding itself .
by no fault of honora 's , of course .
there may have been some truth in the quotation of the vicomte as applied to her  that she was destined to be loved only amidst the play of drama .
if experience is worth anything , monsieur de <unk> should have been an expert in matters of the sex .
could it be possible , honora asked herself more than once , that his feelings were deeper than her feminine instinct and , the knowledge she had <unk> from novels led her to suspect ?
it is painful to relate that the irregularity and deceit of the life the vicomte was leading amused her , for existence at silverdale was plainly not of a kind to make a gentleman of the vicomte 's temperament and habits <unk> happy .
and honora was filled with a strange and unaccountable delight when she overheard him assuring mrs. <unk> , the english <name> of <unk> tendencies , that he was engaged in a study at first hand of americans .
the time has come to acknowledge frankly that it was honora he was studying  honora as the type of young american womanhood .
what he did not suspect was that young american womanhood was studying him .
thanks to a national system , she had had an apprenticeship ; the <unk> of algernon <unk> and many others had not been shed in vain .
and the fact that she was playing with real fire , that this was a duel with the buttons off , lent a <unk> and zest to the pastime which it had hitherto lacked .
the vicomte 's feelings were by no means hidden processes to honora , and it was as though she could lift the lid of the furnace at any time and behold the growth of the flame which she had lighted .
nay , nature had endowed her with such a gift that she could read the daily temperature as by a register <name> on the outside , without getting scorched .
nor had there been any design on her part in thus tormenting his soul .
he had not meant to remain more than four days at silverdale , that she knew ; he had not meant to come to <name> and fall in love with a penniless beauty  that she knew also .
the climax would be interesting , if perchance uncomfortable .
it is wonderful what we can find the time to do , if we only try .
monsieur de <unk> lent honora novels , which she read in bed ; but being in the full bloom of health and of a strong constitution , this practice did not prevent her from rising at seven to take a walk through the garden with mr. holt  a custom which he had come insensibly to depend upon .
and in the brief conversations which she vouchsafed the vicomte , they discussed his novels .
in vain he pleaded , in caressing <unk> , that she should ride with him .
honora had never been on a horse , but she did not tell him so .
if she would but drive , or <unk> a little way  he would promise faithfully not to forget himself .
honora intimated that the period of his probation had not yet expired .
if he waylaid her on the stairs , he got but little satisfaction .
" you converse by the hour with the missionaries , and take long <unk> with the architects and <name> workers , but to me you <name> give nothing , " he complained .
" the persons of whom you speak are not dangerous , " answered honora , giving him a look .
the look , and being called dangerous , sent up the temperature several degrees .
frenchmen are not the only branch of the male sex who are complimented by being called dangerous .
the vicomte was desolated , so he said .
" i stay here only for you , and the coffee is slowly <unk> me , " he declared in french , for most of their conversations were in that language .
if there were <unk> in this , honora did not recognize it .
" i stay here only for you , and how you are cruel !
i live for you  how , the good god only knows .
i exist  to see you for ten minutes a day . "
" oh , vicomte , you exaggerate .
if you were to count it up , i am sure you would find that we talk an hour at least , altogether .
and then , although i am very young and inexperienced , i can imagine how many conquests you have made by the same arts . "
" i suffer , " he cried ; " ah , no , you can not look at me without perceiving it  you who are so heartless .
and when i see you play at golf with that mr .
spence  ! "
" surely , " said honora , " you ca n't object to my acquiring a new accomplishment when i have the opportunity , and mr. spence is so kind and good-natured about it . "
" do you think i have no eyes ? "
he exclaimed .
" have i not seen him look at you like the great animal of <name> when he wants his supper ?
he is without <unk> , without soul .
there is nothing inside of him but <unk> machinery . "
" the most valuable of all machinery , " she replied , laughingly .
" if i thought you believed that , mademoiselle , if i thought you were like so many of your <unk> in this respect , i should leave to-morrow , " he declared .
" do n't be too sure , vicomte , " she cautioned him .
if one possessed a sense of humour and a certain knowledge of mankind , the spectacle of a young and successful wall street broker at silverdale that week was apt to be <unk> .
mr. spence held his own .
he advised the architect to make a specialty of country houses , and promised some day to order one : he disputed boldly with the other young man as to the practical uses of settlement work , and even measured swords with the missionary .
needless to say , he was not popular with these gentlemen .
but he was also good-natured and obliging , and he did not object to repeating for the english <name> certain phrases which she called " picturesque expressions , " and which she wrote down with a gold pencil .
it is evident , from the vicomte 's remarks , that he found time to continue honora 's lessons in golf  or rather that she found time , in the midst of her manifold and <unk> duties , to take them .
and in this diversion she was encouraged by mrs. holt herself .
on saturday morning , the heat being unusual , they ended their game by common consent at the fourth hole and descended a wood road to silver <name> , to a spot which they had visited once before and had found attractive .
honora , after bathing her face in the pool , perched herself on a boulder .
she was very fresh and radiant .
this fact , if she had not known it , she might have gathered from mr .
silence 's expression .
he had laid down his coat ; his sleeves were rolled up and his arms were tanned , and he stood smoking a cigarette and gazing at her with approbation .
she lowered her eyes .
" well , we 've had a pretty good time , have n't we ? "
he remarked .
lightning sometimes fails in its effect , but the look she flashed back at him from under her blue lashes seldom misses .
" i 'm afraid i have n't been a very apt pupil , " she replied modestly .
" you 're on the <unk> to a cup , " he assured her .
" if i could take you on for another week " he paused , and an expression came into his eyes which was not new to honora , nor peculiar to mr .
silence .
" i have to go back to town on monday . "
if honora felt any regret at this announcement , she did not express it .
" i thought you could n't stand silverdale much longer , " she replied .
" you know why i stayed , " he said , and paused again  rather awkwardly for mr. spence .
but honora was silent .
" i had a letter this morning from my partner , <name> dallam , calling me back . "
" i suppose you are very busy , " said honora , <unk> a <unk> scale of moss from the boulder .
" the fact is , " he explained , " that we have received an order of considerable importance , for which i am more or less responsible .
something of a compliment  since we are , after all , comparatively young men . "
" sometimes , " said honora , " sometimes i wish i were a man .
women are so hampered and circumscribed , and have to wait for things to happen to them .
a man can do what he wants .
he can go into wall street and fight until he controls miles of railroads and thousands and thousands of men .
that would be a career ! "
" yes , " he agreed , smilingly , " it 's worth fighting for . "
her eyes were burning with a strange light as she looked down the vista of the wood road by which they had come .
he flung his cigarette into the water and took a step nearer her .
" how long have i known you ? "
he asked .
she started .
" why , it 's only a little more than a week , " she said .
" does it seem longer than that to you ? "
" yes , " admitted honora , colouring ; " i suppose it 's because we 've been staying in the same house . "
" it seems to me , " said mr. spence , " that i have known you always . "
honora sat very still .
it passed through her <name> , without comment , that there was a certain haunting familiarity about this remark ; some other voice , in some other place , had spoken it , and in very much the same tone .
" you 're the kind of girl i admire , " he declared .
" i 've been watching you  more than you have any idea of .
you 're <unk> .
put you down any place , and you take hold .
for instance , it 's a marvellous thing to me how you 've handled all the curiosities up there this week . "
" oh , i like people , " said honora , " they interest me . "
and she laughed a little , nervously .
she was aware that mr. spence was making love , in his own manner : the new fork manner , undoubtedly ; though what he said was changed by the new vibrations in his voice .
he was making love , too , with a characteristic lack of apology and with assurance .
she stole a glance at him , and beheld the image of a dominating man of affairs .
he did not , it is true , <unk> in her that extreme sensation which has been called a thrill .
she had read somewhere that women were always expecting thrills , and never got them .
nevertheless , she had not realized how close a bond of sympathy had grown between them until this sudden announcement of his going back to new york .
in a little while she too would be leaving for st. <name> .
the probability that she would never see him again seemed graver than she would have believed .
" <name> you miss me a little ? "
he asked .
" oh , yes , " she said breathlessly , " and i shall be curious to know how your  your enterprise succeeds . "
" honora , " he said , " it is only a week since i first met you , but i know my own mind .
you are the woman i want , and i think i may say without boasting that i can give you what you <name> in life  after a while .
i love you .
you are young , and just now i felt that perhaps i should have waited a year before speaking , but i was afraid of missing altogether what i know to be the great happiness of my life .
<name> you marry me ? "
she sat silent upon the rock .
she heard him speak , it is true ; but , try as she would , the full significance of his words would not come to her .
she had , indeed , no idea that he would propose , no notion that his heart was involved to such an extent .
he was very near her , but he had not attempted to touch her .
his voice , towards the end of his speech , had trembled with passion  a true note had been struck .
and she had struck it , by no seeming effort !
he wished to marry her !
he aroused her again .
" i have frightened you , " he said .
she opened her eyes .
what he beheld in them was not fright  it was nothing he had ever seen before .
for the first time in his life , perhaps , he was awed .
and , seeing him helpless , she put out her hands to him with a gesture that seemed to enhance her gift a <unk> .
he had not realized what he was getting .
" i am not frightened , " she said .
" yes , i <name> marry you . "
he was not sure whether  so brief was the moment !  he had held and kissed her cheek .
his arms were empty now , and he caught a glimpse of her poised on the road above him amidst the quivering , sunlit leaves , looking back at him over her shoulder .
he followed her , but she kept nimbly ahead of him until they came out into the open golf course .
he tried to think , but failed .
never in his orderly life had anything so precipitate happened to him .
he caught up with her , devoured her with his eyes , and beheld in marriage a delirium .
" honora , " he said thickly , " i ca n't grasp it . "
she gave him a quick look , and a smile quivered at the corners of her mouth .
" what are you thinking of ? "
he asked .
" i am thinking of mrs. holt 's expression when we tell her , " said honora .
" but we <name> n't tell her yet , shall we , <name> ?
we 'll have it for our own secret a little while . "
the golf course being deserted , he pressed her arm .
" we 'll tell her whenever you like , dear , " he replied .
in spite of the fact that they drove <name> 's trotter to lunch  much too rapidly in the heat of the day , they were late .
" i shall never be able to go in there and not give it away , " he whispered to her on the stairs .
" you look like the cheshire cat in the tree , " whispered honora , laughing , " only more purple , and not so <unk> . "
" i know i 'm smiling , " replied <name> , " i feel like it , but i ca n't help it .
it wo n't come off .
i want to <unk> out the news to every one in the dining-room  to that little frenchman , in particular . "
honora laughed again .
her imagination easily summoned up the <unk> which such a proceeding would bring forth .
the incredulity , the chagrin , the indignation , even , in some quarters .
he conceived the household , with the exception of the vicomte , <unk> themselves into his arms .
honora , who was cool enough herself ( no doubt owing to the superior training which women receive in matters of deportment ) , observed that his entrance was not a triumph of <unk> .
his colour was high , and his expression , indeed , a little idiotic ; and he declared afterwards that he felt like a <unk> , with the news printed in red letters before and behind .
honora knew that the intense improbability of the truth would save them , and it did .
mrs. holt remarked , slyly , that the game of golf must have hidden attractions , and regretted that she was too old to learn it .
" we went very slowly on account of the heat , " <name> declared .
" i should say that you had gone very rapidly , from your face , " retorted mrs. holt .
in relaxing moods she indulged in banter .
honora stepped into the breach .
she would not trust her newly acquired <unk> to extricate himself .
" we were both very much worried , mrs. holt , " she explained , " because we were late for lunch once before . "
" i suppose i 'll have to forgive you , my dear , especially with that colour .
i am modern enough to approve of exercise for young girls , and i am sure your aunt <name> <name> think silverdale has done you good when i send you back to her . "
" oh , i 'm sure she <name> , " said honora .
in the meantime mr. spence was concentrating all of his attention upon a <unk> egg .
honora glanced at the vicomte .
he sat very stiff , and his manner of twisting his mustache reminded her of an animal sharpening its claws .
it was at this moment that the butler handed her a telegram , which , with mrs. holt 's permission , she opened and read twice before the meaning of it came to her .
" i <name> it is no bad news , honora , " said mrs. holt .
" it 's from <name> <name> , " she replied , still a little dazed .
" he 's in new york .
and he 's <unk> up on the five o'clock train to spend an hour with me . "
" oh , " said <name> ; " i remember his picture on your bureau at sutcliffe .
he had such a good face .
and you told me about him . "
" he is like my brother , " honora explained , aware that <name> was looking at her .
" only he is much older than i .
he used to wheel me up and down when i was a baby .
he was , an errand boy in the bank then , and uncle <name> took an interest in him , and now he is a lawyer .
a very good one , i believe . "
" i have a great respect for any man who makes his own way in life , " said mrs. holt .
" and since he is such an old friend , my dear , you must ask him to spend the night . "
" oh , thank you , mrs. bolt , " honora answered .
it was , however , with mingled feelings that she thought of peter's arrival at this time .
life , indeed , was full of strange coincidences !
there was a little door that led out of the house by the billiard room , honora remembered , and contrived , after luncheon , to slip away and reach it .
she felt that she must be alone , and if she went to her room she was likely to be disturbed by <name> or mrs. <name>  or indeed mrs. holt herself .
honora meant to tell <name> the first of all .
she crossed the great lawn quickly , keeping as much as possible the trees and masses of shrubbery between herself and the house , and reached the forest .
with a really large fund of energy at her disposal , honora had never been one to believe in the useless expenditure of it ; nor did she feel the intense <name> which a girl of another temperament might have had , under the same conditions , to keep in motion .
so she sat down on a bench within the borders of the wood .
it was not that she wished to reflect , in the ordinary meaning of the word , that she had sought seclusion , but rather to give her imagination free play .
the enormity of the change that was to come into her life did not <unk> her in the least ; but she had , in connection with it , a sense of unreality which , though not unpleasant , she sought unconsciously to <unk> .
<name> spence , she reflected with a smile , was surely solid and substantial enough , and she thought of him the more tenderly for the possession of these attributes .
a castle founded on such a rock was not a castle in spain !
it did not occur to honora that her thoughts might be more of the castle than of the rock : of the heaven he was to hold on his shoulders than of the hercules she had chosen to hold it .
she would write to her aunt <name> and her uncle <name> that very afternoon  one letter to both .
tears came into her eyes when she thought of them , and of their lonely life ' without her .
but they would come on to new york to visit her often , and they would be proud of her .
of one thing she was sure  she must go home to them at once  on tuesday .
she would tell mrs. holt to-morrow , and <name> to-night .
and , while pondering over the probable expression of that <name> 's amazement , it suddenly occurred to her that she must write the letter immediately , because <name> <name> was coming .
what would he say ?
should she tell him ?
she was surprised to find that the idea of doing so was painful to her .
but she was aroused from these reflections by a step on the path , and raised her head to perceive the vicomte .
his face wore an expression of triumph .
" at last , " he cried , " at last ! "
and he sat down on the bench beside her .
her first impulse was to rise , yet for some inexplicable reason she remained .
" i always suspected in you the qualities of a monsieur lecoq , " she remarked .
" you have an instinct for the <name> . "
" mon dieu ? "
he said .
" i have risked a stroke of the sun to find you .
why should you so continually run away from me ? "
" to test your ingenuity , vicomte . "
" and that other one  the <unk>  you do not avoid him .
diable , i am not blind , mademoiselle .
it is plain to me at luncheon that you have made boil the sluggish blood of that one .
as for me  " " your <unk> is lower , " she said , smiling .
" listen , mademoiselle , " he pursued , bending towards her .
" it is not for my health that i stay here , as i have told you .
it is for the sight of you , for the sound of the music of that low voice .
it is in the <name> that you <name> be a little kinder , that you <name> understand me a little better .
and to-day , when i learn that still another is on his way to see you , i could sit still no longer .
i do not fear that spence ,  no .
but this other  what is he like ? "
" he is the best type of american , " replied honora .
" i am sure you <name> be interested in him , and like him . "
the vicomte shrugged his shoulders .
" it is not in <name> that you <name> find your <name> , mademoiselle .
you are made to <name> a salon , a court , which you <name> not find in this country .
such a woman as you is thrown away here .
you possess qualities  you <name> pardon me  in which your <unk> are lacking ,  <unk> , imagination , <unk> , the power to bind people to you .
i have read you as you have not read yourself .
i have seen how you have served yourself by this <unk> holt , and how at the same time you have kept their friendship . "
" vicomte ! "
she exclaimed .
" ah , do not get angry , " he begged ; " such gifts are rare  they are sublime .
they lead , " he added , raising his arms , " to the heights . "
honora was silent .
she was , indeed , not unmoved by his voice , into which there was creeping a vibrant note of passion .
she was a little frightened , but likewise puzzled and interested .
this was all so different from what she had expected of him .
what did he mean ?
was she indeed like that ?
she was aware that he was speaking again , that he was telling her of a chateau in <name> which his ancestors had owned since the days of <name> xii ; a grey pile that stood upon a thickly wooded height ,  a chateau with a banquet hall , where kings had dined , with a chapel where kings had prayed , with a flowering terrace high above a gleaming river .
it was there that his childhood had been passed .
and as he spoke , she listened with mingled feelings , picturing the pageantry of life in such a place .
" i tell you this , mademoiselle , " he said , " that you may know i am not what you call an adventurer .
many of these , alas !
come to your country .
and i ask you to regard with some <unk> customs which must be strange to americans .
when we marry in <name> , it is with a <name> , and especially is it necessary amongst the families of our nobility . "
honora rose , the blood mounting to her temples .
" mademoiselle , " he cried , " do not misunderstand me .
i would die rather than hurt your feelings .
listen , i pray .
it was to tell you frankly that i came to this country for that purpose ,  in order that i might live as my ancestors have lived , with a hotel in <name> : but the chateau , <name> a dieu , is not mortgaged , nor am i wholly <unk> .
i have <unk> <unk> mille livres de <unk> , which is fifteen thousand dollars a year in your money , and which goes much farther in <name> .
at the proper time , i <name> present these matters to your guardians .
i have lived , but i have a heart , and i love you madly .
rather would i dwell with you in <unk> , where i <name> cultivate the soil of my forefathers , than a palace on the <unk> <unk> with another .
we can come to <name> for two months , at least .
for you i can throw my prospects out of the window with a light heart .
<unk>  how sweet is your name in my language  i love you to despair . "
he seized her hand and pressed it to his lips , but she <name> it gently away .
it seemed to her that he had made the very air quiver with feeling , and she let herself wonder , for a moment , what life with him would be .
incredible as it seemed , he had proposed to her , a penniless girl !
her own voice was not quite steady as she answered him , and her eyes were filled with compassion .
" vicomte , " she said , " i did not know that you cared for me  that way .
i thought  i thought you were amusing yourself . "
" amusing myself ! "
he exclaimed bitterly .
" and you  were you amusing yourself ? "
" i  i tried to avoid you , " she replied , in a low voice .
" i am engaged . "
" engaged ! "
he sprang to his feet .
" engaged !
ah , no , i <name> not believe it .
you were engaged when you came here ? "
she was no little alarmed by the violence which he threw into his words .
at the same time , she was indignant .
and yet a mischievous sprite within her led her on to tell him the truth .
" no , i am going to marry mr. <name> spence , although i do not wish it announced . "
for a moment he stood motionless , speechless , staring at her , and then he seemed to sway a little and to choke .
" no , no , " he cried , " it can not be !
my ears have deceived me .
i am not sane .
you are going to marry him  ?
ah , you have sold yourself . "
" monsieur de <unk> , " she said , " you forget yourself .
mr. spence is an honourable man , and i love him . "
the vicomte appeared to choke again .
and then , suddenly , he became himself , although his voice was by no means natural .
his elaborate and <unk> bow she remembered for many years .
" pardon , mademoiselle , " he said , " and adieu .
you <name> be good enough to convey my congratulations to mr .
spence . "
with a kind of military " about face " he turned and left her abruptly , and she watched him as he hurried across the lawn until he had disappeared behind the trees near the house .
when she sat down on the bench again , she found that she was trembling a little .
was the unexpected to occur to her from now on ?
was it true , as the vicomte had said , that she was destined to be loved amidst the play of drama ?
she felt sorry for him because he had loved her enough to fling to the winds his chances of wealth for her sake  a sufficient measure of the feelings of one of his nationality and caste .
and she permitted , for an instant , her mind to linger on the supposition that <name> spence had never come into her life ; might she not , when the vicomte had made his unexpected and generous <unk> , have accepted him ?
she thought of the romances of her childish days , written at fever heat , in which ladies with titles moved around and gave commands and rebuked lovers who slipped in through wicket gates .
and to think that she might have been a vicomtesse and have lived in a castle !
a poor vicomtesse , it is true .
chapter xi .
what might have been honora sat still upon the bench .
after an indefinite period she saw through the trees a vehicle on the driveway , and in it a single passenger .
and suddenly it occurred to her that the passenger must be <name> , for mrs. holt had announced her intention of sending for him .
she arose and approached the house , not without a sense of agitation .
she halted a moment at a little distance from the porch , where he was talking with <name> spence and <name> , and the fact that he was an unchanged <name> came to her with a shock of surprise .
so much , in less than a year , had happened to honora !
and the sight of him , and the sound of his voice , brought back with a rush memories of a forgotten past .
how long it seemed since she had lived in st. <name> !
yes , he was the same <name> , but her absence from him had served to sharpen her sense of certain characteristics .
he was lounging in his chair with his long legs crossed , with one hand in his pocket , and talking to these men as though he had known them always .
there was a quality about him which had never struck her before , and which eluded exact definition .
it had never occurred to her , until now , when she saw him out of the element with which she had always associated him , that <name> <name> had a personality .
that personality was a mixture of simplicity and self-respect and  common sense .
and as honora listened to his cheerful voice , she perceived that he had the gift of expressing himself clearly and forcibly and withal modestly ; nor did it escape her that the other two men were listening with a certain deference .
in her sensitive state she tried to evade the contrast thus suddenly presented to her between <name> and the man she had promised , that very morning , to marry .
<name> spence was seated on the table , smoking a cigarette .
never , it seemed , had he more distinctly <unk> to her prosperity .
an attribute which she had admired in him , of strife without the appearance of strife , lost something of its value .
to look at <name> was to wonder whether there could be such a thing as a <unk> <unk> ; and until to-day she had never thought of <name> as a <unk> .
the sight of his <name> face summoned , all <unk> , the vague vision of an ideal , and perhaps it was this that caused her voice to falter a little as she came forward and called his name .
he rose precipitately .
" what a surprise , <name> ! "
she said , as she took his hand .
" how do you happen to be in the east ? "
" an errand boy , " he replied .
" somebody had to come , so they chose me .
incidentally , " he added , smiling down at her , " it is a part of my education . "
" we thought you were lost , " said <name> spence , significantly .
" oh , no , " she answered lightly , <unk> his look .
" i was on the bench at the edge of the wood . "
she turned again to <name> .
" how good of you to come up and see me ! "
" i could n't have resisted that , " he declared , " if it were only for an hour . "
" i 've been trying to persuade him to stay a while with us , " <name> put in with unusual <unk> .
" my mother <name> be disappointed not to see you . "
" there is nothing i should like better , mr. holt , " said <name> , simply , gazing off across the lawn .
" unfortunately i have to leave for the west to-night . "
" before you go , " said honora , " you must see this wonderful place .
come , we 'll begin with the garden . "
she had a <name> now to take him away by himself , something she had wished , an hour ago , to avoid .
" would n't you like a runabout ? "
suggested <name> , hospitably .
honora thanked him .
" i 'm sure mr. <name> would rather walk , " she replied .
" come , <name> , you must tell me all the news of home . "
spence accepted his dismissal with a fairly good <name> , and gave no evidence of jealousy .
he put his hand on <name> 's shoulder .
" if you 're ever in new york , <name> , " said he , " look me up dallam and spence .
we 're members of the exchange , so you wo n't have any trouble in finding us .
i 'd like to talk to you sometime about the west . "
<name> thanked him .
for a little while , as they went down the driveway side by side , he was meditatively silent .
she wondered what he thought of <name> spence , until suddenly she remembered that her secret was still her own , that <name> had as yet no particular reason to single out mr. spence for especial consideration .
she could not , however , resist saying , " new <unk> are like that . "
" like what ? "
he asked .
she coloured .
" like  mr. spence .
a little  <unk> , sure of themselves . "
she strove to keep out of her voice any suspicion of the agitation which was the result of the events of an extraordinary day , not yet ended .
she knew that it would have been wiser not to have mentioned <name> ; but <name> 's silence , somehow , had impelled her to speak .
" he has made quite an unusual success for so young a man . "
<name> looked at her and shook his head .
" new york  success !
what is to become of poor old st .
<name> ? "
he inquired .
" oh , i 'm going back next week , " honora cried .
" i wish i were going with you . "
" and leave all this , " he said incredulously , " for trolley rides and forest park and  and me ? "
he stopped in the garden path and looked upon the picture she made standing in the sunlight against the blazing borders , her wide hat casting a shadow on her face .
and the smile which she had known so well since childhood , indulgent , quizzical , with a touch of sadness , was in his eyes .
she was conscious of a slight resentment .
was there , in fact , no change in her as the result of the events of those momentous ten months since she had seen him ?
and rather than a tolerance in which there was neither antagonism nor envy , she would have preferred from <name> an open disapproval of luxury , of the standards which he implied were hers .
she felt that she had stepped into another world , but he refused to be dazzled by it .
he insisted upon treating her as the same honora .
" how did you leave uncle <name> and aunt <name> ? "
she asked .
they were counting the days , he said , until she should return , but they did not wish to curtail her visit .
they did not expect her next week , he knew .
honora coloured again .
" i feel  that i ought to go to them , " she said .
he glanced at her as though her determination to leave silverdale so soon surprised him .
" they <name> be very happy to see you , honora , " he said .
" they have been very lonesome . "
she softened .
some unaccountable impulse prompted her to ask : " and you ?
have you missed me  a little ? "
he did not answer , and she saw that he was profoundly affected .
she laid a hand upon his arm .
" oh , <name> , i did n't mean that , " she cried .
" i know you have .
and i have missed you  terribly .
it seems so strange seeing you here , " she went on hurriedly .
" there are so many ' things i want to show you .
tell me how it happened hat you came on to new york . "
" somebody in the firm had to come , " he said .
" in the firm ! "
she repeated .
she did not grasp the full meaning of this change in his status , but she remembered that uncle <name> had predicted it one day , and that it was an honour .
" i never knew any one so secretive about their own affairs !
why did n't you write me you had been admitted to the firm ?
so you are a partner of judge <name> . "
" <name> , graves , and <name> , " said <name> ; " it sounds very grand , doesn't it ?
i ca n't get used to it myself . "
" and what made you call yourself an errand boy ? "
she exclaimed reproachfully .
" when i go back to the house i intend to tell <name> holt and  and mr. spence that you are a great lawyer . "
<name> laughed .
" you 'd better wait a few years before you say that , " said he .
he took an interest in everything he saw , in mr. holt 's flowers , in <name> 's cow barn , which they traversed , and declared , if he were ever <name> enough , he would live in the country .
they walked around the pond ,  fringed now with yellow water-lilies on their floating green pads ,  through the woods , and when the shadows were <unk> came out at the little summer-house over the valley of silver <name>  the scene of that first memorable encounter with the vicomte .
at the sight of it the episode , and much else of recent happening , rushed back into honora 's mind , and she realized with suddenness that she had , in his companionship , unconsciously been led far afield and in pleasant places .
comparisons seemed inevitable .
she watched him with an unwonted tugging at her heart as he stood for a long time by the edge of the railing , gazing over the tree-tops of the valley towards the distant hazy hills .
nor did she understand what it was in him that now , on this day of days when she had definitely cast the die of life , when she had chosen her path , aroused this strange emotion .
why had she never felt it before ?
she had thought his face homely  now it seemed to shine with a <unk> light .
she recalled , with a pang , that she had criticised his clothes : to-day they seemed the expression of the man himself .
incredible is the range of human emotion !
she felt a longing to throw herself into his arms , and to weep there .
he turned at length from the view .
" how wonderful ! "
he said .
" i did n't know  you cared for nature so much , <name> . "
he looked at her strangely and put out his hand and <name> her , unresisting , to the bench beside him .
" are you in trouble , honora ? "
he asked .
" oh , no , " she cried , " oh , no , i am  very happy . "
" you may have thought it odd that i should have come here without knowing mrs. holt , " he said gravely , " particularly when you were going home so soon .
i do not know myself why i came .
i am a matter-of-fact person , but i acted on an impulse . "
" an impulse ! "
she faltered , avoiding the troubled , searching look in his eyes .
" yes , " he said , " an impulse .
i can call it by no other name .
i should have taken a train that leaves new york at noon ; but i had a feeling this morning , which seemed almost like a presentiment , that i might be of some use to you . "
" this morning ? "
she felt herself trembling , and she scarcely recognized <name> with such words on his lips .
" i am happy  indeed i am .
only  i am <unk>  seeing you again  and you made me think of home . "
" it was no doubt very foolish of me , " he declared .
" and if my coming has upset you  " " oh , no , " she cried .
" please do n't think so .
it has given me a sense of  of security .
that you were ready to help me if  if i needed you . "
" you should always have known that , " he replied .
he rose and stood gazing off down the valley once more , and she watched him with her heart beating , with a sense of an impending crisis which she seemed powerless to <unk> off .
and presently he turned to her , " honora , i have loved you for many years , " he said .
" you were too young for me to speak of it .
i did not intend to speak of it when i came here to-day .
for many years i have hoped that some day you might be my wife .
my one fear has been that i might lose you .
perhaps  perhaps it has been a dream .
but i am willing to wait , should you wish to see more of the world .
you are young yet , and i am offering myself for all time .
there is no other woman for me , and never can be . "
he paused and smiled down at her .
but she did not speak .
she could not .
" i know , " he went on , " that you are ambitious .
and with your gifts i do not blame you .
i can not offer you great wealth , but i say with confidence that i can offer you something better , something surer .
i can take care of you and protect you , and i <name> devote my life to your happiness .
<name> you marry me ? "
her eyes were sparkling with tears ,  tears , he remembered afterwards , that were like blue diamonds .
" oh , <name> , " she cried , " i wish i could !
i have always  wished that i could .
i ca n't . "
" you ca n't ? "
she shook her head .
" i  i have told no one yet  not even aunt <name> .
i am going to marry mr .
spence . "
for a long time he was silent , and she did not dare to look at the suffering in his face .
" honora , " he said at last , " my most <name> wish in life <name> be for your happiness .
and whatever may , come to you i <name> that you <name> remember that i am your friend , to be counted on .
and that i shall not change .
<name> you remember that ? "
" yes , " she whispered .
she looked at him now , and through the veil of her tears she seemed to see his soul shining in his eyes .
the tones of a distant church <name> were borne to them on the valley breeze .
<name> glanced at his watch .
" i am afraid , " he said , " that i have n't time to go back to the house  my train goes at seven .
can i get down to the village through the valley ? "
honora pointed out the road , faintly perceptible through the trees beneath them .
" and you <name> apologize for my departure to mrs .
holt ? "
she nodded .
he took her hand , pressed it , and was gone .
and presently , in a little clearing far below , he turned and waved his hat at her bravely .
chapter xii .
which contains a surprise for mrs. holt how long she sat gazing with <unk> eyes down the valley honora did not know .
distant mutterings of thunder aroused her ; the evening sky had darkened , and <unk> clouds of purple were gathering over the hills .
she rose and hurried homeward .
she had thought to enter by the billiard-room door , and so gain her own chamber without encountering the household ; but she had reckoned without her hostess .
beyond the billiard room , in the little entry filled with potted plants , she came face to face with that <name> , who was <unk> a footman to further efforts in his attempt to close a <unk> skylight .
honora proved of more interest , and mrs. holt abandoned the skylight .
" why , my dear , " she said , " where have you been all afternoon ? "
" i  i have been walking with mr. <name> , mrs. holt .
i have been showing him silverdale . "
" and where is he ?
it seems to me i invited him to stay all night , and <name> tells me he extended the invitation . "
" we were in the little summer-house , and suddenly he discovered that it was late and he had to catch the seven o'clock train , " faltered honora , somewhat <unk> .
" otherwise he would have come to you himself and told you  how much he regretted not staying .
he has to go to st. <name> to-night . "
" well , " said mrs. holt , " this is an afternoon of surprises .
the vicomte has gone off , too , without even waiting to say good-by . "
" the vicomte ! "
exclaimed honora .
" did n't you see him , either , before he left ? "
inquired mrs. holt ; " i thought perhaps you might be able to give me some further explanation of it . "
" i ? "
exclaimed honora .
she felt ready to sink through the floor , and mrs. holt 's <unk> eyes haunted her afterwards like a nightmare .
" did n't you see him , my dear ?
did n't he tell you anything ? "
" he  he did n't say he was going away . "
" did he seem disturbed about anything ? "
mrs. holt insisted .
" now i think of it , he did seem a little disturbed . "
" to save my life , " said mrs. holt , " i ca n't understand it .
he left a note for me saying that he had received a telegram , and that he had to go at once .
i was at a meeting of my <name> board .
it seems a very strange proceeding for such an agreeable and polite man as the vicomte , although he had his drawbacks , as all <unk> have .
and at times i thought he was grave and moody ,  did n't you ? "
" oh , yes , he was moody , " honora agreed eagerly .
" you noticed it , too , " said mrs. holt .
" but he was a charming man , and so interested in <name> and in the work we are doing .
but i can't understand about the telegram .
i had <name> inquire of every servant in the house , and there is no knowledge of a telegram having come up from the village this afternoon . "
" perhaps the vicomte might have met the messenger in the grounds , " hazarded honora .
at this point their attention was distracted by a noise that bore a striking resemblance to a suppressed laugh .
the footman on the <unk> began to rattle the skylight vigorously .
" what on earth is the matter with you , woods ? "
said mrs. holt .
" it must have been some dust off the skylight , madam , that got into my throat , " he stammered , the colour of a geranium .
" nonsense , " said mrs. holt , " there is no dust on the skylight . "
" it may be i swallowed the wrong way , looking up like , as i was , madam , " he ventured , rubbing the frame and looking at his finger to prove his former theory .
" you are very stupid not to be able to close it , " she declared ; " in a few minutes the place <name> be flooded .
tell <name> to come and do it . "
honora suffered herself to be led limply through the library and up the stairs into mrs. holt 's own boudoir , where a maid was closing the windows against the first great drops of the storm , which the wind was pelting against them .
she <name> the shades deftly , lighted the gas , and retired .
honora sank down in one of the <unk> light blue satin chairs and gazed at the shining brass of the coal grate set in the marble mantel , above which <name> an engraving of sir <name> <unk> <unk> .
she had an instinct that the climax of the drama was at hand .
mrs. holt sat down in the chair opposite .
" my dear , " she began , " i told you the other day what an unexpected and welcome comfort and help you have been to me .
you evidently inherit " ( mrs. holt coughed slightly ) " the <name> of entertaining and pleasing , and i need not warn you , my dear , against the dangers of such a gift .
your aunt has evidently brought you up with strictness and religious care .
you have been very fortunate . "
" indeed i have , mrs. holt , " echoed honora , in bewilderment .
" and <name> , " continued mrs. holt , " useful and willing as she is , does not possess your gift of taking people off my hands and entertaining them . "
honora could think of no reply to this .
her eyes  to which no one could be indifferent  were riveted on the face of her hostess , and how was the good <name> to guess that her <name> was reeling ?
" i was about to say , my dear , that i expect to have a great deal of  well , of rather difficult company this summer .
next week , for instance , some prominent women in the working girls ' relief society are coming , and on july the twenty-third i give a garden party for the delegates to the <name> conference in new york .
the japanese minister has promised to pay me a visit , and sir <name> <name> , who built those remarkable <unk> homes in england , you know , is arriving in <name> with his family .
then there are some foreign artists . "
" oh , mrs. holt , " exclaimed honora ; " how many interesting people you see ! "
" exactly , my dear .
and i thought that , in addition to the fact that i have grown very fond of you , you would be very useful to me here , and that a summer with me might not be without its advantages .
as your aunt <name> have you until you are married , which , i may say , without denying your attractions , is likely to be for some time , i intend to write to her to-night  with your consent  and ask her to allow you to remain with me all summer . "
honora sat transfixed , staring painfully at the big pendant <unk> .
" it is so kind of you , mrs. holt  " she faltered .
" i can realize , my dear , that you would wish to get back to your aunt .
the feeling does you infinite credit .
but , on the other hand , besides the advantages which would <unk> to you , it might , to put the matter delicately , be of a little benefit to your relations , who <name> have to think of your future . "
" indeed , it is good of you , but i must go back , mrs .
holt . "
" of course , " said mrs. holt , with a touch of dignity  for ere now people had left silverdale before she wished them to  " of course , if you do not care to stay , that is quite another thing . "
" oh , mrs. holt , do n't say that ! "
cried honora , her face burning ; " i can not thank you enough for the pleasure you have given me .
if  if things were different , i would stay with you gladly , although i should miss my family .
but now ,  now i feel that i must be with them .
i  i am engaged to be married . "
honora still remembers the blank expression which appeared on the countenance of her hostess when she spoke these words .
mrs. <unk> cheeks twitched , her <unk> quivered , and her bosom <unk> .
" engaged to be married ! "
she gasped .
" yes , " replied our heroine , humbly , " i was going to tell you  to-morrow . "
" i suppose , " said mrs. holt , after a silence , " it is to the young man who was here this afternoon , and whom i did not see .
it accounts for his precipitate departure .
but i must say , honora , since frankness is one of my faults , that i feel it my duty to write to your aunt and <unk> all responsibility . "
" it is not to mr. <name> , " said honora , meekly ; " it is  it is to mr .
spence . "
mrs. holt seemed to find difficulty in speaking , her former symptoms , which honora had come to recognize as indicative of agitation , returned with alarming intensity .
and when at length her voice made itself heard , it was scarcely recognizable .
" you are engaged  to  <name> spence ? "
" oh , mrs. holt , " exclaimed honora , " it was as great a surprise to me  believe me  as it is to you . "
but even the knowledge that they shared a common amazement did not appear , at once , to <unk> mrs. holt 's emotions .
" do you love him ? "
she demanded abruptly .
whereupon honora burst into tears .
" oh , mrs. holt , " she sobbed , " how can you ask ? "
from this time on the course of events was not precisely logical .
mrs. holt , setting in abeyance any ideas she may have had about the affair , took honora in her arms , and against that ample bosom was sobbed out the pent-up excitement and emotion of an extraordinary day .
" there , there , my dear , " said mrs. holt , stroking the dark hair , " i should not have asked you <unk> me . "
and the worthy <name> , quivering with sympathy now , remembered the time of her own engagement to <name> .
and the fact that the circumstances of that event differed somewhat from those of the present  in regularity , at least , increased rather than <unk> from mrs. holt 's sudden access of tenderness .
the perplexing questions as to the probable result of such a marriage were swept away by a flood of feeling .
" there , there , my dear , i did not mean to be harsh .
what you told me was such a shock  such a surprise , and marriage is such a grave and sacred thing . "
" i know it , " sobbed honora .
" and you are very young . "
" yes , mrs .
holt . "
" and it happened in my house . "
" no , " said honora , " it happened  near the golf course . "
mrs. holt smiled , and wiped her eyes .
" i mean , my dear , that i shall always feel responsible for bringing you together  for your future happiness .
that is a great deal .
i could have wished that you both had taken longer to reflect , but i <name> with all my heart that you <name> be happy . "
honora lifted up a <unk> face .
" he said it was because i was going away that  that he spoke , " she said .
" oh , mrs. holt , i knew that you would be kind about it . "
" of course i am kind about it , my dear , " said mrs. holt .
" as i told you , i have grown to have an affection for you .
i feel a little as though you belonged to me .
and after this  this event , i expect to see a great deal of you .
<name> spence 's mother was a very dear friend of mine .
i was one of the first who knew her when she came to new york , from <name> , a widow , to educate her son .
she was a very fine and a very courageous woman . "
mrs. holt paused a moment .
" she hoped that <name> would be a lawyer . "
" a lawyer ! "
honora repeated .
" i lost sight of him for several years , " continued mrs. holt , " but before i invited him here i made some inquiries about him from friends of mine in the financial world .
i find that he is successful for so young a man , and well thought of .
i have no doubt he <name> make a good husband , my dear , although i could wish he were not on the stock exchange .
and i <name> you <name> make him happy . "
whereupon the good <name> kissed honora , and dismissed her to dress for dinner .
" i shall write to your aunt at once , " she said .
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... <unk> love , unsettled condition that it is supposed to bring , did not interfere with <name> spence 's appetite at dinner .
his spirits , as usual , were of the best , and from time to time honora was aware of his glance .
then she lowered her eyes .
she sat as in a dream ; and , try as she might , her thoughts would not range themselves .
she seemed to see him but dimly , to hear what he said faintly ; and it conveyed nothing to her mind .
this man was to be her husband !
over and over she repeated it to herself .
his name was <name> spence , and he was on the <unk> to riches and success , and she was to live in new york .
ten days before he had not existed for her .
she could not bring herself to believe that he existed now .
did she love him ?
how could she love him , when she did not realize him ?
one thing she knew , that she had loved him that morning .
the fetters of her past life were broken , and this she would not realize .
she had opened the door of the cage for what ?
these were the fragments of thoughts that drifted through her mind like tattered clouds across an empty sky after a storm .
<name> <name> appeared to her more than once , and he was strangely real .
but he belonged to the past .
course succeeded course , and she talked <unk> to mr. holt and <name>  such is the result of feminine training .
after dinner she stood on the porch .
the rain had ceased , a cool damp breeze shook the drops from the leaves , and the stars were shining .
presently , at the sound of a step behind her , she started .
he was standing at her shoulder .
" honora ! "
he said .
she did not move .
" honora , i have n't seen you  alone  since morning .
it seems like a thousand years .
honora ? "
" yes . "
" did you mean it ?
" did i mean what ? "
" when you said you 'd marry me . "
his voice trembled a little .
" i 've been thinking of nothing but you all day .
you 're not  sorry ?
you haven't changed your mind ? "
she shook her head .
" at dinner when you would n't look at me , and this afternoon  " " no , i 'm not sorry , " she said , cutting him short .
" i 'm not sorry . "
he put his arm about her with an air that was almost apologetic .
and , seeing that she did not resist , he <name> her to him and kissed her .
suddenly , unaccountably to her , she clung to him .
" you love me ! "
he exclaimed .
" yes , " she whispered , " but i am tired .
i  i am going upstairs , <name> .
i am tired . "
he kissed her again .
" i ca n't believe it ! "
he said .
" i 'll make you a <name> .
and we 'll be married in the autumn , honora . "
he nodded <unk> towards the open windows of the library .
" shall i tell them ? "
he asked .
" i feel like shouting it .
i ca n't hold on much longer .
i wonder what the old <name> <name> say ! "
honora disengaged herself from his arms and fled to the screen door .
as she opened it , she turned and smiled back at him .
" mrs. holt knows already , " she said .
and catching her skirt , she flew quickly up the stairs .
book ii .
volume 3 .
chapter i .
so long as ye both shall live !
it was late november .
and as honora sat at the window of the drawing-room of the sleeping car , life seemed as fantastic and unreal as the <unk> southern forest into which she stared .
she was happy , as a child is happy who is taken on an excursion into the unknown .
the monotony of existence was at last broken , and riven the <unk> walls .
limitless possibilities lay ahead .
the emancipation had not been without its pangs of sorrow , and there were moments of <unk>  as now .
she saw herself on uncle tom's arm , walking up the aisle of the old church .
how many sundays of her life had she sat watching a shaft of sunlight strike across the stone pillars of its gothic arches !
she saw , in the chancel , tall and grave and pale , <name> <name> standing beside the man with the flushed face who was to be her husband .
she heard again the familiar voice of dr. <unk> reciting the words of that wonderful introduction .
at other weddings she had been moved .
why was her own so <unk> ?
" honora , wilt thou have this man to thy wedded husband , to live together after god 's ordinance in the holy state of matrimony ?
wilt thou obey him , and serve him , love , honour , and keep him in sickness and in health ; and , <unk> all others , keep thee only unto him , so long as ye both shall live ? "
she had promised .
and they were walking out of the church , facing the great rose window with its blended colours , and the vaults above were ringing now with the volume of an immortal march .
after that an illogical series of events and pictures passed before her .
she was in a corner of the carriage , her veil raised , gazing at her husband , who had kissed her passionately .
he was there beside her , looking extremely well in his top hat and frock-coat , with a white flower in his buttonhole .
he was the representative of the future she had deliberately chosen .
and yet , by virtue of the strange ceremony through which they had passed , he seemed to have changed .
in her attempt to seize upon a reality she looked out of the window .
they were just passing the hanbury mansion in <unk> square , and her eyes fell upon the <unk> windows under the wide cornice ; and she wondered whether the doll 's house were still in its place , its mute inhabitants waiting to be called by the names she had given them , and quickened into life once more .
next she recalled the arrival at the little house that had been her home , summer and <name> , for so many years of her life .
a red and white awning , stretching up the length of the walk which once had run beside the tall pear trees , gave it an <unk> , <name> air .
long had it stood there , patient , unpretentious , content that the great things should pass it by !
and now , modest still , it had been singled out from amongst its neighbours and honoured .
was it honoured ?
it seemed to honora , so fanciful this day , that its unwonted air of festival was unnatural .
why should the hour of departure from such a harbour of peace be celebrated ?
she was standing beside her husband in the little parlour , while carriage doors slammed in the dusk outside ; while one by one  a pageant of the past which she was leaving forever the friends of her childhood came and went .
laughter and tears and kisses !
and then , in no time at all , she found herself changing for the journey in the " little house under the hill . "
there , locked up in the little desk cousin <name> had given her long ago , was the unfinished manuscript of that novel written at fever heat during those summer days in which she had sought to escape from a <unk> existence .
and now  she had escaped .
aunt <name> , helpful under the most trying circumstances , was putting her articles in a bag , the initials on which she did not recognize  h. l. s.  honora leffingwell spence ; while old <name> , tearful and inefficient , knelt before her , fumbling at her shoes .
honora , bending over , took the face of the faithful old servant and kissed it .
" do n't feel badly , <name> , " she said ; " i 'll be coming back often to see you , and you <name> be coming to see me . "
" <name> ye , <unk> ?
the blessing of god be on you for those words  and you to be such a fine <name> !
it always was a fine <name> ye were , with such a family and such a bringin ' up .
and now ye 've married a <name> man , as is right and proper .
if it 's <name> as croesus he was , he 'd be none too good for you . "
" <name> , " said aunt <name> , <unk> , " what ideas you put into the child 's head ! "
" sure , miss <name> , " cried <name> , " it 's always the great <name> she was , and she a wee bit of a thing .
and was n't it yerself , miss <name> , that dressed her like a <name> ? "
then came the <unk>  the real ones .
uncle <name> , always the friend of young people , was surrounded by a group of <unk> in the hall .
she clung to him .
and <name> , who had the carriage ready .
what would her wedding have been without <name> ?
as they drove towards the station , his was the image that remained persistently in her mind , bareheaded on the sidewalk in the light of the carriage lamps .
the image of struggle .
she had married prosperity .
a whimsical question , that shocked her , irresistibly presented itself : was it not prosperity that she had promised to love , honour , and obey ?
it must not be thought that honora was by any means discontented with her prosperity .
he was new  that was all .
<name> looked new .
but she remembered that he had always looked new ; such was one of his greatest charms .
in the long summer days since she had bade him good-by on her way through new york from silverdale , honora had constructed him : he was perpetual yet sophisticated youth ; he was finance and fashion ; he was power in correctly cut clothes .
and when he had arrived in st. <name> to play his part in the wedding festivities , she had found her swan a swan indeed  he was all that she had dreamed of him .
and she had tingled with pride as she introduced him to her friends , or gazed at him across the <unk> table as he sat beside <name> hanbury at the <unk> dinner in <unk> square .
the wedding ceremony had somehow upset her opinion of him , but honora regarded this change as temporary .
<name> caesar or <name> washington himself must have been somewhat ridiculous as <unk> : and she had the sense to perceive that her own agitations as a bride were partly responsible .
no matter how much a young girl may have trifled with that electric force in the male sex known as the grand passion , she shrinks from surrendering herself to its dominion .
honora shrank .
he made love to her on the way to the station , and she was terrified .
he actually forgot to smoke cigarettes .
what he said was to the effect that he possessed at last the most wonderful and beautiful woman in the world , and she resented the implication of possession .
nevertheless , in the glaring lights of the station , her courage and her pride in him revived , and he became again a normal and a marked man .
although the sex may resent it , few women are really indifferent to clothes , and <name> 's <unk> check suit had the magic touch of the metropolis .
his manner matched his garments .
obsequious porters grasped his <unk> bag , and seized honora 's ; the man at the gate inclined his head as he examined their tickets , and the pullman conductor himself showed them their stateroom , and plainly regarded them as important people far from home .
<name> had the cosmopolitan air .
he gave the man a dollar , and remarked that the new orleans train was not exactly the chicago and new york limited .
" not by a long shot , " agreed the conductor , as he went out , softly closing the door behind him .
whereupon the cosmopolitan air dropped from mr. <name> spence , not gracefully , and he became once more that superfluous and awkward and utterly <unk> individual , the husband .
" let 's go out and walk on the platform until the train starts , " suggested honora , desperately .
" oh , <name> , the shades are up !
i 'm sure i saw some one looking in ! "
he laughed .
but there was a light in his eyes that frightened her , and she deemed his laughter out of place .
was he , after all , an utterly different man than what she had thought him ?
still laughing , he held to her wrist with one hand , and with the other pulled down the shades .
" this is good enough for me , " he said .
" at last  at last , " he whispered , " all the red tape is over , and i 've got you to myself !
do you love me just a little , honora ? "
" of course i do , " she faltered , still struggling , her face burning as from a fire .
" then what 's the matter ? "
he demanded .
" i do n't know  i want air .
<name> , please let me go .
<unk> 's so hot <unk> .
you must let me go . "
her release , she felt afterwards , was due less to a physical than a mental effort .
she seemed suddenly to have cowed him , and his resistance became enfeebled .
she broke from him , and opened the door , and reached the cement platform and the cold air .
when he joined her , there was something <unk> apologetic about his manner , and he was smoking a cigarette ; and she could not help thinking that she would have respected him more if he had held her .
" women beat me , " he said .
" they 're the most erratic stock in the market . "
it is worthy of remark how soon the human , and especially the feminine <name> <unk> itself to new conditions .
in a day or two life became real again , or rather romantic .
for the american husband in his proper place is an auxiliary who makes all things possible .
his ability to " get things done , " before it ceases to be a novelty , is a quality to be admired .
honora admired .
an intimacy  if the word be not too strong  sprang up between them .
they wandered through the quaint streets of new orleans , that most foreign of american cities , searching out the <unk> french houses ; and honora was never tired of imagining the romances and tragedies which must have taken place in them .
the new scenes excited her ,  the quaint <unk> with their delicious , <unk> creole cooking ,  and she would sit talking for a quarter of an hour at a time with <name> , who <unk> himself to please the palate of a <name> with such allure .
he called her " madame " ; but well he knew , this student of human kind , that the title had not been of long duration .
madame came from new york , without doubt ?
such was one of his questions , as he stood before them in answer to <name> 's summons , rubbing his hands .
and honora , with a little thrill , acknowledged the accuracy of his guess .
there was no dish of <name> 's they did not taste .
and <name> smilingly paid the bills .
he was <unk> proud of his wife , and although he did justice to the cooking , he cared but little for the mysterious <unk> , the spanish buildings , and the novels of mr. <name> w. cable , which honora devoured when she was too tired to walk about .
he followed her obediently to the battle field of new orleans , and admired as obediently the sunset , when the sky was all <unk> through the <unk> , and the spreading live oaks <name> with spanish moss , and a silver bar lay upon the father of waters .
honora , with beating heart and flushed cheeks , felt these things : <name> felt them through her and watched  not the sunset  but the flame it lighted in her eyes .
he left her but twice a day , and then only for brief periods .
he even felt a <name> when she ventured to complain .
" i believe you care more for those horrid stocks than for me , " she said .
" i  i am just a novelty . "
his answer , since they were alone in their sitting-room , was obvious .
" <name> , " she cried , " how mean of you !
now i 'll have to do my hair all over again .
i 've got such a lot of it  you 've no idea how difficult it is . "
" you bet i have ! "
he declared meaningly , and honora blushed .
his pleasure of possession was increased when people turned to look at her on the street or in the dining room  to think that this remarkable creature was in reality his wife !
nor did the feeling grow less intense with time , being quite the same when they arrived at a fashionable resort in the <name> mountains , on their way to new york .
for such were the exactions of his calling that he could spare but two weeks for his honeymoon .
honora 's interest in her new surroundings was as great , and the sight of those towering ridges against the soft blue of the autumn skies inspired her .
it was indian summer here , the <unk> of wood smoke was in the air ; in the valleys  as they drove  the haze was shot with the dust of gold , and through the gaps they looked across vast , unexplored valleys to other distant , <unk> ridges that rose between them and the sunset .
honora took an infinite delight in the <unk> cabins beside the <unk> roads , in the historic atmosphere of the ancient houses and <unk> of the warm springs , where the fathers of the republic had come to take the waters .
and one day , when a north wind had scattered the smoke and swept the sky , <name> followed her up the paths to the ridge 's crest , where she stood like a victory , her garments blowing , gazing off over the mighty billows to the westward .
<name> had never seen a victory , but his vision of <unk> was untroubled .
although it was late in the season , the old-fashioned , rambling hotel was well filled , and people interested honora as well as scenery  a proof of her human qualities .
she <unk> <name> because he , too , was not more socially inclined .
" how can you expect me to be  now ? "
he demanded .
she told him he was a goose , although secretly admitting the justice of his defence .
he knew four or five men in the hotel , with whom he talked stocks while waiting for honora to complete her <unk> ; and he gathered from two of these , who were married , that <name> was a necessary qualification in a husband .
one evening they introduced their wives .
later , <name> revealed their identity  or rather that of the husbands .
" <unk> is one of the big men in the <name> insurance company , and <name> is president of the <unk> trust . "
he paused to light a cigarette , and smiled at her significantly .
" if you can <name> the ladies along once in a while , honora , it wo n't do any harm , " he added .
" you have a way with you , you know ,  when you want to . "
honora grew <name> .
" <name> ! "
she exclaimed .
he looked somewhat <unk> .
" well , " he said , " i was only joking .
do n't take it seriously .
but it does n't do any harm to be polite . "
" i am always polite , " she answered a little coldly .
<unk> , after all , are matters of conjecture , and what proportion of them contain <unk> <name> never be known .
honora lay awake for a long time that night , and the poignant and ever recurring remembrance of her husband 's remark sent the blood to her face like a flame .
would <name> , or <name> hanbury , or any of the intimate friends of her childhood have said such a thing ?
a new and wistful feeling of loneliness was upon her .
for some days , with a certain sense of isolation and a tinge of envy which she would not acknowledge , she had been watching a group of well-dressed , <unk> people galloping off on horseback or filling the <unk> <unk> .
they were from new york  that she had discovered ; and they did not mix with the others in the hotel .
she had thought it strange that <name> did not know them , but for a reason which she did not analyze she hesitated to ask him who they were .
they had rather a rude manner of staring  especially the men  and the air of <unk> infinite amusement from that which went on about them .
one of them , a young man with a <unk> who was addressed by the singular name of " <unk> , " she had overheard demanding as she passed : who the deuce was the tall girl with the dark hair and the colour ?
wherever she went , she was aware of them .
it was foolish , she knew , but their presence seemed  in the magnitude which trifles are wont to assume in the <unk>  of late to have poisoned her pleasure .
enlightenment as to the identity of these disturbing persons came , the next day , from an unexpected source .
indeed , from mrs. <name> .
she loved brides , she said , and honora seemed to her such a sweet bride .
it was mrs. <name> 's ambition to become thin ( which was hitching her wagon to a <name> with a vengeance ) , and she invited our heroine to share her constitutional on the porch .
honora found the proceeding in the nature of an ordeal , for mrs. <name> 's legs were short , her frizzled hair very blond , and the fact that it was natural made it seem , somehow , all the more damning .
they had scarcely begun to walk before honora , with a sense of dismay of which she was ashamed , beheld some of the people who had occupied her thoughts come out of the door and form a laughing group at the end of the porch .
she could not rid herself of the feeling that they were laughing at her .
she tried in vain to drive them from her mind , to listen to mrs. <name> 's account of how she , too , came as a bride to new york from some place with a classical name , and to the advice that accompanied the narration .
the most conspicuous young woman in the group , in riding clothes , was seated on the railing , with the toe of one boot on the ground .
her profile was <unk> and her chestnut hair tightly knotted behind under her hat .
every time they turned , this young woman stared at honora <unk> .
" nasty thing ! "
exclaimed mrs. <name> , suddenly and unexpectedly in the midst of a description of the delights of life in the metropolis .
" who ? "
asked honora .
" that young mrs. <name> <unk> , sitting on the rail .
she 's the rudest woman in new york . "
a perversity of spirit which she could not control prompted honora to reply : " why , i think she is so good-looking , mrs. <name> .
and she seems to have so much individuality and independence . "
" there ! "
cried mrs. <name> , triumphantly .
" once  not so very long ago  i was just as inexperienced as you , my dear .
she belongs to that horribly fast set with which no self-respecting woman would be seen .
it 's an outrage that they should come to a hotel like this and act as though it belonged to them .
she knows me quite as well as i know her , but when i am face to face she acts as though i was air . "
honora could not help thinking that this , at least , required some imagination on mrs. <unk> 's part .
mrs. <name> had stopped for breath .
" i have been introduced to her twice , " she continued , " but of course i would n't speak to her .
the little man with the <unk> , next to her , who is always acting in that silly way , they call <unk> cuthbert .
he gets his name in the newspapers by leading <unk> in new york and newport .
and the tall , slim , blond one , with the green hat and the feather in it , is <name> wing .
he 's the son of <name> wing , the financier . "
" i went to school at sutcliffe with his sister , " said honora .
it seemed to honora that mrs. <name> 's manner underwent a change .
" my dear , " she exclaimed , " did you go to sutcliffe ?
what a wonderful school it is !
i fully intend to send my daughter <name> there . "
an almost irresistible <name> came over honora to run away .
she excused herself instead , and hurried back towards her room .
on the way she met <name> in the corridor , and he held a telegram in his hand .
" i 've got some bad news , honora , " he said .
" that is , bad from the point of view of our honeymoon .
<name> dallam is swamped with business , and wants me in new york .
i 'm afraid we 've got to cut it short . "
to his astonishment she smiled .
" oh , i 'm so glad , <name> , " she cried .
" i  i do n't like this place nearly so well as new orleans .
there are  so many people here . "
he looked relieved , and patted her on the arm .
" we 'll go to-night , old girl , " he said .
chapter ii .
" stafford park " there is a terrifying aspect of all great cities .
rome , with its leviathan <unk> , its seething tenements clinging to the hills , its cruel , shining <unk> , must have overborne the provincial traveller coming up from ostia .
and honora , as she stood on the deck of the ferry-boat , approaching new york for the second time in her life , could not overcome a sense of oppression .
it was on a sharp december morning , and the steam of the hurrying craft was dazzling white in the early sun .
above and beyond the city rose , overpowering , a very different city , somehow , than that her imagination had first drawn .
each of that multitude of vast towers seemed a fortress now , manned by <unk> and hun and , <unk> and saxon , <unk> by <unk> .
and the strife between them was on a scale never known in the world before , a strife with modern arms and modern methods and modern brains , in which there was no <name> .
hidden somewhere amidst those bristling miles of masonry to the northward of the towers was her future home .
her mind dwelt upon it now , for the first time , and tried to construct it .
once she had spoken to <name> of it , but he had smiled and avoided discussion .
what would it be like to have a house of one 's own in new york ?
a house on fifth avenue , as her girl friends had said when they laughingly congratulated her and begged her to remember that they came occasionally to new york .
those of us who , like honora , believe in providence , do not trouble ourselves with mere matters of dollars and cents .
this morning , however , the huge material towers which she gazed upon seemed stronger than providence , and she thought of her husband .
was his fibre sufficiently tough to become eventually the captain of one of those fortresses , to compete with the <unk> and the wings , and others she knew by name , calmly and efficiently intrenched there ?
the boat was approaching the slip , and he came out to her from the cabin , where he had been industriously reading the stock reports , his newspapers thrust into his overcoat pocket .
" there 's no place like new york , after all , " he declared , and added , " when the market 's up .
we 'll go to a hotel for breakfast . "
for some reason she found it difficult to ask the question on her lips .
" i suppose , " she said hesitatingly , " i suppose we could n't go  home , <name> .
you  you have never told me where we are to live . "
as before , the reference to their home seemed to cause him amusement .
he became very mysterious .
" could n't you pass away a few hours shopping this morning , my dear ? "
" oh , yes , " replied honora .
" while i gather in a few dollars , " he continued .
" i 'll meet you at lunch , and then we 'll <unk> . "
as the sun mounted higher , her spirits rose with it .
new york , or that strip of it which is known to the more fortunate of human beings , is a place to raise one 's spirits on a sparkling day in early <name> .
and honora , as she drove in a hansom from shop to shop , felt a new sense of elation and independence .
she was at one , now , with the prosperity that surrounded her : her purse no longer limited , her whims existing only to be gratified .
her reflections on this recently attained state <unk> with alluring conjectures on the place of abode of which <name> had made such a mystery .
where was it ?
and why had he insisted , before showing it to her , upon waiting until afternoon ?
newly arrayed in the most becoming of grey furs , she met him at that hitherto fabled restaurant which in future days  she reflected  was to become so familiar  <unk> 's .
<name> was awaiting her in the vestibule ; and it was not without a little quiver of timidity and excitement and a consequent rise of colour that she followed the waiter to a table by the window .
she felt as though the assembled fashionable world was staring at her , but presently gathered courage enough to gaze at the costumes of the women and the faces of the men .
<name> , with a sang <unk> of which she felt a little proud , ordered a meal for which he eventually paid a fraction over eight dollars .
what would aunt <name> have said to such extravagance ?
he produced a large bunch of violets .
" with <name> dallam 's love , " he said , as she pinned them on her gown .
" i tried to get <name>  mrs. <name>  for lunch , but you never can put your finger on her .
she 'll amuse you , honora . "
" oh , <name> , it 's so much pleasanter lunching alone to-day .
i 'm glad you did n't .
and then afterwards  ? "
he refused , however , to be drawn .
when they emerged she did not hear the directions he gave the cabman , and it was not until they turned into a narrow side street , which became <unk> and <unk> as they bumped their way eastward , that she experienced a sudden sinking sensation .
" <name> ! "
she cried .
" where are you going ?
you must tell me . "
" one of the prettiest suburbs in new jersey  rivington , " he said .
" wait till you see the house . "
" suburbs !
rivington !
new jersey ! "
the words swam before honora 's eyes , like the great signs she had seen printed in black letters on the tall buildings from the ferry that morning .
she had a sickening sensation , and the odour of his cigarette in the cab became unbearable .
by an <unk> trick of her memory , she recalled that she had told the clerks in the shops where she had made her purchases that she would send them her address later .
how different that address from what she had imagined it !
" it 's in the country ! "
she exclaimed .
to lunch at <unk> 's for eight dollars and live in rivington <name> appeared disturbed .
more than that , he appeared astonished , solicitous .
" why , what 's the matter , honora ? "
he asked .
" i thought you 'd like it .
it 's a brand new house , and i got <name> dallam to furnish it .
she 's a wonder on that sort of thing , and i told her to go ahead  within reason .
i talked it over with your aunt and uncle , and they agreed with me you'd much rather live out there for a few years than in a flat . "
" in a flat ! "
repeated honora , with a shudder .
" certainly , " he said , flicking his ashes out of the window .
" who do you think i am , at my age ?
<name> t. <unk> , or the owner of the brougham building ? "
" but  <name> , " she protested , " why did n't you talk it over with me ? "
" because i wanted to surprise you , " he replied .
" i spent a month and a half looking for that house .
and you never seemed to care .
it didn't occur to me that you would care  for the first few years , " he added , and there was in his voice a note of reproach that did not escape her .
" you never seemed inclined to discuss business with me , honora .
i didn't think you were interested .
dallam and i are making money .
we expect some day to be on easy street  so to speak  or fifth avenue .
some day , i <name> , you can show some of these people the road .
but just now what capital we have has to go into the business . "
strangely enough , in spite of the intensity of her disappointment , she felt nearer to her husband in that instant than at any time since their marriage .
honora , who could not bear to hurt any one 's feelings , seized his hand <unk> .
tears started in her eyes .
" oh , <name> , i must seem to you very ungrateful , " she cried .
" it was such a  such a surprise .
i have never lived in the country , and i 'm sure it <name> be delightful  and much more healthful than the city .
wo n't you forgive me ? "
if he had known as much about the fluctuations of the feminine temperament as of those of stocks , the ease with which honora executed this complete change of front might have disturbed him .
<name> , as <name> be seen , possessed that quality which is loosely called good nature .
in marriage , he had been told ( and was ready to believe ) , the wind blew where it listed ; and he was a wise husband who did not spend his time in inquiry as to its sources .
he kissed her before he helped her out of the carriage .
again they crossed the north river , and he led her through the wooden ferry house on the new jersey side to where the rivington train was standing beside a platform shed .
there was no parlour car .
men and women  mostly women  with bundles were already <unk> the seats and racks , and honora found herself wondering how many of these individuals were her future neighbours .
that there might have been an hysterical element in the lively anticipation she exhibited during the journey did not occur to <name> spence .
after many stops ,  in forty-two minutes , to be exact , the brakeman shouted out the name of the place which was to be her home , and of which she had been ignorant that morning .
they alighted at an old red railroad station , were seized upon by a hackman in a coonskin coat , and thrust into a carriage that threatened to fall to pieces on the frozen <unk> road .
they passed through a village in which honora had a glimpse of the drug store and grocery and the grand army hall ; then came detached houses of all ages in one and <unk> plots some above the road , for the country was rolling ; a very attractive church of cream-coloured stone , and finally the carriage turned sharply to the left under an archway on which were the words " stafford park , " and stopped at a very new <unk> in a very new gutter on the right .
" here we are ! "
cried <name> , as he fished in his trousers pockets for money to pay the hackman .
honora looked around her .
stafford park consisted of a wide <unk> of red gravel , not yet packed , with an island in its middle planted with shrubbery and young trees , the bare branches of which formed a black tracery against the <unk> of the western sky .
on both sides of this <unk> were concrete walks , with <unk> from the <unk> to the houses .
there were six of these  three on each side  standing on a raised terrace and about two hundred feet apart .
beyond them , to the northward , stafford park was still a wilderness of <unk> <unk> , interspersed with a few cedars .
honora 's house , the first on the right , was exactly like the other five .
if we look at it through her eyes , we shall find this similarity its main drawback .
if we are a little older , however , and more sophisticated , we shall suspect the owner of stafford park and his architect of a design to make it appear imposing .
it was ( indefinite and <unk> term ) colonial ; painted white ; and double , with dormer windows of diagonal <unk> panes in the roof .
there was a large pillared porch on its least private side  namely , the front .
a <unk> maid stood in the open doorway and smiled at honora as she entered .
honora walked through the rooms .
there was nothing intricate about the house ; it was as simple as two times four , and really too large for her and <name> .
her presents were installed , the pictures and photograph frames and chairs , even mr. <unk> 's dining-room table and cousin <name> 's piano .
the sight of these , and of the engraving which aunt <name> had sent on , and which all her childhood had <name> over her bed in the little room at home , brought the tears once more to her eyes .
but she forced them back bravely .
these reflections were interrupted by the appearance of the little maid announcing that tea was ready , and bringing her two letters .
one was from <name> holt , and the other , written in a large , slanting , and angular handwriting , was signed <name> dallam .
it was dated from new york .
" my dear honora , " it ran , " i feel that i must call you so , for <name> and <name> , in addition to being partners , are such friends .
i hesitated so long about furnishing your house , my dear , but <name> insisted , and said he wished to surprise you .
i am sending you this line to welcome you , and to tell you that i have arranged with the furniture people to take any or all things back that you do not like , and exchange them .
after all , they <name> be out of date in a few years , and <name> and <name> <name> have made so much money by that time , i <name> , that i shall be able to leave my apartment , which is dear , and you <name> be coming to town . "
honora laid down the sheet , and began to tidy her hair before the glass of the highly polished bureau in her room .
a line in <name> 's letter occurred to her : " mother hopes to see you soon .
she asked me to tell you to buy good things which <name> last you all your life , and says that it pays . "
the tea-table was steaming in the parlour in front of the wood fire in the blue tiled fireplace .
the oak floor reflected its gleam , and that of the electric lights ; the shades were drawn ; a slight odour of steam heat pervaded the place .
<name> , smoking a cigarette , was reclining on a sofa that evidently was not made for such a purpose , reading the evening newspapers .
" well , honora , " he said , as she took her seat behind the tea-table , " you have n't told me how you like it .
pretty <unk> , eh ?
and enough spare room to have people out over sundays . "
" oh , <name> , i do like it , " she cried , in a desperate attempt  which momentarily came near succeeding to convince herself that she could have desired nothing more .
" it 's so sweet and clean and new  and all our own . "
she succeeded , at any rate , in convincing <name> .
in certain matters , he was easily convinced .
" i thought you 'd be pleased when you saw it , my dear , " he said .
chapter iii .
the great unattached it was the poet <unk> who sang of domestic happiness as the only bliss that has survived the fall .
one of the burning and <unk> questions of to-day is ,  <name> it survive the twentieth century ?
<name> it survive rapid transit and bridge and woman 's rights , the modern novel and modern drama , automobiles , flying machines , and intelligence offices ; hotel , apartment , and suburban life , or four homes , or none at all ?
is it a weed that <name> grow anywhere , in a crevice between two stones in the city ?
or is it a plant that requires tender care and the water of self-sacrifice ?
above all , is it desirable ?
our heroine , as may have been suspected , has an <unk> temperament .
her natural position is upright , but like the <name> , she can bend gracefully , and yields only to spring back again <unk> .
since this chronicle regards her , we must try to look at existence through her eyes , and those of some of her generation and her sex : we must give the four years of her life in rivington the approximate value which she herself would have put upon it  which is a chapter .
we must regard rivington as a kind of purgatory , not solely a place of departed spirits , but of those which have not yet arrived ; as one of the many temporary abodes of the great unattached .
no philosophical writer has as yet made the attempt to define the change  as profound as that of the <unk> to the frog  between the lover and the husband .
an author of ideals would not dare to proclaim that this change is inevitable : some husbands  and some wives are fortunate enough to escape it , but it is not unlikely to happen in our modern civilization .
just when it occurred in <name> spence it is difficult to say , but we have got to consider him henceforth as a husband ; one who regards his home as a <unk> rather than the sanctuary of a goddess ; as a launching place , the ways of which are carefully greased , that he may slide off to business every morning with as little friction as possible , and return at night to rest undisturbed in a comfortable berth , to ponder over the combat of the morrow .
it would be inspiring to summon the vision of honora , in rustling garments , poised as the <unk> of this craft , beckoning him on to battle and victory .
alas !
the launching happened at that <unk> and most <unk> of <unk> minutes of eight in the morning .
there was a period , indeterminate , when she poured out his coffee with <unk> zeal ; a second period when she appeared at the foot of the stairs to kiss him as he was going out of the door ; a third when , clad in an attractive dressing-gown , she waved him good-by from the window ; and lastly , a fourth , which was only marked by an occasional protest on his part , when the coffee was weak .
" i 'd gladly come down , <name> , if it seemed to make the least difference to you , " said honora .
" but all you do is to sit with your newspaper propped up and read the stock reports , and growl when i ask you a polite question .
you 've no idea how long it makes the days out here , to get up early . "
" it seems to me you put in a good many days in town , " he retorted .
" surely you do n't expect me to spend all my time in rivington ! "
she cried reproachfully ; " i 'd die .
and then i am always having to get new cooks for you , because they ca n't make <unk> sauce like hotel <unk> .
men have no idea how hard it is to keep house in the country ,  i just wish you had to go to those horrid intelligence offices .
you would n't stay in rivington ten days .
and all the good cooks drink . "
<name> , indeed , with the aid of the village policeman , had had to expel from his kitchen one imperious female who swore like a dock hand , and who wounded honora to the quick by remarking , as she departed in <unk> , that she had always lived with ladies and gentlemen and people who were somebody .
the incident had tended further to <unk> from the romance of the country .
it is a mistake to suppose that the honeymoon disappears below the horizon with the rapidity of a tropical sun .
and there is generally an <unk> .
in spite of cooks and other minor clouds , in spite of visions of metropolitan triumphs ( not shattered , but put away in camphor ) , life was touched with a certain novelty .
there was a new runabout and a horse which honora could drive herself , and she went to the station to meet her husband .
on mild saturday and <name> afternoons they made long excursions , into the country  until the golf season began , when the lessons begun at silverdale were renewed .
but after a while certain male competitors appeared , and the lessons were <unk> .
<name> , after his pile of newspapers had religiously been disposed of , became a field day .
indeed , it is impossible , without a twinge of pity , to behold <name> taking root in rivington , for we know that sooner or later he <name> be dug up and transplanted .
the soil was congenial .
he played poker on the train with the rivington husbands , and otherwise got along with them <unk> .
and it was to him an enigma  when occasionally he allowed his thoughts to dwell upon such trivial matters  why honora was not equally congenial with the wives .
there were , no doubt , interesting people in rivington about whom many stories could be written : people with loves and fears and anxieties and joys , with <unk> and <unk> , with babies , but few grandchildren .
there were weddings at the little church , and <unk> ; there were dances at the golf club ; there were christmas trees , where most of the presents  like honora 's  came from afar , from family centres formed in a social period gone by ; there were <unk> for the heads of families , and consequent rejoicings over increases of income ; there were <unk> ; there were  inevitable in the ever grinding action of that remorseless law , the survival of the fittest  commercial calamities , and the <unk> search for new employment .
rivington called upon honora in vehicles of all descriptions , in proportion to the <unk> or prosperity of the owners .
and honora returned the calls , and joined the sewing circle , and the woman's luncheon club , which met for the purpose of literary discussion .
in the evenings there were little dinners of six or eight , where the men talked business and the women house rent and groceries and gossip and the cheapest places in new york city to buy articles of the latest fashion .
some of them had actually built or were building houses that cost as much as thirty thousand dollars , with the inexplicable intention of remaining in rivington the rest of their lives !
honora was kind to these ladies .
as we know , she was kind to everybody .
she almost allowed two or three of them to <name> that they might become her intimates , and made excursions to new york with them , and lunched in fashionable restaurants .
their range of discussion included babies and <name> browning , the modern novel and the best <unk> .
it would be interesting to know why she treated them , on the whole , like travellers met by chance in a railroad station , from whom she was presently forever to depart .
the time and manner of this departure were matters to be determined in the future .
it would be interesting to know , likewise , just at what period the intention of moving away from rivington became fixed in honora 's mind .
honora circumscribed , honora limited , honora admitting defeat , and this chronicle would be finished .
the gods exist somewhere , though many <unk> may , be necessary to achieve their companionship .
and no prison walls loom so high as to <unk> our heroine 's soul .
to exchange one prison for another is in itself something of a feat , and an argument that the thing may be done again .
neither do the wise ones beat themselves <unk> against brick or stone .
<name>  poor man !  is <unk> enough to regard a great problem as being settled once and for all by a marriage certificate and a benediction ; and labours under the delusion that henceforth he may come and go as he pleases , eat his breakfast in silence , sleep after dinner , and spend his sundays at the rivington golf club .
it is as well to leave him , at present , in blissful ignorance of his future .
our sympathies , however , must be with honora , who has paid the price for heaven , and who discovers that by marriage she has merely joined the ranks of the great unattached .
hitherto it had been inconceivable to her that any one sufficiently prosperous could live in a city , or near it and dependent on it , without being socially a part of it .
most momentous of <unk> !
with the exception of the <name> <unk> and one or two young brokers who occasionally came out over <name> , her husband had no friends in new york .
rivington and the holt family ( incongruous mixture ) formed the sum total of her acquaintance .
on monday mornings in particular , if perchance she went to town , the huge signs which she read across the swamps , of breakfast <unk> and other necessaries , seemed , for some reason , best to express her isolation .
well-dressed , laughing people descended from omnibuses at the prettier stations , people who seemed <unk> to themselves ; people she was sure she should like if only she knew them .
once the sight of her school friend , <name> wing , chatting with a tall young man , brought up a flood of recollections ; again , in a <unk> establishment , she came face to face with the attractive mrs. <unk> whom she had seen at hot springs .
sometimes she would walk on fifth avenue , watching , with mingled sensations , the procession there .
the colour , the movement , the sensation of living in a world where every one was <unk> wealthy , was at once a <unk> and a despair .
brougham after brougham passed , <name> after <name> , in which beautifully <unk> women chatted gayly or sat back , impassive , amidst the cushions .
some of them , indeed , looked bored , but this did not mar the general effect of pleasure and prosperity .
even the people  well-dressed , too  in the hansom cabs were usually animated and smiling .
on the sidewalk athletic , <unk> girls passed her , sometimes with a man , sometimes in groups of two and three , going in and out of the <unk> shops with the large , plate-glass windows .
all of these women , apparently , had something definite to do , somewhere to go , some one to meet the very next , minute .
they protested to <unk> and <unk> if they were kept waiting , and even seemed impatient of time lost if one by chance bumped into them .
but honora had no imperative appointments .
<name> dallam was almost sure to be out , or going out immediately , and seemed to have more engagements than any one in new york .
" i 'm so sorry , my dear , " she would say , and add reproachfully : " why did n't you telephone me you were coming ?
if you had only let me know we might have lunched together or gone to the <unk> .
now i have promised <name> trowbridge to go to a lunch party at her house . "
mrs. dallam had a most convincing way of saying such things , and in spite of one 's self put one in the wrong for not having telephoned .
but if indeed honora telephoned  as she did once or twice in her innocence  <name> was quite as distressed .
" my dear , why did n't you let me know last night ?
trixy <name> has given <name> chandos his box at the horse show , and <name> would never , never forgive me if i backed out . "
although she lived in an apartment  in a most attractive one , to be sure  there could be no doubt about it that <name> dallam was fashionable .
she had a way with her , and her costumes were marvellous .
she could have made her fortune either as a <unk> or a house <unk> , and she bought everything from " little " men and women whom she discovered herself .
it was a curious fact that all of these small <unk> eventually became fashionable , too .
<name> was kind to honora , and gave her their addresses before they grew to be great and insolent and careless whether one patronized them or not .
while we are confessing the trials and weaknesses of our heroine , we shall have to admit that she read , occasionally , the society columns of the newspapers .
and in this manner she grew to have a certain familiarity with the doings of those <unk> of fortune who had more delightful engagements than hours in which to fulfil them .
so intimate was <name> dallam with many of these <unk> that she spoke of them by their first names , or generally by their nicknames .
some two years after honora 's marriage the <unk> had taken a house in that much discussed colony of quicksands , where sport and pleasure reigned supreme : and more than once the gown which mrs. <name> dallam had worn to a polo match had been faithfully described in the public prints , or the dinners which she had given at the quicksands club .
one of these dinners , honora learned , had been given in honour of mr. trixton <name> .
" you ought to know trixy , honora , " mrs. dallam declared ; " he 'd be crazy about you . "
time passed , however , and mrs. dallam made no attempt to bring about this most desirable meeting .
when honora and <name> went to town to dine with the <unk> , it was always at a restaurant , a <unk> <unk> ' .
<name> dallam thought it dull to dine at home , and they went to the theatre afterwards  invariably a musical comedy .
although honora did not care particularly for musical comedies , she always experienced a certain feverish <unk> which kept her wide awake on the midnight train to rivington .
<name> had a most exasperating habit of dozing in the corner of the seat .
" you are always sleepy when i have anything interesting to talk to you about , " said honora , " or reading stock reports .
i scarcely see anything at all of you . "
<name> roused himself .
" where are we now ? "
he asked .
" oh , " cried honora , " we have n't passed <unk> .
<name> , who is trixton <name> ? "
" what about him ? "
demanded her husband .
" nothing  except that he is one of <name> 's friends , and she said she knew  i should like him .
i wish you would be more interested in people .
who is he ? "
" one of the best-known <unk> in the market , " <name> answered , and his air implied that a lack of knowledge of mr. <name> was ignorance indeed ; " a daring gambler .
he cornered cotton once , and raked in over a million .
he 's a sport , too . "
" how old is he ? "
" about forty-three . "
" is he married ? "
inquired honora .
" he 's divorced , " said <name> .
and she had to be content with so much of the gentleman 's biography , for her husband relapsed into <unk> again .
a few days later she saw a picture of mr. <name> , in polo costume , in one of the magazines .
she thought him good-looking , and wondered what kind of a wife he had had .
honora , when she went to town for the day , generally could be sure of finding some one , at least , of the holt family at home at luncheon time .
they lived still in the same house on <name> avenue to which aunt <name> and uncle <name> had been invited to breakfast on the day of <unk> arrival in her own country .
it had a wide , <unk> front , with a basement , and a high flight of steps leading up to the door .
within , solemnity reigned , and this effect was largely produced by the prodigiously high ceilings and the black walnut doors and woodwork .
on the second floor , the library where the family assembled was more cheerful .
the books themselves , although in <unk> cases , and the sun pouring in , assisted in making this effect .
here , indeed , were stability and peace .
here honora <unk> the acquaintance of the young settlement worker , and of the missionary , now on the presbyterian board of missions .
here she charmed other friends and allies of the holt family ; and once met , somewhat to her surprise , two young married women who differed radically from the other guests of the house .
honora admired their gowns if not their manners ; for they ignored her , and talked to mrs. holt about plans for raising money for the working girl 's relief society .
" you should join us , my dear , " said mrs. holt ; " i am sure you would be interested in our work . "
" i 'd be so glad to , mrs. holt , " replied honora , " if only i did n't live in the country . "
she came away as usual , feeling of having run into a <unk> de sac .
mrs. holt 's house was a refuge , not an outlet ; and thither honora directed her steps when a distaste for lunching alone or with some of her rivington friends in the hateful , selfish gayety of a fashionable restaurant overcame her ; or when her moods had run through a cycle , and an atmosphere of religion and <unk> became congenial .
" <name> , " she asked unexpectedly one evening , as he sat smoking beside the blue tiled mantel , " have you got on your <name> <unk> ? "
" i 'll bet a hundred dollars to ten cents , " he cried , " that you 've been lunching with mrs .
holt . "
" i think you 're horrid , " said honora .
something must be said for her .
domestic virtue , in the face of such mocking heresy , is exceptionally difficult of attainment .
mrs. holt had not been satisfied with honora 's and <name> 's accounts of the house in stafford park .
she felt called upon to inspect it .
and for this purpose , in the spring following honora 's marriage , she made a pilgrimage to rivington and spent the day .
honora met her at the station , and the drive homeward was occupied in answering innumerable questions on the characters , conditions , and modes of life of <unk> neighbours .
" now , my dear , " said mrs. holt , when they were seated before the fire after lunch , " i want you to feel that you can come to me for everything .
i must congratulate you and <name> on being sensible enough to start your married life simply , in the country .
i shall never forget the little house in which mr. holt and i began , and how <unk> happy i was . "
the good <name> reached out and took honora 's hand in her own .
" not that your deep feeling for your husband <name> ever change .
but men are more difficult to manage as they grow older , my dear , and the best of them require a little managing for their own good .
and increased establishments bring added cares and responsibilities .
now that i am here , i have formed a very fair notion of what it ought to cost you to live in such a place .
and i shall be glad to go over your housekeeping books with you , and tell you if you are being cheated as i dare say you are . "
" oh , mrs. holt , " honora faltered , " i  i have n't kept any books .
<name> just pays the bills . "
" you mean to say he has n't given you any allowance ! "
cried mrs. holt , aghast .
" you do n't know what it costs to run this house ? "
" no , " said honora , humbly .
" i never thought of it .
i have no idea what <name> 's income may be . "
" i 'll write to <name> myself  to-night , " declared mrs. holt .
" please do n't , mrs. holt .
i 'll  i 'll speak to him , " said honora .
" very well , then , " the good <name> agreed , " and i <name> send you one of my own books , with my own system , as soon as i get home .
it is not your fault , my dear , it is <name> 's .
it is little short of criminal of him .
i suppose this is one of the pernicious results of being on the stock exchange .
new york is nothing like what it was when i was a girl  the extravagance by everybody is actually appalling .
the whole city is bent upon <unk> and pleasure .
and i am afraid it is very often the wives , honora , who take the lead in <unk> .
it all tends , my dear , to loosen the marriage tie  especially this frightful habit of dining in hotels and restaurants . "
before she left mrs. holt insisted on going over the house from top to bottom , from <unk> to linen closet .
suffice it to say that the inspection was not without a certain criticism , which must be passed over .
" it is a little large , just for you and <name> , my dear , " was her final comment .
" but you are wise in providing for the future . "
" for the future ? "
honora repeated .
mrs. holt playfully pinched her cheek .
" when the children arrive , my dear , as i <name> they <name>  soon , " she said , smiling at honora 's colour .
" sometimes it all comes back to me  my own <name> when <name> was a baby .
i was very foolish about him , no doubt .
<name> and gwendolen tell me so .
i would n't even let the nurse sit up with him when he was getting his teeth .
<name> ! "
she exclaimed , glancing at the enamelled watch on her gown ,  for long practice had enabled her to tell the time upside down ,  " we 'll be late for the train , my dear . "
after returning from the station , honora sat for a long time at her window , looking out on the park .
the afternoon sunlight had the silvery tinge that comes to it in march ; the red gravel of the centre driveway was very wet , and the grass of the lawns of the houses opposite already a vivid green ; in the <unk> the white clothes snapped from the lines ; and a group of children , followed by nurses with <unk> , tripped along the strip of sidewalk .
why could not she feel the joys and desires of which mrs. holt had spoken ?
it never had occurred to her until to-day that they were lacking in her .
children !
a home !
why was it that she did not want children ?
why should such a natural longing be absent in her ?
her mind went back to the days of her childhood dolls , and she smiled to think of their large families .
she had always associated marriage with children  until she got married .
and now she remembered that her childhood ideals of the matrimonial state had been very much , like mrs. holt 's own experience of it : why then had that ideal gradually faded until , when marriage came to her , it was faint and shadowy indeed ?
why were not her spirit and her hopes enclosed by the walls in which she sat ?
the housekeeping book came from mrs. holt the next morning , but honora did not mention it to her husband .
circumstances were her excuse : he had had a hard day on the exchange , and at such times he showed a marked <unk> for the discussion of household matters .
it was not until the autumn , in fact , that the subject of finance was mentioned between them , and after a period during which <name> had been unusually <unk> and morose .
just as electrical disturbances are said to be in some way connected with sun spots , so honora learned that a certain <unk> and tendency to discuss expenses on the part of her husband were <unk> with a depression in the market .
" i wish you 'd learn to go a little slow , honora , " he said one evening .
" the bills are pretty stiff this month .
you do n't seem to have any idea of the value of money . "
" oh , <name> , " she exclaimed , after a moment 's pause for breath , " how can you say such a thing , when i save you so much ? "
" save me so much ! "
he echoed .
" yes .
if i had gone to ridley for this suit , he would have charged me two hundred dollars .
i took such pains  all on your account  to find a little man <name> dallam told me about , who actually made it for one hundred and twenty-five . "
it was typical of the <unk> of his sex that he failed to be impressed by this argument .
" if you go on saving that way , " said he , " we 'll be in the hands of a receiver by christmas .
i ca n't see any difference between buying one suit from ridley  whoever he may be  and three from <name> <unk> 'little man , ' except that you spend more than three times as much money . "
" oh , i did n't get three !  i never thought you could be so unjust , <name> .
surely you do n't want me to dress like these rivington women , do you ? "
" i ca n't see anything wrong with their clothes , " he maintained .
" and to think that i was doing it all to please you ! "
she cried reproachfully .
" to please me ! "
" who else ?
<unk> do n't know anybody in new york .
and i wanted you to be proud of me .
i 've tried so hard and  and sometimes you do n't even look at my gowns , and say whether you like them and they are all for you . "
this argument , at least , did not fail of results , combined as it was with a hint of tears in honora 's voice .
its effect upon <name> was peculiar  he was at once irritated , disarmed , and softened .
he put down his cigarette  and honora was on his knee !
he could not deny her attractions .
" how could you be so cruel , <name> ? "
she asked .
" you know you would n't like me to be a <unk> .
it was my own idea to save money  i had a long talk about economy one day with mrs. holt .
and you act as though you had such a lot of it when we 're in town for dinner with these rivington people .
you always have champagne .
if  if you're poor , you ought to have told me so , and i should n't have ordered another dinner gown . "
" you 've ordered another dinner gown ! "
" only a little one , " said honora , " the simplest kind .
but if you're poor  " she had made a discovery  to reflect upon his business success was to touch a sensitive nerve .
" i 'm not poor , " he declared .
" but the bottom 's dropped out of the market , and even old wing is <unk> .
we 'll have to put on the brakes for awhile , honora . "
it was shortly after this that honora departed on the first of her three visits to st. <name> .
chapter iv .
the new doctrine this history concerns a free and <unk>  and , let us add , feminine  spirit .
no <name> is in the least interesting if restricted and contented with her restrictions ,  a fact which the ladies of our nation are fast finding out .
what would become of the goddess of <name> ?
and let us <name> well , while we are making these observations , that <name> is a goddess , not a god , although it has taken us in <name> over a century to realize a significance in the choice of her sex .
and  another discovery !  she is not a <unk> frau .
she is never <unk> , never fettered .
even the french , clever as they are , have not conceived her : equality and fraternity are neither <unk> nor kin of hers , and she laughs at them as <unk>  for she is a laughing <name> .
she alone of the three is real , and she alone is worshipped for attributes which she does not possess .
she is a <unk> , and she is never satisfied .
if she were , she would not be <name> : if she were , she would not be worshipped of men , but despised .
if they understood her , they would not care for her .
and finally , she comes not to bring peace , but a sword .
at quarter to seven one <unk> evening of the <name> following their fourth anniversary honora returned from new york to find her husband seated under the tall lamp in the room he somewhat <unk> called his " den , " scanning the financial <name> of his newspaper .
he was in his dressing gown , his <unk> feet extended towards the hearth , smoking a cigarette .
and on the stand beside him was a <unk> glass  empty .
" <name> , " she cried , brushing his ashes from the table , " how can you be so untidy when you are so good-looking dressed up ?
i really believe you 're getting fat .
and there , " she added , critically touching a place on the top of his head , " is a bald spot ! "
" anything else ? "
he murmured , with his eyes still on the sheet .
" lots , " answered honora , pulling down the newspaper from before his face .
" for one thing , i 'm not going to allow you to be a bear any more .
i do n't mean a stock exchange bear , but a domestic bear  which is much worse .
you 've got to notice me once in a while .
if you do n't , i 'll get another husband .
that 's what women do in these days , you know , when the one they have does n't take the trouble to make himself sufficiently agreeable .
i 'm sure i could get another one quite easily , " she declared .
he looked up at her as she stood facing him in the lamplight before the fire , and was forced to admit to himself that the boast was not wholly idle .
a smile was on her lips , her eyes gleamed with health ; her furs  of silver fox  were thrown back , the crimson roses pinned on her <unk> afternoon gown matched the glow in her cheeks , while her hair mingled with the dusky shadows .
<name> spence experienced one of those startling , illuminating moments which come on occasions to the busy and <unk> husbands of his nation .
<unk> have a name for such a phenomenon .
ten minutes before , so far as his thoughts were concerned , she had not existed , and suddenly she had become a possession which he had not , in truth , sufficiently prized .
absurd though it was , the possibility which she had suggested aroused in him a slight uneasiness .
" you are a deuced good-looking woman , i 'll say that for you , honora , " he admitted .
" thanks , " she answered , mockingly , and put her hands behind her back .
" if i had only known you were going to settle down in rivington and get fat and bald and wear dressing gowns and be a bear , i never should have married you  never , never , never !
oh , how young and simple and foolish i was !
and the magnificent way you talked about new york , and intimated that you were going to conquer the world .
i believed you .
was n't i a little idiot not  to know that you 'd make for a place like this and dig a hole and stay in it , and let the world go <name> ? "
he laughed , though it was a poor attempt .
and she read in his eyes , which had not left her face , that he was more or less disturbed .
" i treat you pretty well , do n't i , honora ? "
he asked .
there was an <unk> , apologetic note in his voice that amused her , and reminded her of the honeymoon .
" i give you all the money you want or rather  you take it ,  and i do n't kick up a row , except when the market goes to pieces  " " when you act as though we 'd have to live in <unk>  which could n't be much worse , " she interrupted .
" and you stay in town all day and have no end of fun making money ,  for you like to make money , and expect me to amuse myself the best part of my life with a lot of women who do n't know enough to keep thin . "
he laughed again , but still uneasily .
honora was still smiling .
" what 's got into you ? "
he demanded .
" i know you do n't like rivington , but you never broke loose this way before . "
" if you stay here , " said honora , with a new firmness , " it <name> be alone .
i ca n't see what you want with a wife , anyway .
i 've been thinking you over lately .
i do n't do anything for you , except to keep getting you cooks  and anybody could do that .
you do n't seem to need me in any possible way .
all i do is to <unk> around the house and read and play the piano , or go to new york and buy clothes for nobody to look at except strangers in restaurants .
i 'm worth more than that .
i think i'll get married again . "
" great lord , what are you talking about ? "
he exclaimed when he got his breath .
" i think i 'll take a man next time , " she continued calmly , " who has something to him , some ambition .
the kind of man i thought i was getting when i took you only i should n't be fooled again .
women <unk> a good deal in these days , and i 'm beginning to see the reason why .
and the women who have done it appear to be perfectly happy  much happier than they were at first .
i saw one of them at <name> dallam 's this afternoon .
she was radiant .
i ca n't see any particular reason why a woman should be tied all her life to her husband 's apron strings  or whatever he wears  and waste the talents she has .
it 's wicked , when she might be the making of some man who is worth something , and who lives somewhere . "
her husband got up .
" <unk> ! "
he cried , " i never heard such talk in my life . "
the idea that her love for him might have ebbed a little , or that she would for a moment consider leaving him , he rejected as preposterous , of course : the reputation which the majority of her sex had made throughout the ages for constancy to the marriage tie was not to be so lightly dissipated .
nevertheless , there was in her words a new undertone of determination he had never before heard  or , at least , noticed .
there was one argument , or <unk> , which had generally worked like a charm , although some time had elapsed since last he had resorted to it .
he tried to seize and kiss her , but she eluded him .
at last he caught her , out of breath , in the corner of the room .
" <name>  you 'll knock over the lamp  you 'll ruin my gown  and then you 'll have to buy me another .
i did mean it , " she insisted , holding back her head ; " you 'll have to choose between rivington and me .
it 's  it 's an ultimatum .
there were at least three awfully attractive men at <name> dallam 's tea  i wo n't tell you who they were  who would be glad to marry me in a minute . "
he <name> her down on the arm of his chair .
" now that <name> has a house in town , " he said weakly , " i suppose you think you 've got to have one . "
" oh , <name> , it is such a dear house .
i had no idea that so much could be done with so narrow a front .
it 's all french , with mirrors and big white panels and satin chairs and sofas , and a carved gilt piano that she got for nothing from a dealer she knows ; and church candlesticks .
the mirrors give it the effect of being larger than it really is .
i've only two criticisms to make : it 's too far from fifth avenue , and one can scarcely turn around in it without knocking something down  a photograph frame or a flower vase or one of her <unk> chairs .
it was only a hideous , old-fashioned stone front when she bought it .
i suppose nobody but <name> farwell could have made anything out of it . "
" who 's <name> farwell ? "
inquired her husband .
" <name> , do you really mean to say you 've never heard of <name> farwell ?
<name> was so lucky to get him  she says he would n't have done the house if he had n't been such a friend of hers .
and he was coming to the tea this afternoon  only something happened at the last minute , and he could n't .
she was so disappointed .
he built the <unk> ' house , and did over the <name> <unk> ' .
and he 's going to do our house  some day . "
" why not right away ? "
asked <name> .
" because i 've made up my mind to be very , very reasonable , " she replied .
" we 're going to quicksands for a while , first . "
" to quicksands ! "
he repeated .
but in spite of himself he experienced a feeling of relief that she had not demanded a town mansion on the spot .
honora sprang to her feet .
" get up , <name> , " she cried , " remember that we 're going out for <unk> you 'll never be ready . "
" hold on , " he protested , " i do n't know about this quicksands proposition .
let 's talk it over a little more  " " we 'll talk it over another time , " she replied .
" but  remember my ultimatum .
and i am only taking you there for your own good . "
" for my own good ! "
" yes .
to get you out of a <unk> .
to keep you from becoming commonplace and obscure and  and everything you promised not to be when you married me , " she retorted from the doorway , her eyes still alight with that disturbing and tantalizing fire .
" it is my last desperate effort as a wife to save you from baldness , <unk> , and <unk> . "
wherewith she disappeared into her room and closed the door .
we read of earthquakes in the tropics and at the ends of the earth with commiseration , it is true , yet with the fond belief that the ground on which we have built is so firm that our own <unk> ' and <unk> ' are in no danger of being shaken down .
and in the same spirit we learn of other people 's domestic <unk> .
<name> spence had had only a slight shock , but it frightened him and destroyed his sense of immunity .
and during the week that followed he lacked the moral courage either to discuss the subject of quicksands thoroughly or to let it alone : to put down his foot like a turk or accede like a crichton .
either course might have saved him .
one trouble with the unfortunate man was that he realized but dimly the gravity of the crisis .
he had laboured under the delusion that matrimonial conditions were still what they had been in the eighteenth century  although it is doubtful whether he had ever thought of that century .
characteristically , he considered the troublesome affair chiefly from its business side .
his ambition , if we may use so large a word for the sentiment that had filled his breast , had been coincident with his <unk> passion for honora .
and she had contrived , after four years , in some mysterious way to stir up that ambition once more ; to make him uncomfortable ; to compel him to ask himself whether he were not sliding downhill ; to wonder whether living at quicksands might not bring him in touch with important interests which had as yet eluded him .
and , above all ,  if the idea be put a little more <unk> and definitely than it occurred in his thoughts , he awoke to the realization that his wife was an <unk> he had hitherto utterly neglected .
inconceivable though it were ( a <unk> reflection ) , if he insisted on trying to keep such a woman bottled up in rivington she might some day pack up and leave him .
one never could tell what a woman would do in these days .
<name> <unk> <unk> .
we are indebted to honora for this view of her husband 's mental processes .
she watched them , as it were , through a glass in the side of his head , and incidentally derived infinite amusement therefrom .
with instinctive wisdom she refrained from <unk> .
an invitation to dine with the <unk> ' , in their own house , arrived a day or two after the tea which honora had attended there .
although <name> had always been cordial , honora thought this note couched in terms of unusual warmth .
she was implored to come early , because <name> had so much to talk to her about which could n't be written on account of a splitting headache .
in moderate obedience to this summons honora arrived , on the evening in question , before the ornamental ironwork of mrs. <unk> front door at a few minutes after seven o'clock .
honora paused in the spring twilight to contemplate the house , which stood out <unk> from its sombre , <unk> brothers and sisters with noisy basement kitchens .
the third avenue elevated , " so handy for <name> , " roared across the gap scarcely a block away ; and just as the door was opened the <unk> of little blue <unk> , pulled by a huge chestnut horse and driven by the <unk> of grooms in top boots , <name> up at the curb .
and out of it burst a resplendent <name>  mrs. dallam .
" oh , it 's you , honora , " she cried .
" am i late ?
i 'm so sorry .
but i just could n't help it .
it 's all <name> trowbridge 's fault .
she insisted on my staying to meet that <name> <unk> who dances so divinely in <name> <unk> .
she 's sweet .
i 've seen her eight times . "
here she took honora 's arm , and faced her towards the street .
" what do you think of my turnout ?
is n't he a darling ? "
" is he  full grown ? "
asked honora .
<name> dallam burst out laughing .
" bless you , i do n't mean <name> ,  although i had a terrible time finding him .
i mean the horse .
trixy <name> gave him to me before he went abroad . "
" gave him to you ! "
honora exclaimed .
" oh , he 's always doing kind things like that , and he had n't any use for him .
my dear , i <name> you do n't think for an instant trixy 's in love with me !
he 's crazy about <name> chandos .
i tried so hard to get her to come to dinner to-night , and the <unk> ' and the <unk> ' .
you 've no idea how difficult it is in new york to get any one under two weeks .
and so we 've got just ourselves . "
honora was on the point of declaring , politely , that she was very glad , when <name> dallam asked her how she liked the brougham .
" it 's the image of mrs. <name> grainger 's , my dear , and i got it for a song .
as long as trixy gave me the horse , i told <name> the least he could do was to give me the brougham and the harness .
is master <name> asleep ? "
she inquired of the maid who had been patiently waiting at the door .
" i meant to have got home in time to kiss him . "
she led honora up the narrow but thickly carpeted stairs to a miniature boudoir , where madame <name> , in a gilt <unk> frame , looked <unk> down from the walls .
" why have n't you been in to see me since my tea , honora ?
you were such a success , and after you left they were all crazy to know something about you , and why they had n't heard of you .
my dear , how much did little <name> charge you for that dress ?
if i had your face and neck and figure i 'd die before i 'd live in rivington .
you 're positively wasted , honora .
and if you stay there , no one <name> look at you , though you were as beautiful as mrs .
<unk> . "
" you 're rather good-looking yourself , <name> , " said honora .
" i 'm ten years older than you , my dear , and i have to be so careful .
<name> says i 'm killing myself , but i 've found a little <unk> woman who is wonderful .
how do you like this dress ? "
" all your things are exquisite . "
" do you think so ? "
cried mrs. dallam , delightedly .
honora , indeed , had not <unk> herself .
only the <unk> , when mrs. dallam was dressed , had the impression of a performed miracle .
she was the most finished of finished products .
her complexion was high and ( be it added ) natural , her hair wonderfully <unk> ' , and she had withal the sweetest and kindest of smiles and the most engaging laughter in the world .
it was impossible not to love her .
" <name> , " she cried , when a little later they were seated at the table , " how mean of you to have kept honora in a dead and alive place like rivington all these years !
i think she 's an <name> to have stood it .
men are beyond me .
do you know what an attractive wife you 've got ?
i 've just been telling her that there was n't a woman at my tea who compared with her , and the men were crazy about her . "
" that 's the reason i live down there , " proclaimed <name> , as he finished his first glass of champagne .
" honora , " demanded mrs. dallam , ignoring his bravado , " why do n't you take a house at quicksands ?
you 'd love it , and you 'd look simply divine in a bathing suit .
why do n't you come down ? "
" ask <name> , " replied honora , demurely .
" well , <name> , i 'll own up i have been considering it a little , " that gentleman admitted with gravity .
" but i have n't decided anything .
there are certain drawbacks  " " drawbacks ! "
exclaimed mrs. dallam .
" drawbacks at quicksands !
i 'd like to know what they are .
do n't be silly , <name> .
you get more for your money there than any place i know . "
suddenly the light of an inspiration came into her eyes , and she turned to her husband .
" <name> , the <name> <name> house is for rent , is n't it ? "
" i think it must be , <name> , " replied mr. dallam .
" sometimes i believe i 'm losing my mind , " declared mrs. dallam .
" what an imbecile i was not to think of it !
it 's a dear , honora , not five minutes from the club , with the sweetest furniture , and they just finished it last fall .
it would be positively wicked not to take it , <name> .
they could n't have failed more <unk> .
i 'm sorry for <name> , but i always thought <name> <name> a little <unk> .
<name> , you must see <name> down town the first thing in the morning and ask him what 's the least he'll rent it for .
tell him i wish to know . "
" but  my dear <name>  began mr. dallam apologetically .
" there ! "
complained his wife , " you 're always raising objections to my most charming and sensible plans .
you act as though you wanted honora and <name> to stay in rivington . "
" my dear <name> ! "
he protested again .
and words failing him , he sought by a gesture to <unk> such a sinister motive for inaction .
" what harm can it do ? "
she asked plaintively .
" <name> does n't have to rent the house , although it would be a sin if he did n't .
find out the rent in the morning , <name> , and we 'll all four go down on <name> and look at it , and lunch at the quicksands club .
i 'm sure i can get out of my engagement at <name> <name> 's  this is so important .
what do you say , honora ? "
" i think it would be delightful , " said honora .
chapter v. quicksands to convey any adequate idea of the community familiarly known as quicksands a <unk> were necessary .
with a pen we can only approximate the appearance of the shifting grains at any one time .
some households there were , indeed , which maintained a precarious though seemingly miraculous footing on the surface , or near it , going under for mere brief periods , only to rise again and <unk> <unk> in the face of providence .
there were real tragedies , too , although a casual visitor would never have guessed it .
for tragedies sink , and that is the end of them .
the <unk> , to be sure , would reveal one from time to time , coming like a shadow across an endless feast , and gone again in a flash .
such was what might appropriately be called the episode of the <name> ferns .
after three years of married life they had come , they had rented ; the market had gone up , they had bought and built  upon the sands .
the ancient farmhouse which had stood on the site had been torn down as <unk> to a higher civilization , although the great elms which had sheltered it had been left standing , in grave contrast to the twisted cedars and stunted oaks so much in evidence round about .
the ferns  or rather little mrs. <name>  had had taste , and the new house reflected it .
as an indication of the quality of imagination possessed by the owners , the place was called " the <unk> . "
there was a long porch on the side of the ocean , but a view of the water was shut off from it by a hedge which , during the successive <unk> of the adjoining property , had attained a height of twelve feet .
there was a little toy greenhouse connecting with the porch ( an " economy " indulged in when the market had begun to go the wrong way for mr. <name> ) .
exile , although unpleasant , was sometimes found necessary at quicksands , and even effective .
above all things , however , if one is describing quicksands , one must not be depressing .
that is the <unk> sin there .
hence we must touch upon these tragedies lightly .
if , after walking through the entrance in the hedge that separated the <unk> from the main road , you turned to the left and followed a driveway newly laid out between young <unk> , you came to a mass of cedars .
behind these was hidden the stable .
there were four stalls , all replete with brass trimmings , and a box , and the <unk> was made large enough for the break which mr. <name> had been getting ready to buy when he had been forced , so unexpectedly , to change his mind .
if the world had been searched , perhaps , no greater contrast to rivington could have been found than this delightful colony of quicksands , full of life and motion and colour , where everybody was beautifully dressed and enjoying themselves .
for a whole week after her <unk> honora was in a continual state of excitement and anticipation , and the sound of wheels and voices on the <unk> beyond the hedge sent her peeping to her curtains a dozen times a day .
the waking hours , instead of burdens , were so many fleeting joys .
in the morning she awoke to breathe a new , perplexing , and delicious perfume  the salt sea breeze stirring her curtains : later , she was on the <name> , <unk> beach with <name> dallam , making new acquaintances ; and presently stepping , with a quiver of fear akin to delight , into the restless , limitless blue water that stretched southward under a milky haze : luncheon somewhere , more new acquaintances , and then , perhaps , in <name> 's light wood <name> to meet the train of trains .
for at half-past five the little station , forlorn all day long in the midst of the twisted cedars that grew out of the heated sand , assumed an air of gayety and animation .
vehicles of all sorts <name> up in the open space before it , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , high wheeled <unk> carts , and low <unk> carts : women in white summer gowns and veils compared notes , or shouted invitations to dinner from carriage to carriage .
the engine rolled in with a great cloud of dust , the horses danced , the husbands and the overnight guests , grimy and brandishing evening newspapers , poured out of the special car where they had sat in <unk> and talked stocks all the way from long island city .
some were driven home , it is true ; some to the beach , and others to the quicksands club , where they continued their discussions over <unk> until it was time to have a <unk> and dress for dinner .
then came the memorable evening when <name> dallam gave a dinner in honour of honora , her real introduction to quicksands .
it was characteristic of <name> that her touch made the desert bloom .
three years before quicksands had gasped to hear that the <name> <unk> had bought the <unk> house  or rather what remained of it .
" we got it for nothing , " <name> explained triumphantly on the occasion of honora 's first admiring view .
" nobody would look at it , my dear . "
it must have been this first price , undoubtedly , that appealed to <name> dallam , model for all husbands : to <name> , who had had as much of an idea of buying in quicksands as of acquiring a scotch shooting box .
the " <unk> place " had belonged to the middle ages , as time is reckoned in quicksands , and had lain deserted for years , chiefly on account of its <unk> and funereal aspect .
it was on a corner .
two " for rent " signs had fallen successively from the overgrown hedge : some fifty feet back from the road , hidden by undergrowth and in the <unk> shades of huge <unk> and cedars , stood a hideous , two-storied house with a mansard roof , once painted dark red .
the magical transformation of all this into a <name> , smiling , white villa with <unk> awnings and well-kept lawns and just enough shade had done no little towards giving to <name> dallam that ascendency which she had acquired with such startling rapidity in the community .
when honora and <name> drove up to the door in the deepening twilight , every window was a yellow , blazing square , and above the sound of voices rose a waltz from " <name> <unk> " played with vigour on the piano .
<name> dallam greeted honora in the little room which ( for some unexplained reason ) was known as the library , pressed into service at dinner parties as the ladies ' dressing room .
" my dear , how sweet you look in that <name> !
i 've been so lucky to-night , " she added in honora 's ear ; " i 've actually got trixy <name> for you . "
our heroine was conscious of a pleasurable <unk> as she walked with her hostess across the little entry to the door of the drawing-room , where her eyes encountered an inviting and vivacious scene .
some ten or a dozen guests , laughing and talking gayly , filled the spaces between the furniture ; an upright piano was embedded in a corner , and the <name> who had just executed the waltz had swung around on the stool , and was smiling up at a man who stood beside her with his hand in his pocket .
she was a decided <unk> , neither tall nor short , with a suggestion of <unk> .
" that 's <name> chandos , " explained <name> dallam in her usual <unk> , following honora 's gaze , " at the piano , in ashes of roses .
she 's stopped mourning for her husband .
trixy told her to-night she 'd discarded the sackcloth and kept the ashes .
he 's awfully clever .
i do n't wonder that she 's crazy about him , do you ?
he 's standing beside her . "
honora took a good look at the famous trixy , who resembled a certain type of military englishman .
he had close-cropped hair and a close-cropped mustache ; and his grey eyes , as they rested <unk> on mrs. chandos , seemed to have in them the light of mockery .
" trixy ! "
cried his hostess , threading her way with considerable skill across the room and dragging honora after her , " trixy , i want to introduce you to mrs. spence .
now are n't you glad you came ! "
it was partly , no doubt , by such informal introductions that <name> dallam had made her reputation as the mistress of a house where one and all had such a good time .
honora , of course , blushed to her temples , and everybody laughed  even mrs. chandos .
" glad , " said mr. <name> , with his eyes on honora , " does not quite express it .
you usually have a supply of <unk> , <name> , which you might have drawn on . "
" is n't he irrepressible ? "
demanded <name> dallam , delightedly , " he's always teasing . "
it was running through honora 's mind , while <name> dallam 's characteristic introductions of the other guests were in progress , that " irrepressible " was an inaccurate word to apply to mr. <name> 's manner .
honora could not define his attitude , but she vaguely resented it .
all of <name> 's guests had the air of being at home , and at that moment a young gentleman named <name> <unk> , who was six feet tall and weighed two hundred pounds , was loudly demanding <unk> .
they were presently brought by a rather <unk> <unk> .
" i ca n't get over how well you look in that gown , <name> , " declared mrs. dallam , as they went out to dinner .
" trixy , what does she remind you of ? "
" <name> , " cried <unk> trowbridge , with an attempt to be gallant .
" eternal vigilance , " said mr. <name> , and they sat down amidst the laughter , <name> dallam declaring that he was horrid , and mrs. chandos giving him a look of tender reproach .
but he turned abruptly to honora , who was on his other side .
" where did you drop down from , mrs .
spence ? "
he inquired .
" why do you take it for granted that i have dropped ? "
she asked sweetly .
he looked at her queerly for a moment , and then burst out laughing .
" because you are sitting next to <unk> , " he said .
" it 's kind of me to warn you , is n't it ? "
" it was n't necessary , " replied honora .
" and besides , as a dinner companion , i imagine <unk> could n't be improved on . "
he laughed again .
" as a dinner companion ! "
he repeated .
" so you would limit <unk> to dinners ?
that 's rather a severe punishment , since we 're neighbours . "
" how delightful to have <unk> as one 's neighbour , " said honora , avoiding his eyes .
" of course i 've been brought up to believe that he was always next door , so to speak , but i 've never  had any proof of it until now . "
" proof ! "
echoed mr. <name> .
" has my reputation gone before me ? "
" i smell the brimstone , " said honora .
he derived , apparently , infinite amusement from this remark likewise .
" if i had known i was to have the honour of sitting here , i should have used another perfume , " he replied .
" i have several . "
it was honora 's turn to laugh .
" they are probably for  commercial transactions , not for ladies , " she retorted .
" we are notoriously fond of brimstone , if it is not too strong .
a suspicion of it . "
her colour was high , and she was surprised at her own vivacity .
it seemed strange that she should be holding her own in this manner with the renowned trixton <name> .
no wonder , after four years of rivington , that she tingled with an unwonted excitement .
at this point mr. <name> 's eye fell upon <name> , who was explaining something to mrs. trowbridge at the far end of the table .
" what 's your husband like ? "
he demanded abruptly .
honora was a little taken aback , but recovered sufficiently to retort : " you 'd hardly expect me to give you an <unk> judgment . "
" that 's true , " he agreed significantly .
" he 's everything , " added honora , " that is to be expected in a husband . "
" which is n't much , in these days , " declared mr. <name> .
" on the contrary , " said honora .
" what i should like to know is why you came to quicksands , " said mr. <name> .
" for a little excitement , " she replied .
" so far , i have not been disappointed .
but why do you ask that question ? "
she demanded , with a slight uneasiness .
" why did you come here ? "
" oh , " he said , " you must remember that i 'm  <unk> , a citizen of the world , at home anywhere , a sort of <unk> .
i 'm not here all the time  but that 's no reflection on quicksands .
may i make a bet with you , mrs .
spence ? "
" what about ? "
" that you wo n't stay in quicksands more than six months , " he answered .
" why do you say that ? "
she asked curiously .
he shook his head .
" my experience with your sex , " he declared <unk> , " has not been a slight one . "
" trixy ! "
interrupted mrs. chandos at this juncture , from his other side , " <unk> trowbridge wo n't tell me whether to sell my consolidated <unk> stock . "
" because he does n't know , " said mr. <name> , laconically , and <unk> himself to honora , who had , however , caught a glimpse of mrs. <unk> face .
" do n't you think it 's time for you to talk to mrs .
chandos ? "
she asked .
" what for ? "
" well , for one reason , it is customary , out of consideration for the hostess , to assist in turning the table . "
" <name> does n't care , " he said .
" how about mrs. chandos ?
i have an idea that she does care . "
he made a gesture of indifference .
" and how about me ? "
honora continued .
" perhaps  i 'd like to talk to mr .
dallam . "
" have you ever tried it ? "
he demanded .
over her shoulder she flashed back at him a glance which he did not return .
she had never , to tell the truth , given her husband 's partner much consideration .
he had existed in her mind solely as an obliging shopkeeper with whom <name> had unlimited credit , and who handed her over the counter such things as she desired .
and to-night , in contrast to trixton <name> , <name> dallam suggested the counter more than ever before .
he was about five and forty , small , neatly made , with little hands and feet ; fast growing bald , and what hair remained to him was a jet black .
his <unk> of manner and anxious <name> to give one just the topic that pleased had always irritated honora .
good shopkeepers are not supposed to have any tastes , <unk> , or desires of their own , and it was therefore with no little surprise that , after many haphazard attempts , honora discovered mr. dallam to be possessed by one <unk> weakness .
she had fallen in love , she remarked , with little <name> on the beach , and <name> dallam suddenly became transfigured .
was she fond of children ?
honora coloured a little , and said " yes . "
he confided to her , with an astonishing degree of feeling , that it had been the regret of his life he had not had more children .
nobody , he implied , who came to his house had ever exhibited the proper interest in <name> .
" sometimes , " he said , leaning towards her confidentially , " i slip upstairs for a little peep at him after dinner . "
" oh , " cried honora , " if you 're going to-night may n't i go with you ?
i'd love to see him in bed . "
" of course i 'll take you , " said <name> dallam , and he looked at her so gratefully that she coloured again .
" honora , " said <name> dallam , when the women were back in the drawing-room , " what did you do to <name> ?
you had him beaming  and he hates dinner parties . "
" we were talking about children , " replied honora , innocently .
" children ! "
" yes , " said honora , " and your husband has promised to take me up to the nursery . "
" and did you talk to trixy about children , too ? "
cried <name> , laughing , with a mischievous glance at mrs. chandos .
" is he interested in them ? "
asked honora .
" you dear ! "
cried <name> , " you 'll be the death of me .
<name> , honora wants to know whether trixy is interested in children . "
mrs. chandos , in the act of lighting a cigarette , smiled sweetly .
" apparently he is , " she said .
" it 's time he were , if he 's ever going to be , " said honora , just as sweetly .
everybody laughed but mrs. chandos , who began to betray an intense interest in some old lace in the corner of the room .
" i bought it for nothing , my dear , " said mrs. dallam , but she pinched honora 's arm delightedly .
" how wicked of you ! "
she whispered , " but it serves her right . "
in the midst of the discussion of clothes and house rents and other people 's possessions , interspersed with anecdotes of a kind that was new to honora , <name> dallam appeared at the door and beckoned to her .
" how silly of you , <name> ! "
exclaimed his wife ; " of course she does n't want to go . "
" indeed i do , " protested honora , rising with alacrity and following her host up the stairs .
at the end of a hallway a nurse , who had been reading beside a lamp , got up smilingly and led the way on tiptoe into the nursery , turning on a shaded electric light .
honora bent over the crib .
the child lay , as children <name> , with his little yellow head resting on his arm .
but in a moment , as she stood gazing at him , he turned and opened his eyes and smiled at her , and she stooped and kissed him .
" where 's daddy ? "
he demanded .
" we 've waked him ! "
said honora , <unk> .
" daddy , " said the child , " tell me a story . "
the nurse looked at dallam reproachfully , as her duty demanded , and yet she smiled .
the noise of laughter reached them from below .
" i did n't have any to-night , " the child pleaded .
" i got home late , " dallam explained to honora , and , looking at the nurse , pleaded in his turn ; " just one . "
" just a <name> one , " said the child .
" it 's against all rules , mr. dallam , " said the nurse , " but  he 's been very lonesome to-day . "
dallam sat down on one side of him , honora on the other .
" <name> you go to sleep right away if i do , <name> ? "
he asked .
the child shut his eyes very tight .
" like that , " he promised .
it was not the <name> dallam of the <unk> who told that story , and honora listened with strange sensations which she did not attempt to define .
" i used to be fond of that one when i was a youngster , " he explained apologetically to her as they went out , and little <name> had settled himself obediently on the pillow once more .
" it was when i dreamed , " he added , " of less <unk> occupations than the stock market . "
<name> dallam had dreamed !
although <name> dallam had declared that to leave her house before midnight was to insult her , it was half-past eleven when honora and her husband reached home .
he halted smilingly in her doorway as she took off her wrap and laid it over a chair .
" well , honora , " he asked , " how do you like  the whirl of fashion ? "
she turned to him with one of those rapid and bewildering movements that sometimes characterized her , and put her arms on his shoulders .
" what a dear old <unk> you were , <name> , " she said .
" i wonder what would have happened to you if i had n't rescued you in the <name> of time !
own up that you like  a little variety in life . "
being a man , he qualified his approval .
" i did n't have a bad time , " he admitted .
" i had a talk with <name> after dinner , and i think i 've got him interested in a little scheme .
it's a strange thing that <name> dallam was never able to do any business with him .
if i can put this through , coming to quicksands <name> have been worth while . "
he paused a moment , and added : " <name> seems to have taken quite a shine to you , honora . "
she dropped her arms , and going over to her dressing table , <unk> a pin on the front of her gown .
" i imagine , " she answered , in an indifferent tone , " that he acts so with every new woman he meets . "
<name> remained for a while in the doorway , seemingly about to speak .
then he turned on his heel , and she heard him go into his own room .
far into the night she lay awake , the various incidents of the evening , like magic lantern views , thrown with bewildering rapidity on the screen of her mind .
at last she was launched into life , and the days of her isolation gone by forever .
she was in the centre of things .
and yet  well , nothing could be perfect .
perhaps she demanded too much .
once or twice , in the intimate and somewhat <unk> <unk> that had been tossed back and forth in the drawing-room after dinner , her delicacy had been offended : an air of revelry had prevailed , enhanced by the arrival of <unk> on a tray .
and at the time she had been caught up by an excitement in the grip of which she still found herself .
she had been aware , as she tried to talk to <name> trowbridge , of trixton <unk> glance , and of a certain hostility from mrs. chandos that caused her now to grow warm with a kind of shame when she thought of it .
but she could not deny that this man had for her a fascination .
there was in him an insolent sense of power , of scarcely veiled contempt for the company in which he found himself .
and she asked herself , in this mood of <unk> , whether a little of his contempt for <name> dallam 's guests had not been communicated from him to her .
when she had risen to leave , he had followed her into the entry .
she recalled him vividly as he had stood before her then , a cigar in one hand and a lighted match in the other , his eyes fixed upon her with a singularly disquieting look that was tinged , however , with amusement .
" i 'm coming to see you , " he announced .
" do be careful , " she had cried , " you 'll burn yourself ! "
" that , " he answered , tossing away the match , " is to be expected . "
she laughed nervously .
" good night , " he added , " and remember my bet . "
what could he have meant when he had declared that she would not remain in quicksands ?
chapter <name> .
gad and <unk> .
there was an orthodox place of worship at quicksands , a <name> not merely opened up for an hour or so on <name> mornings to be shut tight during the remainder of the week although it was thronged with devotees on the sabbath .
this <name> , of course , was the quicksands club .
<name> spence was quite orthodox ; and , like some of our puritan forefathers , did not even come home to the midday meal on the first day of the week .
but a certain instinct of protest and of <unk> which may have been remarked in our heroine sent her to st. <unk>  by no means so well attended as the house of gad and <unk> .
she walked home in a pleasantly contemplative state of mind through a field of <unk> , and had just arrived at the hedge in front of the <unk> when the sound of hoofs behind her caused her to turn .
mr. trixton <name> , very firmly astride of a restive , <unk> polo pony , surveyed her <unk> .
" where have you been ? "
said he .
" to church , " replied honora , demurely .
" such virtue is unheard of in quicksands . "
" it is n't virtue , " said honora .
" i had my doubts about that , too , " he declared .
" what is it , then ? "
she asked laughingly , wondering why he had such a faculty of stirring her excitement and interest .
" dissatisfaction , " was his prompt reply .
" i do n't see why you say that , " she protested .
" i 'm prepared to make my wager definite , " said he .
" the odds are a thoroughbred horse against a personally knitted worsted waistcoat that you wo n't stay in quicksands six months . "
" i wish you would n't talk nonsense , " said honora , " and besides , i can't knit . "
there was a short silence during which he did n't relax his disconcerting stare .
" wo n't you come in ? "
she asked .
" i 'm sorry <name> is n't home . "
" i 'm not , " he said promptly .
" ca n't you come over to my box for lunch ?
i 've asked <name> chandos and <unk> trowbridge . "
it was not without <unk> that trixton <name> called his house the " box . "
it was square , with no pretensions to architecture whatever , with a porch running all the way around it .
and it was literally filled with the relics of the man 's physical prowess cups for games of all descriptions , heads and skins from the bitter roots to bengal , and masks and brushes from england .
to honora there was an irresistible and mysterious fascination in all these trophies , each suggesting a finished  and some perhaps a cruel  performance of the man himself .
the cups were polished until they beat back the light like mirrors , and the glossy bear and tiger skins gave no hint of dying agonies .
mr. <name> 's method with women , honora observed , more resembled the <name> sport of <name> <name> than that of <unk> , but she could not deny that this element of cruelty was one of his fascinations .
it was very evident to a feminine observer , for instance , that mrs. chandos was engaged in a breathless and altogether desperate struggle with the slow but inevitable and appalling <unk> of a body and character that would not <unk> .
if her figure grew stout , what was to become of her charm as an <unk> gate ' ?
her host not only perceived , but apparently derived great enjoyment out of the drama of this contest .
from <unk> to self-denial  even though inspired by terror  is a far cry .
and trixton <name> had evidently prepared his menu with a <unk> purpose .
" what !
no <unk> , <name> ?
i had that sauce especially for you . "
" oh , trixy , did you really ?
how sweet of you ! "
and her liquid eyes regarded , with an almost equal affection , first the master and then the dish .
" i 'll take a little , " she said weakly ; " it 's so bad for my gout . "
" what , " asked trixton <name> , flashing an amused glance at honora , " are the symptoms of gout , <name> ?
i hear a great deal about that trouble these days , but it seems to affect every one differently . "
mrs. chandos grew very red , but <unk> trowbridge saved her .
" it 's a swelling , " he said innocently .
<name> threw back his head and laughed .
" you have n't got it anyway , <unk> , " he cried .
mr. trowbridge , who resembled a <name> and <unk> <name> terrier , maintained that he had .
" it 's a pity you do n't ride , <name> .
i understand that that 's one of the best <unk>  for gout .
i bought a horse last week that would just suit you  an ideal woman 's horse .
he 's taken a couple of blue ribbons this summer . "
" i <name> you <name> show him to us , mr. <name> , " exclaimed honora , in a spirit of kindness .
" do you ride ? "
he demanded .
" i 'm devoted to it , " she declared .
it was true .
for many weeks that spring , on monday , wednesday , and friday mornings , she had gone up from rivington to <name> 's riding academy , near central park .
thus she had acquired the elements of the <unk> <name> , and incidentally aroused the enthusiasm of a <unk> .
after mrs. chandos had smoked three of the cigarettes which her host specially imported from egypt , she declared , with no <unk> of enthusiasm , that she was ready to go and see what trixy had in the " stables . "
in spite of that <name> 's somewhat obvious impatience , honora insisted upon admiring everything from the monogram of coloured sands so deftly woven on the white in the coach house , to the hunters and polo ponies in their rows of boxes .
at last <unk> , the latest acquisition of which <name> had spoken , was uncovered and trotted around the ring .
" i 'm sorry , trixy , but i 've really got to leave , " said mrs. chandos .
" and i 'm in such a predicament !
i promised <name> <unk> i 'd go over there , and it 's eight miles , and both my horses are lame . "
<name> turned to his coachman .
" put a pair in the <name> right away and drive mrs. chandos to mrs. <unk> 's , " he said .
she looked at him , and her lip quivered .
" you always were the soul of generosity , trixy , but why the <name> ? "
" my dear <name> , " he replied , " if there 's any other carriage you prefer  ? "
honora did not hear the answer , which at any rate was scarcely audible .
she moved away , and her eyes continued to follow <unk> as he trotted about the <unk> after a groom .
and presently she was aware that trixton <name> was standing beside her .
" what do you think of him ? "
he asked .
" he 's adorable , " declared honora .
" would you like to try him ? "
" oh  might i ?
sometime ? "
" why not to-day  now ? "
he said .
" i 'll send him over to your house and have your saddle put on him . "
before honora could protest mrs. chandos came forward .
" it 's awfully sweet of you , trixy , to offer to send me to <name> 's , but <unk> says he <name> drive me over .
good-by , my dear , " she added , holding out her hand to honora .
" i <name> you enjoy your ride . "
mr. trowbridge 's <unk> was brought up , <name> helped mrs. chandos in , and stood for a moment gazing after her .
amusement was still in his eyes as he turned to honora .
" poor <name> ! "
he said .
" most women could have done it better than that  could n't they ? "
" i think you were horrid to her , " exclaimed honora , indignantly .
" it would n't have hurt you to drive her to mrs .
<unk> 's . "
it did not occur to her that her rebuke implied a familiarity at which they had swiftly but imperceptibly arrived .
" oh , yes , it would hurt me , " said he .
" i 'd rather spend a day in jail than drive with <name> in that frame of mind .
tender reproaches , and all that sort of thing , you know although i ca n't believe you ever indulge in them .
do n't , " he added .
in spite of the fact that she was up in arms for her sex , honora smiled .
" do you know , " she said slowly , " i 'm beginning to think you are a brute . "
" that 's encouraging , " he replied .
" and fickle . "
" still more encouraging .
most men are fickle .
we 're predatory animals . "
" it 's just as well that i am warned , " said honora .
she raised her parasol and picked up her skirts and shot him a look .
although he did not resemble in feature the great if unscrupulous emperor of the french , he reminded her now of a picture she had once seen of <name> and a <name> ; the <name> obviously in a little flutter under the <unk> scrutiny .
the picture had suggested a probable future for the <name> .
" how long <name> it take you to dress ? "
he asked .
" to dress for what ? "
" to ride with me . "
" i 'm not going to ride with you , " she said , and experienced a tingle of satisfaction from his surprise .
" why not ? "
he demanded .
" in the first place , because i do n't want to ; and in the second , because i 'm expecting <name> dallam . "
" <name> never keeps an engagement , " he said .
" that 's no reason why i should n't , " honora answered .
" i 'm beginning to think you 're deuced clever , " said he .
" how unfortunate for me ! "
she exclaimed .
he laughed , although it was plain that he was obviously put out .
honora was still smiling .
" deuced clever , " he repeated .
" an experienced moth , " suggested honora ; " perhaps one that has been singed a little , once or twice .
good-by  i 've enjoyed myself immensely . "
she glanced back at him as she walked down the path to the roadway .
he was still standing where she had left him , his feet slightly apart , his hands in the pockets of his riding breeches , looking after her .
her announcement of an engagement with mrs. dallam had been , to put it politely , fiction .
she spent the rest of the afternoon writing letters home , pausing at periods to look out of the window .
occasionally it appeared that her reflections were amusing .
at seven o'clock <name> arrived , flushed and tired after his day of rest .
" by the way , honora , i saw trixy <name> at the club , and he said you would n't go riding with him . "
" do you call him trixy to his face ? "
she asked .
" what ?
no  but everyone calls him trixy .
what 's the matter with you ? "
" nothing , " she replied .
" only  the habit every one has in quicksands of speaking of people they do n't know well by their nicknames seems rather bad taste . "
" i thought you liked quicksands , " he retorted .
" you were n't happy until you got down here . "
" it 's infinitely better than rivington , " she said .
" i suppose , " he remarked , with a little irritation unusual in him , " that you 'll be wanting to go to newport next . "
" perhaps , " said honora , and resumed her letter .
he fidgeted about the room for a while , ordered a <unk> , and lighted a cigarette .
" look here , " he began presently , " i wish you 'd be decent to <name> .
he's a pretty good fellow , and he 's in with <name> wing and that crowd of big financiers , and he seems to have taken a shine to me probably because he 's heard of that copper deal i put through this spring . "
honora thrust back her writing pad , turned in her chair , and faced him .
" how <unk> ' do you wish me to be ? "
she inquired .
" how decent ? "
he repeated .
" yes . "
he regarded her uneasily , took the <unk> which the maid offered him , drank it , and laid down the glass .
he had had before , in the presence of his wife , this vague feeling of having passed boundaries invisible to him .
in her eyes was a curious smile that lacked mirth , in her voice a dispassionate note that added to his bewilderment .
" what do you mean , honora ? "
" i know it 's too much to expect of a man to be as solicitous about his wife as he is about his business , " she replied .
" otherwise he would hesitate before he threw her into the arms of mr. trixton <name> .
i warn you that he is very attractive to women . "
" <name> it , " said <name> , " i ca n't see what you 're driving at .
i 'm not throwing you into his arms .
i 'm merely asking you to be friendly with him .
it means a good deal to me  to both of us .
and besides , you can take care of yourself .
you 're not the sort of woman to play the fool . "
" one never can tell , " said honora , " what may happen .
suppose i fell in love with him ? "
" do n't talk nonsense , " he said .
" i 'm not so sure , " she answered , meditatively , " that it is nonsense .
it would be quite easy to fall in love with him .
easier than you imagine .
curiously .
would you care ? "
she added .
" care ! "
he cried ; " of course i 'd care .
what kind of rot are you talking ? "
" why would you care ? "
" why ?
what a darned idiotic question  " " it 's not really so idiotic as you think it is , " she said .
" suppose i allowed mr. <name> to make love to me , as he 's very willing to do , would you be sufficiently interested to compete . "
" to what ? "
" to compete . "
" but  but we 're married . "
she laid her hand upon her knee and glanced down at it .
" it never occurred to me until lately , " she said , " how absurd is the belief men still hold in these days that a <unk> <unk> them forever from any effort on their part to retain their wives ' affections .
they regard the ring very much as a ball and chain , or a hobble to prevent the women from running away , that they may catch them whenever they may <name>  which is n't often .
am i not right ? "
he snapped his cigarette case .
" <unk> it , honora , you 're getting too deep for me ! "
he exclaimed .
" you never liked those , browning women down at rivington , but if this isn't browning i 'm hanged if i know what it is .
an attack of nerves , perhaps .
they tell me that women go all to pieces nowadays over nothing at all . "
" that 's just it , " she agreed , " nothing at all ! "
" i thought as much , " he replied , eager to seize this opportunity of ending a conversation that had neither head nor tail , and yet was marvellously uncomfortable .
" there !
be a good girl , and forget it . "
he stooped down suddenly to her face to kiss her , but she turned her face in time to receive the caress on the cheek .
" the <unk> ! "
she said .
he laughed a little , <unk> , as he stood looking down at her .
" sometimes i ca n't make you out , " he said .
" you 've changed a good deal since i married you . "
she was silent .
but the thought occurred to her that a complete absorption in <unk> was not developing .
" if you can manage it , honora , " he added with an attempt at lightness , " i wish you 'd have a little dinner soon , and ask <name> .
<name> you ? "
" nothing , " she replied , " would give me greater pleasure . "
he patted her on the shoulder and left the room whistling .
but she sat where she was until the maid came in to pull the curtains and turn on the lights , reminding her that guests were expected .
... ... ... ... ... ... ...
although the circle of mr. <name> 's friends could not be said to include any university or college presidents , it was , however , both catholic and wide .
he was hail fellow , indeed , with <unk> and financiers , great ladies and municipal statesmen of good <name> stock .
he was a lion who roamed at large over a great variety of hunting grounds , some of which it would be <unk> to mention ; for many reasons he preferred quicksands : a <unk> , a <unk> , and extraordinarily popular , nevertheless .
many ladies , so it was reported , had tried to tame him : some of them he had cheerfully <unk> up , and others after the briefest of <unk> , <unk> thrust aside with his paw .
this instinct for lion taming , which the most spirited of women possess , is , by the way , almost inexplicable to the great majority of the male sex .
honora had it , as must have been guessed .
but however our <name> in her may be justified by the ridiculous ease of her previous conquests , we can not regard without trepidation her entrance into the arena with this particular and widely renowned king of beasts .
innocence pitted against <unk> and <unk> and might .
two of the preliminary contests we have already witnessed .
others , more or less similar , followed during a period of two months or more .
nothing inducing the excessive wagging of tongues ,  honora saw to that , although mrs. chandos kindly took the trouble to warn our heroine ,  a scene for which there is unfortunately no space in this chronicle ; an entirely amicable , almost <unk> scene , in honora 's boudoir .
nor can a complete picture of life at quicksands be undertaken .
multiply mrs. <unk> dinner-party by one hundred , <name> silence 's sundays at the club by twenty , and one has a very fair idea of it .
it was not precisely intellectual .
" happy , " says <unk> , " the people whose annals are blank in history 's book . "
let us leave it at that .
late one afternoon in <name> honora was riding homeward along the ocean road .
the fragrant marshes that bordered it were a vivid green under the slanting rays of the sun , and she was gazing across them at the breakers crashing on the beach beyond .
trixton <name> was beside her .
" i wish you would n't stare at me so , " she said , turning to him suddenly ; " it is embarrassing . "
" how did you know i was looking at you ? "
he asked .
" i felt it . "
he <name> his horse a little nearer .
" sometimes you 're positively uncanny , " she added .
he laughed .
" i rather like that <unk> expression you wore , " he declared .
" castles in spain ? "
" or in some other place where the real estate is more valuable .
certainly not in quicksands . "
" you are uncanny , " proclaimed honora , with conviction .
" i told you you would n't like quicksands , " said he .
" i 've never said i did n't like it , " she replied .
" i ca n't see why you assume that i do n't . "
" you 're ambitious , " he said .
" not that i think it a fault , when it's more or less warranted .
your thrown away here , and you know it . "
she made him a bow from the saddle .
" i have not been without a reward , at least , " she answered , and looked at him .
" i have , " said he .
honora smiled .
" i 'm going to be your good <name> , and help you get out of it , " he continued .
" get out of what ? "
" quicksands . "
" do you think i 'm in danger of sinking ? "
she asked .
" and is it impossible for me to get out alone , if i wished to ? "
" it <name> be easier with my help , " he answered .
" you 're clever enough to realize that  honora . "
she was silent awhile .
" you say the most extraordinary things , " she remarked presently .
" sometimes i think they are almost  " " indelicate , " he supplied .
she coloured .
" yes , indelicate . "
" you ca n't forgive me for sweeping away your <unk> cloud of romance , " he declared , laughing .
" there are spades in the pack , however much you may wish to ignore 'em .
you know very well you do n't like these quicksands people .
they grate on your finer <unk> , and all that sort of thing .
come , now , is n't it so ? "
she coloured again , and put her horse to the trot .
" onwards and upwards , " he cried .
" <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . "
" it seems to me , " she laughed , " that so much education is thrown away on the stock market . "
" whether you <name> be any happier higher up , " he went on , " god knows .
sometimes i think you ought to go back to the <unk> you came from .
did you pick out spence for an embryo lord of high finance ? "
" my excuse is , " replied honora , " that i was very young , and i had n't met you . "
whether the lion has judged our heroine with astuteness , or done her a little less than justice , must be left to the reader .
apparently he is accepting her gentle lashings with a meek enjoyment .
he assisted her to alight at her own door , sent the horses home , and offered to come in and give her a lesson in a delightful game that was to do its share in the disintegration of the old and tiresome order of things  bridge .
the lion , it <name> be seen , was self-sacrificing even to the extent of double dummy .
he had picked up the game with characteristic <unk> abroad  quicksands had yet to learn it .
<name> spence entered in the midst of the lesson .
" hello , <name> , " said he , genially , " you may be interested to know i got that little matter through without a hitch to-day . "
" i continue to <name> at you , " said the lion , and made it no <unk> .
since this is a <unk> history , and since we have wandered so far from home and amidst such strange , if brilliant scenes , it must be confessed that honora , three days earlier , had entered a certain shop in new york and inquired for a book on bridge .
yes , said the clerk , he had such a treatise , it had arrived from england a week before .
she kept it looked up in her drawer , and studied it in the mornings with a pack of cards before her .
given the proper amount of spur , anything in reason can be mastered .
volume 4 .
chapter vii .
of certain delicate matters in the religious cult of gad and <unk> , practised with such enthusiasm at quicksands , the saints ' days were polo days , and the chief of all festivals the occasion of the match with the <unk> hunt club  quicksands 's greatest rival .
rival for more reasons than one , reasons too delicate to tell .
long , long ago there appeared in punch a <unk> of lord <unk> executing that most difficult of performances , an egg dance .
we shall be fortunate indeed if we get to the end of this chapter without breaking an egg !
our pen fails us in a description of that festival of festivals , the <unk> one , which took place early in <name> .
we should have to go back to babylon and the days of king <unk> .
( who turns out to have been only a regent , by the way , and his name is now said to be spelled <unk> ) .
how give an idea of the <unk> poured out to gad and the shekels laid aside for <unk> in the quicksands <name> ?
honora privately thought that building ugly , and it reminded her of a collection of huge yellow <unk> sprawling over the ground .
a few of the inevitable tortured cedars were around it .
between two of the larger buildings was wedged a room dedicated to the worship of <unk> , to-day like a narrow <unk> at flood time jammed with tree-trunks  some of them , let us say , <unk>  and all grinding together with an intolerable noise like a battle .
if you happened to be passing the windows , certain more or less intelligible sounds might separate themselves from the bedlam .
" four to five on quicksands ! "
" that stock is n't worth a d  n ! "
" she 's gone to south <name> . "
honora , however , is an heretic , as we know .
without going definitely into her reasons , these festivals had gradually become distasteful to her .
perhaps it would be fairer to look at them through the eyes of <name> dallam , who was in her element on such days , and regarded them as the most innocent and enjoyable of occasions , and perhaps they were .
the view from the veranda , at least , appealed to our heroine 's artistic sense .
the marshes in the middle distance , the shimmering sea beyond , and the polo field laid down like a vast green carpet in the foreground ; while the players , in white breeches and bright shirts , on the agile little horses that darted hither and thither across the turf lent an added touch of colour and movement to the scene .
amongst them , trixton <name> most frequently caught the eye and held it .
once honora perceived him flying the length of the field , madly pursued , his mallet poised lightly , his shirt bulging in the wind , his close-cropped head bereft of a cap , regardless of the havoc and confusion behind him .
he played , indeed , with the <unk> and individuality one might have expected ; and honora , forgetting at moments the disturbing elements by which she was surrounded , followed him with fascination .
occasionally his name rippled from one end of the crowded veranda to the other , and she experienced a curious and uncomfortable sensation when she heard it in the mouths of these strangers .
from time to time she found herself watching them furtively , comparing them unconsciously with her quicksands friends .
some of them she had remarked before , at contests of a minor importance , and they seemed to her to possess a certain distinction that was indefinable .
they had come to-day from many mysterious ( and therefore delightful ) places which honora knew only by name , and some had driven the twenty-five odd miles from the bunting community of <unk> in coaches and even those new and marvellous <unk>  french automobiles .
when the game had ended , and <name> dallam was <unk> the club steward to set her tea-table at once , a group of these visitors halted on the lawn , talking and laughing gayly .
two of the younger men honora recognized with a start , but for a moment she could not place them  until suddenly she remembered that she had seen them on her wedding trip at hot springs .
the one who lisped was mr. cuthbert , familiarly known as " <unk> " : the other , taller and <unk> and paler , was <name> wing .
a third , the regularity of whose features made one wonder at the perfection which nature could attain when she chose , who had a certain <unk> appearance ( and who , if the truth be told , might have reminded an impartial eye of a slightly animated wax clothing model ) , turned , stared , hesitated , and bowed to <name> dallam .
" that 's <name> <unk> , who did my house in town , " she whispered to honora .
" he 's never been near me since it was finished .
he 's utterly ruined . "
honora was silent .
she tried not to look at the group , in which there were two women of very attractive appearance , and another man .
" those people are so superior , " mrs. dallam continued .
" i 'm not surprised at <name> shorter .
ever since she married <name> she's stuck to the <unk> closer than a sister .
that 's <name> grainger , my dear , the man who looks as though he were going to fall asleep any moment .
but to think of <name> kame acting that way !
is n't it ridiculous , <name> ? "
she cried , appealing to mrs. trowbridge .
" they say that <name> grainger never leaves her side .
i knew her when she first married <name> kame , the dearest , simplest man that ever was .
he was twenty years older than <name> , and made his money in leather .
she took the first steamer after his funeral and an apartment in a <name> palace for the <name> .
as soon as she decently could she made for england .
the english <name> put up with anybody who has a few million dollars , and i do n't deny that <unk> good-looking , and clever in her way .
but it 's absurd for her to come over here and act as though we did n't exist .
she need n't be afraid that i 'll speak to her .
they say she became intimate with <name> grainger through charities .
one of your friend mrs. holt 's charities , by the way , honora .
where are you going ? "
for honora had risen .
" i think i 'll go home , <name> , " she said ; " i 'm rather tired . "
" home ! "
exclaimed mrs. dallam .
" what can you be thinking of , my dear ?
nobody ever goes home after the <unk> match .
the fun has just begun , and we 're all to stay here for dinner and dance afterwards .
and trixy <name> promised me faithfully he 'd ' come here for tea , as soon as he dressed . "
" i really ca n't stay , <name> .
i  i do n't feel up to it , " said honora , desperately .
" and you ca n't know how i counted on you !
you look perfectly fresh , my dear . "
honora felt an overwhelming <name> to hide herself , to be alone .
in spite of the cries of protest that followed her and <name>  she thought  an unnecessary and disagreeable attention to her departure , she threaded her way among groups of people who stared after her .
her colour was high , her heart beating painfully ; a vague sense of rebellion and shame within her for which she did not try to account .
rather than run the <unk> of the crowded veranda she stepped out on the lawn , and there encountered trixton <name> .
he had , in an incredibly brief time , changed from his polo clothes to <unk> and a straw hat .
he looked at her and whistled , and barred her passage .
" hello ! "
he cried .
" <unk> !
where are we going in such a hurry ? "
" home , " answered honora , a little breathlessly , and added for his deception , " the game 's over , is n't it ?
i 'm glad you won . "
mr. <name> , however , continued to gaze at her <unk> , and she avoided his eyes .
" but why are you rushing off like a flushed partridge ?  no reference to your complexion .
has there been a row ? "
" oh , no  i was just  tired .
please let me go . "
" being your good <name>  or physician , as you choose  i have a prescription for that kind of weariness , " he said smilingly .
" i  anticipated such an attack .
that 's why i got into my clothes in such record time . "
" i do n't know what you mean , " faltered honora .
" you are always imagining all sorts of things about me that are n't true . "
" as a matter of fact , " said <name> , " i have promised faithfully to do a favor for certain friends of mine who have been clamouring to be presented to you . "
" i ca n't  to-day  mr. <name> , " she cried .
" i really do n't feel <unk> people .
i told <name> dallam i was going home . "
the group , however , which had been the object of that <name> 's remarks was already moving towards them  with the exception of mrs .
shorter and mr. farwell , who had left it .
they greeted mr. <name> with great cordiality .
" mrs. kame , " he said , " let me introduce mrs. spence .
and mrs. spence , mr. grainger , mr. wing , and mr. cuthbert .
mrs. spence was just going home . "
" home ! "
echoed mrs. kame , " i thought quicksands people never went home after a victory . "
" i 've scarcely been here long enough , " replied honora , " to have acquired all of the quicksands habits . "
" oh , " said mrs. kame , and looked at honora again .
" was n't that mrs. dallam you were with ?
i used to know her , years ago , but she doesn't speak to me any more . "
" perhaps she thinks you 've forgotten her , " said honora .
" it would be impossible to forget mrs. dallam , " declared mrs. kame .
" so i should have thought , " said honora .
trixton <name> laughed , and mrs. kame , too , after a moment 's hesitation .
she laid her hand familiarly on mr. <name> 's arm .
" i have n't seen you all summer , trixy , " she said .
" i hear you 've been here at quicksands , <unk> in that little packing-case of yours .
aren't you coming into our <unk> at <unk> .
" i believe you went to school with my sister , " said young mr. wing .
" oh , yes , " answered honora , somewhat surprised .
" i caught a glimpse of her once , in new york .
i <name> you <name> remember me to her . "
" and i 've seen you before , " proclaimed mr. cuthbert , " but i ca n't for the life of me think where . "
honora did not enlighten him .
" i <name> n't forget , at any rate , mrs. spence , " said <name> grainger , who had not taken his eyes from her , except to blink .
mrs. kame saved her the embarrassment of replying .
" ca n't we go somewhere and play bridge , " trixy demanded .
" i 'd be delighted to offer you the hospitality of my packing-case , as you call it , " said <name> , " but the dining-room ceiling fell down wednesday , and i 'm having the others <unk> up as a mere matter of precaution . "
" i suppose we could n't get a fourth , anyway .
neither <name> nor <unk> plays .
it 's so stupid of them not to learn . "
" mrs. spence might , help us out , " suggested <name> .
" do you play ? "
exclaimed mrs. kame , in a voice of mixed incredulity and <name> .
" play ! "
cried mr. <name> , " she can teach <name> shorter or the duchess of <unk> . "
" the duchess <unk> , " announced <name> grainger .
" i caught her at it at <unk>  " " indeed , i do n't play very well , " honora interrupted him , " and besides  " " suppose we go over to mrs. spence 's house , " trixton <name> suggested .
" i 'm sure she 'd like to have us would n't you , mrs .
spence ? "
" what a brilliant idea , trixy ! "
exclaimed mrs. kame .
" i should be delighted , " said honora , somewhat weakly .
an impulse made her glance toward the veranda , and for a fraction of a second she caught the eye of <name> dallam , who turned again to mrs. chandos .
" i say , " said mr. cuthbert , " i do n't play  but i <name> i may come along . "
" and me too , " chimed in mr. wing .
honora , not free from a certain uneasiness of conscience , led the way to the <unk> , flanked by mr. grainger and mr. cuthbert .
her frame of mind was not an ideal one for a hostess ; she was put out with trixton <name> , and she could not help wondering whether these people would have made themselves so free with another house .
when tea was over , however , and the bridge had begun , her spirits rose ; or rather , a new and strange excitement took possession of her that was not wholly due to the novel and revolutionary experience of playing , for money  and winning .
her <name> being in the <unk> , as we may perceive .
she had drawn mrs. kame for a partner , and the satisfaction and <unk> of that <name> visibly grew as the score mounted : even the skill of trixton <name> could not triumph over the hands which the two ladies held .
in the intervals the talk wandered into regions unfamiliar to honora , and she had a sense that her own horizon was being enlarged .
a new vista , at least , had been cut : possibilities became probabilities .
even when mrs. kame chose to ridicule quicksands honora was silent , so keenly did she feel the justice of her guest 's remarks ; and the implication was that honora did not belong there .
when train time arrived and they were about to climb into trixton <name> 's omnibus  for which he had <unk> telephoned  mrs. kame took honora 's band in both her own .
some good thing , after all , could come out of this community  such was the triumphant discovery the <name> 's manner implied .
" my dear , do n't you ever come to <unk> ? "
she asked .
" i 'd be so glad to see you .
i must get trixy to drive you over some day for lunch .
we've had such a good time , and <name> did n't fall asleep once .
quite a record .
you saved our lives , really . "
" are you going to be in town this <name> ? "
mr. grainger inquired .
" i ,  i suppose so  replied honora , for the moment taken aback , although i have n't decided just where . "
" i shall look forward to seeing you , " he said .
this <name> was expressed even more fervently by mr. cuthbert and mr. wing , and the whole party waved her a cordial good-by as the carriage turned the circle .
trixton <name> , with his hands in his pockets , stood facing her under the electric light on the porch .
" well ? "
he said .
" well , " repeated honora .
" nice people , " said mr. <name> .
honora bridled .
" you invited them here , " she said .
" i must say i think it , was rather  presumptuous .
and you 've got me into no end of trouble with <name> dallam . "
he laughed as he held open the screen door for her .
" i wonder whether a good <name> was ever so abused , " he said .
" a good <name> , " she repeated , smiling at him in spite of herself .
" or <unk> , " he continued , " whichever you choose .
you want to get out of quicksands  i 'm trying to make it easy for you .
before you leave you have to arrange some place to go .
before we are off with the old we 'd better be on with the new . "
" oh , please do n't say such things , " she cried , " they 're so  so sordid . "
she looked searchingly into his face .
" do i really seem to you like that ? "
her lip was quivering , and she was still under the influence of the excitement which the visit of these people had brought about .
" no , " said <name>  coming very close to her , " no , you do n't .
that 's the extraordinary part of it .
the trouble with you , honora , is that you want something badly very badly  and you have n't yet found out what it is .
" and you wo n't find out , " he added , " until you have tried everything .
therefore am i a good <unk> , or something like it . "
she looked at him with startled eyes , breathing deeply .
" i wonder if that is so ! "
she said , in a low voice .
" not until you have had and broken every toy in the shop , " he declared .
" out of the mouths of men of the world occasionally issues wisdom .
i'm going to help you get the toys .
do n't you think i 'm kind ? "
" and is n't this <unk> mood a little new to you ? "
she asked .
" i thought i had exhausted all novelties , " he answered .
" perhaps that's the reason why i enjoy it . "
she turned and walked slowly into the drawing-room , halted , and stood staring at the heap of gold and yellow bills that mr. grainger had deposited in front of the place where she had sat .
her sensation was akin to sickness .
she reached out with a kind of shuddering fascination and touched the gold .
" i think , " she said , speaking rather to herself than to <name> , " i'll give it to <name> . "
" if it is possible to combine a <unk> act with good policy , i should suggest giving it to mrs. grainger for the relief of oppressed working girls , " he said .
honora started .
" i wonder why <name> does n't come she exclaimed , looking at the clock .
" probably because he is holding nothing but full hands and <unk> , " hazarded mr. <name> .
" might i propose myself for dinner ? "
" when so many people are clamouring for you ? "
she asked .
" even so , " he said .
" i think i 'll telephone to the club , " said honora , and left the room .
it was some time before her husband responded to the call ; and then he explained that if honora did n't object , he was going to a man 's dinner in a private room .
the statement was not unusual .
" but , <name> , " she said , " i  i wanted you particularly to-night . "
" i thought you were going to dine with <name> dallam .
she told me you were .
are you alone ? "
" mr. <name> is here .
he brought over some <unk> people to play bridge .
they 've gone . "
" oh , <name> <name> amuse you , " he replied .
" i did n't know you were going to be home , and i 've promised these men .
i 'll come back early . "
she <name> up the receiver thoughtfully , paused a moment , and went back to the drawing-room .
<name> looked up .
" well , " he said , " was i right ? "
" you seem always to be right , " honora , sighed .
after dinner they sat in the screened part of the porch which mrs. <name> had arranged very cleverly as an outside room .
<name> had put a rug over honora 's knees , for the ocean breath that stirred the leaves was cold .
across the darkness fragments of dance music drifted fitfully from the club , and died away ; and at intervals , when the embers of his cigar flared up , she caught sight of her companion 's face .
she found him difficult to understand .
there are certain rules of thumb in every <name> , no doubt ,  even in that most perilous one of <unk> .
but here was a baffling , individual lion .
she liked him best , she told herself , when he purred <unk> , but she could by no means be sure that his subjection was complete .
sometimes he had scratched her in his play .
and however natural it is to <name> a lion for one 's friend , to be eaten is both uncomfortable and <unk> .
" that 's a remarkable husband of yours , " he said at length .
" i should n't have said that you were a particularly good judge of husbands , " she retorted , after a moment of surprise .
he acknowledged with a laugh the justice of this observation .
" i stand corrected .
he is by no means a remarkable husband .
permit me to say he is a remarkable man . "
" what makes you think so ? "
asked honora , considerably disturbed .
" because he induced you to marry him , for one thing , " said <name> .
" of course he got you before you knew what you were worth , but we must give him credit for discovery and foresight . "
" perhaps , " honora could not resist replying , " perhaps he did n't know what he was getting . "
" that 's probably true , " <name> assented , " or he 'd be sitting here now , where i am , instead of playing poker .
although there is something in matrimony that takes the bloom off the peach . "
" i think that 's a horrid , cynical remark , " said honora .
" well , " he said , " we speak according to our experiences  that is , if we 're not inclined to be hypocritical .
most women are . "
honora was silent .
he had thrown away his cigar , and she could no longer see his face .
she wondered whither he was leading .
" how would you like to see your husband president of a trust company ? "
he said suddenly .
" <name>  president of a trust company ! "
she exclaimed .
" why not ? "
he demanded .
and added <unk> , " smaller men have been . "
" i wish you would n't joke about <name> , " she said .
" how does the idea strike you ? "
he persisted .
" ambition satisfied  temporarily ; quicksands a <unk> on a back road ; another toy to break ; husband a big man in the community , so far as the eye can see ; visiting list on fifth avenue , and all that sort of thing . "
" i once told you you could be brutal , " she said .
" you have n't told me what you thought of the idea . "
" i wish you 'd be sensible once in a while , " she exclaimed .
" <name> spence , president of the orange trust company ! "
he recited .
" i suppose no man is a hero to his wife .
does it sound so incredible ? "
it did .
but honora did not say so .
" what have i to do with it ? "
she asked , in pardonable doubt as to his seriousness .
" everything , " answered <name> .
" women of your type usually have .
they make and mar without rhyme or reason  set business by the ears , alter the gold reserve , disturb the balance of trade , and nobody ever suspects it .
old <name> wing and i have got a trust company organized , and the building up , and the man wing wanted for president backed out . "
honora sat up .
" why  why did he <unk> out ' ? "
she demanded .
" he preferred to stay where he was , i suppose , " replied <name> , in another tone .
" the point is that the place is empty .
i 'll give it to you . "
" to me ? "
" certainly , " said <name> , " i do n't pretend to care anything about your husband .
he 'll do as well as the next man .
his duties are pretty well  defined . "
again she was silent .
but after a moment dropped back in her chair and laughed uneasily .
" you 're preposterous , " she said ; " i ca n't think why i let you talk to me in this way . "
chapter viii .
of mental processes  feminine and insoluble honora may be pardoned for finally <unk> to mr. <name> 's somewhat <unk> sense of humour his remarks concerning her husband 's elevation to a conspicuous position in the world of finance .
taken in any other sense than a joke , they were both insulting and degrading , and made her face burn when she thought of them .
after he had gone  or rather after she had dismissed him  she took a book upstairs to wait for <name> , but she could not read .
at times she wished she had rebuked trixton <name> more forcibly , although he was not an easy person to rebuke ; and again she reflected that , had she taken the matter too seriously , she would have laid herself open to his ridicule .
the lion was often unwittingly rough , and perhaps that was part of his fascination .
if <name> had come home before midnight it is possible that she might have tried to sound him as to his relations with trixton <name> .
that gentleman , she remembered , had the reputation of being a peculiarly <unk> business man , and it was of course absurd that he should offer her husband a position merely to please her .
and her imagination failed her when she tried to think of <name> as the president of a trust company .
she was unable to picture him in a great executive office : this train of thought led her to the unaccustomed task of analyzing his character .
for the first time since her marriage comparisons crept into her mind , and she awoke to the fact that he was not a masterful man  even among men .
for all his <unk> , perhaps , would be the better word  he was in reality a follower , not a leader ; a <unk> .
he did not lack ideas .
she tried to arrest the process in her <name> when she got as far as asking herself whether it might not be that he lacked ideals .
since in business matters he never had taken her into his confidence , and since she would not at any rate have understood such things , she had no proof of such a failing .
but one or two vague remarks of trixton <name> 's which she recalled , and <unk> own request that she should be friendly with <name> , <unk> her instinct on this point .
when she heard her husband 's footstep on the porch , she put out her light , but still lay thinking in the darkness .
her revelations had arrived at the uncomfortable stage where they began to frighten her , and with an effort she forced herself to turn to the other side of the account .
the hour was <unk> to exaggerations .
perfection in husbands was evidently a state not to be considered by any woman in her right senses .
he was more or less amenable , and he was prosperous , although definite news of that prosperity never came from him  quicksands always knew of it first .
an instance of this second-hand acquisition of knowledge occurred the very next morning , when <name> dallam , with much dignity , walked into honora 's little sitting-room .
there was no apparent reason why dignity should not have been becoming to <name> dallam , for she was by no means an <unk> woman ; but the assumption by her of that quality always made her a little tragic or ( if one chanced to be in the humour  honora was not ) a little ridiculous .
" i suppose i have no pride , " she said , as she halted within a few feet of the doorway .
" why , <name> ! "
exclaimed honora , pushing back the chair from her desk , and rising .
but mrs. dallam did not move .
" i suppose i have no pride , " she repeated in a dead voice , " but i just could n't help coming over and giving you a chance . "
" giving me a chance ? "
said honora .
" to explain  after the way you treated me at the polo game .
if i hadn't seen it with my own eyes , i should n't have believed it .
i do n't think i should have trusted my own eyes , " mrs. dallam went so far as to affirm , " if <name> chandos and <name> trowbridge and others had n't been there and seen it too ; i should n't have believed it . "
honora was finding penitence a little difficult .
but her heart was kind .
" do sit down , <name> , " she begged .
" if i 've offended you in any way , i'm exceedingly sorry  i am , really .
you ought to know me well enough to understand that i would n't do anything to hurt your feelings . "
" and when i counted on you so , for my tea and dinner at the club ! "
continued mrs. dallam .
" there were other women dying to come .
and you said you had a headache , and were tired . "
" i was , " began honora , <unk> .
" and you were so popular in quicksands  everybody was crazy about you .
you were so sweet and so <unk> .
i might have known that it couldn't last .
and now , because <name> kame and <name> grainger and  " " <name> , please do n't say such things ! "
honora implored , revolted .
" of course you wo n't be satisfied now with anything less than <unk> or newport .
but you ca n't say i did n't warn you , honora , that they are a horrid , selfish , fast lot , " <name> dallam declared , and brushed her eyes with her handkerchief .
" i did love you . "
" if you 'll only be reasonable a moment , <name> ,  " said honora .
" reasonable !
i saw you with my own eyes .
five minutes after you left me they all started for your house , and <name> chandos said it was the quickest cure of a headache she had ever seen . "
" <name> , " honora began again , with exemplary <name> , " when people invite themselves to one 's house , it 's a little difficult to refuse them hospitality , is n't it ? "
" invite themselves ? "
" yes , " replied honora .
" if i were n't  fond of you , too , i shouldn't make this explanation .
i was tired .
i never felt less like entertaining strangers .
they wanted to play bridge , there was n't a quiet spot in the club where they could go .
they knew i was on my way home , and they suggested my house .
that is how it happened . "
mrs. dallam was silent a moment .
" may i have one of <name> 's cigarettes ? "
she asked , and added , after this modest wish had been supplied , " that 's just like them .
they're willing to make use of anybody . "
" i meant , " said honora , " to have gone to your house this morning and to have explained how it happened . "
another brief silence , broken by <name> dallam .
" did you notice the skirt of that suit <name> kame had on ?
" , she asked .
" i 'm sure she paid a fabulous price for it in <name> , and it 's exactly like one i ordered on tuesday . "
the details of the rest of this conversation may be omitted .
that honora was forgiven , and mrs. dallam 's spirits restored may be inferred from her final remark .
" my dear , what do you think of <name> and <name> making twenty thousand dollars apiece in <unk> copper ?
is n't it too lovely !
i 'm having a little architect make me plans for a conservatory .
you know i 've always been dying for one  i do n't see how i 've lived all these years without it . "
honora , after her friend had gone , sat down in one of the wicker chairs on the porch .
she had a very vague idea as to how much twenty thousand dollars was , but she reflected that while they had lived in rivington <name> must have made many similar sums , of which she was unaware .
gradually she began to realize , however , that her resentment of the lack of confidence of her husband was by no means the only cause of the feeling that took possession of and overwhelmed her .
something like it she had experienced before : to-day her thoughts seemed to run through her in <unk> , like waves of heat , and she wondered that she could have controlled herself while listening to <name> dallam .
mrs. dallam 's reproaches presented themselves to honora in new aspects .
she began to feel now , with an intensity that frightened her , distaste and rebellion .
it was intolerable that she should be called to account for the people she chose to have in her house , that any sort of pressure should be brought to bear on her to confine her friends to quicksands .
treason , heresy , <unk> to the cult of that community  in reality these , and not a breach of engagement , were the things of which she had been accused .
she saw now .
she would not be tied to quicksands  she would not , she would not , she would not !
she owed it no allegiance .
her very soul rebelled at the thought , and cried out that she was made for something better , something higher than the life she had been leading .
she would permit no one forcibly to restrict her horizon .
just where and how this higher and better life was to be found honora did not know ; but the belief of her childhood  that it existed somewhere  was still intact .
her powers of analysis , we see , are only just budding , and she did not and could not define the ideal existence which she so <unk> sought .
of two of its attributes only she was sure  that it was to be free from restraint and from odious comparisons .
honora 's development , it may be remarked , proceeds by the action of <unk> , and of late her protest against quicksands and what it represented had driven her to other books besides the treatise on bridge .
the library she had collected at rivington she had brought with her , and was adding to it from time to time .
its volumes are neither sufficiently extensive or profound to enumerate .
those who are more or less skilled in psychology may attempt to establish a sequence between the events and reflections just related and the fact that , one morning a fortnight later , honora found herself driving northward on fifth avenue in a hansom cab .
she was in a pleasurable state of adventurous excitement , comparable to that <name> must have felt when the shores of the old world had disappeared below the horizon .
during the fortnight we have skipped honora had been to town several times , and had driven and walked through certain streets : inspiration , courage , and decision had all arrived at once this morning , when at the ferry she had given the cabman this particular address on fifth avenue .
the cab , with the jerking and thumping peculiar to <unk> , made a circle and <name> up at the curb .
but even then a moment of <unk> intervened , and she sat staring through the little side window at the sign , t. <name> shorter , real estate , in neat gold letters over the basement floor of the building .
" here <unk> , miss , " said the cabman through the hole in the roof .
honora descended , and was almost at the flight of steps leading down to the office door when a familiar figure appeared coming out of it .
it was that of mr. <unk> cuthbert , arrayed in a faultless morning suit , his tie delicately suggestive of falling leaves ; and there dangled over his arm the <unk> of walking sticks .
" mrs .
spence ! "
he lisped , with every appearance of <name> .
" mr .
cuthbert ! "
she cried .
" going in to see <name> ? "
he inquired after he had put on his hat , nodding up at the sign .
" i  that is , yes , i had thought of it , " she answered .
" town house ? "
said mr. cuthbert , with a knowing smile .
" i did have an idea of looking at houses , " she confessed , somewhat taken aback .
" i 'm your man , " announced mr. cuthbert .
" you ! "
exclaimed honora , with an air of considering the lilies of the field .
but he did not seem to take offence .
" that 's my business , " he proclaimed ,  " when in town .
<name> gives me a commission .
come in and see him , while i get a list and some keys .
by the way , you would n't object to telling him you were a friend of mine , would you ? "
" not at all , " said honora , laughing .
mr .
shorter was a jovial gentleman in <unk> clothes , and he was exceedingly glad to meet mr. cuthbert 's friend .
" what kind of a house do you want , mrs .
spence ? "
he asked .
" cuthbert tells me this morning that the <unk> house has come into the market .
you could n't have a better location than that , on the avenue between the cathedral and the park . "
" oh , " said honora with a gasp , " that 's much too expensive , i 'm sure .
and there are only two of us . "
she hesitated , a little alarmed at the rapidity with which affairs were proceeding , and added : " i ought to tell you that i 've not really decided to take a house .
i wished to  to see what there was to be had , and then i should have to consult my husband . "
she gazed very seriously into mr .
shorter 's brown eyes , which became very wide and serious , too .
but all the time it seemed to her that other parts of him were laughing .
" husbands , " he declared , " are <unk> .
what have they got to do with a house  except to sleep in it ?
now i have n't the pleasure of knowing you as well as i <name> to one of these days , mrs. spence  " " oh , i say ! "
interrupted mr. cuthbert .
" but i venture to predict , on a slight acquaintance , " continued mr .
shorter , undisturbed , " that you <name> pick out the house you want , and that your husband <name> move into it . "
honora could not help laughing .
and mr .
shorter leaned back in his revolving chair and laughed , too , in so alarming a manner as to lead her to fear he would fall over backwards .
but mr. cuthbert , who did not appear to perceive the humour in this conversation , extracted some keys and several pasteboard slips from a rack in the corner .
suddenly mr .
shorter jerked himself upright again , and became very solemn .
" where 's my hat ? "
he demanded .
" what do you want with your hat ? "
mr. cuthbert inquired .
" why , i 'm going with you , of course , " mr .
shorter replied .
" i 've decided to take a personal interest in this matter .
you may regard my presence , cuthbert , as justified by an artistic passion for my profession .
i should never forgive myself if mrs. spence did n't get just the right house . "
" oh , " said mr. cuthbert , " i 'll manage that all right .
i thought you were going to see the representative of a syndicate at eleven . "
mr .
shorter , with a sigh , acknowledged this necessity , and escorted honora gallantly through the office and across the sidewalk to the waiting hansom .
cuthbert got in beside her .
" <name> 's a joker , " he observed as they drove off , " you must n't mind him . "
" i think he 's delightful , " said honora .
" one would n't believe that a man of his size and appearance could be so fond of women , " said mr. cuthbert .
" he 's the greatest old <unk> that ever breathed .
for two cents he would have come with us this morning , and let a five thousand dollar commission go .
do you know mrs .
shorter ? "
" no , " replied honora .
" she looks most attractive .
i caught a glimpse of her at the polo that day with you . "
" i 've been at her house in newport ever since .
came down yesterday to try to earn some money , " he continued , cheerfully making himself agreeable .
" deuced clever woman , much too clever for me and <name> too .
always in a <unk> with an <unk> or a <unk> , or a <unk> , and tells novelists what to put into their next books and <unk> how to decide cases .
full of modern and liberal ideas  believes in free love and all that sort of thing , and gives <name> the dickens for practising it . "
" oh ! "
exclaimed honora .
mr. cuthbert , however , did not appear to realize that he had shocked her .
" by the way , " he asked , " have you seen <name> grainger since the quicksands game ? "
" no , " she replied .
" has mr. grainger been at quicksands since ? "
" nobody knows where he 's been , " answered mr. cuthbert .
" it 's a mystery .
he has n't been home  at newport , i <unk> a fortnight .
he 's never stayed away so long without letting any one know where he is .
naturally they thought he was at mrs. kame 's in <unk> , but she has n't laid eyes on him .
it 's a mystery .
my own theory is that he went to sleep in a parlour car and was sent to the yards , and has n't waked up . "
" and is n't mrs. grainger worried ? "
asked honora .
" oh , you never can tell anything about her , " he said .
" do you know her ?
she 's a sphinx .
all the <unk> are <unk> .
and besides , she 's been so busy with this charities conference that she has n't had time to think of <name> .
who 's that ? "
" that " was a <name> from rivington , one of honora 's former neighbours , to whom she had bowed .
life , indeed , is full of contrasts .
mr. cuthbert , too , was continually bowing and waving to acquaintances on the avenue .
thus pleasantly conversing , they arrived at the first house on the list , and afterwards went through a succession of them .
once inside , honora would look helplessly about her in the darkness while her escort would raise the shades , admitting a gloomy light on bare <unk> or shrouded furniture .
and the rents : four , five , six , and seven and eight thousand dollars a year .
pride prevented her from discussing these prices with mr. cuthbert ; and in truth , when lunch time came , she had seen nothing which realized her somewhat vague but persistent ideals .
" i 'm so much obliged to you , " she said , " and i <name> you 'll forgive me for wasting your time . "
mr. cuthbert smiled broadly , and honora smiled too .
indeed , there was something ludicrous in the remark .
he assumed an attitude of reflection .
" i imagine you would n't care to go over beyond lexington avenue , would you ?
i did n't think to ask you . "
" no , " she replied , blushing a little , " i should n't care to go over as far as that . "
he pondered a while longer , when suddenly his face lighted up .
" i 've got it ! "
he cried , " the very thing  why did n't .
i think of it ?
dicky farnham 's house , or rather his wife 's house .
i 'll get it straight after a while ,  she is n't his wife any more , you know ; she married <unk> rindge last month .
that 's the reason it 's for rent .
dicky says he 'll never get married again  you bet !
they planned it together , laid the <unk> and all that sort of thing , and before it was finished she had a divorce and had gone abroad with rindge .
i saw her before she sailed , and she begged me to rent it .
but it is n't furnished . "
" i might look at it , " said honora , dubiously .
" i 'm sure it <name> just suit you , " he declared with enthusiasm .
" it 's a real find .
we 'll drive around by the office and get the keys . "
the house was between fifth avenue and <name> , on a cross street not far below <unk> , and honora had scarcely entered the little <unk> hall before she had forgotten that mr. cuthbert was a real estate agent  a most difficult thing to remember .
upstairs , the drawing-room was flooded with sunlight that poured in through a window with stone <unk> and <unk> panes extending the entire width of the house .
against the wall stood a huge stone mantel of the tudor period , and the ceiling was of wood .
behind the little hall a <unk> library lighted by a well , and behind that an ample dining-room .
and honora remembered to have seen , in a shop on fourth avenue , just the sideboard for such a setting .
on the third floor , as mr. cuthbert pointed out , there was a bedroom and boudoir for mrs. spence , and a bedroom and dressing-room for mr. spence .
into the domestic arrangement of the house , however important , we need not penetrate .
the rent was eight thousand dollars , which mr. cuthbert thought extremely reasonable .
" eight thousand dollars ! "
as she stood with her back turned , looking out on the street , some trick of memory brought into her mind the fact that she had once heard her uncle declare that he had bought his house and lot for that exact sum .
and as cashier of mr. <unk> 's bank , he did not earn so much in a year .
she had found the house , indeed , but the other and mightier half of the task remained , of getting <name> into it .
in the consideration of this most difficult of problems honora , who in her exaltation had beheld herself installed in every room , grew suddenly serious .
she was startled out of her reflections by a remark of almost uncanny penetration on the part of mr. cuthbert .
" oh , he 'll come round all right , when he sees the house , " that young gentleman declared .
honora turned quickly , and , after a moment of astonishment , laughed in spite of herself .
it was impossible not to laugh with mr. cuthbert , so irresistible and <unk> was he , so confiding and sympathetic , that he became ; before one knew it , an accomplice .
had he not poured out to honora , with a charming gayety and frankness , many of his financial troubles ?
" i 'm afraid he 'll think it frightfully expensive , " she answered , becoming thoughtful once more .
and it did not occur to her that neither of them had mentioned the individual to whom they referred .
" wait until he 's feeling <unk> , " mr. cuthbert advised , " and then bring him up here in a hurry .
i say , i <name> you do take the house , " he added , with a boyish seriousness after she had refused his appeal to lunch with him , " and that you <name> let me come and see you once in a while . "
she lunched alone , in a quiet corner of the dining-room of one of the large hotels , gazing at intervals absently out of the window .
and by the middle of the afternoon she found herself , quite unexpectedly , in the antique furniture shop , gazing at the sideboard and a set of <unk> <unk> chairs , and bribing the dealer with a smile to hold them for a few days until she could decide whether she wished them .
in a similar mood of abstraction she boarded the ferry , but it was not until the boat had started on its journey that she became aware of a trim , familiar figure in front of her , <unk> against the <unk> blue waters of the river  trixton <name> 's .
and presently , as though the concentration of her thoughts upon his back had summoned him , he turned .
" where have you been all this time ? "
she asked .
" i have n't seen you for an age . "
" to seattle . "
" to seattle ! "
she exclaimed .
" what were you doing there ? "
" trying to forget you , " he replied promptly , " and incidentally attempting to obtain control of some properties .
both efforts , i may add , were unsuccessful . "
" i 'm sorry , " said honora .
" and what mischief , " he demanded , " have you been up to ? "
" you 'll never guess ! "
she exclaimed .
" preparing for the exodus , " he hazarded .
" you surely do n't expect me to stay in quicksands all <name> ? "
she replied , a little <unk> .
" quicksands , " he declared , " has passed into history . "
" you always insist upon putting a wrong interpretation upon what i do , " she complained .
he laughed .
" what interpretation do you put on it ? "
he asked .
" a most natural and praiseworthy one , " she answered .
" education , improvement , growth  these things are as necessary for a woman as for a man .
of course i do n't expect you to believe that  your idea of women not being a very exalted one . "
he did not reply , for at that instant the <name> rang , the passengers pressed forward about them , and they were soon in the midst of the confusion of a landing .
it was not until they were seated in adjoining chairs of the <unk> that the conversation was renewed .
" when do you move to town ? "
he inquired .
however simple mr. <name> 's methods of reasoning may appear to others , his apparent <unk> never failed to startle honora .
" somebody has told you that i 've been looking at houses ! "
she exclaimed .
" have you found one ? "
she hesitated .
" yes  i have found one .
it belongs to some people named farnham  they're divorced . "
" dicky farnham 's <unk> , " he supplied .
" i know where it is  unexceptionable neighbourhood and all that sort of thing . "
" and it 's just finished , " continued honora , her enthusiasm gaining on her as she spoke of the object which had possessed her mind for four hours .
" it 's the most enchanting house , and so <name> for new york .
if i had built it myself it could not have suited me better .
only  " " only  " repeated trixton <name> , smiling .
" well , " she said slowly , " i really ought n't to talk about it .
i  i have n't said anything to <name> yet , and he may not like it .
i ran across it by the merest accident . "
" what <name> you give me , " he said , " if i can induce <name> to like it ? "
" my eternal friendship , " she laughed .
" that 's not enough , " said trixton <name> .
chapter ix .
introducing a <unk> vehicle " <name> , " said honora that evening , " i 've been going through houses to-day . "
" houses ! "
he exclaimed , looking up from his newspaper .
" and i 've been most fortunate , " she continued .
" i found one that mrs. farnham built  she is now mrs. rindge .
it is just finished , and so attractive .
if i 'd looked until <unk> i could n't have done any better . "
" but great <name> ! "
he ejaculated , " what put the notion of a town house into your head ? "
" is n't it high time to be thinking of the <name> ? "
she asked .
" it's nearly the end of <name> . "
he was inarticulate for a few moments , in an evident desperate attempt to rally his forces to meet such an unforeseen attack .
" who said anything about going to town ? "
he inquired .
" now , <name> , do n't be foolish , " she replied .
" surely you did n't expect to stay in quicksands all <name> ? "
" foolish ! "
he repeated , and added <unk> , " why not ? "
" because , " said honora , calmly , " i have a life to lead as well as you . "
" but you were n't satisfied until you got to quicksands , and now you want to leave it . "
" i did n't bargain to stay here in the <name> , " she declared .
" you know very well that if you were unfortunate it would be different .
but you're quite prosperous . "
" how do you know ? "
he demanded <unk> .
" quicksands tells me , " she said .
" it is  a little humiliating not to have more of your confidence , and to hear such things from outsiders . "
" you never seemed interested in business matters , " he answered uneasily .
" i should be , " said honora , " if you would only take the trouble to tell me about them . "
she stood up .
" <name> , ca n't you see that it is making us  grow apart ?
if you wo n't tell me about yourself and what you're doing , you drive me to other interests .
i am your wife , and i ought to know  i want to know .
the reason i do n't understand is because you've never taken the trouble to teach me .
i wish to lead my own life , it is true  to develop .
i do n't want to be like these other women down here .
i  i was made for something better .
i 'm sure of it .
but i wish my life to be joined to yours , too  and it does n't seem to be .
and sometimes  i 'm afraid i ca n't explain it to you  sometimes i feel lonely and frightened , as though i might do something desperate .
and i don't know what 's going to become of me . "
he laid down his newspaper and stared at her helplessly , with the air of a man who suddenly finds himself at sea in a small boat without oars .
" oh , you ca n't understand ! "
she cried .
" i might have known you never could . "
he was , indeed , thoroughly perplexed and uncomfortable : unhappy might not be too strong a word .
he got up awkwardly and put his hand on her arm .
she did not respond .
he <name> her , limp and unresisting , down on the lounge beside him .
" for heaven 's sake , what is the matter , honora ? "
he faltered .
" i  i thought we were happy .
you were getting on all right , and seemed to be having a good time down here .
you never said anything about  this . "
she turned her head and looked at him  a long , searching look with widened eyes .
" no , " she said slowly , " you do n't understand .
i suppose it is n't your fault . "
" i 'll try , " he said , " i do n't like to see you  upset like this .
i 'll do anything i can to make you happy . "
" not things , not  not toys , " trixton <name> 's expression involuntarily coming to her lips .
" oh , ca n't you see i 'm not that kind of a woman ?
i do n't want to be bought .
i want you , whatever you are , if you are .
i want to be saved .
take care of me  see a little more of me  be a little interested in what i think .
god gave me a mind , and  other men have discovered it .
you do n't know , you ca n't know , what temptations you subject me to .
it is n't right , <name> .
and oh , it is humiliating not to be able to interest one 's husband . "
" but you do interest me , " he protested .
she shook her head .
" not so much as your business , " she said ; " not nearly so much . "
" perhaps i have been too absorbed , " he confessed .
" one thing has followed another .
i did n't suspect that you felt this way .
come , i'll try to brace up . "
he pressed her to him .
" do n't feel badly .
you're <unk> .
you 've exaggerated the situation , honora .
we 'll go in on the eight o'clock train together and look at the house  although i'm afraid it 's a little steep , " he added cautiously .
" i do n't care anything about the house , " said honora .
" i do n't want it . "
" there ! "
he said soothingly , " you 'll feel differently in the morning .
we 'll go and look at it , anyway . "
her quick ear , however , detected an undertone which , if not precisely resentment , was akin to the vexation that an elderly gentleman might be justified in feeling who has taken the same walk for twenty years , and is one day struck by a falling brick .
<name> had not thought of consulting her in regard to remaining all <name> in quicksands .
and , although he might not realize it himself , if he should consent to go to new york one reason for his acquiescence would be that the country in <name> offered a more or less favourable atmosphere for the recurrence of similar unpleasant and unaccountable domestic convulsions .
business demands peace at any price .
and the ultimatum at rivington , though delivered in so different a manner , recurred to him .
the morning sunlight , as is well known , is a <unk> of moods , a <unk> of the night 's <unk> .
it awoke honora at what for her was a comparatively early hour , and as she dressed rapidly she heard her husband whistling in his room .
it is idle to speculate on the phenomenon taking place within her , and it may merely be remarked in passing that she possessed a quality which , in a man , leads to a career and fame .
<unk> <name> of <name> 's women possess that quality  a fact that is becoming more and more apparent every day .
" why , honora ! "
<name> exclaimed , as she appeared at the breakfast table .
" what 's happened to you ? "
" have you forgotten already , " she asked , smilingly , as she poured out her coffee , " that we are going to town together ? "
he <unk> his newspaper against the <unk> .
" how much do you think mrs. farnham  or mrs. rindge  is worth ? "
he asked .
" i 'm sure i do n't know , " she replied .
" old <name> left her five million dollars . "
" what has that to do with it ? "
inquired honora .
" she is n't going to rent , especially in that part of town , for nothing . "
" would n't it be wiser , <name> , to wait and see the house .
you know you proposed it yourself , and it wo n't take very much of your time . "
he returned to a perusal of the financial column , but his eye from time to time wandered from the sheet to his wife , who was reading her letters .
" <name> , " she said , " i feel dreadfully about mrs. holt .
we have n't been at silverdale all summer .
here 's a note from her saying she 'll be in town to-morrow for the charities conference , asking me to come to see her at her hotel .
i think i 'll go to silverdale a little later . "
" why do n't you ? "
he said .
" it would do you good . "
" and you ? "
she asked .
" my only day of the week is <name> , honora .
you know that .
and i would n't spend another day at silverdale if they gave me a deed to the property , " he declared .
on the train , when <name> had returned from the smoking car and they were about to <unk> at long island city , they encountered mr. trixton <name> .
" whither away ? "
he cried in apparent astonishment .
" up at <name> , and the eight o'clock train ! "
" we were going to look at a house , " explained honora , " and <name> has no other time . "
" i 'll go , too , " declared mr. <name> , promptly .
" you might n't think me a judge of houses , but i am .
i 've lived in so many bad ones that i know a good one when i see it now . "
" honora has got a wild notion into her head that i 'm going to take the farnham house , " said <name> , smiling .
there , on the deck of the ferryboat , in the flooding sunlight , the idea seemed to give him amusement .
with the morning light pharaoh must have hardened his heart .
" well , perhaps you are , " said mr. <name> , conveying to honora his delight in the situation by a scarcely perceptible wink .
" i should n't like to take the other end of the bet .
why should n't you ?
you 're fat and healthy and making money faster than you can gather it in . "
<name> coughed , and laughed a little , uncomfortably .
trixton <name> was not a man to offend .
" honora has got that delusion , too , " he replied .
he <unk> himself in his usual manner for the ordeal to come by smoking a cigarette , for the arrival of such a powerful ally on his wife 's side lent a different aspect to the situation .
honora , during this colloquy , was silent .
she was a little uncomfortable , and pretended not to see mr. <name> 's wink .
" incredible as it may seem , i expected to have my automobile ready this morning , " he observed ; " we might have gone in that .
it landed three days ago , but so far it has failed to do anything but fire off revolver shots . "
" oh , i do wish you had it , " said honora , relieved by the change of subject .
" to drive in one must be such a wonderful sensation . "
" i 'll let you know when it stops shooting up the garage and <unk> to move out , " he said .
" i 'll take you down to quicksands in it . "
the prospective arrival of mr. <name> 's french motor car , which was looked for daily , had indeed been one of the chief topics of conversation at quicksands that summer .
he could appear at no lunch or dinner party without being subjected to a shower of questions as to where it was , and as many as half a dozen different women among whom was mrs. chandos  declared that he had promised to bring them out from new york on the occasion of its triumphal entry into the colony .
honora , needless to say , had betrayed no curiosity .
neither mr .
shorter nor mr. cuthbert had appeared at the real estate office when , at a little after nine o'clock ; honora asked for the keys .
and an office boy , perched on the box seat of the carriage , drove with them to the house and opened the <unk> gate that guarded the entrance , and the massive front door .
honora had a sense of unreality as they entered , and told herself it was obviously ridiculous that she should aspire to such a dwelling .
yesterday , under the spell of that somewhat adventurous excursion with mr. cuthbert , she had pictured herself as installed .
he had contrived somehow to give her a sense of intimacy with the people who lived <unk>  his own friends .
perhaps it was her husband who was the <unk> note as he stood on the polished floor of the <unk> drawing-room .
although bare of furniture , it was eloquent to honora of a kind of taste not to be found at quicksands : it carried her back , by <unk> channels of thought , to the impression which , in her childhood , the hanbury mansion had always made .
<name> , in her present whimsical fancy , even seemed a little grotesque in such a setting .
his inevitable pink shirt and obviously prosperous clothes made discord there , and she knew in this moment that he was <unk> the house from a commercial standpoint .
his comment confirmed her guess .
" if i were starting out to blow myself , or you , honora , " he said , poking with his stick a <unk> of the carved stone mantel , " i 'd get a little more for my money while i was about it . "
honora did not reply .
she looked out of the window instead .
" see here , old man , " said trixton <name> , " i 'm not a real estate dealer or an architect , but if i were in your place i 'd take that carriage and hustle over to <name> shorter 's as fast as i could and sign the lease . "
<name> looked at him in some surprise , as one who had learned that trixton <name> 's opinions were usually worth listening to .
characteristically , he did not like to display his ignorance .
" i know what you mean , <name> , " he replied , " and there may be something to the argument .
it gives an idea of <unk> and prosperity . "
" you 've made a bull's-eye , " said trixton <name> , <unk> .
" but  but i 'm not ready to begin on this scale , " objected <name> .
" why , " cried <name> , with evident zest  for he was a man who enjoyed sport in all its forms , even to <unk> the husbands of his friends ,  " when i first set eyes on you , old fellow , i thought you knew a thing or two , and you 've made a few turns since that confirmed the opinion .
but i 'm beginning to perceive that you have limitations .
i could sit down here now , if there were any place to sit , and calculate how much living in this house would be worth to me in wall street . "
honora , who had been listening uneasily , knew that a <unk> or more disturbing argument could not have been used on her husband ; and it came from trixton <name>  to <name> at least  ex <unk> .
she was filled with a sense of shame , which was due not solely to the fact that she was a little <unk> because of her innocent <unk> , nor that her husband did not resent an obvious attempt of a high-handed man to <unk> him ; but also to the feeling that the character of the discussion had in some strange way degraded the house itself .
why was it that everything she touched seemed to become <unk> ?
" there 's no use staying any longer , " she said .
" <name> does n't like it . "
" i did n't say so , " he interrupted .
" there 's something about the place that grows on you .
if i felt i could afford it  " " at any rate , " declared honora , trying to control her voice , " i've decided , now i 've seen it a second time , that i do n't want it .
i only wished him to look at it , " she added , scornfully aware that she was taking up the <unk> in his behalf .
but she could not bring herself , in <name> 's presence , to declare that the argument of the rent seemed decisive .
her exasperation was somewhat increased by the expression on trixton <name> 's face , which plainly declared that he deemed her last remarks to be the <unk> of tactics ; and he obstinately refused , as they went down the stairs to the street , to regard the matter as closed .
" i 'll take him down town in the elevated , " he said , as he put her into the carriage .
" the first round 's a draw . "
she directed the driver to the ferry again , and went back to quicksands .
several times during the day she was on the point of <unk> <name> not to try to persuade <name> to rent the house , and once she even got so far as to take down the receiver .
but when she reflected , it seemed an impossible thing to do .
at four o'clock she herself was called to the telephone by mr. <unk> , a confidential clerk in <name> 's office , who informed her that her husband had been obliged to leave town suddenly on business , and would not be home that night .
" did n't he say where he was going ? "
asked honora .
" he did n't even tell me , mrs. spence , " <unk> replied , " and mr. dallam does n't know . "
" oh , dear , " said honora , " i <name> he realizes that people are coming for dinner to-morrow evening . "
" i 'm positive , from what he said , that he 'll be back some time to-morrow , " <unk> reassured her .
she refused an invitation to dine out , and retired shortly after her own dinner with a novel so <unk> that she gradually regained an equable frame of mind .
the uneasiness , the vague fear of the future , wore away , and she slept peacefully .
in the morning , however ; she found on her breakfast tray a note from trixton <name> .
her first feeling after reading it was one of relief that he had not mentioned the house .
he had written from a new york club , asking her to lunch with him at <unk> 's that day and drive home in the motor .
no answer was required : if she did not appear at one o'clock , he would know she could n't come .
honora took the eleven o'clock train , which gave her an hour after she arrived in new york to do as she pleased .
her first idea , as she stood for a moment amidst the clamour of the traffic in front of the ferry house , was to call on mrs. holt at that <name> 's hotel ; and then she remembered that the charities conference began at eleven , and decided to pay a visit to madame <unk> , who made a specialty of importing novelties in dress .
her costume for the prospective excursion in the automobile had cost honora some thought that morning .
as the day was cool , she had brought along an ulster that was <unk> .
but how about the hat and veil ?
madame <unk> was enchanted .
she had them both ,  she had landed with them only last week .
she tried them on honora , and stood back with her hands clasped in an ecstasy she did not attempt to hide .
what a satisfaction to sell things to mrs. spence !
some ladies she could mention would look like <unk> in them , but madame spence had 'de la race ' .
she could wear anything that was <unk> .
the hat and veil , said madame , with a <unk> , were sixty dollars .
" sixty dollars ! "
exclaimed honora .
" ah , madame , what would you ? "
novelties were novelties , the united states custom authorities robbers .
having attended to these important details , honora drove to the restaurant in her hansom cab , the blood coursing pleasantly in her veins .
the autumn air sparkled , and new york was showing signs of animation .
she glanced furtively into the little mirror at the side .
her veil was grey , and with the hat gave her somewhat the air of a <unk> , an aspect heightened by the perfect oval of her face ; and something akin to a religious thrill ran through her .
the automobile , with its brass and varnish shining in the sunlight , was waiting a little way up the street , and the first person honora met in the vestibule of <unk> 's was <name> chandos .
she was , as usual , elaborately dressed , and gave one the impression of being lost , so anxiously was she scanning the face of every new arrival .
" oh , my dear , " she cried , staring hard at the hat and the veil , " have you seen <name> trowbridge anywhere ? "
a certain pity possessed honora as she shook her head .
" she was in town this morning , " continued mrs. chandos , " and i was sure she was coming here to lunch .
trixy just drove up a moment ago in his new car .
did you see it ? "
honora 's pity turned into a definite contempt .
" i saw an automobile as i came in , " she said , but the brevity of her reply seemed to have no effect upon mrs. chandos .
" there he is now , at the entrance to the cafe , " she exclaimed .
there , indeed , was trixton <name> , staring at them from the end of the hall , and making no attempt to approach them .
" i think i 'll go into the dressing-room and leave my coat , " said honora , outwardly calm but inwardly desperate .
fortunately , <name> made no attempt to follow her .
" you 're a dream in that veil , my dear , " mrs. chandos called after her .
" do n't forget that we 're all dining with you to-night in quicksands . "
once in the dressing-room , honora felt like locking the doors and jumping out of the window .
she gave her coat to the maid , rearranged her hair without any apparent reason , and was leisurely putting on her hat again , and wondering what she would do next , when mrs. kame appeared .
" trixy asked me to get you , " she explained .
" mr. grainger and i are going to lunch with you . "
" how nice ! "
said honora , with such a distinct emphasis of relief that mrs. kame looked at her queerly .
" what a fool trixy was , with all his experience , to get mixed up with that chandos woman , " that <name> remarked as they passed through the hallway .
" she 's like molasses  one can never get her off .
lucky thing he found <name> and me here .
there 's your persistent friend , trixy , " she added , when they were seated .
" really , this is pathetic , when an invitation to lunch and a drive in your car would have made her so happy . "
honora looked around and beheld , indeed , mrs. chandos and two other quicksands women , mrs. <name> and mrs. barclay , at a table in the corner of the room .
" where 's <name> to-day , <name>  or do you know ? "
demanded mrs. kame , after an amused glance at <name> , who had not <unk> to answer her .
" i promised to go to newport with her at the end of the week , but i haven't been able to find her . "
" <name> does n't know , " said trixton <name> .
" the police have been looking for him for a fortnight .
where the deuce have you been , <name> ? "
" to the adirondacks , " replied mr grainger , gravely .
this explanation , which seemed entirely plausible to honora , appeared to afford great amusement to <name> , and even to mrs. kame .
" when did you come to life ? "
demanded <name> .
" yesterday , " said mr. grainger , quite as solemnly as before .
mrs. kame glanced curiously at honora , and laughed again .
" you ought to be ashamed of yourself , trixy , " she said .
" why ? "
he asked innocently .
" there 's nothing wrong in going to the adirondacks  is there , <name> ? "
" no , " said mr. grainger , blinking rapidly .
" the adirondacks , " declared mrs. kame , " have now become classic . "
" by the way , " observed mr. grainger , " i believe <name> 's in town to-day at a <name> pow-wow , reading a paper .
i 've half a mind to go over and listen to it .
the white dove of peace  and all that kind of thing . "
" you 'd go to sleep and spoil it all , " said <name> .
" but you ca n't , <name> ! "
cried mrs. kame .
" do n't you remember we 're going to <unk> to the <unk> ' to spend the night and play bridge ?
and we promised to arrive early . "
" that 's so , by <name> , " said mr. grainger , and he drank the rest of his <unk> .
" i 'll tell you what i 'll do , if mrs. spence is willing , " suggested <name> .
" if you start right after lunch , i 'll take you out .
we 'll have plenty of time , " he added to honora , " to get back to quicksands for dinner . "
" are you sure ? "
she asked anxiously .
" i have people for dinner tonight . "
" oh , lots of time , " declared mrs. kame .
" trixy 's car is some unheard-of <unk> .
it 's only twenty-five miles to the <unk> ' , and you 'll be back at the ferry by half-past four . "
" easily , " said trixton <name> .
chapter x .
on the <name> of lion taming after lunch , while mrs. kame was <unk> to her maid and mr. grainger to mrs. <unk> , honora found herself alone with trixton <name> in the automobile at a moment when the quicksands party were taking a cab .
mrs. chandos <unk> long enough to wave her hand .
" bon voyage ! "
she cried .
" what an ideal party !
and the chauffeur doesn't understand english .
if you do n't turn up this evening , honora , i'll entertain your guests . "
" we must get back , " said honora , involuntarily to <name> .
" it would be too dreadful if we did n't ! "
" are you afraid i 'll run off with you ? "
he asked .
" i believe you 're perfectly capable of it , " she replied .
" if i were wise , i 'd take the train . "
" why do n't you ? "
he demanded .
she smiled .
" i do n't know .
it 's because of your <unk> influence , i suppose .
and yet i trust you , in spite of my instincts and  my eyes .
i'm seriously put out with you . "
" why ? "
" i 'll tell you later , if you 're at a loss , " she said , as mrs. kame and mr. grainger appeared .
eight years have elapsed since that day and this writing  an <unk> in this rapidly moving republic of ours .
the roads , although far from perfect yet , were not then what they have since become .
but the weather was dry and the voyage to <unk> accomplished successfully .
it was half-past three when they drove up the avenue and deposited mrs. kame and <name> grainger at the long front of the <unk> house : and <name> , who had been driving , relinquished the wheel to the chauffeur and joined honora in the tonneau .
the day was perfect , the woods still heavy with summer foliage , and the only signs of autumn were the hay mounds and the <unk> <unk> stacked amidst the stubble of the fields .
<name> sat silently watching her , for she had raised her veil in saying good-by to mrs. kame , and  as the chauffeur was proceeding slowly  had not lowered it .
suddenly she turned and looked him full in the face .
" what kind of woman do you think i am ? "
she demanded .
" that 's rather a big order , is n't it ? "
he said .
" i 'm perfectly serious , " continued honora , slowly .
" i 'd really like to know . "
" before i begin on the somewhat lengthy list of your qualities , " he replied , smiling , " may i ask why you 'd like to know ? "
" yes , " she said quickly .
" i 'd like to know because i think you've misjudged me .
i was really more angry than you have any idea of at the manner in which you talked to <name> .
and did you seriously suppose that i was in <name> when we spoke about your assistance in persuading him to take the house ? "
he laughed .
" you are either the <unk> woman in the world , " he declared , " or else you ought n't to be out without a guardian .
and no judge in possession of his five senses would appoint your husband . "
indignant as she was , she could not resist smiling .
there was something in the way <name> made such remarks that fascinated her .
" i should n't call you precisely eligible , either , " she retorted .
he laughed again .
but his eyes made her vaguely uneasy .
" are these harsh words the reward for my <name> ?
he asked .
" i 'm by no means sure it 's <name> , " she said .
" that 's what is troubling me .
and you have no right to say such things about my husband . "
" how was i to know you were sensitive on the subject ?
he replied .
" i wonder what it would be like to be so utterly cynical as you , " she said .
" do you mean to say you do n't want the house ? "
" i do n't want it under those conditions , " she answered with spirit .
" i did n't expect to be taken literally .
and you 've always insisted , " she added , " in <unk> to me motives that  that never occurred to me .
you make the mistake of thinking that because you have no ideals , other people have n't .
i <name> <name> has n't said he 'd take the house .
he 's gone off somewhere , and i have n't been able to see him . "
trixton <name> looked at her queerly .
" after that last manoeuvre of yours , " he said , " it was all i could do to prevent him from rushing over to <name> shorter 's  and signing the lease . "
she did not reply .
" what do these sudden , virtuous resolutions mean ? "
he asked .
" resignation ?
quicksands for life ?
abandonment of the whole campaign ? "
" there is n't any i campaign , " she said  and her voice caught in something like a sob .
" i 'm not that sordid kind of a person .
and if i do n't like quicksands , it 's because the whole atmosphere seems to be charged with  with just such a spirit . "
her hand was lying on the seat .
he covered it with his own so quickly that she left it there for a moment , as though paralyzed , while she listened to the first serious words he had ever addressed to her .
" honora , i admire you more than any woman i have ever known , " he said .
her breath came quickly , and she <name> her hand away .
" i suppose i ought to feel complimented , " she replied .
at this crucial instant what had been a gliding flight of the automobile became , suddenly , a more or less uneven and <unk> progress , accompanied by violent explosions .
at the first of these honora , in alarm , leaped to her feet .
and the machine , after what seemed an heroic attempt to continue , came to a dead stop .
they were on the outskirts of a village ; children coming home from school surrounded them in a ring .
<name> jumped out , the chauffeur opened the hood , and they peered together into what was , to honora , an inexplicable tangle of machinery .
there followed a colloquy , in technical french , between the master and the man .
" what 's the matter ? "
asked honora , anxiously .
" nothing much , " said <name> , " <unk> .
we 'll fix it up in a few minutes . "
he looked with some annoyance at the gathering crowd .
" stand back a little , ca n't you ? "
he cried , " and give us room . "
after some minutes spent in wiping greasy pieces of steel which the chauffeur extracted , and subsequent ceaseless grinding on the crank , the engine started again , not without a series of protesting cracks like pistol shots .
the chauffeur and <name> leaped in , the bystanders parted with derisive cheers , and away they went through the village , only to announce by another series of explosions a second disaster at the other end of the street .
a crowd collected there , too .
" oh , dear ! "
said honora , " do n't you think we ought to take the train , mr. <name> ?
if i were to miss a dinner at my own house , it would be too terrible ! "
" there 's nothing to worry about , " he assured her .
" nothing broken .
it's only the <unk> system that needs adjustment . "
although this was so much greek to honora , she was reassured .
trixton <name> inspired confidence .
there was another argument with the chauffeur , a little more animated than the first ; more greasy <unk> taken out and wiped , and a sharper exchange of compliments with the crowd ; more grinding , until the chauffeur 's face was steeped in perspiration , and more pistol shots .
they were off again , but lamely , spurting a little at times , and again <unk> down to the pace of an <unk> .
their progress became a series of illustrations of the fable of the hare and the tortoise .
they passed horses , and the horses shied into the ditch : then the same horses passed them , usually at the periods chosen by the demon under the hood to fire its pistol shots , and into the ditch went the horses once more , their owners expressing their thoughts in language at once vivid and unrestrained .
it is one of the blessed compensations of life that in times of prosperity we do not remember our miseries .
in these enlightened days , when everybody owns an automobile and calmly travels from chicago to boston if he chooses , we have forgotten the dark ages when these machines were possessed by devils : when it took sometimes as much as three hours to go twenty miles , and often longer than that .
how many of us have had the same experience as honora !
she was always going to take the train , and did n't .
whenever her mind was irrevocably made up , the automobile whirled away on all four cylinders for a half a mile or so , until they were out of reach of the railroad .
there were trolley cars , to be sure , but those took forever to get anywhere .
four o'clock struck , five and six , when at last the fiend who had conspired with fate , having accomplished his evident purpose of compelling honora to miss her dinner , finally abandoned them as suddenly and mysteriously as he had come , and the automobile was a lamb once more .
it was half-past six , and the sun had set , before they saw the lights twinkling all yellow on the heights of fort <name> .
at that hour the last train they could have taken to reach the dinner-party in time was leaving the new york side of the ferry .
" what <name> they think ? "
cried honora .
" they saw us leave <unk> 's at two o'clock , and they did n't know we were going to <unk> . "
it needed no very vivid imagination to summon up the probable remarks of mrs. chandos on the affair .
it was all very well to say the motor broke down ; but unfortunately trixton <name> 's reputation was not much better than that of his car .
trixton <name> , as might have been expected , was inclined to treat the matter as a joke .
" there 's nothing very formal about a quicksands dinner-party , " he said .
" we 'll have a <unk> little dinner in town , and call 'em up on the telephone . "
she herself was surprised at the spirit of recklessness stealing over her , for there was , after all , a certain appealing glamour in the adventure .
she was thrilled by the swift , gliding motion of the automobile , the weird and unfamiliar character of these upper reaches of a great city in the twilight , where new houses stood alone or in rows on wide levelled tracts ; and old houses , once in the country , were seen high above the roadway behind crumbling fences , surrounded by gloomy old trees with rotting branches .
she stole a glance at the man close beside her ; a delightful fear of him made her shiver , and she shrank closer into the corner of the seat .
" honora ! "
all at once he had seized her hand again , and held it in spite of her efforts to release it .
" honora , " he said , " i love you as i have never loved in my life .
as i never shall love again . "
" oh  you must n't say that ! "
she cried .
" why not ? "
he demanded .
" why not , if i feel it ? "
" because , " faltered honora , " because i ca n't listen to you . "
<name> made a motion of disdain with his free hand .
" i do n't pretend that it 's right , " he said .
" i 'm not a hypocrite , anyway , thank god !
it 's undoubtedly wrong , according to all moral codes .
i 've never paid any attention to them .
you 're married .
i 'm happy to say i 'm divorced .
you 've got a husband .
i wo n't be guilty of the bad taste of discussing him .
he 's a good fellow enough , but he never thinks about you from the time the exchange opens in the morning until he gets home at night and wants his dinner .
you do n't love him  it would be a miracle if a woman with any spirit did .
he has n't any more of an idea of what he possesses by legal right than the man i discovered driving in a cart one of the best hunters i ever had in my stables .
to say that he doesn't appreciate you is a ludicrous <unk> .
any woman would have done for him . "
" please do n't ! "
she implored him .
" please do n't ! "
but for the moment she knew that she was powerless , carried along like a chip on the crest of his passion .
" i do n't pretend to say how it is , or why it is , " he went on , paying no heed to her protests .
" i suppose there 's one woman for every man in the world  though i did n't use to think so .
i always had another idea of woman before i met you .
i 've thought i was in love with 'em , but now i understand it was only  something else .
i say , i do n't know what it is in you that makes me feel differently .
i ca n't analyze it , and i don't want to .
you 're not perfect , by a good deal , and god knows i 'm not .
you 're ambitious , but if you were n't , you 'd be <unk>  yet there's no pitiful artifice in you as in other women that any idiot can see through .
and it would have paralyzed forever any ordinary woman to have married <name> spence . "
a new method of wooing , surely , and evidently peculiar to trixton <name> .
honora , in the prey of emotions which he had aroused in spite of her , needless to say did not , at that moment , perceive the humour in it .
his words gave her food for thought for many months afterwards .
the lion was indeed aroused at last , and whip or goad or <unk> of no avail .
there came a time when she no longer knew what he was saying : when speech , though eloquent and forceful , seemed a useless medium .
her appeals were lost , and she found herself fighting in his arms , when suddenly they turned into one of the crowded arteries of <unk> .
she made a supreme effort of <name> , and he released her .
" oh ! "
she cried , trembling .
but he looked at her , <unk> , with the light of triumph in his eyes .
" i 'll never forgive you ! "
she exclaimed , breathless .
" i gloried in it , " he replied .
" i shall remember it as long as i live , and i 'll do it again . "
she did not answer him .
she dropped her veil , and for a long space was silent while they rapidly threaded the traffic , and at length turned into upper fifth avenue , skirting the park .
she did not so much as glance at him .
but he seemed content to watch her veiled profile in the dusk .
her breath , in the first tumult of her thought , came and went deeply .
but gradually as the street lights burned brighter and familiar sights began to appear , she grew more controlled and became capable of reflection .
she remembered that there was a train for quicksands at <unk> , which <name> had taken once or twice .
but she felt that the interval was too short .
in that brief period she could not calm herself sufficiently to face her guests .
indeed , the notion of appearing alone , or with <name> , at that dinner-party , appalled her .
and suddenly an idea presented itself .
<name> leaned over , and began to direct the chauffeur to a well-known hotel .
she interrupted him .
" no , " she said , " i 'd rather go to the holland house . "
" very well , " he said <unk> , not a little surprised at this unlooked-for acquiescence , and then told his man to keep straight on down the avenue .
she began mechanically to <unk> her hat and veil ; and after that , sitting upright , to watch the cross streets with feverish anticipation , her hands in her lap .
" honora ? "
he said .
she did not answer .
" raise the veil , just for a moment , and look at me . "
she shook her head .
but for some reason , best known to herself , she smiled a little .
perhaps it was because her indignation , which would have frightened many men into repentance , left this one <unk> .
at any rate , he caught the gleam of the smile through the film of her veil , and laughed .
" we 'll have a little table in the corner of the room , " he declared , " and you shall order the dinner .
here we are , " he cried to the chauffeur .
" pull up to the right . "
they alighted , crossed the sidewalk , the doors were flung open to receive them , and they entered the hotel .
through the entrance to the restaurant honora caught sight of the red glow of candles upon the white tables , and heard the hum of voices .
in the hall , people were talking and laughing in groups , and it came as a distinct surprise to her that their arrival seemed to occasion no remark .
at the moment of getting out of the automobile , her courage had almost failed her .
trixton <name> hailed one of the hotel servants .
" show mrs. spence to the ladies ' parlour , " said he .
and added to honora , " i 'll get a table , and have the dinner card brought up in a few moments . "
honora stopped the boy at the elevator door .
" go to the office , " she said , " and find out if mrs. <name> holt is in , and the number of her room .
and take me to the telephone booths .
i'll wait there . "
she asked the telephone operator to call up mr. spence 's house at quicksands  and waited .
" i 'm sorry , madam , " he said , after a little while , which seemed like half an hour to honora , " but they 've had a fire in the kingston exchange , and the quicksands line is out of order . "
honora 's heart sank ; but the <unk> had reappeared .
yes , mrs. holt was in .
" take me to her room , " she said , and followed him into the elevator .
in response to his knock the door was opened by mrs. holt herself .
she wore a <unk> gown , and in her hand was a copy of the report of the board of missions .
for a moment she peered at honora over the glasses lightly poised on the uncertain rim of her nose .
" why  my dear ! "
she exclaimed , in astonishment .
" honora ! "
" oh , " cried honora , " i 'm so glad you 're here .
i was so afraid you 'd be out . "
in the embrace that followed both the glasses and the mission report fell to the floor .
honora picked them up .
" sit down , my dear , and tell me how you happen to be here , " said mrs. holt .
" i suppose <name> is downstairs . "
" no , he is n't , " said honora , rather breathlessly ; " that 's the reason i came here .
that 's one reason , i mean .
i was coming to see you this morning , but i simply did n't have time for a call after i got to town . "
mrs. holt settled herself in the middle of the sofa , the only piece of furniture in the room in <name> with her ample proportions .
her attitude and posture were both judicial , and justice itself spoke in her <unk> eyes .
" tell me all about it , " she said , thus revealing her suspicions that there was something to tell .
" i was just going to , " said honora , hastily , thinking of trixton <name> waiting in the ladies ' parlour .
" i took lunch at <unk> 's with mr. grainger , and mr. <name> , and mrs. kame  " " <name> grainger ? "
demanded mrs. holt .
honora trembled .
" yes , " she said .
" i knew his father and mother intimately , " said mrs. holt , unexpectedly .
" and his wife is a friend of mine .
she 's one of the most executive women we have in the <unk> girls ' association , ' and she read a paper today that was masterful .
you know her , of course . "
" no , " said honora , " i have n't met her yet . "
" then how did you happen to be lunching with her husband ?
" i was n't lunching with him , mrs. holt , " said honora ; " mr. <name> was giving the lunch . "
" who 's mr .
<name> ? "
demanded mrs. holt .
" one of those quicksands people ? "
" he 's not exactly a quicksands person .
i scarcely know how to describe him .
he 's very <name> , and goes abroad a great deal , and plays polo .
that 's the reason he has a little place at quicksands .
he 's been awfully kind both to <name> and me , " she added with inspiration .
" and mrs .
kame ? "
said mrs. holt .
" she 's a widow , and has a place at <unk> .
" i never heard of her , " said mrs. holt , and honora thanked her stars .
" and <name> <unk> of these mixed <unk> , my dear ?
when i was young , husbands and wives usually went to parties together . "
a <unk> thought came to honora , that mrs. holt might suddenly inquire as to the whereabouts of mr. <name> 's wife .
" oh , <name> does n't mind , " she said hastily .
" i suppose times have changed , mrs. holt .
and after lunch we all went out in mr. <unk> automobile to the <unk> ' in <unk>  " " the <name> jones <unk> ? "
mrs. holt interrupted .
" what a nice woman that young mrs. <unk> is !
she was <name> <unk> , you know .
both of them very old families . "
" it was only , " continued honora , in desperation , " it was only to leave mr. grainger and mrs. kame there to spend the night .
they all said we had plenty of time to go and get back to quicksands by six o'clock .
but coming back the automobile broke down  " " of course , " said mrs. holt , " it serves any one right for trusting to them .
i think they are an invention of the devil . "
" and we 've only just got back to new york this minute . "
" who ? "
inquired mrs. holt .
" mr. <name> and i , " said honora , with downcast eyes .
" good gracious ! "
exclaimed the elder <name> .
" i could n't think of anything else to do but come straight here to you , " said honora , gazing at her friend .
" and oh , i 'm so glad to find you .
there 's not another train to quicksands till after nine . "
" you did quite right , my dear , under the circumstances .
i do n't say you have n't been foolish , but it 's <name> 's fault quite as much as yours .
he has no business to let you do such things . "
" and what makes it worse , " said honora , " is that the wires are down to quicksands , and i ca n't telephone <name> , and we have people to dinner , and they do n't know i went to <unk> , and there 's no use telegraphing : it would n't be delivered till midnight or morning . "
" there , there , my dear , do n't worry .
i know how anxious you feel on your husband 's account  " " oh  mrs. holt , i was going to ask you a great , great favour .
wouldn't you go down to quicksands with me and spend the night  and pay us a little visit ?
you know we would so love to have you ! "
" of course i 'll go down with you , my dear , " said mrs. holt .
" i'm surprised that you should think for an instant that i would n't .
it 's my obvious duty .
<name> ! "
she called , " <name> ! "
the door of the bedroom opened , and mrs. holt 's elderly maid appeared .
the same maid , by the way , who had closed the shutters that memorable <name> night at silverdale .
she had , it seemed , a trick of appearing at crises .
" <name> , telephone to mrs. <unk>  you know her <unk> say that i am very sorry , but an unexpected duty calls me out of town to-night , and ask her to communicate with the reverend mr. field .
as for staying with you , honora , " she continued , " i have to be back at silverdale to-morrow night .
perhaps you and <name> <name> come back with me .
my <name> opinion is , that a rest from the gayety of quicksands <name> do you good . "
" i <name> come , with pleasure , " said honora .
" but as for <name>  i'm afraid he 's too busy . "
" and how about dinner ? "
asked mrs. holt .
" i forgot to say , " said honora , " that mr. <name> 's downstairs .
he brought me here , of course .
have you any objection to his dining with us ? "
" no , " answered mrs. holt , " i think i should like to see him . "
after mrs. holt had given instructions to her maid to pack , and honora had brushed some of the dust of the roads from her costume , they descended to the ladies ' parlour .
at the far end of it a waiter holding a card was standing respectfully , and trixton <name> was pacing up and down between the windows .
when he caught sight of them he stopped in his tracks , and stared , and stood as if rooted to the carpet .
honora came forward .
" oh , mr .
<name> ! "
she cried , " my old friend , mrs. holt , is here , and she 's going to take dinner with us and come down to quicksands for the night .
may i introduce mr .
<name> . "
" was n't it fortunate , mr. <name> , that mrs. spence happened to find me ? "
said mrs. holt , as she took his hand .
" i know it is a relief to you . "
it was not often , indeed , that trixton <name> was taken off his guard ; but some allowance must be made for him , since he was facing a situation unparalleled in his previous experience .
virtue had not often been so triumphant , and never so dramatic as to produce at the critical instant so emblematic a defender as this <unk> <name> in dove colour .
for a moment , he stared at her , speechless , and then he gathered himself together .
" a relief ? "
he asked .
" it would seem so to me , " said mrs. holt .
" not that i do not think you are perfectly capable of taking care of her , as an intimate friend of her husband .
i was merely thinking of the proprieties .
and as i am a guest in this hotel , i expect you both to do me the honour to dine with me before we start for quicksands . "
after all , trixton <name> had a sense of humour , although it must not be expected that he should grasp at once all the elements of a joke on himself so colossal .
" i , for one , " he said , with a slight bow which gave to his words a touch somewhat elaborate , " <name> be delighted . "
and he shot at honora a glance compounded of many feelings , which she returned smilingly .
" is that the waiter ? "
asked mrs. holt .
" that is a waiter , " said trixton <name> , glancing at the motionless figure .
" shall i call him ? "
" if you please , " said mrs. holt .
" honora , you must tell me what you like . "
" anything , mrs. holt , " said honora .
" if we are to leave a little after nine , " said that <name> , balancing her glasses on her nose and glancing at the card , " we have not , i 'm afraid , time for many courses . "
the head waiter greeted them at the door of the dining-room .
he , too , was a man of wisdom and experience .
he knew mrs. holt , and he knew trixton <name> .
if gravity had not been a life-long habit with him , one might have suspected him of a <name> to laugh .
as it was , he seemed palpably embarrassed ,  for mr. <name> had evidently been conversing with him .
" two , sir ? "
he asked .
" three , " said mrs. holt , with dignity .
the head waiter planted them conspicuously in the centre of the room ; one of the strangest parties , from the point of view of a <unk> of new york , that ever sat down together .
mrs. holt with her curls , and her glasses laid flat on the bosom of her <unk> dress ; honora in a costume dedicated to the very latest of the sports , and trixton <name> in english <unk> .
the dining-room was full .
but here and there amongst the <unk> , honora observed , were elderly people who smiled discreetly as they glanced in their direction  friends , perhaps , of mrs. holt .
and suddenly , in one corner , she perceived a table of six where the mirth was less restrained .
fortunately for mr. <name> , he had had a <unk> , or perhaps two , in honora 's absence .
sufficient time had elapsed since their administration for their proper soothing and exhilarating effects .
at the sound of the laughter in the corner he turned his head , a signal for renewed merriment from that quarter .
whereupon he turned back again and faced his hostess once more with a heroism that compelled honora 's admiration .
as a sportsman , he had no intention of shirking the bitterness of defeat .
" mrs. grainger and mrs .
shorter , " he remarked , " appear to be enjoying themselves . "
honora felt her face grow hot as the merriment at the corner table rose to a height it had not heretofore attained .
and she did not dare to look again .
mrs. holt was <unk> oblivious to her surroundings .
she was , as usual , extremely composed , and improved the interval , while drinking her soup , with a more or less undisguised observation of mr. <name> ; evidently regarding him somewhat in the manner that a suspicious <unk> would look upon a strange gentleman whom he accidentally found in his front hall .
explanations were necessary .
that mr. <unk> appearance , on the whole , was in his favour did not serve to <unk> her suspicions .
good-looking men were apt to be unscrupulous .
" are you interested in working girls , mr .
<name> ? "
she inquired presently .
honora , in spite of her discomfort , had an insane <name> to giggle .
she did not dare to raise her eyes .
" i ca n't say that i 've had much experience with them , mrs. holt , " he replied , with a gravity little short of sublime .
" naturally you would n't have had , " said mrs. holt .
" what i meant was , are you interested in the problems they have to face ? "
" extremely , " said he , so unexpectedly that honora choked .
" i ca n't say that i 've given as many hours as i should have liked to a study of the subject , but i do n't know of any class that has a harder time .
as a rule , they 're <unk> and overworked , and when night comes they are either tired to death or bored to death , and the good-looking ones are subject to temptations which some of them find impossible to resist , in a natural <name> for some excitement to vary the routine of their lives . "
" it seems to me , " said mrs. holt , " that you are fairly conversant with the subject .
i do n't think i ever heard the problem stated so <unk> and so well .
perhaps , " she added , " it might interest you to attend one of our meetings next month .
indeed , you might be willing to say a few words . "
" i 'm afraid you 'll have to excuse me , mrs. holt .
i 'm a rather busy man , and nothing of a public speaker , and it is rarely i get off in the daytime . "
" how about <unk> ? "
asked mrs. holt , with a smile .
" well , " said trixton <name> , laughing in spite of himself , " i like the working girls , i have to have a little excitement occasionally .
and i find it easier to get off in the summer than in the <name> . "
" men cover a multitude of sins under the plea of business , " said mrs. holt , shaking her head .
" i ca n't say i think much of your method of distraction .
why any one desires to get into an automobile , i don't see . "
" have you ever been in one ? "
he asked .
" mine is here , and i was about to invite you to go down to the ferry in it .
i 'll promise to go slow . "
" well , " said mrs. holt , " i do n't object to going that distance , if you keep your promise .
i 'll admit that i 've always had a curiosity . "
" and in return , " said <name> , gallantly , " allow me to send you a cheque for your working girls . "
" you 're very good , " said mrs. holt .
" oh , " he protested , " i 'm not in the habit of giving much to charities , i 'm sorry to say .
i 'd like to know how it feels . "
" then i <name> the sensation <name> induce you to try it again , " said mrs. holt .
" nobody , mrs. holt , " cried honora , " could be kinder to his friends than mr .
<name> ! "
" we were speaking of disinterested kindness , my dear , " was mrs. <unk> reply .
" you 're quite right , mrs. holt , " said trixton <name> , beginning , as the dinner progressed , to take in the <name> opposite a delight that surprised him .
" i 'm willing to confess that i 've led an extremely selfish existence . "
" the confession is n't necessary , " she replied .
" it 's written all over you .
you 're the type of successful man who gets what he wants .
i don't mean to say that you are incapable of kindly instincts . "
and her eye twinkled a little .
" i 'm very grateful for that concession , at any rate , " he declared .
" there might be some <name> for you if you fell into the hands of a good woman , " said mrs. holt .
" i take it you are a bachelor .
<name> my words , the longer you remain one , the more steeped in selfishness you are likely to become in this modern and complex and <unk> life which so many people lead . "
honora trembled for what he might say to this , remembering his bitter references of that afternoon to his own matrimonial experience .
visions of a scene arose before her in the event that mrs. holt should discover his status .
but evidently trixton <name> had no intention of discussing his marriage .
" judging by some of my married friends and acquaintances , " he said , " i have no <name> to try matrimony as a remedy for unselfishness . "
" then , " replied mrs. holt , " all i can say is , i should make new friends amongst another kind of people , if i were you .
you are quite right , and if i were seeking examples of happy marriages , i should not begin my search among the so-called fashionable set of the present day .
they are so supremely selfish that if the least difference in taste develops , or if another man or woman chances along whom they momentarily fancy more than their own husbands or wives , they get a divorce .
their idea of marriage is not a mutual sacrifice which brings happiness through trials borne together and through the making of character .
no , they have a notion that man and wife may continue to lead their individual lives .
that is n't marriage .
i 've lived with <name> holt thirty-five years last <name> , and i have n't pleased myself in all that time . "
" all men , " said trixton <name> , " are not so fortunate as mr .
holt . "
honora began to have the sensations of a witness to a debate between <unk> and the powers of heaven .
her head swam .
but mrs. holt , who had unlooked-for flashes of humour , laughed , and shook her curls at <name> .
" i should like to lecture you some time , " she said ; " i think it would do you good . "
he shook his head .
" i 'm beyond redemption .
do n't you think so , honora ? "
he asked , with an unexpected return of his audacity .
" i 'm afraid i 'm not worthy to judge you , " she replied , and coloured .
" stuff and nonsense , " said mrs. holt ; " women are superior to men , and it 's our duty to keep them in order .
and if we 're really going to risk our lives in your automobile , mr. <name> , you 'd better make sure it's there , " she added , glancing at her watch .
having dined together in an apparent and inexplicable amity , their exit was of even more interest to the table in the corner than their entrance had been .
mrs. holt 's elderly maid was waiting in the hall , mrs. <unk> little trunk was strapped on the rear of the car ; and the <name> herself , with something of the feelings of a missionary embarking for the wilds of africa , was assisted up the little step and through the narrow entrance of the tonneau by the combined efforts of honora and <name> .
an expression of resolution , emblematic of a determination to die , if necessary , in the performance of duty , was on her face as the machinery started ; and her breath was not quite normal when , in an incredibly brief period , they descended at the ferry .
the journey to quicksands was accomplished in a good fellowship which honora , an hour before , would not have dreamed of .
even mrs. holt was not wholly proof against the charms of trixton <name> when he chose to exert himself ; and for some reason he did so choose .
as they stood in the starlight on the platform of the deserted little station while he went across to <unk> 's livery stable to get a carriage , mrs. holt remarked to honora : " mr. <name> is a fascinating man , my dear . "
" i am so glad that you appreciate him , " exclaimed honora .
" and a most dangerous one , " continued mrs. holt .
" he has probably , in his day , disturbed the peace of mind of a great many young women .
not that i have n't the highest confidence in you , honora , but honesty forces me to confess that you are young and <unk> , and a little heedless .
and the atmosphere in which you live is not likely to correct those tendencies .
if you <name> take my advice , you <name> not see too much of mr. trixton <name> when your husband is not present . "
indeed , as to the probable effect of this incident on the relations between mr. <name> and herself honora was wholly in the dark .
although , from her point of view , what she had done had been amply justified by the plea of self-defence , it could not be expected that he would accept it in the same spirit .
the apparent pleasure he had taken in the present situation , once his amazement had been overcome , profoundly puzzled her .
he returned in a few minutes with the carriage and driver , and they started off .
<name> sat in front , and honora explained to mrs. holt the appearance of the various places by daylight , and the names of their owners .
the elderly <name> looked with considerable interest at the blazing lights of the club , with the same sensations she would no doubt have had if she had been suddenly set down within the <unk> rouge .
shortly afterwards they turned in at the gate of " the <unk> . "
the light streamed across the porch and driveway , and the sound of music floated out of the open windows .
within , the figure of mrs. barclay could be seen ; she was singing <unk> songs at the piano .
mrs. holt 's lips were tightly shut as she descended and made her way up the steps .
" i <name> you 'll come in , " , said honora to trixton <name> , in a low voice .
" come in ! "
he replied , " i would n't miss it for ten thousand dollars . "
mrs. holt was the first of the three to appear at the door of the drawing-room , and mrs. barclay caught sight of her , and stopped in the middle of a bar , with her mouth open .
some of the guests had left .
a table in the corner , where <name> chandos had insisted on playing bridge , was covered with scattered cards and some bills , a <unk> of whiskey , two soda bottles , and two glasses .
the blue curling smoke from mrs. chandos ' cigarette mingled with the haze that <name> between the ceiling and the floor , and that <name> was in the act of saying cheerfully to <name> , who sat opposite ,  " trixy 's run off with her . "
suddenly the chill of silence pervaded the room .
<name> chandos , whose back was turned to the door , looked from mrs. barclay to <name> , who , with the other men had risen to his feet .
" what 's the matter ? "
she said in a frightened tone .
and , following the eyes of the others , turned her head slowly towards the doorway .
mrs. holt , who filled it , had been literally incapable of speech .
close behind her stood honora and trixton whose face was inscrutable .
" <name> , " said honora , summoning all the courage that remained in her , " here 's mrs. holt .
we dined with her , and she was good enough to come down for the night .
i 'm so sorry not to have been here , " she added to her guests , " but we went to <unk> with mrs. kame and mr. grainger , and the automobile broke down on the way back . "
mrs. holt made no attempt to enter , but stared fixedly at the cigarette that mrs. chandos still held in her trembling fingers .
<name> crossed the room in the midst of an intense silence .
" glad to see you , mrs. holt , " he said .
" er  wo n't you come in and  and sit down ? "
" thank you , <name> " she replied , " i do not wish to interrupt your party .
it is my usual hour for retiring .
" and i think , my dear , " she added , turning to honora , " that i 'll ask you to excuse me , and show me to my room . "
" certainly , mrs. holt , " said honora , breathlessly .
" <name> , ring the <name> . "
she led the way up the stairs to the <unk> with the rose paper and the little balcony .
as she closed the door gusts of laughter reached them from the floor below , and she could plainly distinguish the voices of may barclay and trixton <name> .
" i <name> you 'll be comfortable , mrs. holt , " she said .
" your maid <name> be in the little room across the hall and i believe you like breakfast at eight . "
" you must n't let me keep you from your guests , honora . "
" oh , mrs. holt , " she said , on the verge of tears , " i do n't want to go to them .
really , i do n't . "
" it must be confessed , " said mrs. holt , opening her handbag and taking out the copy of the mission report , which had been carefully folded , " that they seem to be able to get along very well without you .
i suppose i am too old to understand this modern way of living .
how well i remember one night  it was in 1886  i missed the train to silverdale , and my telegram miscarried .
poor mr. holt was nearly out of his head . "
she fumbled for her glasses and dropped them .
honora picked them up , and it was then she perceived that the tears were raining down the good <name> 's cheeks .
at the same moment they sprang into honora 's eyes , and blinded her .
mrs. holt looked at her long and earnestly .
" go down , my dear , " she said gently , " you must not neglect your friends .
they <name> wonder where you are .
and at what time do you breakfast ? "
" at  at any time you like . "
" i shall be down at eight , " said mrs. holt , and she kissed her .
honora , closing the door , stood motionless in the hall , and presently the footsteps and the laughter and the sound of carriage wheels on the gravel died away .
chapter xi .
containing some revelations honora , as she descended , caught a glimpse of the parlour maid picking up the scattered cards on the drawing-room floor .
there were voices on the porch , where <name> was saying good-by to mrs. chandos and trixton <name> .
she joined them .
" oh , my dear ! "
cried mrs. chandos , interrupting honora 's apologies , " i'm sure i <name> n't sleep a wink  she gave me such a fright .
you might have sent trixy ahead to prepare us .
when i first caught sight of her , i thought it was my own dear mother who had come all the way from <name> , and the cigarette burned my fingers .
but i must say i think it was awfully clever of you to get hold of her and save <unk> reputation .
good night , dear . "
and she got into her carriage .
" give my love to mrs. holt , " said <name> , as he took honora 's hand , " and tell her i feel hurt that she neglected to say good night to me .
i thought i had made an impression .
tell her i 'll send her a cheque for her rescue work .
she inspires me with confidence . "
<name> laughed .
" i 'll see you to-morrow , <name> , " he called out as they drove away .
though always <unk> , it seemed to honora that her husband had an increased air of importance as he turned to her now with his hands in his pockets .
he looked at her for a moment , and laughed again .
he , too , had apparently seen the incident only in a humorous light .
" well , honora , " he remarked , " you have a sort of a p. t. barnum way of doing things once in a while  have n't you ?
is the old <name> really tucked away for the night , or is she coming down to read us a sermon ?
and how the deuce did you happen to pick her up ? "
she had come downstairs with confession on her lips , and in the agitation of her mind had scarcely heeded <name> 's words or mrs. chandos ' .
she had come down prepared for any attitude but the one in which she found him ; for anger , reproaches , <unk> .
nay , she was surprised to find now that she had actually hoped for these .
she deserved to be scolded : it was her right .
if he had been all of a man , he would have called her to account .
there must be  there was something lacking in his character .
and it came to her suddenly , with all the shock of a great contrast , with what different eyes she had looked upon him five years before at silverdale .
he went into the house and started to enter the drawing-room , still in disorder and reeking with smoke .
" no , not in there ! "
she cried sharply .
he turned to her puzzled .
her breath was coming and going quickly .
she crossed the hall and turned on the light in the little parlour there , and he followed her .
" do n't you feel well ? "
he asked .
" <name> , " she said , " were n't you worried ? "
" worried ?
no , why should i have been ?
<name> chandos and may barclay had seen you in the automobile in town , and i knew you were high and dry somewhere . "
" high and dry , " she repeated .
" what ? "
" nothing .
they said i had run off with mr. <name> , did n't they ? "
he laughed .
" yes , there was some joking to that effect . "
" you did n't take it seriously ? "
" no  why should i ? "
she was appalled by his lack of knowledge of her .
all these years she had lived with him , and he had not grasped even the elements of her nature .
and this was marriage !
trixton <name>  short as their acquaintance had been  had some <name> of her character and possibilities her husband none .
where was she to begin ?
how was she to tell him the episode in the automobile in order that he might perceive something of its sinister significance ?
where was she to go to be saved from herself , if not to him ?
" i might have run away with him , if i had loved him , " she said after a pause .
" would you have cared ? "
" you bet your life , " said <name> , and put his arm around her .
she looked up into his face .
so intent had she been on what she had meant to tell him that she did not until now perceive he was preoccupied , and only half listening to what she was saying .
" you bet your life , " he said , patting her shoulder .
" what would i have done , all alone , in the new house ? "
" in the new house ? "
she cried .
" oh , <name>  you have n't taken it ! "
" i have n't signed the lease , " he replied <unk> , smiling down at her , and thrusting his hands in his pockets .
" i do n't want it , " said honora ; " i do n't want it .
i told you that i'd decided i did n't want it when we were there .
oh , <name> , why did you take it ? "
he whistled .
he had the maddening air of one who derives amusement from the <unk> of a spoiled child .
" well , " he remarked , " women are too many for me .
if there 's any way of pleasing 'em i have n't yet discovered it .
the night before last you had to have the house .
nothing else would do .
it was the greatest find in new york .
for the first time in months you get up for breakfast  a pretty sure sign you had n't changed your mind .
you drag me to see it , and when you land me there , because i do n't lose my head immediately , you say you do n't want it .
of course i did n't take you seriously  i thought you 'd set your heart on it , so i wired an offer to shorter to-day , and he accepted it .
and when i hand you this pleasant little surprise , you go right up in the air . "
he had no air of vexation , however , as he delivered this somewhat reproachful harangue in the picturesque language to which he commonly resorted .
quite the contrary .
he was still smiling , as <name> claus must smile when he knows he has another pack up the chimney .
" why this sudden change of mind ? "
he demanded .
" it ca n't be because you want to spend the <name> in quicksands . "
she was indeed at a loss what to say .
she could not bring herself to ask him whether he had been influenced by trixton <name> .
if he had , she told herself , she did not wish to know .
he was her husband , after all , and it would be too humiliating .
and then he had taken the house .
" have you hit on a palace you like better ? "
he inquired , with a clumsy attempt at banter .
" they tell me the elder <unk> are going abroad  perhaps we could get their house on the park . "
" you said you could n't afford mrs. rindge 's house , " she answered uneasily , " and i  i believed you . "
" i could n't , " he said mysteriously , and paused .
it seemed to her , as she recalled the scene afterwards , that in this pause he gave the impression of physically swelling .
she remembered staring at him with wide , frightened eyes and parted lips .
" i could n't , " he repeated , with the same strange emphasis and a palpable attempt at complacency .
" but  er  circumstances have changed since then . "
" what do you mean , <name> ? "
she whispered .
the corners of his mouth twitched in the attempt to repress a smile .
" i mean , " he said , " that the president of a trust company can afford to live in a better house than the <name> partner of dallam and spence . "
" the president of a trust company ! "
honora scarcely recognized her own voice  so distant it sounded .
the room rocked , and she clutched the arm of a chair and sat down .
he came and stood over her .
" i thought that would surprise you some , " he said , obviously pleased by these symptoms .
" the fact is , i had n't meant to break it to you until morning .
but i think i 'll go in on the seven thirty-five . "
( he glanced significantly up at the ceiling , as though mrs. holt had something to do with this decision . )
" president of the orange trust company at forty is n't so bad , eh ? "
" the orange trust company ?
did you say the orange trust company ? "
" yes . "
he produced a cigarette .
" old <name> wing and <name> practically control it .
you see , if i do say it myself , i handled some things pretty well for <name> this summer , and he 's seemed to appreciate it .
he and wing were buying in traction stocks out west .
but you could have knocked me down with a <unk> when he came to me  " " when did he come to you ? "
she asked breathlessly .
" yesterday .
we went down town together , you remember , and he asked me to step into his office .
well , we talked it over , and i left on the one o'clock for newport to see mr. wing .
wonderful old man !
i sat up with him till midnight  it was n't any picnic " ... more than once during the night honora awoke with a sense of oppression , and each time went painfully through the whole episode from the evening  some weeks past when trixton <name> had first mentioned the subject of the trust company , to the occurrence in the automobile and <name> 's triumphant announcement .
she had but a vague notion of how that scene had finished ; or of how , limply , she had got to bed .
round and round the circle she went in each waking period .
to have implored him to relinquish the place had been waste of breath ; and then  her reasons ?
these were the moments when the current was strongest , when she grew incandescent with humiliation and pain ; when stray phrases in red letters of <name> 's were illuminated .
merit !
he had a contempt for her husband which he had not taken the trouble to hide .
but not a business contempt .
" as good as the next man , " <name> had said  or words to that effect .
" as good as the next man ! "
then she had tacitly agreed to the bargain , and refused to honour the <name> !
no , she had not , she had not .
before god , she was innocent of that !
when she reached this point it was always to <name> wing that she clung  the financier , at least , had been impartial .
and it was he who saved her .
at length she opened her eyes to discover with bewilderment that the room was flooded with light , and then she sprang out of bed and went to the open window .
to seaward <name> an <name> mist , struck here and there with crimson .
she listened ; some one was whistling an air she had heard before  mrs. barclay had been singing it last night !
wheels <unk> the gravel  <name> was going off .
she stood motionless until the <unk> hoofs rang on the <unk> , and then hurried into her dressing-gown and slippers and went downstairs to the telephone and called a number .
" is this mr. <name> 's ?
<name> you say to mr. <name> that mrs. spence would be greatly , obliged if he stopped a moment at her house before going to town ?
thank you . "
she returned to her room and dressed with feverish haste , trying to gather her wits for an ordeal which she felt it would have killed her to delay .
at ten minutes to eight she emerged again and glanced anxiously at mrs. holt 's door ; and scarcely had she reached the lower hall before he drove into the circle .
she was struck more forcibly than ever by the physical freshness of the man , and he bestowed on her , as he took her hand , the peculiar smile she knew so well , that always seemed to have an enigma behind it .
at sight and touch of him the memory of what she had prepared to say vanished .
" behold me , as ever , your obedient servant , " he said , as he followed her into the <unk> portion of the porch .
" you must think it strange that i sent for you , i know , " she cried , as she turned to him .
" but i could n't wait .
i  i did not know until last night .
<name> only told me then .
oh , you did n't do it for me !
please say you did n't do it for me ! "
" my dear honora , " replied trixton <name> , gravely , " we wanted your husband for his abilities and the valuable services he can render us . "
she stood looking into his eyes , striving to penetrate to the soul behind , ignorant or heedless that others before her had tried and failed .
he met her gaze <unk> , and smiled .
" i want the truth , " she craved .
" i never lie  to a woman , " he said .
" my life  my future depends upon it , " she went on .
" i 'd rather scrub floors , i 'd rather beg  than to have it so .
you must believe me ! "
" i do believe you , " he affirmed .
and he said it with a gentleness and a sincerity that startled her .
" thank you , " she answered simply .
and speech became very difficult .
" if  if i have n't been quite fair with you  mr. <name> , i am sorry .
i  i liked you , and i like you to-day better than ever before .
and i can quite see now how i must have misled you into thinking  queer things about me .
i did n't mean to .
i have learned a lesson . "
she took a deep , involuntary breath .
the touch of lightness in his reply served to emphasize the hitherto unsuspected fact that <unk> in trixton <name> was not merely a code , but assumed something of the grandeur of a principle .
" i , too , have learned a lesson , " he replied .
" i have learned the difference between nature and <name> .
i am something of a <unk> in <name> .
i bow to nature , and pay my bets . "
" your bets ? "
she asked , with a look .
" my <unk> , <unk> , whatever you choose to call them .
i have been fairly and squarely beaten  but by nature , not by <name> .
that is my consolation . "
laughter struck into her eyes like a shaft of sunlight into a well ; her emotions were no longer to be distinguished .
and in that moment she wondered what would have happened if she had loved this man , and why she had not .
and when next he spoke , she started .
" how is my elderly <unk> friend this morning ? "
he asked .
" that dinner with her was one of the great events of my life .
i did n't suppose such people existed any more . "
" perhaps you 'll stay to breakfast with her , " suggested honora , smiling .
" i know she 'd like to see you again . "
" no , thanks , " he said , taking her hand , " i 'm on my way to the train  i'd quite forgotten it .
au revoir ! "
he reached the end of the porch , turned , and called back , " as a <unk> ex <unk> ' , she has never been equalled . "
honora stood for a while looking after him , until she heard a footstep behind her ,  mrs. holt 's .
" who was that , my dear ? "
she asked , " <name> ? "
" <name> has gone , mrs. holt , " honora replied , rousing herself .
" i must make his apologies .
it was mr .
<name> . "
" mr .
<name> ! "
the good <name> repeated , with a slight upward lift of the faint eyebrows .
" does he often call this early ? "
honora coloured a little , and laughed .
" i asked him to breakfast with you , but he had to catch a train .
he  wished to be remembered .
he took such a fancy to you . "
" i am afraid , " said mrs. holt , " that his fancy is a thing to be avoided .
are you coming to silverdale with me , honora ? "
" yes , mrs. holt , " she replied , slipping her arm through that of her friend , " for as long as you <name> let me stay . "
and she left a note for <name> to that effect .
book iii .
volume 5 .
chapter i. <unk> .
honora did not go back to quicksands .
neither , in this modern chronicle , shall we .
the sphere we have left , which we know is sordid , sometimes shines in the retrospect .
and there came a time , after the excitement of furnishing the new house was over , when our heroine , as it were , swung for a time in space : not for a very long time ; that month , perhaps , between autumn and <name> .
we need not be worried about her , though we may pause for a moment or two to sympathize with her in her loneliness  or rather in the moods it produced .
she even felt , in those days , slightly akin to the <name> of the <name> ( perfectly respectable ) , whom all of us fortunate enough occasionally to go to new york have seen driving on fifth avenue with an expression of wistful <unk> , and who changes her costumes four times a day .
sympathy !
we have seen honora surrounded by friends  what has become of them ?
her husband is president of a trust company , and she has one of the most desirable houses in new york .
what more could be wished for ?
to jump at conclusions in this way is by no means to understand a heroine with an ideal .
she had these things , and  strange as it may seem  suffered .
her <name> drawing-room , with its gathered silk curtains , was especially beautiful ; whatever the <unk> or <unk> may have lacked , it was not taste .
honora sat in it and wondered : wondered , as she looked back over the road she had threaded somewhat blindly towards the ideal , whether she might not somewhere have taken the wrong turn .
the farther she travelled , the more she seemed to penetrate into a land of <unk> .
the exquisite objects by which she was surrounded , and which she had collected with such care , had no substance : she would not have been greatly surprised , at any moment , to see them vanish like a scene in a theatre , leaning an empty , <name> stage behind them .
they did not belong to her , nor she to them .
past generations of another blood , no doubt , had been justified in looking upon the hazy landscapes in the great tapestries as their own : and children 's children had knelt , in times gone by , beside the carved stone mantel .
the big , gilded chairs with the silken seats might appropriately have graced the table of the hotel de <unk> .
would not the warriors and the wits , the patient ladies of high degree and of many children , and even the <unk> <unk> ' themselves , turn over in their graves if they could so much as imagine the contents of the single street in modern new york where honora lived ?
one morning , as she sat in that room , possessed by these whimsical though painful fancies , she picked up a newspaper and glanced through it , absently , until her eye fell by chance upon a name on the editorial <name> .
something like an electric shock ran through her , and the letters of the name seemed to quiver and become red .
slowly they spelled  <name> <name> .
" the argument of mr. <name> <name> , of st. <name> , before the supreme court of the united states in the now celebrated <unk> case is universally acknowledged by lawyers to have been masterly , and reminiscent of the great names of the profession in the past .
mr. <name> is not dramatic .
he appears to <name> all before him by the sheer force of intellect , and by a kind of <unk> ability to expose a fallacy : he is still a young man , self-made , and studied law under judge <name> of st. <name> , once president of the national bar association , whose partner he is " ... . honora cut out the editorial and thrust it in her gown , and threw the newspaper is the fire .
she stood for a time after it had burned , watching the twisted remnants fade from flame colour to rose , and finally <unk> .
then she went slowly up the stairs and put on her hat and coat and veil .
although a cloudless day , it was <name> in the park , and cold , the ruffled waters an intense blue .
she walked fast .
she lunched with mrs. holt , who had but just come to town ; and the light , like a speeding guest , was departing from the city when she reached her own door .
" there is a gentleman in the drawing-room , madam , " said the butler .
" he said he was an old friend , and a stranger in new york , and asked if he might wait . "
she stood still with presentiment .
" what is his name ? "
she asked .
" mr. <name> , " said the man .
still she hesitated .
in the strange state in which she found herself that day , the supernatural itself had seemed credible .
and yet  she was not prepared .
" i beg pardon , madam , " the butler was saying , " perhaps i should n't  ? "
" yes , yes , you should , " she interrupted him , and pushed past him up the stairs .
at the drawing-room door she paused  he was unaware of her presence .
and he had not changed !
she wondered why she had expected him to change .
even the glow of his newly acquired fame was not discernible behind his well-remembered head .
he seemed no older  and no younger .
and he was standing with his hands behind his back gazing in simple , silent appreciation at the big tapestry nearest the windows .
" <name> , " she said , in a low voice .
he turned quickly , and then she saw the glow .
but it was the old glow , not the new  the light in which her early years had been spent .
" what a coincidence ! "
she exclaimed , as he took her hand .
" coincidence ? "
" it was only this morning that i was reading in the newspaper all sorts of nice things about you .
it made me feel like going out and telling everybody you were an old friend of mine . "
still holding his fingers , she pushed him away from her at arm 's length , and looked at him .
" what does it feel like to be famous , and have <unk> about one 's self in the new york newspapers ? "
he laughed , and released his hands somewhat abruptly .
" it seems as strange to me , honora , as it does to you . "
" how unkind of you , <name> ! "
she exclaimed .
she felt his eyes upon her , and their searching , yet kindly and humorous rays seemed to illuminate chambers within her which she would have kept in darkness : which she herself did not wish to examine .
" i 'm so glad to see you , " she said a little breathlessly , flinging her muff and <unk> on a chair .
" sit there , where i can look at you , and tell me why you did n't let me know you were coming to new york . "
he glanced a little comically at the gilt and silk arm-chair which she designated , and then at her ; and she smiled and coloured , <unk> the humour in his unspoken phrase .
" for a great man , " she declared , " you are absurd . "
he sat down .
in spite of his black clothes and the lounging attitude he habitually assumed , with his knees crossed  he did not appear incongruous in a seat that would have <unk> with the flowing robes of the renowned french cardinal himself .
honora wondered why .
he impressed her to-day as force  tremendous force in repose , and yet he was the same <name> .
why was it ?
had the clipping that even then lay in her bosom effected this magic change ?
he had intimated as much , but she denied it fiercely .
she rang for tea .
" you have n't told me why you came to new york , " she said .
" i was telegraphed for , from washington , by a mr. wing , " he explained .
" a mr. wing , " she repeated .
" you do n't mean by any chance <name> wing ? "
" the mr. wing , " said <name> .
" the reason i asked , " explained honora , flushing , " was because <name> is  associated with him .
mr. wing is largely interested in the orange trust company . "
" yes , i know , " said <name> .
his elbows were resting on the arms of his chair , and he looked at the tips of his fingers , which met .
honora thought it strange that he did not congratulate her , but he appeared to be reflecting .
" what did mr. wing want ? "
she inquired in her momentary confusion , and added hastily , " i beg your pardon , <name> .
i suppose i ought not to ask that . "
" he was kind enough to wish me to live in new york he answered , still staring at the tips of his fingers .
" oh , how nice ! "
she cried  and wondered at the same time whether , on second thoughts , she would think it so .
" i suppose he wants you to be the counsel for one of his trusts .
when  when do you come ? "
" i 'm not coming . "
" not coming !
why ?
is n't it a great compliment ? "
he ignored the latter part of her remark ; and it seemed to her , when she recalled the conversation afterwards , that she had heard a certain note of sadness under the lightness of his reply .
" to attempt to explain to a new <unk> why any one might prefer to live in any other place would be a difficult task . "
" you are incomprehensible , <name> , " she declared .
and yet she felt a relief that surprised her , and a <name> to get away from the subject .
" dear old st. <name> !
somehow , in spite of your greatness , it seems to fit you . "
" it 's growing , " said <name>  and they laughed together .
" why did n't you come to lunch ? "
she said .
" lunch !
i did n't know that any one ever went to lunch in new york  in this part of it , at least  with less than three weeks ' notice .
and by the way , if i am interfering with any engagement  " " my book is not so full as all that .
of course you 'll come and stay with us , <name> . "
he shook his head regretfully .
" my train leaves at six , from <unk> street , " he replied .
" oh , you are <unk> , " she cried .
" to think how little i see of you , <name> .
and sometimes i long for you .
it 's strange , but i still miss you terribly  after five years .
it seems longer than that , " she added , as she poured the boiling water into the <unk> .
but she did not look at him .
he got up and walked as far as a <unk> on the wall .
" you have some beautiful things here , honora , " he said .
" i am glad i have had a glimpse of you surrounded by them to <name> back to your aunt and uncle . "
she glanced about the room as he spoke , and then at him .
he seemed the only reality in it , but she did not say so .
" you 'll see them soon , " was what she said .
and considered the miracle of him staying there where providence had placed him , and bringing the world to him .
whereas she , who had gone forth to seek it  " the day after to-morrow <name> be <name> , " he reminded her .
nothing had changed there .
she closed her eyes and saw the little dining room in all the dignity of <name> dinner , the big silver soup <unk> catching the sun , the flowered <name> with the gilt edges , and even a glimpse of lace paper when the closet door opened ; aunt <name> and uncle <name> , with <name> between them .
and these , strangely , were the only tangible things and immutable .
" you 'll give them  a good account of me ? "
she said .
" i know that you do not care for new york , " she added with a smile .
" but it is possible to be happy here . "
" i am glad you are happy , honora , and that you have got what you wanted in life .
although i may be unreasonable and provincial and  and western , " he confessed with a twinkle  for he had the characteristic national trait of shading off his most serious remarks  " i have never gone so far as to declare that happiness was a question of locality . "
she laughed .
" nor fame . "
her mind returned to the <unk> .
" oh , fame ! "
he exclaimed , with a touch of impatience , and he used the word that had possessed her all day .
" there is no reality in that .
men are not loved for it . "
she set down her cup quickly .
he was looking at the <unk> .
" have you been to the metropolitan museum lately ? "
he asked .
" the metropolitan museum ? "
she repeated in bewilderment .
" that would be one of the temptations of new york for me , " he said .
" i was there for half an hour this afternoon before i presented myself at your door as a suspicious character .
there is a picture there , by coffin , called 'the rain , ' i believe .
i am very fond of it .
and looking at it on such a <name> 's day as this brings back the summer .
the squall coming , and the sound of it in the trees , and the very smell of the wet <unk> in the wind .
do you know it ? "
" no , " replied honora , and she was suddenly filled with shame at the thought that she had never been in the museum .
" i did n't know you were so fond of pictures . "
" i am beginning to be a rival of mr. dwyer , " he declared .
" i 've bought four  although i have n't built my gallery .
when you come to st. <name> i 'll show them to you  and let us <name> it <name> be soon . "
for some time after she had heard the street door close behind him honora remained where she was , staring into the fire , and then she crossed the room to a reading lamp , and turned it up .
some one spoke in the doorway .
" mr. grainger , madam . "
before she could rouse herself and recover from her astonishment , the gentleman himself appeared , blinking as though the vision of her were too bright to be steadily gazed at .
if the city had been searched , it is doubtful whether a more striking contrast to the man who had just left could have been found than <name> grainger in the <unk> , grey <unk> that clung to the semblance of a waist he still possessed .
in him hyde park and fifth avenue , so to speak , shook hands across the sea : put him in either , and he would have appeared indigenous .
" <name> you 'll forgive my comin ' 'round on such slight acquaintance , mrs. spence , " said he .
" could n't resist the opportunity to pay my respects .
shorter told me where you were . "
" that was very good of mr .
shorter , " said honora , whose surprise had given place to a very natural resentment , since she had not the honour of knowing mrs. grainger .
" oh , " said mr. grainger , " shorter 's a good sort .
said he 'd been here himself to see how you were fixed , and had n't found you in .
uncommonly well fixed , i should say , " he added , glancing around the room with undisguised approval .
" why the deuce did she furnish it , since she's gone to <name> to live with rindge ? "
" i suppose you mean mrs. rindge , " said honora .
" she did n't furnish it . "
mr. grainger winked at her rapidly , like a man suddenly brought face to face with a mystery .
" oh ! "
he replied , as though he had solved it .
the solution came a few moments later .
" it 's ripping ! "
he said .
" farwell could n't have done it any better . "
honora laughed , and momentarily forgot her resentment .
" <name> you have tea ? "
she asked .
" oh , do n't sit down there ! "
" why not ? "
he asked , jumping .
it was the chair that had held <name> , and mr. grainger examined the seat as though he suspected a bent pin .
" because , " said honora , " because it is n't comfortable .
pull up that other one . "
again mystified , he did as he was told .
she remembered his reputation for going to sleep , and wondered whether she had been wise in her second choice .
but it soon became apparent that mr. grainger , as he gazed at her from among the cushions , had no intention of dozing , his eyelids reminded her of the shutters of a camera , and she had the feeling of sitting for thousands of instantaneous photographs for his benefit .
she was by turns annoyed , amused , and <unk> : <name> was leaving his hotel ; now he was taking the train .
was he thinking of her ?
he had said he was glad she was happy !
she caught herself up with a start after one of these silences to realize that mr. grainger was making unwonted and indeed pathetic exertions to entertain her , and it needed no feminine eye to perceive that he was thoroughly uncomfortable .
she had , unconsciously and in thinking of <name> , rather overdone the note of rebuke of his visit .
and honora was , above all else , an artist .
his air was distinctly apologetic as he rose , perhaps a little mortified , like that of a man who has got into the wrong house .
" i very much fear i 've intruded , mrs. spence , " he stammered , and he was winking now with bewildering rapidity .
" we  we had such a pleasant drive together that day to <unk>  i was tempted  " " we did have a good time , " she agreed .
" and it has been a pleasure to see you again . "
thus , in the kindness of her heart , she assisted him to cover his retreat , for it was a strange and somewhat awful experience to see mr. <name> grainger <unk> .
he glanced again , as he went out , at the chair in which he had been forbidden to sit .
she went to the piano , played over a few bars of <unk> , and dropped her hands listlessly .
cross currents of the strange events of the day flowed through her mind : <name> 's arrival and its odd <unk> , and the discomfort of mr. grainger .
<name> came in .
he did not see her under the shaded lamp , and she sat watching him with a curious feeling of detachment as he unfolded his newspaper and sank , with a sigh of content , into the cushioned chair which mr. grainger had vacated .
was it fancy that her husband 's physical attributes had changed since he had attained his new position of dignity ?
she could have sworn that he had visibly swollen on the evening when he had announced to her his promotion , and he seemed to have remained swollen .
not bloated , of course : he was fatter , and  if possible <unk> .
but there was a growing suggestion in him of <unk> greatness .
if there  were leisure in this <unk> chronicle for what might be called <unk> , the dinner that honora had given to some of her quicksands friends might be described .
suffice it to recall , with honora , that <name> dallam , with a sure instinct , had put the finger of her wit on this new attribute of <name> 's .
" you 'll kill me , <name> ! "
she had cried .
" he even looks at the soup as though he were examining a security ! "
needless to say , it did not cure him , although it sealed <name> <unk> fate  and incidentally that of quicksands .
honora 's thoughts as she sat now at the piano watching him , flew back unexpectedly to the summer at silverdale when she had met him , and she tried to imagine , the genial and boyish representative of finance that he was then .
in the midst of this effort he looked up and discovered her .
" what are you doing over there , honora ? "
he asked .
" thinking , " she answered .
" that 's a great way to treat a man when he comes home after a day's work . "
" i beg your pardon , <name> , " she said with unusual meekness .
" who do you think was here this afternoon ? "
" <name> ?
i 've just come from mr. wing 's house  he has gout to-day and did n't go down town .
he offered <name> a hundred thousand a year to come to new york as corporation counsel .
and if you 'll believe me  he refused it . "
" i 'll believe you , " she said .
" did he say anything about it to you ? "
" he simply mentioned that mr. wing asked him to come to new york .
he did n't say why . "
" well , " <name> remarked , " he 's one too many for me .
he ca n't be making over thirty thousand where he is . "
chapter ii .
the path of philanthropy mrs. <name> grainger may safely have been called a personality , and one of the proofs of this was that she haunted people who had never seen her .
honora might have looked at her , it is true , on the memorable night of the dinner with mrs. holt and trixton <name> ; but  for sufficiently obvious reasons  refrained .
it would be an exaggeration to say that mrs. grainger became an <unk> with our heroine ; yet it can not be denied that , since honora 's arrival at quicksands , this <name> had , in increasing degrees , been the subject of her speculations .
the threads of mrs. grainger 's influence were so <unk> , indeed , as to be found in mrs. dallam , who declared she was the rudest woman in new york and yet had copied her brougham ; in mr. cuthbert and trixton <name> ; in mrs. kame ; in mrs. holt , who proclaimed her a tower of strength in charities ; and lastly in mr. grainger himself , who , although he did not spend much time in his wife 's company , had for her an admiration that amounted to awe .
<name> grainger , who was at once modern and <unk> conservative , might have been likened to some of the <name> matrons of the aristocracy in the last years of the republic .
her family , the <unk> , had traditions : so , for that matter , had the <unk> .
but senator <unk> , antique <unk> <unk> et <unk> , had been a <name> of the old school who would have preferred exile after the battle of philippi ; and who , could he have foreseen modern new york and modern finance , would have been more content to die when he did .
he had lived in washington square .
his daughter inherited his executive ability , many of his prejudices ( as they would now be called ) , and his habit of regarding favourable impressions with profound suspicion .
she had never known the necessity of making friends : hers she had inherited , and for some reason specially decreed , they were better than those of less fortunate people .
mrs. grainger was very tall .
and sargent , in his portrait of her , had caught with admirable <name> the indefinable , yet partly <unk> and scornful smile with which she looked down upon the world about her .
she possessed the rare gift of combining <unk> with personal distinction in her dress .
her hair was almost titian red in colour , and her face ( on the authority of mr. <name> farwell ) was at once modern and italian renaissance .
not the languid , <unk> renaissance , but the <name> of decision who chose , and did not wait to be chosen .
her eyes had all the colours of the <unk> , and her regard was so baffling as to arouse intense antagonism in those who were not her friends .
to honora , groping about for a better and a higher life , the path of philanthropy had more than once suggested itself .
and on the day of <name> 's visit to new york , when she had lunched with mrs. holt , she had signified her willingness ( now that she had come to live in town ) to join the working girls ' relief society .
mrs. holt , needless to say , was overjoyed : they were to have a meeting at her house in the near future which honora must not fail to attend .
it was not , however , without a feeling of trepidation natural to a stranger that she made her way to that meeting when the afternoon arrived .
no sooner was she seated in mrs. holt 's drawing-room  filled with <unk> for the occasion  than she found herself listening breathlessly to a recital of personal experiences by a young woman who worked in a <unk> on the east side .
honora 's heart was soft : her sympathies , as we know , easily aroused .
and after the young woman had told with great simplicity and earnestness of the struggle to support herself and lead an honest and self-respecting existence , it seemed to honora that at last she had opened the book of life at the proper <name> .
afterwards there were questions , and a report by miss <unk> , a middle-aged <name> with glasses who was the secretary .
honora looked around her .
the membership of the society , judging by those present , was surely of a sufficiently heterogeneous character to satisfy even the catholic tastes of her hostess .
there were elderly ladies , some benevolent and some formidable , some <unk> and others unadorned ; there were <unk> younger women , to whom dress was evidently a secondary consideration ; and there was a sprinkling of others , perfectly <unk> , several of whom were gathered in an opposite corner .
<unk> eyes , as the reading of the report progressed , were drawn by a continual and resistless attraction to this group ; or rather to the face of one of the women in it , which seemed to stare out at her like the eat in the tree of an old-fashioned picture puzzle , or the <unk> of <name> washington among a mass of boulders on a <name> .
once one has discovered it , one can see nothing else .
in vain honora dropped her eyes ; some strange fascination compelled her to raise them again until they met those of the other woman : did their glances meet ?
she could never quite be sure , so disconcerting were the lights in that regard  lights , seemingly , of laughter and mockery .
some instinct informed honora that the woman was mrs. grainger , and immediately the scene in the holland house dining-room came back to her .
never until now had she felt the full horror of its comedy .
and then , as though to fill the cup of humiliation , came the thought of <name> grainger 's call .
she longed , in an agony with which sensitive natures <name> sympathize , for the reading to be over .
the last paragraph of the report contained <unk> to mrs. <name> holt and mrs. <name> grainger for the work each had done during the year , and amidst enthusiastic <unk> the formal part of the meeting came to an end .
the servants were entering with tea as honora made her way towards the door , where she was stopped by <name> holt .
" my dear honora , " cried mrs. holt , who had hurried after her daughter , " you 're not going ? "
honora suddenly found herself without an excuse .
" i really ought to , mrs. holt .
i 've had such a good <unk> i 've been so interested .
i never realized that such things occurred .
and i 've got one of the reports , which i intend to read over again . "
" but my dear , " protested mrs. holt , " you must meet some of the members of the society .
<name> ! "
mrs. grainger , indeed  for honora had been right in her surmise  was standing within <unk> of this conversation .
and honora , who knew she was there , could not help feeling that she took a rather <unk> interest in it .
at mrs. holt 's words she turned .
" <name> , i 've found a new recruit  one that i can answer for , mrs. spence , whom i spoke to you about . "
mrs. grainger bestowed upon honora her <unk> smile .
" oh , " she declared , " i 've heard of mrs. spence from other sources , and i 've seen her , too . "
honora grew a fiery red .
there was obviously no answer to such a remark , which seemed the <unk> of rudeness .
but mrs. grainger continued to smile , and to stare at her with the air of trying to solve a riddle .
" i 'm coming to see you , if i may , " she said .
" i 've been intending to since i 've been in town , but i 'm always so busy that i do n't get time to do the things i want to do . "
an announcement that fairly took away honora 's breath .
she managed to express her appreciation of mrs. grainger 's intention , and presently found herself walking rapidly <unk> through swirling snow , somewhat dazed by the events of the afternoon .
and these , by the way , were not yet finished .
as she reached her own door , a voice vaguely familiar called her name .
" honora ! "
she turned .
the slim , tall figure of a young woman descended from a carriage and crossed the pavement , and in the soft light of the vestibule she recognized <name> wing .
" i 'm so glad i caught you , " said that young <name> when they entered the drawing-room .
and she gazed at her school friend .
the colour glowed in honora 's cheeks , but health alone could not account for the <name> in her eyes .
" why , you look radiant .
you are more beautiful than you were at sutcliffe .
is it marriage ? "
honora laughed happily , and they sat down side by side on the lounge behind the tea table .
" i heard you 'd married , " said <name> , " but i did n't know what had become of you until the other day .
<name> never tells me anything .
it appears that he 's seen something of you .
but it was n't from <name> that i heard about you first .
you 'd never guess who told me you were here . "
" who ? "
asked honora , curiously .
" mr .
<name> . "
" <name> <name> ! "
" i 'm perfectly shameless , " proclaimed <name> wing .
" i 've lost my heart to him , and i do n't care who knows it .
why in the world did n't you marry him ? "
" but  where did you see him ? "
honora demanded as soon as she could command herself sufficiently to speak .
her voice must have sounded odd .
<name> did not appear to notice that .
" he lunched with us one day when father had gout .
did n't he tell you about it ?
he said he was coming to see you that afternoon . "
" yes  he came .
but he did n't mention being at lunch at your house . "
" i 'm sure that was like him , " declared her friend .
and for the first time in her life honora experienced a twinge of that <unk> ailment  jealousy .
how did <name> know what was like him ?
" i made father give him up for a little while after lunch , and he talked about you the whole time .
but he was most interesting at the table , " continued <name> , <unk> unconscious of the lack of compliment in the comparison ; " as <name> would say , he fairly wiped up the ground with father , and it isn't an easy thing to do . "
" wiped up the ground with mr .
wing ! "
honora repeated .
" oh , in a delightfully quiet , humorous way .
that 's what made it so effective .
i could n't understand all of it ; but i grasped enough to enjoy it hugely .
father 's so used to bullying people that it 's become second nature with him .
i 've seen him lay down the law to some of the biggest lawyers in new york , and they took it like little lambs .
he caught a tartar in mr. <name> .
i did n't dare to laugh , but i wanted to . "
" what was the discussion about ? "
asked honora .
" i 'm not sure that i can give you a very clear idea of it , " said <name> .
" generally speaking , it was about modern trust methods , and what a self-respecting lawyer would do and what he would n't .
father took the ground that the laws were n't logical , and that they were different and conflicting , anyway , in different states .
he said they impeded the natural development of business , and that it was justifiable for the great legal brains of the country to devise means by which these laws could be eluded .
he did n't quite say that , but he meant it , and he honestly believes it .
the manner in which mr. <name> <unk> it was a revelation to me .
i 've been thinking about it since .
you see , i 'd never heard that side of the argument .
mr. <name> said , in the nicest way possible , but very firmly , that a lawyer who hired himself out to enable one man to take advantage of another <unk> his talents : that the brains of the legal profession were out of politics in these days , and that it was almost impossible for the men in the <unk> to frame laws that could n't be evaded by clever and unscrupulous devices .
he cited ever so many cases ... . " <name> 's voice became indistinct , as though some one had shut a door in front of it .
honora was trembling on the brink of a discovery : holding herself back from it , as one who has climbed a fair mountain <unk> from the lip of an unsuspected crater at sight of the lazy , sulphurous fumes .
all the years of her marriage , ever since she had first heard his name , the stature of <name> wing had been insensibly growing , and the vastness of his empire gradually disclosed .
she had lived in that empire : in it his word had stood for authority , his genius had been worshipped , his decrees had been absolute .
she had met him once , in <name> 's office , when he had greeted her gruffly , and the memory of his rugged features and small red eyes , like live coals , had remained .
and she saw now the drama that had taken place before <name> 's eyes .
the capitalist , overbearing , tyrannical , hearing a few , simple truths in his own house from <name>  her <name> .
and she recalled her husband 's account of his talk with <name> wing .
<name> had refused to sell himself .
had <name> ?
many times during the days that followed she summoned her courage to ask her husband that question , and kept silence .
she did not wish to know .
" i do n't want to seem <unk> to papa , " <name> was saying .
" he is under great responsibilities to other people , to stockholders ; and he must get things done .
but oh , honora , i 'm so tired of money , money , money and its standards , and the things people are willing to do for it .
i 've seen too much . "
honora looked at her friend , and believed her .
one glance at the girl's tired eyes  a weariness somehow enhanced  in effect by the gold sheen of her hair  confirmed the truth of her words .
" you 've changed , <name> , since sutcliffe , " she said .
" yes , i 've changed , " said <name> wing , and the weariness was in her voice , too .
" i 've had too much , honora .
life was all glitter , like a christmas tree , when i left sutcliffe .
i had no heart .
i 'm not at all sure that i have one now .
i 've known all kinds of people  except the right kind .
and if i were to tell you some of the things that have happened to me in five years you would n't believe them .
money has been at the bottom of it all ,  it ruined my brother , and it has ruined me .
and then , the other day , i beheld a man whose standards simply take no account of money , a man who holds something else higher .
i  i had been groping lately , and then i seemed to see clear for the first time in my life .
but i 'm afraid it comes too late . "
honora took her friend 's hand in her own and pressed it .
" i do n't know why i 'm telling you all this , " said <name> : " it seems to-day as though i had always known you , and yet we were n't particularly intimate at school .
i suppose i 'm inclined to be <unk> .
heaven knows i 've had enough to make me so .
but i always thought that you were a little  ambitious .
you 'll forgive my frankness , honora .
i do n't think you 're at all so , now . "
she glanced at honora suddenly .
" perhaps you've changed , too , " she said .
honora nodded .
" i think i 'm changing all the time , " she replied .
after a moment 's silence , <name> wing pursued her own train of thought .
" curiously enough when he  when mr. <name> spoke of you i seemed to get a very different idea of you than the one i had always had .
i had to go out of town , but i made up my mind i 'd come to see you as soon as i got back , and ask you to tell me something about him . "
" what shall i tell you ? "
asked honora .
" he is what you think he is , and more . "
" tell me something of his early life , " said <name> wing .
... ... ... ... ... ... ...
there is a famous river in the western part of our country that disappears into a canon , the walls of which are some thousands of feet high , and the bottom so narrow that the confined waters roar through it at breakneck speed .
sometimes they disappear entirely under the rock , to emerge again below more furiously than ever .
from the river-bed can be seen , far , far above , a blue ribbon of sky .
once upon a time , not long ago , two heroes in the service of the government of the united states , whose names should be graven in the immortal rock and whose story read wherever the language is spoken , made the journey through this canon and came out alive .
that journey once started , there could be no turning back .
down and down they were <unk> by the rushing waters , over the falls and through the tunnels , with time to think only of that which would save them from immediate death , until they emerged into the sunlight of the plain below .
all of which by way of parallel .
for our own chronicle , hitherto leisurely enough , is coming to its canon  perhaps even now begins to feel the pressure of the shelving sides .
and if our heroine be somewhat rudely tossed from one boulder to another , if we fail wholly to understand her emotions and her acts , we must blame the canon .
she had , indeed , little time to think .
one evening , three weeks or so after the conversation with <name> wing just related , honora 's husband entered her room as her maid was giving the finishing touches to her toilet .
" you 're not going to wear that dress ! "
he exclaimed .
" why not ? "
she asked , without turning from the mirror .
he lighted a cigarette .
" i thought you 'd put on something handsome  to go to the <unk> ' .
and where are your jewels ?
you 'll find the women there loaded with 'em . "
" one string of pearls is all i care to wear , " said honora  a reply with which he was fain to be content until they were in the carriage , when she added : " <name> , i must ask you as a favour not to talk that way before the servants . "
" what way ? "
he demanded .
" oh , " she exclaimed , " if you do n't know i suppose it is impossible to explain .
you would n't understand . "
" i understand one thing , honora , that you 're too <unk> clever for me , " he declared .
honora did not reply .
for at that moment they <name> up at a carpet stretched across the pavement .
unlike the mansions of vast and imposing <unk> that were beginning everywhere to catch the eye on fifth avenue , and that followed mostly the continental styles of architecture , the house of the <name> <unk> had a substantial , " middle <unk> " appearance .
it stood on a corner , with a high iron fence protecting the area around it .
within , it gave one an idea of space that the exterior strangely belied ; and it was furnished , not in a french , but in what might be called a comfortably english , manner .
it was filled , honora saw , with handsome and priceless things which did not immediately and aggressively strike the eye , but which somehow gave the impression of having always been there .
what struck her , as she sat in the little withdrawing room while the maid removed her <unk> , was the note of permanence .
some of those who were present at mrs. grainger 's that evening remember her entrance into the drawing-room .
her gown , the colour of a <unk> cloud , set off the exceeding whiteness of her neck and arms and vied with the crimson in her cheeks , and the single glistening string of pearls about the slender column of her neck served as a contrast to the shadowy masses of her hair .
mr. <name> farwell , who was there , afterwards declared that she seemed to have stepped out of the gentle landscape of an old painting .
she stood , indeed , hesitating for a moment in the doorway , her eyes softly alight , in the very pose of expectancy that such a picture suggested .
honora herself was almost frightened by a sense of <unk> , of triumph , as she went forward to greet her hostess .
conversation , for the moment , had stopped .
<name> grainger , with the air of one who had pulled aside the curtain and revealed this vision of beauty and innocence , crossed the room to welcome her .
and mrs. grainger herself was not a little surprised ; she was not a dramatic person , and it was not often that her drawing-room was the scene of even a mild sensation .
no entrance could have been at once so startling and so unexceptionable as honora 's .
" i was sorry not to find you when i called , " she said .
" i was sorry , too , " replied mrs. grainger , regarding her with an interest that was undisguised , and a little embarrassing .
" i 'm scarcely ever at home , except when i 'm with the children .
do you know these people ? "
" i 'm not sure , " said honora , " but  i must introduce my husband to you . "
" how d 'ye do ! "
said mr. grainger , blinking at her when this ceremony was accomplished .
" i 'm awfully glad to see you , mrs. spence , upon my word . "
honora could not doubt it .
but he had little time to express his <name> , because of the appearance of his wife at honora 's elbow with a tall man she had summoned from a corner .
" before we go to dinner i must introduce my cousin , mr. chiltern  he is to have the pleasure of taking you out , " she said .
his name was in the class of those vaguely familiar : vaguely familiar , too , was his face .
an extraordinary face , honora thought , glancing at it as she took his arm , although she was struck by something less tangible than the unusual features .
he might have belonged to any nationality within the limits of the caucasian race .
his short , <unk> , black hair suggested great <unk> , an effect intensified by a strongly bridged nose , <unk> hands , and bushy eyebrows .
but the <unk> distinction was in the eyes that looked out from under these brows the glimpse she had of them as he bowed to her gravely , might be likened to the hasty reading of a chance <name> in a forbidden book .
her attention was arrested , her curiosity aroused .
she was on that evening , so to speak , exposed for and sensitive to impressions .
she was on the threshold of the <unk> .
" <name> has such a faculty , " complained mr. grainger , " of turning up at the wrong moment ! "
dinner was announced .
she took chiltern 's arm , and they fell into file behind a <name> in yellow , with a long train , who looked at her rather hard .
it was mrs. <name> <unk> .
her glance shifted to chiltern , and it seemed to honora that she started a little .
" hello , <name> , " she said indifferently , looking back over her shoulder ; " have you turned up again ? "
" still sticking to the same side of your horse , i see . "
he replied , ignoring the question .
" i told you you 'd get <unk> . "
the deformity , if there were any , did not seem to trouble her .
" i 'm going to <name> wednesday .
we want another man .
think it over . "
" sorry , but i 've got something else to do , " he said .
" the devil and idle hands , " retorted mrs. <unk> .
honora was sure as she could be that chiltern was angry , although he gave no visible sign of this .
it was as though the current ran from his arm into hers .
" have you been away ? "
she asked .
" it seems to me as though i had never been anywhere else , " he answered , and he glanced curiously at the guests ranging about the great , <unk> table .
they sat down .
she was a little repelled , a little piqued ; and a little relieved when the man on her other side spoke to her , and she recognized mr. <name> farwell , the architect .
the table capriciously swung that way .
she did not feel prepared to talk to mr. chiltern .
and before entering upon her <unk> she was in need of a guide .
she could have found none more charming , none more impersonal , none more subtly aware of her wants ( which had once been his ) than mr. farwell .
with his hair parted with geometrical precision from the back of his collar to his forehead , with his silky mustache and eyes of soft <name> lights , he was all things to all men and women  within reason .
he was an achievement that civilization had not hitherto produced , a combination of the <unk> arts and the jockey club and american <unk> .
he was of those upon whom labour leaves no trace .
there were preliminaries , mutually satisfactory .
to see mrs. spence was never to forget her , but more delicately intimated .
he remembered to have caught a glimpse of her at the quicksands club , and mrs. dallam nor her house were not mentioned by either .
honora could not have been in new york long .
no , it was her first <name> , and she felt like a stranger .
would mr. farwell tell her who some of these people were ?
nothing charmed mr. farwell so much as simplicity  when it was combined with personal attractions .
he did not say so , but contrived to intimate the former .
" it 's always difficult when one first comes to new york , " he declared , " but it soon straightens itself out , and one is surprised at how few people there are , after all .
we 'll begin on <name> 's right .
that 's mrs. <name> <unk> . "
" oh , yes , " said honora , looking at a tall , thin woman of middle age who wore a <name> , and whose throat was covered with jewels .
honora did not imply that mrs. <unk> 's name , and most of those that followed , were extremely familiar to her .
" in my opinion she 's got the best garden in newport , and she did most of it herself .
next to her , with the bald head , is <name> <unk> .
next to him is miss godfrey .
she 's a little eccentric , but she can afford to be  the <unk> for generations have done so much for the city .
the man with the beard , next her , is <name> <unk> , the <unk> .
that pretty woman , who 's just as nice as she looks , is mrs. <name> strange .
she was <name> <unk>  mrs. grainger 's cousin .
and the gentleman with the pink face , whom she is entertaining  " " is my husband , " said honora , smiling .
" i know something about him . "
mr. farwell laughed .
he admired her <unk> , and he did not himself change countenance .
indeed , the incident seemed rather to heighten the confidence between them .
honora was looking rather critically at <name> .
it was a fact that his face did grow red at this stage of a dinner , and she wondered what mrs .
strange found to talk to him about .
" and the woman on the other side of him ? "
she asked .
" by the way , she has a red face , too . "
" so she has , " he replied <unk> .
" that is mrs. <unk> <unk> , the greatest living rebuke to the modern woman .
most of those jewels are inherited , but she has accustomed herself by long practice to <name> them , as well as other burdens .
she has eight children , and she 's on every <name> list .
her ancestors were the very roots of <unk> .
she looks like a <unk>  does n't she ? "
" and the extraordinary looking man on my right ? "
honora asked .
" i 've got to talk to him presently . "
" chiltern ! "
he said .
" is it possible you have n't heard something about <name> chiltern ? "
" is it such lamentable ignorance ? "
she asked .
" that depends upon one 's point of view , " he replied .
" he 's always been a sort of a  well , viking , " said farwell .
honora was struck by the <unk> of the word .
" viking  yes , he looks it exactly .
i could n't think .
tell me something about him . "
" well , " he laughed , lowering his voice a little , " here goes for a little rough and ready <unk> .
one thing about chiltern that 's to be admired is that he 's never cared a rap what people think .
of course , in a way , he never had to .
his family own a section of the state , where they've had woollen mills for a hundred years , more or less .
i believe <name> chiltern has sold 'em , or they 've gone into a trust , or something , but the estate is still there , at grenoble  one of the most beautiful places i 've ever seen .
the general  this man 's father  was a violent , dictatorial man .
there is a story about his taking a battery at <unk> which is almost incredible .
but he went back to grenoble after the war , and became the typical <unk> citizen ; built up the mills which his own pioneer grandfather had founded , and all that .
he married an aunt of mrs. grainger 's ,  one of those delicate , gentle women who never dare to call their soul their own . "
" and then ? "
prompted honora , with interest .
" it 's only fair to <name> , " farwell continued , " to take his early years into account .
the general never understood him , and his mother died before he went off to school .
men who were at harvard with him say he has a brilliant mind , but he spent most of his time across the <name> river breaking things .
it was , probably , the energy the general got rid of at <unk> .
what <name> really needed was a war , and he had too much money .
he has a curious literary streak , i 'm told , and wrote a rather remarkable article  i 've forgotten just where it appeared .
he raced a yacht for a while in a <unk> , fiendish way , as one might expect ; and used to go off on <unk> and not be heard of for months .
at last he got engaged to <name> harrington  mrs. <name> <unk> . "
honora glanced across the table .
" exactly , " said mr. farwell .
" that was seven or eight years ago .
nobody ever knew the reason why she broke it  though it may have been pretty closely guessed .
he went away , and nobody 's laid eyes on him until he turned up to-night . "
honora 's innocence was not too great to enable her to read between the lines of this biography which <name> farwell had related with such praiseworthy delicacy .
it was a biography , she well knew , that , like a score of others , had been guarded as jealously as possible within the circle on the borders of which she now found herself .
mrs. grainger with her charities , mrs. <unk> <unk> with her good works , miss godfrey with her virtue  all swallowed it as gracefully as possible .
<unk> oblige .
honora had read french and english memoirs , and knew that history repeats itself .
and a biography that is printed in black letter and illuminated in gold is attractive in spite of its contents .
the contents , indeed , our heroine had not found uninteresting , and she turned now to the subject with a flutter of anticipation .
he looked at her intently , almost boldly , she thought , and before she dropped her eyes she had made a discovery .
the thing stamped upon his face and burning in his eyes was not <unk> , disappointment , despair .
she could not tell what it was , yet ; that it was none of these , she knew .
it was not unrelated to experience , but <unk> it .
there was an element of purpose in it , of determination , almost  she would have believed  of <name> .
that mrs. <unk> nor any other woman was a part of it she became equally sure .
nothing could have been more commonplace than the conversation which began , and yet it held for her , between the lines as in the biography , the thrill of interest .
she was a woman , and embarked on a voyage of discovery .
" do you live in new york ? "
he asked .
" yes , " said honora , " since this autumn . "
" i 've been away a good many years , " he said , in explanation of his question .
" i have n't quite got my bearings .
i ca n't tell you how queerly this sort of thing affects me . "
" you mean civilization ? "
she hazarded .
" yes .
and yet i 've come back to it . "
of course she did not ask him why .
their talk was like the starting of a heavy train  a series of jerks ; and yet both were aware of an irresistible forward traction .
she had not recovered from her surprise in finding herself already so far in his confidence .
" and the time <name> come , i suppose , when you 'll long to get away again . "
" no , " he said , " i 've come back to stay .
it 's taken me a long while to learn it , but there 's only one place for a man , and that 's his own country . "
her eyes lighted .
" there 's always so much for a man to do . "
" what would you do ? "
he asked curiously .
she considered this .
" if you had asked me that question two years ago  even a year ago  i should have given you a different answer .
it 's taken me some time to learn it , too , you see , and i 'm not a man .
i once thought i should have liked to have been a king amongst money <unk> , and own railroad and steamship lines , and <unk> men by sheer power . "
he was clearly interested .
" and now ? "
he prompted her .
she laughed a little , to relieve the tension .
" well  i 've found out that there are some men that kind of power can't control  the best kind .
and i 've found out that that is n't the best kind of power .
it seems to be a brutal , barbarous cunning power now that i've seen it at close range .
there 's another kind that springs from a man himself , that speaks through his works and acts , that influences first those around him , and then his community , convincing people of their own folly , and that finally spreads in ever widening circles to those whom he can not see , and never <name> see . "
she paused , breathing deeply , a little frightened at her own eloquence .
something told her that she was not only addressing her own soul  she was speaking to his .
" i 'm afraid you 'll think i 'm preaching , " she apologized .
" no , " he said impatiently , " no . "
" to answer your question , then , if i were a man of independent means , i think i should go into politics .
and i should put on my first campaign banner the words , 'no compromise . ' "
it was a little strange that , until now  <unk> had not definitely <unk> these ambitions .
the idea of the banner with its inscription had come as an inspiration .
he did not answer , but sat regarding her , drumming on the cloth with his strong , brown fingers .
" i have learned this much in new york , " she said , carried on by her impetus , " that men and women are like plants .
to be useful , and to grow properly , they must be firmly rooted in their own soil .
this city seems to me like a luxurious , overgrown hothouse .
of course , " she added hastily , " there are many people who belong here , and whose best work is done here .
i was thinking about those whom it attracts .
and i have seen so many who are only watered and fed and warmed , and who become  distorted . "
" it 's extraordinary , " replied chiltern , slowly , " that you should say this to me .
it is what i have come to believe , but i could n't have said it half so well . "
mrs. grainger gave the signal to rise .
honora took chiltern 's arm , and he led her back to the drawing-room .
she was standing alone by the fire when mrs. <unk> approached her .
" have n't i seen you before ? "
she asked .
chapter iii .
<unk> it was a pleasant newport to which honora went early in <name> , a fair city shining in the midst of summer seas , a place to light the fires of imagination .
it wore at once an air of age , and of a new and sparkling unreality .
honora found in the very atmosphere a certain magic which she did not try to define , but to the enjoyment of which she abandoned herself ; and in those first days after her arrival she took a sheer delight in driving about the island .
narrow thames street , crowded with <name> carriages , with its aspect of the eighteenth and it shops of the twentieth century ; the whiffs of the sea ; <unk> avenue , with its glorious <unk> ranks of trees , its erring perfumes from bright gardens , its massed flowering shrubs beckoning the eye , its lawns of a truly enchanted green .
through tree and hedge , as she drove , came ever changing glimpses of gleaming palace fronts ; glimpses that made her turn and look again ; that stimulated but did not satisfy , and left a pleasant longing for something on the seeming verge of fulfilment .
the very stillness and solitude that seemed to envelop these palaces suggested the <unk> 's wand .
to-morrow , perhaps , the perfect lawns where the <unk> hopped amidst the shrubbery would become again the <unk> , <unk> new england pasture above the sea , and screaming gulls circle where now the swallows hovered about the steep blue roof of a french chateau .
hundreds of years hence , would these great pleasure houses still be standing behind their screens and walls and hedges ?
or would , indeed , the shattered , <unk> marble of a balustrade alone <name> the crumbling terraces whence once the fabled owners scanned the sparkling waters of the ocean ?
who could say ?
the onward rush of our story between its canon walls compels us reluctantly to skip the narrative of the <name> conquests of the <name> who is our heroine .
popularity had not spoiled her , and the best proof of this lay in the comments of a world that is nothing if not critical .
no beauty could have received with more modesty the triumph which had greeted her at mrs. <unk> 's <unk> , in <name> , when she had appeared as <unk> , in an architectural frame especially designed by mr. farwell himself .
there had been a moment of hushed astonishment , followed by an <unk> that sent the curtain up twice again .
we must try to imagine , too , the logical continuation of that triumph in the <unk> of our modern republic and empire , newport .
open , <unk> !
seems , as ever , to be the <unk> of her life .
even the palace gates swung wide to her : most of them with the more readiness because she had already passed through other gates  mrs. grainger 's , for instance .
<unk> , apparently , is a <unk> world in which , if one alights upside down , it is difficult to become righted .
to alight upside down , is to alight in a palace .
the <unk> did not live in one , but in a garden that existed before the palaces were , and one that the palace owners could not copy : a garden that three generations of <unk> , somewhat assisted by a remarkable climate , had made with loving care .
the box was priceless , the spreading trees in the miniature park no less so , and time , the <unk> , alone could now have produced the wide , carefully cherished victorian mansion .
likewise not <unk> by california gold was a grandfather whose name had been written large in the pages of american history .
his library was now lined with english sporting prints ; but these , too , were old and mellow and rare .
to reach honora 's cottage , you turned away from the pomp and glitter and noise of <unk> avenue into the inviting tunnel of a leafy <name> that presently stopped of itself .
as though to provide against the contingency of a stray <unk> , a <unk> guard of old lilac trees massed themselves before the house , and seemed to look down with contempt on the new brick wall across the <name> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> ' .
it was on account of the new brick wall , in fact , that honora , through the intervention of mrs. grainger and mrs .
shorter , had been able to obtain this most desirable of retreats , which belonged to a <unk> of miss godfrey , mrs. <unk> .
mr. chamberlin , none other than he of whom we caught a glimpse some years ago in a castle near silverdale , owned the wall and the grounds and the palace it enclosed .
this gentleman was of those who arrive in newport upside down ; and was even now , with the somewhat doubtful assistance of his wife , making lavish and pathetic attempts to right himself .
newport had never forgiven him for the <unk> of a mansion and the <unk> of trees which had been landmarks , and for the driving out of mrs. <unk> .
the mere sight of the modern wall had been too much for this <name>  the lilacs and the leaves in the <name> mercifully hid the palace  and after five and thirty peaceful summers she had moved out , and let the cottage .
it was furnished with delightful old-fashioned things that seemed to express , at every turn , the aristocratic and uncompromising personality of the owner who had lived so long in their midst .
mr. chamberlin , who has nothing whatever to do with this chronicle except to have been the indirect means of honora 's installation , used to come through the wall once a week or so to sit for half an hour on her porch as long as he ever sat anywhere .
he had reddish <unk> , and he reminded her of a buzzing toy locomotive wound up tight and suddenly taken from the floor .
she caught glimpses of him sometimes in the mornings buzzing around his gardeners , his painters , his carpenters , and his grooms .
he would buzz the rest of his life , but nothing short of a revolution could take his possessions away .
the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> might move mountains , but not mr. chamberlin 's house .
whatever <unk> he may have had because certain people refused to come to his balls , he was in newport to remain .
he would sit under the battlements until the crack of doom ; or rather  and more appropriate in mr. chamberlin 's case  walk around them and around , blowing trumpets until they <unk> .
honora magically found herself within them , and without a siege .
behold her at last in the setting for which we always felt she was destined .
why is it , in this world , that realization is so difficult a thing ?
now that she is there , how shall we proceed to give the joys of her elysium their full value ?
not , certainly , by repeating the word pleasure over and over again : not by describing the palaces at which she lunched and danced and dined , or the bright waters in which she bathed , or the yachts in which she sailed .
during the week , indeed , she moved <unk> in a world with which she found herself in perfect <name> : it was new , it was dazzling , it was unexplored .
during the week it possessed still another and more valuable attribute  it was real .
and she , honora leffingwell spence , was part and parcel of its permanence .
the life relationships of the people by whom she was surrounded became her own .
she had little time for thought  during the week .
we are dealing , now , in emotions as delicate as cloud shadows , and these <name> on as saturday approached .
on saturdays and sundays the quality and texture of life seemed to undergo a change .
who does not recall the monday mornings of the school days of youth , and the indefinite feeling betwixt sleep and waking that to-day would not be as yesterday or the day before ?
on saturday mornings , when she went downstairs , she was wont to find the porch littered with newspapers and her husband lounging in a wicker chair behind the <unk> lilacs .
although they had long ceased to bloom , their colour was purple  his was pink .
honora did not at first analyze or define these emotions , and was conscious only of a stirring within her , and a change .
reality became unreality .
the house in which she lived , and for which she felt a passion of ownership , was for two days a rented house .
other women in newport had week-end guests in the guise of husbands , and some of them went so far as to <unk> the fact .
some had got rid of them .
honora kissed hers <unk> , and picked up the newspapers , drove him to the beach , and took him out to dinner , where he talked <unk> of finance .
on <name> night he departed , without visible regrets , for new york .
one monday morning a storm was raging over newport .
seized by a sudden whim , she rang her <name> , breakfasted at an unusual hour , and nine o'clock found her , with her skirts flying , on the road above the cliffs that leads to the fort .
the wind had increased to a <name> , and as she stood on the rocks the harbour below her was full of tossing white yachts straining at their anchors .
serene in the midst of all this hubbub lay a great grey battleship .
presently , however , her thoughts were distracted by the sight of something moving rapidly across her line of vision .
a sloop yacht , with a ridiculously shortened sail , was coming in from the narrows , <unk> before the wind like a frightened bird .
she watched its approach in a sort of fascination , for of late she had been upon the water enough to realize that the feat of which she was witness was not without its difficulties .
as the sloop <name> nearer she made out a bare-headed figure bent <unk> at the wheel , and four others clinging to the yellow deck .
in a flash the boat had rounded to , the mainsail fell , and a veil of spray hid the actors of her drama .
when it cleared the yacht was tugging like a wild thing at its anchor .
that night was mrs. <unk> 's ball , and many times in later years has the scene come back to honora .
it was not a large ball , by no means on the scale of mr. chamberlin 's , for instance .
the great room reminded one of the gallery of a <name> french chateau , with its <unk> ceiling , in the oval of which the colours of a pastoral fresco glowed in the <name> lights of the heavy chandeliers ; its grey <unk> , hidden here and there by tapestries , and its series of deep , arched windows that gave glimpses of a <unk> terrace .
out there , beyond a marble balustrade , the lights of fishing schooners tossed on a blue-black ocean .
the same ocean on which she had looked that morning , and which she heard now , in the intervals of talk and laughter , crashing against the cliffs ,  although the wind had gone down .
like a woman stirred to the depths of her being , its bosom was heaving still at the memory of the passion of the morning .
this night after the storm was capriciously mild , the <name> gown of heaven <unk> with stars .
the music had ceased , and supper was being served at little tables on the terrace .
the conversation was <unk> .
" who is that with <name> farwell ? "
<name> wing asked .
" it 's the <unk> girl , " replied mr. cuthbert , whose business it was to know everybody .
" chicago wheat .
she looks like ceres , does n't she ?
quite becoming to <name> 's dark beauty .
she was sixteen , they tell me , when the old gentleman emerged from the pit , and they packed her off to a convent by the next steamer .
<name> may have the blissful experience of living in one of his own houses if he marries her . "
the fourth at the table was <name> carrington , who had been first secretary at an embassy , and he had many stories to tell of ambassadors who spoke commercial american and asked royalties after their wives .
some one had said about him that he was the only edition of the <unk> de <unk> that included the united states .
he somewhat resembled a golden seal emerging from a cold bath , and from time to time screwed an <unk> into his eye and made a careful survey of mrs. <unk> 's guests .
" by <name> ! "
he exclaimed .
" is n't that <name> chiltern ? "
honora started , and followed the direction of mr. carrington 's glance .
at sight of him , a vivid memory of the man 's personality possessed her .
" yes , " cuthbert was saying , " that 's chiltern sure enough .
he came in on dicky farnham 's yacht this morning from new york . "
" this morning ! "
said <name> wing .
" surely not !
no yacht could have come in this morning . "
" nobody but chiltern would have brought one in , you mean , " he corrected her .
" he sailed her .
they say dicky was half dead with fright , and wanted to put in anywhere .
chiltern sent him below and kept right on .
he has a devil in him , i believe .
by the way , that 's dicky <unk> <unk> he 's talking to  <name> .
she keeps her good looks , does n't she ?
what 's happened to rindge ? "
" left him on the other side , i hear , " said carrington .
" perhaps <unk> take chiltern next .
she looked as though she were ready to .
and they say it 's easier every time . "
" c'est <name> second <name> qui <unk> , " <unk> cuthbert , tossing his cigar over the balustrade .
the strains of a waltz floated out of the windows , the groups at the tables broke up , and the <unk> began .
as honora danced , chiltern remained in the back of her mind , or rather an indefinite impression was there which in flashes she connected with him .
she wondered , at times , what had become of him , and once or twice she caught herself scanning the bewildering , shifting sheen of gowns and jewels for his face .
at last she saw him by the windows , holding a favour in his hand , coming in her direction .
she looked away , towards the red uniforms of the hungarian band on the raised platform at the end of the room .
he was standing beside her .
" do you remember me , mrs .
spence ? "
he asked .
she glanced up at him and smiled .
he was not a person one would be likely to forget , but she did not say so .
" i met you at mrs. <unk> 's , " was what she said .
he handed her the favour .
she placed it amongst the collection at the back of her chair and rose , and they danced .
was it dancing ?
the music throbbed ; nay , the musicians seemed suddenly to have been carried out of themselves , and played as they had not played before .
her veins were filled with pulsing fire as she was swung , guided , carried out of herself by the extraordinary <unk> of the man who held her .
she had tasted mastery .
" thank you , " she faltered , as they came around the second time to her seat .
he released her .
" i stayed to dance with you , " he said .
" i had to await my opportunity . "
" it was kind of you to remember me , " she replied , as she went off with mr. carrington .
a moment later she saw him bidding good night to his hostess .
his face , she thought , had not lost that strange look of determination that she recalled .
and yet  how account for his recklessness ?
" rum chap , chiltern , " remarked carrington .
" he might be almost anything , if he only knew it . "
in the morning , when she awoke , her eye fell on the <unk> favours scattered over the lounge .
one amongst them stood out  a <unk> <unk> .
honora arose , picked it up <unk> , stared at it awhile , and smiled .
then she turned to her window , breathing in the perfumes , gazing out through the <unk> leaves at the green , <unk> lawn below .
on her breakfast tray , amidst some invitations , was a letter from her .
uncle .
this she opened first .
" dear honora , " he wrote , " amongst your father 's papers , which have been in my possession since his death , was a certificate for three hundred shares in a land company .
he bought them for very little , and i had always thought them worthless .
it turns out that these <unk> are in a part of the state of texas that is now being developed ; on the advice of mr. <unk> and others i have accepted an offer of thirty dollars a share , and i enclose a draft on new york for nine thousand dollars .
i need not dwell upon the pleasure it is for me to send you this legacy from your father .
and i shall only add the counsel of an old uncle , to invest this money by your husband 's advice in some safe securities . " ...
honora put down the letter , and sat staring at the cheque in her hand .
nine thousand dollars  and her own !
her first impulse was to send it back to her uncle .
but that would be , she knew , to hurt his feelings  he had taken such a pride in handing her this inheritance .
she read the letter again , and resolved that she would not ask <name> to invest the money .
this , at least , should be her very own , and she made up her mind to take it to a bank in thames street that morning .
while she was still under the influence of the excitement aroused by the unexpected legacy , mrs .
shorter came in , a <name> with whom <unk> intimacy had been of steady growth .
the tie between them might perhaps have been described as intellectual , for <name> shorter professed only to like people who were " worth while . "
she lent honora french plays , discussed them with her , and likewise a wider range of literature , including certain brightly bound books on evolution and <unk> .
in the eighteenth century , mrs .
shorter would have had a title and a salon in the <unk> : in the twentieth , she was the wife of a most fashionable and successful real estate agent in new york , and was aware of no <unk> .
<unk> was the last thing that could be said of her ; she was as ready as a <name> sand to discuss the whole range of human emotions ; which she did many times a week with certain gentlemen of intellectual bent who had the habit of calling on her .
she had never , to the knowledge of her acquaintances , been shocked .
but while she believed that a great love carried , mysteriously concealed in its flame , its own pardon , she had through some fifteen years of married life remained faithful to <name> shorter : who was not , to say the least , a <unk> or a <name> .
although she had had nervous prostration and was thirty-four , she was <unk> pretty .
she was of the suggestive , and not the <unk> type , and the secret of her strength with the other sex was that she was in the habit of submitting her opinions for their approval .
" my dear , " she said to honora , " you may thank heaven that you are still young enough to look beautiful in <unk> .
how far have you got ?
have you guessed of which woman <unk> was the lover ?
and is n't it the most exciting play you 've ever read ?
<name> carrington saw it in <name> , and declares it frightened him into being good for a whole week ! "
" oh , <name> , " exclaimed honora , apologetically , " i have n't read a word of it . "
mrs .
shorter glanced at the pile of favours .
" how was the dance ? "
she asked .
" i was too tired to go .
<name> chiltern offered to take me . "
" i saw mr. chiltern there .
i met him last <name> at the <unk> ' . "
" he 's staying with us , " said mrs .
shorter ; " you know he 's a sort of cousin of <name> 's , and devoted to him .
he turned up yesterday morning on dicky farnham 's yacht , in the midst of all that storm .
it appears that dicky met him in new york , and <name> said he was coming up here , and dicky offered to sail him up .
when the storm broke they were just outside , and all on board lost their heads , and <name> took charge and sailed in .
dicky told me that himself . "
" then it was n't  recklessness , " said honora , involuntarily .
but mrs .
shorter did not appear to be surprised by the remark .
" that 's what everybody thinks , of course , " she answered .
" they say that he had a chance to run in somewhere , and <unk> dicky into keeping on for newport at the risk of their lives .
they do <name> an injustice .
he might have done that some years ago , but he 's changed . "
curiosity got the better of honora .
" changed ? "
she repeated .
" of course you did n't know him in the old days , honora , " said mrs .
shorter .
" you would n't recognize him now .
i 've seen a good deal of men , but he is the most interesting and astounding transformation i 've ever known . "
" how ? "
asked honora .
she was sitting before the glass , with her hand raised to her hair .
mrs .
shorter appeared puzzled .
" that 's what interests me , " she said .
" my dear , do n't you think life tremendously interesting ?
i do .
i wish i could write a novel .
between ourselves , i 've tried .
i had mr. <unk> send it to a publisher , who said it was clever , but had no plot .
if i only could get a plot ! "
honora laughed .
" how would i the transformation of mr. chiltern ' do , <name> ? "
" if i only knew what 's happened to him , and how he 's going to end ! "
sighed mrs .
shorter .
" you were saying , " said honora , for her friend seemed to have relapsed into a contemplation of this problem , " you were saying that he had changed . "
" he goes away for seven years , and he suddenly turns up filled with ambition and a purpose in life , something he had never dreamed of .
he's been at grenoble , where the chiltern estate is , making improvements and preparing to settle down there .
and he 's actually getting ready to write a life of his father , the general  that 's the most surprising thing !
they never met but to strike fire while the general was alive .
it appears that <name> and <name> grainger and one or two other people have some of the old gentleman 's letters , and that 's the reason why <unk> come to newport .
and the strangest thing about it , my dear , " added mrs .
shorter , <unk> , " is that i do n't think it 's a love affair . "
honora laughed again .
it was the first time she had ever heard mrs .
shorter attribute unusual human phenomena to any other source .
" he wrote <name> that he was coming back to live on the estate ,  from england .
and he was n't there a week .
i ca n't think where he 's seen any women  that is , " mrs .
shorter corrected herself hastily , " of his own class .
he 's been in the jungle  <name> , africa , cores .
that was after <name> harrington broke the engagement .
and i 'm positive he 's not still in love with <name> .
she lunched with me yesterday , and i watched him .
oh , i should have known it .
but <name> has n't got over it .
it was n't a grand passion with <name> .
i do n't believe he 's ever had such a thing .
not that he is n't capable of it  on the contrary , he 's one of the few men i can think of who is . "
at this point in the conversation honora thought that her curiosity had gone far enough .
chapter iv .
the viking she was returning on foot from the bank in thames street , where she had deposited her legacy , when she met him who had been the subject of her conversation with mrs .
shorter .
and the encounter seemed  and was  the most natural thing in the world .
she did not stop to ask herself why it was so fitting that the viking should be a part of <unk> : why his coming should have given it the one and final needful touch .
for that designation of <name> farwell 's had come back to her .
despite the fact that <name> chiltern had with such apparent resolution set his face towards literature and the tillage of the land , it was as the viking still that her imagination pictured him .
by these tokens we may perceive that this faculty of our heroine 's has been at work , and her canvas already sketched in .
whether by design or accident he was at the leafy entrance of her <name> she was not to know .
she spied him standing there ; and in her leisurely approach a strange conceit of <unk> possessed her , and she smiled at the contrast thus summoned up .
despite the jingling harnesses of <unk> avenue and the background of mr. chamberlin 's palace wall ; despite the straw hat and white trousers and blue <unk> <unk> coat in which he was <unk> arrayed , he was the sea fighter still  of all the ages .
m. <unk> <unk> , who had won an empire for <name> , had just such a head .
their greeting , too , was conventional enough , and he turned and walked with her up the <name> , and halted before the lilacs .
" you have mrs. <unk> 's house , " he said .
" how well i remember it !
my mother used to bring me here years ago . "
" wo n't you come in ? "
asked honora , gently .
he seemed to have forgotten her as they mounted in silence to the porch , and she watched him with curious feelings as he gazed about him , and peered through the windows into the drawing-room .
" it 's just as it was , " he said .
" even the furniture .
i 'm glad you have n't moved it .
they used to sit over there in the corner , and have tea on the <name> table .
and it was always <unk> as it is now .
i can see them .
they wore dresses with wide skirts and <unk> , and queer low collars and bonnets .
and they talked in subdued voices  unlike so many women in these days . "
she was a little surprised , and moved , by the genuine feeling with which he spoke .
" i was most fortunate to get the house , " she answered .
" and i have grown to love it .
sometimes it seems as though i had always lived here . "
" then you do n't envy that , " he said , flinging his hand towards an opening in the shrubbery which revealed a glimpse of one of the <unk> of the palace across the way .
the instinct of tradition which had been the cause of mrs. <unk> 's departure was in him , too .
he , likewise , seemed to belong to the little house as he took one of the wicker chairs .
" not , " said honora , " when i can have this . "
she was dressed in white , her background of lilac leaves .
seated on the railing , with the tip of one toe resting on the porch , she smiled down at him from under the shadows of her wide hat .
" i did n't think you would , " he declared .
" this place seems to suit you , as i imagined you .
i have thought of you often since we first met last <name> . "
" yes , " she replied hastily , " i am very happy here .
mrs .
shorter tells me you are staying with then . "
" when i saw you again last night , " he continued , ignoring her attempt to divert the stream from his channel , " i had a vivid impression as of having just left you .
have you ever felt that way about people ? "
" yes , " she admitted , and poked the toe of her boot with her parasol .
" and then i find you in this house , which has so many associations for me .
harmoniously here , " he added , " if you know what i mean .
not a newcomer , but some one who must always have been logically expected . "
she glanced at him quickly , with parted lips .
it was she who had done most of the talking at mrs. grainger 's dinner ; and the imaginative quality of mind he was now revealing was <unk> for .
she was surprised not to find it out of character .
it is a little difficult to know what she expected of him , since she did not know herself the methods , perhaps ; of the viking in longfellow 's poem .
she was aware , at least , that she had attracted him , and she was beginning to realize it was not a thing that could be done lightly .
this gave her a little flutter of fear .
" are you going to be long in newport ? "
she asked .
" i am leaving on friday , " he replied .
" it seems strange to be here again after so many years .
i find i 've got out of touch with it .
and i haven't a boat , although farnham 's been kind enough to offer me his . "
" i ca n't imagine you , somehow , without a boat , " she said , and added hastily : " mrs .
shorter was speaking of you this morning , and said that you were always on the water when you were here .
newport must have been quite different then . "
he accepted the topic , and during the remainder of his visit she succeeded in keeping the conversation in the middle ground , although she had a sense of the ultimate futility of the effort ; a sense of pressure being exerted , no matter what she said .
she presently discovered , however , that the taste for literature attributed to him which had seemed so incongruous  existed .
he spoke with a new fire when she led him that way , albeit she suspected that some of the fuel was derived from the revelation that she shared his liking for books .
as the extent of his reading became gradually disclosed , however , her feeling of inadequacy grew , and she resolved in the future to make better use of her odd moments .
on her table , in two green volumes , was the life of a massachusetts statesman that mrs .
shorter had lent her .
she picked it up after chiltern had gone .
he had praised it .
he left behind him a blurred portrait on her mind , as that of two men superimposed .
and only that morning he had had such a distinct impression of one .
it was from a consideration of this strange phenomenon , with her book lying open in her lap , that her maid aroused her to go to mrs. <unk> 's .
this was tuesday .
some of the modern inventions we deem most marvellous have been fitted for ages to man and woman .
woman , particularly , possesses for instance a kind of submarine <name> ; and , if she listens , she can at times hear it tinkling faintly .
and the following morning , wednesday , honora heard hers when she received an invitation to lunch at mrs .
shorter 's .
after a struggle , she refused , but mrs .
shorter called her up over the telephone , and she yielded .
" i 've got <name> <unk> for myself , " said <name> shorter , as she greeted honora in the hall .
" he writes those very clever things  you 've read them .
and <name> for you , " she added significantly .
the shorter cottage , though commodious , was simplicity itself .
from the <unk> <unk> where they lunched they beheld the distant sea like a lavender haze across the flats .
and honora wondered whether there were not an element of truth in what mr. <unk> said of their hostess  that she thought nothing immoral except novels with happy <unk> .
chiltern did not talk much : he looked at honora .
" <name> has got so serious , " said <name> shorter , " that sometimes i'm actually afraid of him .
you ought to have done something to be as serious as that , <name> . "
" done something ! "
" written the 'origin of species , ' or founded a new political party , or executed a coup <unk> .
half the time i 'm under the delusion that i'm entertaining a celebrity under my roof , and i wake up and it 's only <name> . "
" it 's because he looks as though he might do any of those things , " suggested mr. <unk> .
" perhaps he may . "
" oh , " said <name> shorter , " the men who do them are usually little <unk> specimens . "
honora was silent , watching chiltern .
at times the completeness of her understanding of him gave her an uncanny sensation ; and again she failed to comprehend him at all .
she felt his anger go to a white heat , but the others seemed <unk> unaware of the fact .
the arrival of coffee made a diversion .
" you and <name> may have the <unk> , honora .
i 'll take mr. <unk> into the garden . "
" i really ought to go in a few minutes , <name> , " said honora .
" what nonsense ! "
exclaimed mrs .
shorter .
" if it 's bridge at the <unk> ' , i 'll telephone and get you out of it . "
" no  " " then i do n't see where you can be going , " declared mrs .
shorter , and departed with her cavalier .
" why are you so anxious to get away ? "
asked chiltern , abruptly .
honora coloured .
" oh  did i seem so ?
<name> has such a mania for pairing people <unk> it 's quite embarrassing . "
" she was a little rash in assuming that you 'd rather talk to me , " he said , smiling .
" you were not consulted , either . "
" i was consulted before lunch , " he replied .
" you mean  ? "
" i mean that i wanted you , " he said .
she had known it , of course .
the submarine <name> had told her .
and he could have found no woman in newport who would have brought more enthusiasm to his aid than <name> shorter .
" and you usually  get what you want , " she retorted with a spark of rebellion .
" yes , " he admitted .
" only hitherto i have n't wanted very desirable things . "
she laughed , but her curiosity got the better of her .
" hitherto , " she said , " you have just taken what you desired . "
from the smouldering fires in his eyes darted an <unk> of flame .
" what kind of a man are you ? "
she asked , throwing the impersonal to the winds .
" somebody called you a viking once . "
" who ? "
he demanded .
" it does n't matter .
i 'm beginning to think the name singularly appropriate .
it would n't be the first time one landed in newport , according to legend , " she added .
" i have n't read the poem since childhood , " said chiltern , looking at her fixedly , " but he became  domesticated , if i remember rightly . "
" yes , " she admitted , " the impossible happened to him , as it usually does in books .
and then , circumstances helped .
there were no other women . "
" when the <name> died , " said chiltern , " he fell upon his spear . "
" the final argument for my theory , " declared honora .
" on the contrary , " he maintained , smiling , " it proves there is always one woman for every man  if he cars find her .
if this man had lived in modern times , he would probably have changed from a captain kidd into a useful citizen of the kind you once said you admired . "
" is a woman necessary , " she asked , " for the transformation ? "
he looked at her so intently that she blushed to the hair clustering at her temples .
she had not meant that her <unk> should go so deep .
" it was not a woman , " he said slowly , " that brought me back to <name> . "
" oh , " she exclaimed , suffused , " i <name> you wo n't think that curiosity "  and got no farther .
he was silent a moment , and when she ventured to glance up at him one of those <unk> changes had taken place .
he was looking at her gravely , though intently , and the viking had disappeared .
" i wanted you to know , " he answered .
" you must have heard more or less about me .
people talk .
naturally these things have n't been repeated to me , but i dare say many of them are true .
i have n't been a saint , and i do n't pretend to be now .
i 've never taken the trouble to deceive any one .
and i 've never cared , i 'm sorry to say , what was said .
but i 'd like you to believe that when i agreed with with the sentiments you expressed the first time i saw you , i was sincere .
and i am still sincere . "
" indeed , i do believe it ! "
cried honora .
his face lighted .
" you seemed different from the other women i had known  of my generation , at least , " he went on steadily .
" none of them could have spoken as you did .
i had just landed that morning , and i should have gone direct to grenoble , but there was some necessary business to be attended to in new york .
i did n't want to go to <name> 's dinner , but she insisted .
she was short of a man .
i went .
i sat next to you , and you interpreted my mind .
it seemed too extraordinary not to have had a significance . "
honora did not reply .
she felt instinctively that he was a man who was not wont ordinarily to talk about his affairs .
beneath his speech was an <unk>  or <unk> , perhaps  carrying her swiftly , easily , helpless into the deep waters of intimacy .
for the moment she let herself go without a struggle .
her silence was of a breathless quality which he must have felt .
" and i am going to tell you why i came home , " he said .
" i have spoken of it to nobody , but i wish you to know that it had nothing to do with any ordinary complication these people may invent .
nor was there anything supernatural about it : what happened to me , i suppose , is as old a story as civilization itself .
i 'd been knocking about the world for a good many years , and i 'd had time to think .
one day i found myself in the interior of <name> with a few coolies and a man who i suspect was a <unk> englishman .
i can see the place now the yellow fog , the sand piled up against the wall like yellow snow .
desolation was a mild name for it .
i think i began with a consideration of the englishman who was asleep in the shadow of a tower .
there was something inconceivably hopeless in his face in that <unk> light .
then the place where i was born and brought up came to me with a startling completeness , and i began to go over my own life , step by step .
to make a long story short , i perceived that what my father had tried to teach me , in his own way , had some reason in it .
he was a good deal of a man .
i made up my mind i 'd come home and start in where i belonged .
but i did n't do so right away  i finished the trip first , and lent the englishman a thousand pounds to buy into a firm in <unk> .
i suppose , " he added , " that is what is called suggestion .
in my case it was merely the cumulative result of many reflections in waste places . "
" and since then ? "
" since then i have been at grenoble , making repairs and trying to learn something about agriculture .
i 've never been as happy in my life . "
" and you 're going back on friday , " she said .
he glanced at her quickly .
he had detected the note in her speech : though lightly uttered , it was unmistakably a command .
she tried to soften its effect in her next sentence .
" i ca n't express how much i appreciate your telling me this , " she said .
" i 'll confess to you i wished to think that something of that kind had happened .
i wished to believe that  that you had made this determination alone .
when i met you that night there was something about you i could n't account for .
i have n't been able to account for it until now . "
she paused , confused , fearful that she had gone too far .
a moment later she was sure of it .
a look came into his eyes that frightened her .
" you 've thought of me ? "
he said .
" you must know , " she replied , " that you have an unusual personality  a striking one .
i can go so far as to say that i remembered you when you reappeared at mrs. <unk> 's  " she hesitated .
he rose , and walked to the far end of the tiled pavement of the <unk> , and stood for a moment looking out over the sea .
then he turned to her .
" i either like a person or i do n't , " he said .
" and i tell you frankly i have never met a woman whom i cared for as i do you .
i <name> you 're not going to insist upon a <unk> period of months before you decide whether you can <unk> . "
here indeed was a speech in his other character , and she seemed to see , in a flash , his whole life in it .
there was a touch of boyishness that appealed , a touch of insistent <unk> that alarmed .
she recalled that mrs .
shorter had said of him that he had never had to <unk> a fortress  the white flag had always appeared too quickly .
of course there was the mystery of mrs. <unk>  still to be cleared up .
it was plain , at least , that resistance merely made him unmanageable .
she smiled .
" it seems to me , " she said , " that in two days we have become astonishingly intimate . "
" why should n't we ? "
he demanded .
but she was not to be led into <unk> .
" i 've been reading the biography you recommended , " she said .
he continued to look at her a moment , and laughed as he sat down beside her .
later he walked home with her .
a dinner and bridge followed , and it was after midnight when she returned .
as her maid unfastened her gown she perceived that her <unk> had been replaced by the one she had received at the ball .
" did you put that there , <name> ? "
she asked .
<name> had .
she had seen it on madame 's bureau , and thought madame wished it there .
she would replace the old one at once .
" no , " said honora , " you may leave it , now . "
" bien , madame , " said the maid , and glanced at her mistress , who appeared to have fallen into a revery .
it had seemed strange to her to hear people talking about him at the dinner that night , and once or twice her soul had sprung to arms to champion him , only to remember that her knowledge was special .
she alone of all of them understood , and she found herself exulting in the superiority .
the amazed comment when the heir to the chiltern fortune had returned to the soil of his ancestors had been revived on his arrival in newport .
<name> carrington , amid much laughter , had quoted the lines about <name> <name> : " to mock the expectations of the world , to <unk> prophecies . "
honora disliked mr. carrington .
perhaps the events of thursday , would better be left in the confusion in which they remained in honora 's mind .
she was awakened by penetrating , persistent , and mournful notes which for some time she could not identify , although they sounded oddly familiar ; and it was not until she felt the dampness of the <unk> and looked at the white square of her open windows that she realized there was a fog .
and it had not lifted when chiltern came in the afternoon .
they discussed literature  but the book had fallen to the floor .
<unk> omen ' !
if printing had then been invented , undoubtedly there would have been a book instead of an apple in the third chapter of <name> .
he confided to her his plan of collecting his father 's letters and of writing the general 's life .
honora , too , would enjoy writing a book .
perhaps the thought of the pleasure of <unk> occurred to them both at once ; it was chiltern who wished that he might have her help in the difficult places ; she had , he felt , the literary instinct .
it was not the viking who was talking now .
and then , at last , he had risen reluctantly to leave .
the afternoon had flown .
she held out her hand with a <name> smile .
" good-by , " she said .
" good-by , and good luck . "
" but i may not go , " he replied .
she stood dismayed .
" i thought you told me you were going on friday  to-morrow . "
" i merely set that as a probable date .
i have changed my mind .
there is no immediate necessity .
do you wish me to go ? "
he demanded .
she had turned away , and was straightening the books on the table .
" why should i ? "
she said .
" you would n't object to my remaining a few days more ? "
he had reached the doorway .
" what have i to do with your staying ? "
she asked .
" everything , " he answered  and was gone .
she stood still .
the feeling that possessed her now was rebellion , and akin to hate .
her conduct , therefore , becomes all the more incomprehensible when we find her accepting , the next afternoon , his invitation to sail on mr. farnham 's yacht , the <unk> ' .
it is true that the gods <name> not <unk> mrs .
shorter .
that <name> , who had been bribed with <name> <unk> , used her persuasive powers ; she might be likened to a skilful <unk> who blew wonderful rainbow fabrics out of glass without breaking it ; she blew the tender passion into a thousand shapes , and admired every one .
her criminal <unk> consisted in forgetting the fact that it could not be trusted with children .
nature seems to delight in contrasts .
as though to atone for the fog she sent a dazzling day out of the northwest , and the summer world was stained in new colours .
the yachts were whiter , the water <unk> , the grass greener ; the stern grey rocks themselves flushed with purple .
the wharves were <name> , and dark clustering foliage hid an enchanted city as the folly glided between dancing buoys .
honora , with a frightened glance upward at the great sail , caught her breath .
and she felt rather than saw the man beside her guiding her seaward .
a discreet expanse of striped yellow deck separated them from the wicker chairs where mrs .
shorter and mr. <unk> were already established .
she glanced at the profile of the viking , and allowed her mind to dwell for an instant upon the sensations of that other woman who had been snatched up and carried across the ocean .
which was the quality in him that attracted her ?
his lawlessness , or his intellect and ambition ?
never , she knew , had he appealed to her more than at this moment , when he stood , a stern figure at the wheel , and vouchsafed her nothing but <unk> .
this , surely , was his element .
presently , however , the yacht slid out from the <unk> land into an open sea that stretched before them to a <unk> horizon .
and he turned to her with a disconcerting directness , as though taking for granted a subtle understanding between them .
" how well you sail , " she said , hurriedly .
" i ought to be able to do that , at least , " he declared .
" i saw you when you came in the other day , although i did n't know who it was until afterwards .
i was standing on the rocks near the fort , and my heart was in my mouth . "
he answered that the <name> was a good sea boat .
" so you decided to forgive me , " he said .
" for what ? "
" for staying in newport . "
before accepting the invitation she had <unk> a policy , cheerfully confident in her ability to <name> it out .
for his decision not to leave newport had had an opposite effect upon her than that she had anticipated ; it had oddly relieved the pressure .
it had given her a chance to rally her forces ; to smile , indeed , at an onslaught that had so disturbed her ; to examine the matter in a more rational light .
it had been a cause for <unk> that she had scarcely thought of him the night before .
and to-day , in her blue veil and blue <unk> gown , she had boarded the <unk> ' with her wits about her .
she forgot that it was he who , so to speak , had the choice of ground and weapons .
" i have forgiven you .
why should n't i , when you have so royally <unk> . "
but he obstinately refused to fence .
there was nothing apologetic in this man , no <unk> in his method of attack .
parry adroitly as she might , he beat down her guard .
as the afternoon wore on there were silences , when honora , by staring over the waters , tried to collect her thoughts .
but the sea was his ally , and she turned her face appealingly toward the receding land .
fascination and fear struggled within her as she had listened to his <unk> , and she was conscious of being moved by what he was , not by what he said .
vainly she glanced at the two representatives of an ironically satisfied convention , only to realize that they were absorbed in a milder but no less <unk> aspect of the same topic , and would not thank her for an interruption .
" do you wish me to go away ? "
he asked at last abruptly , almost rudely .
" surely , " she said , " your work , your future is n't in newport . "
" you have n't answered my question . "
" it 's because i have no right to answer it , " she replied .
" although we have known each other so short a time , i am your friend .
you must realize that .
i am not conventional .
i have lived long enough to understand that the people one likes best are not necessarily those one has known longest .
you interest me  i admit it frankly  i speak to you sincerely .
i am even concerned that you shall find happiness , and i feel that you have the power to make something of yourself .
what more can i say ?
it seems to me a little strange , " she added , " that under the circumstances i should say so much .
i can give no higher proof of my friendship . "
he did not reply , but gave a sharp order to the crew .
the sheet was shortened , and the folly obediently headed westward against the swell , flinging rainbows from her bows as she ran .
mrs .
shorter and <unk> returned at this moment from the cabin , where they had been on a tour of inspection .
" where are you taking us , <name> ? "
said mrs .
shorter .
" nowhere in particular , " he replied .
" please do n't forget that i am having people to dinner to-night .
that's all i ask .
what have you done to him , honora , to put him in such a humour ? "
honora laughed .
" i had n't noticed anything peculiar about him , " she answered .
" this boat reminds me of <name> , " said mrs .
shorter .
" she loved it .
i can see how she could get a divorce from dicky  but the <unk> ' !
she told me yesterday that the sight of it made her homesick , and <unk> rindge wo n't leave <name> . "
it suddenly occurred to honora , as she glanced around the yacht , that mrs. rindge rather haunted her .
" so that is your answer , " said chiltern , when they were alone again .
" what other can i give you ? "
" is it because you are married ? "
he demanded .
she grew crimson .
" is n't that an unnecessary question ? "
" no , " he declared .
" it concerns me <unk> to understand you .
you were good enough to wish that i should find happiness .
i have found the possibility of it  in you . "
" oh , " she cried , " do n't say such things ! "
" have you found happiness ? "
he asked .
she turned her face from him towards their shining wake .
but he had seen that her eyes were filled with sudden tears .
" forgive me , " he pleaded ; " i did not mean to be brutal .
i said that because i felt as i have never in my life felt before .
as i did not know i could feel .
i ca n't account for it , but i ask you to believe me . "
" i can account for it , " she answered presently , with a strange gentleness .
" it is because you met me at a critical time .
<unk> often occur in life .
i happened to be a woman ; and , i confess it , a woman who was interested .
i could not have been interested if you had been less real , less sincere .
but i saw that you were going through a crisis ; that you might , with your powers , build up your life into a splendid and useful thing .
and , <unk> , my instinct was to help you .
i should not have allowed you to go on , but  but it all happened so quickly that i was bewildered .
i  i do not understand it myself . "
he listened hungrily , and yet at times with evident impatience .
" no , " he said , " i can not believe that it was an accident .
it was you  " she stopped him with an imploring gesture .
" please , " she said , " please let us go in . "
without an instant 's hesitation he brought the sloop about and headed her for the <unk> on <name> 's reef , and they sailed in silence .
awhile she watched the sapphire waters break to dazzling whiteness under the <unk> sun .
then , in an ecstasy she did not seek to question , she closed her eyes to feel more keenly the swift motion of their flight .
why not ?
the sea , the winds of heaven , had aided others since the <name> of history .
legend was eternally true .
on these very shores happiness had awaited those who had dared to face primeval things .
she looked again , this time towards an <unk> shore .
no sentinel guarded the <unk> reefs , and the very skies were smiling , after the storm , at the <unk> fates .
it was not until they were <unk> once more , and the folly was reluctantly beating back through the narrows , that he spoke again .
" so you wish me to go away ? "
" i can not see any use in your staying , " she replied , " after what you have said .
i  can not see , " she added in a low voice , " that for you to remain would be to promote the happiness of  either of us .
you should have gone to-day . "
" you care ! "
he exclaimed .
" it is because i do not wish to care that i tell you to go  " " and you refuse happiness ? "
" it could be happiness for neither of us , " said honora .
" the situation would be impossible .
you are not a man who would be satisfied with moderation .
you would insist upon having all .
and you do not know what you are asking . "
" i know that i want you , " he said , " and that my life is won or lost with or without you . "
" you have no right to say such a thing . "
" we have each of us but one life to live . "
" and one life to ruin , " she answered .
" see , you are running on the rocks ! "
he swung the boat around .
" others have rebuilt upon ruins , " he declared .
she smiled at him .
" but you are taking my ruins for granted , " she said .
" you would make them first . "
he relapsed into silence again .
the folly needed watching .
once he turned and spoke her name , and she did not rebuke him .
" women have a clearer vision of the future than men , " she began presently , " and i know you better than you know yourself .
what  what you <name> would not mend your life , but break it utterly .
i am speaking plainly .
as i have told you , you interest me ; so far that is the extent of my feelings .
i do not know whether they would go any farther , but on your account as well as my own i <name> not take the risk .
we have come to an <unk> .
i am sorry .
i wish we might have been friends , but what you have said makes it impossible .
there is only one thing to do , and that is for you to go away . "
he eased off his sheet , rounded the fort , and set a course for the moorings .
the sun <name> red above the <unk> roofs of <unk> , and a quaint tower in the shape of a <unk> stood forth to cap the illusions of a day .
the wind was falling , the harbour <unk> for the night , and across the waters , to the tones of a trumpet , the red bars of the battleship 's flag fluttered to the deck .
the folly , making a wide circle , shot into the breeze , and ended by gliding gently up to the buoy .
chapter v. the survival of the fittest it was saturday morning , but honora had forgotten the fact .
not until she was on the bottom step did the odour of cigarettes reach her and turn her faint ; and she clutched suddenly at the <unk> .
thus she stood for a while , motionless , and then went quietly into the drawing-room .
the french windows looking out on the porch were , as usual , open .
it was an odd sensation thus to be regarding one 's husband <unk> .
for the first time he appeared to her definitely as a stranger ; as much a stranger as the man who came once a week to wind mrs. <unk> clocks .
nay , more .
there was a sense of intrusion in this visit , of invasion of a life with which he had nothing to do .
she examined him ruthlessly , very much as one might examine a burglar taken unawares .
there was the inevitable shirt with the wide pink stripes , of the <unk> or even of the effective <unk> down of which she had long since despaired .
on the contrary , like his complexion , they evinced a continual tendency towards a more aggressive colour .
there was also the jewelled ring , now conspicuously held aloft on a fat little finger .
the stripes appeared that morning as the banner of a hated <unk> , the ring as the emblem of his <unk> .
he did not belong in that house ; everything in it cried out for his removal ; and yet it was , in the eyes of the law at least , his .
by <name> of that fact she was here , enjoying it .
at that instant , as though in evidence of this , he laid down a burning cigarette on a mahogany stand he had had brought out to him .
honora seized an ash tray , hurried to the porch , and picked up the cigarette in the tips of her fingers .
" <name> , i wish you would be more careful of mrs. <unk> 's furniture , " she exclaimed .
" hello , honora , " he said , without looking up .
" i see by the newport paper that old <unk> is back from europe .
things are <unk> in wall street . "
he glanced at the ash tray , which she had pushed towards him .
" what 's the difference about the table ?
if the old <name> makes a row , i 'll pay for it . "
" some things are priceless , " she replied ; " you do not seem to realize that . "
" not this rubbish , " said <name> .
" judging by the fuss she made over the inventory , you 'd think it might be worth something . "
" she has trusted us with it , " said honora .
her voice shook .
he stared at her .
" i never saw you look like that , " he declared .
" it 's because you never look at me closely , " she answered .
he laughed , and resumed his reading .
she stood awhile by the railing .
across the way , beyond the wall , she heard mr. chamberlin 's shrill voice <unk> a gardener .
" <name> , " she asked presently , " why do you come to newport at all ? "
" why do i come to newport ? "
he repeated .
" i do n't understand you . "
" why do you come up here every week ? "
" well , " he said , " it is n't a bad trip on the boat , and i get a change from new york ; and see men i should n't probably see otherwise . "
he paused and looked at her again , doubtfully .
" why do you ask such a question ? "
" i wished to be sure , " said honora .
" sure of what ? "
" that <unk> suited you perfectly .
you do not feel  the lack of anything , do you ? "
" what do you mean ? "
" you would n't care to stay in newport all the time ? "
" not if i know myself , " he replied .
" i leave that part of it to you . "
" what part of it ? "
she demanded .
" you ought to know .
you do it pretty well , " he laughed .
" by the way , honora , i 've got to have a conference with mr. wing to-day , and i may not be home to lunch . "
" we 're dining there to-night , " she told him , in a listless voice .
upon <name> wing had descended the dominating characteristics of the elder <name> , who , whatever the power he might wield in wall street , was little more than a visitor in newport .
it was <name> 's house , from the hour she had swept the reel and <name> plans ( which her father had brought home ) from the table and sent for mr. farwell .
the <unk> <name> arrived with a sketch , and the result , as every one knows , is one of the chief monuments to his reputation .
so exquisitely proportioned is its simple , two-storied marble front as seen through the trees left standing on the old estate , that tourists , having beheld the chamberlin and other mansions , are apt to think this <unk> for a palace .
two <unk> wings , stretching towards the water , enclose a court , and through the slender white pillars of the <unk> one beholds in fancy the summer seas of greece .
looking out on the court , and sustaining this classic illusion , is a <unk> dining room , with hangings of <unk> red , and frescoes of <unk> and <unk> and piping shepherds , framed between fluted <unk> , dimly discernible in the soft lights .
in the midst of these surroundings , at the head of his table , sat the great financier whose story but faintly concerns this chronicle ; the man who , every day that he had spent down town in new york in the past thirty years , had eaten the same meal in the same little restaurant under the street .
this he told honora , on his left , as though it were not history .
he preferred apple pie to the greatest of artistic triumphs of his daughter 's chef , and had it ; a glorified apple pie , with frills and <unk> , and whipped cream which he angrily swept to one side with contempt .
" that is n't apple pie , " he said .
" i 'd like to take that frenchman to the little new england <unk> where i went to school and show him what apple pie is . "
such were the <unk> snatches  by no means so crude as they sound that reached her intelligence from time to time .
mr. wing was too subtle to be crude ; and he had married a <unk> , a family noted for good living .
honora did not know that he was fond of talking of that apple pie and the new england school at public banquets ; nor did mr. wing suspect that the young woman whom he was apparently addressing , and who seemed to be hanging on his words , was not present .
it was not until she had put her napkin on the table that she awoke with a start and gazed into his face and saw written there still another history than the one he had been telling her .
the face was hidden , indeed , by the red beard .
what she read was in the little eyes that swept her with a look of possession : possession in a large sense , let it be emphasized , that an exact justice be done mr. <name> wing ,  she was one of the many <unk> over which his ownership extended ; bought and paid for with her husband .
a hot resentment ran through her at the thought .
mr. cuthbert , who was many kinds of a barometer , sought her out later in the courtyard .
" your husband 's feeling <unk> , is n't he ? "
said he .
" he 's been locked up with old wing all day .
something 's in the wind , and i 'd give a good deal to know what it is . "
" i 'm afraid i ca n't inform you , " replied honora .
mr. cuthbert apologized .
" oh , i did n't mean to ask you far a tip , " he declared , quite confused .
" i did n't suppose you knew .
the old man is getting ready to make another killing , that 's all .
you do n't mind my telling you you look stunning tonight , do you ? "
honora smiled .
" no , i do n't mind , " she said .
mr. cuthbert appeared to be <unk> the corners of his <name> for words .
" i was watching you to-night at the table while mr. wing was talking to you .
i do n't believe you heard a thing he said . "
" such astuteness , " she answered , smiling at him , " <unk> me . "
he laughed nervously .
" you 're different than you 've ever been since i 've known you , " he went on , <unk> .
" i <name> you wo n't think i 'm making love to you .
not that i should n't like to , but i 've got sense enough to see it 's no use . "
her reply was unexpected .
" what makes you think that ? "
she asked curiously .
" oh , i 'm not a fool , " said mr. cuthbert .
" but if i were a poet , or that fellow <unk> , i might be able to tell you what your eyes were like to-night . "
" i 'm glad you 're not , " said honora .
as they were going in , she turned for a lingering look at the sea .
a strong young moon rode serenely in the sky and struck a path of light across the restless waters .
along this shimmering way the eyes of her companion followed hers .
" i can tell you what that colour is , at least .
do you remember the blue , transparent substance that used to be on favours at children 's parties ? "
he asked .
" there were caps inside of them , and crackers . "
" i believe you are a poet , after all , " she said .
a shadow fell across the flags .
honora did not move .
" hello , chiltern , " said cuthbert .
" i thought you were playing bridge ... " " you have n't looked at me once to-night , " he said , when cuthbert had gone in .
she was silent .
" are you angry ? "
" yes , a little , " she answered .
" do you blame me ? "
the vibration of his voice in the moonlit court awoke an answering chord in her ; and a note of supplication from him touched her strangely .
logic in his presence was a little difficult  there can be no doubt of that .
" i must go in , " she said unsteadily , " my carriage is waiting . "
but he stood in front of her .
" i should have thought you would have gone , " she said .
" i wanted to see you again . "
" and now ? "
" i ca n't leave while you feel this way , " he pleaded .
" i ca n't abandon what i have of you  what you <name> let me take .
if i told you i would be reasonable  " " i do n't believe in miracles , " she said , recovering a little ; " at least in modern ones .
the question is , could you become reasonable ? "
" as a last resort , " he replied , with a flash of humour and a touch of <name> .
" if you would  <unk> my sentence . "
she passed him , and picking up her skirts , paused in the window .
" i <name> give you one more chance , " she said .
this was the conversation that , by repeating itself , filled the interval of her drive home .
so oblivious was she to <name> 's presence , that he called her twice from her corner of the carriage after the vehicle had stopped ; and he halted her by seizing her arm as she was about to go up the stairs .
she followed him mechanically into the drawing-room .
he closed the door behind them , and the other door into the darkened dining room .
he even took a <unk> glance out of the window of the porch .
and these movements , which ordinarily might have aroused her curiosity , if not her alarm , she watched with a profound indifference .
he took a stand before the japanese screen in front of the fireplace , thrust his hands in his pockets , cleared his throat , and surveyed her from her white shoulders to the <unk> tips of her slippers .
" i 'm leaving for the west in the morning , honora .
if you 've made any arrangements for me on <name> , you 'll have to <unk> them .
i may be gone two weeks , i may be gone a month .
i do n't know . "
" yes , " she said .
" i 'm going to tell you something those fellows in the smoking room to-night did their best to screw out of me .
if you say anything about it , all 's up between me and wing .
the fact that he picked me out to engineer the thing , and that he 's going to let me in if i push it through , is a pretty good sign that he thinks something of my business ability , eh ? "
" you 'd better not tell me , <name> , " she said .
" you 're too clever to let it out , " he assured her ; and added with a chuckle : " if it goes through , order what you like .
rent a house on <unk> avenue  any thing in reason . "
" what is it ? "
she asked , with a sudden <unk> that the thing had a vital significance for her .
" it 's the greatest scheme extant , " he answered with elation .
" i wo n't go into details  you would n't <unk> .
mr. wing and some others have tried the thing before , nearer home , and it worked like a charm .
street railways .
we buy up the little lines for nothing , and get an interest in the big ones , and sell the little lines for fifty times what they cost us , and guarantee big dividends for the big lines . "
" it sounds to me , " said honora , slowly , " as though some one would get cheated . "
" some one get cheated ! "
he exclaimed , laughing .
" every one gets cheated , as you call it , if they have n't enough sense to know what their property 's worth , and how to use it to the best advantage .
it 's a case , " he announced , " of the survival of the fittest .
which reminds me that if i 'm going to be fit to-morrow i 'd better go to bed .
mr. wing 's to take me to new york on his yacht , and you 've got to have your wits about you when you talk to the old man . "
volume 6 .
chapter <name> .
<unk> , or <name> ?
according to the ordinary and inaccurate method of measuring time , a fortnight may have gone by since the event last narrated , and honora had tasted at last the joys of authorship .
her name was not to appear , to be sure , on the cover of the life and letters of general <unk> chiltern ; nor indeed , so far , had she written so much as a chapter or a <name> of a work intended to inspire young and old with the virtues of citizenship .
at present the biography was in the crucial constructive stage .
should the letters be put in one volume , and the life in another ?
or should the letters be inserted in the text of the life ?
or could not there be a third and judicious mixture of both of these methods ?
honora 's counsel on this and other problems was , it seems , invaluable .
her own table was fairly littered with biographies more or less famous which had been fetched from the library , and the method of each considered .
even as mr. garrick would never have been taken for an actor in his coach and four , so our heroine did not in the least resemble <name> eliot , for instance , as she sat before her mirror at high noon with monsieur <unk> and her maid <name> in worshipful attendance .
some of the ladies , indeed , who have left us those <unk> memoirs of the days before the <unk> , she might have been likened to .
monsieur <unk> was an artist , and his branch of <name> was <unk> .
it was by his own wish he was here to-day , since he had conceived a new coiffure especially adapted , he declared , to the type of madame spence .
behold him declaring <unk> that seldom in his experience had he had such hairs to work with .
" avec une <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> tout faire , madame .
<unk> simple , c'est <name> <unk> de <unk> .
ca vous donne , " he added , with clasped hands and a step backward , " ca vous donne tout a fait <unk> <unk> dame de <unk> . "
madame took the <unk> , and did not deny that she was <unk> .
if madame , suggested monsieur <unk> , had but a little dress a la <name> <name> ?
madame had , cried madame 's maid , running to fetch one with little pink flowers and green leaves on an <unk> ground .
could any coiffure or any gown be more appropriate for an entertainment at which <unk> was to preside ?
it is obviously impossible that a masterpiece should be executed under the rules laid down by convention .
it would never be finished .
mr. chiltern was coming to lunch , and it was not the first time .
on her appearance in the doorway he halted abruptly in his pacing of the drawing-room , and stared at her .
" i 'm sorry i kept you waiting , " she said .
" it was worth it , " he said .
and they entered the dining room .
a subdued , <unk> light came in through the tall glass doors that opened out on the little garden which had been mrs. <unk> 's pride .
the scent of roses was in the air , and a mass of them filled a silver bowl in the middle of the table .
on the dark walls were mrs. <unk> 's precious prints , and above the mantel a portrait of a thin , aristocratic gentleman who resembled the poet tennyson .
in the noonday shadows of a recess was a dark mahogany sideboard loaded with softly gleaming silver  honora 's .
chiltern sat down facing her .
he looked at honora over the roses ,  and she looked at him .
a sense of unreality that was , paradoxically , stronger than reality itself came over her , a sense of fitness , of <name> .
and for the moment an imagination , ever straining at its <unk> , was allowed to soar .
it was chiltern who broke the silence .
" what a wonderful bowl ! "
he said .
" it has been in my father 's family a great many years .
he was very fond of it , " she answered , and with a sudden , impulsive movement she reached over and set the bowl aside .
" that 's better , " he declared , " much as i admire the bowl , and the roses . "
she coloured faintly , and smiled .
the feast of reason that we are impatiently awaiting is deferred .
it were best to attempt to record the <unk> things ; the <unk> light , the perfumes , and the faint musical laughter which we can hear if we listen .
<name> 's laughter , surely , not <unk> 's .
<name> , <unk> with such a theme , has taken the stage herself  and as <name> , goddess of <unk> .
it was <name> whom they felt to be presiding .
they lingered , therefore , over the coffee , and chiltern lighted a cigar .
he did not smoke cigarettes .
" i 've lived long enough , " he said , " to know that i have never lived at all .
there is only one thing in life worth having . "
" what is it ? "
asked honora .
" this , " he answered , with a gesture ; " when it is permanent . "
she smiled .
" and how is one to know whether it would be  permanent ? "
" through experience and failure , " he answered quickly , " we learn to distinguish the reality when it comes .
it is unmistakable . "
" suppose it comes too late ? "
she said , forgetting the ancient verse inscribed in her youthful diary : " those who walk on ice <name> slide against their wills . "
" to admit that is to be a coward , " he declared .
" such a philosophy may be fitting for a man , " she replied , " but for a woman  " " we are no longer in the dark ages , " he interrupted .
" every one , man or woman , has the right to happiness .
there is no reason why we should suffer all our lives for a mistake . "
" a mistake ! "
she echoed .
" certainly , " he said .
" it is all a matter of luck , or fate , or whatever you choose to call it .
do you suppose , if i could have found fifteen years ago the woman to have made me happy , i should have spent so much time in seeking distraction ? "
" perhaps you could not have been capable of appreciating her  fifteen years ago , " suggested honora .
and , lest he might <unk> her remark , she avoided his eyes .
" perhaps , " he admitted .
" but suppose i have found her now , when i know the value of things . "
" suppose you should find her now  within a reasonable time .
what would you do ? "
" marry her , " he exclaimed promptly .
" marry her and take her to grenoble , and live the life my father lived before me . "
she did not reply , but rose , and he followed her to the shaded corner of the porch where they usually sat .
the bundle of <unk> envelopes he had brought were lying on the table , and honora picked them up mechanically .
" i have been thinking , " she said as she removed the <unk> , " that it is a mistake to begin a biography by the enumeration of one 's ancestors .
readers become frightfully bored before they get through the first chapter . "
" i 'm beginning to believe , " he laughed , " that you <name> have to write this one alone .
all the ideas i have got so far have been yours .
why should n't you write it , and i arrange the material , and talk about it !
that appears to be all i 'm good for . "
if she allowed her mind to dwell on the vista he thus presented , she did not betray herself .
" another thing , " she said , " it should be written like fiction . "
" like fiction ? "
" fact should be written like fiction , and fiction like fact .
it's difficult to express what i mean .
but this life of your father deserves to be widely known , and it should be <unk> done , like lockhart , or <unk> 's works  " an envelope fell to the floor , spilling its contents .
among them were several photographs .
" oh , " she exclaimed , " how beautiful !
what place is this ? "
" i had n't gone over these letters , " he answered .
" i only got them yesterday from <name> grainger .
these are some pictures of grenoble which must leave been taken shortly before my father died . "
she gazed in silence at the old house half hidden by great maples and <unk> , their weighted branches sweeping the ground .
the building was of wood , painted white , and through an archway of verdure one saw the generous doorway with its circular steps , with its <unk> above , and its windows at the side .
other quaint windows , some of them of triple width , suggested an interior of mystery and interest .
" my <unk> , <name> chiltern , built it , " he said , " on land granted to him before the revolution .
of course the house has been added to since then , but the simplicity of the original has always been kept .
my father put on the conservatory , for instance , " and chiltern pointed to a portion at the end of one of the long low wings .
" he got the idea from the <unk> of a georgian house in england , and an english architect designed it . "
honora took up the other photographs .
one of them , over which she lingered , was of a charming , old-fashioned garden spattered with sunlight , and shut out from the world by a high brick wall .
behind the wall , again , were the dense masses of the trees , and at the end of a path between nodding <unk> and canterbury bells , in a curved recess , a stone seat .
she turned her face .
his was at her shoulder .
" how could you ever have left it ? "
she asked reproachfully .
she voiced his own regrets , which the crowding memories had awakened .
" i do n't know , " he answered , not without emotion .
" i have often asked myself that question . "
he crossed over to the railing of the porch , swung about , and looked at her .
her eyes were still on the picture .
" i can imagine you in that garden , " he said .
did the garden cast the spell by which she saw herself on the seat ?
or was it chiltern 's voice ?
she would indeed love and <name> it .
and was it true that she belonged there , securely infolded within those peaceful walls ?
how marvellously well was <name> playing her comedy !
which was the real , and which the false ?
what of true value , what of peace and security was contained in her present existence ?
she had missed the meaning of things , and suddenly it was held up before her , in a garden .
a later hour found them in honora 's runabout wandering northward along quiet country roads on the eastern side of the island .
chiltern , who was driving , seemed to take no thought of their direction , until at last , with an exclamation , he stopped the horse ; and honora beheld an abandoned mansion of a bygone age sheltered by ancient trees , with wide lands beside it sloping to the water .
" what is it ? "
she asked .
" <unk> , " he replied .
" it was built in the seventeenth century , i believe , and must have been a fascinating place in colonial days . "
he drove in between the fences and tied the horse , and came around by the side of the runabout .
" wo n't you get out and look at it ? "
she hesitated , and their eyes met as he held out his hand , but she avoided it and leaped quickly to the ground neither spoke as they walked around the deserted house and gazed at the quaint facade , broken by a crumbling , shaded balcony let in above the entrance door .
no sound broke the stillness of the summer 's day  a pregnant stillness .
the air was heavy with perfumes , and the leaves formed a tracery against the marvellous blue of the sky .
mystery brooded in the place .
here , in this remote paradise now in ruins , people had dwelt and loved .
thought ended there ; and feeling , which is <unk> thought , began .
again she glanced at him , and again their eyes met , and hers faltered .
they turned , as with one consent , down the path toward the distant water .
paradise overgrown !
could it be <unk> , redeemed ?
in former days the ground they trod had been a <unk> the width of the house , bordered , doubtless , by the forest .
trees grew out of the flower beds now , and underbrush choked the paths .
the box itself , that once <unk> lined the alleys , was gnarled and shapeless .
labyrinth had replaced order , nature had <unk> her vengeance .
at length , in the deepening shade , they came , at what had been the edge of the old terrace , to the daintiest of <unk> , crumbling too , the shutters off their hinges , the <unk> loose .
past and gone were the <unk> of which it had been the stage .
they turned to the left , through tangled box that wound hither and thither , until they stopped at a stone wall bordering a <unk> <name> .
at the bottom of the <name> was a glimpse of blue water .
honora sat down on the wall with her back to a great trunk .
chiltern , with a hand on the stones , leaped over lightly , and stood for some moments in the <name> , his feet a little apart and firmly planted , his hands behind his back .
what had <name> been about to allow the message of that morning to creep into her comedy ?
a message announcing the coming of an intruder not in the play , in the person of a husband bearing gifts .
what right had he , in the eternal essence of things , to return ?
he was out of all time and place .
such had been her feeling when she had first read the hastily written letter , but even when she had burned it it had risen again from the ashes .
anything but that !
in trying not to think of it , she had picked up the newspaper , learned of a railroad accident ,  and shuddered .
anything but his return !
her marriage was a sin ,  there could be no sacrament in it .
she would flee first , and abandon all rather than submit to it .
chiltern 's step aroused her now .
he came back to the wall where she was sitting , and faced her .
" you are sad , " he said .
she shook her head at him , slowly , and tried to smile .
" what has happened ? "
he demanded rudely .
" i ca n't bear to see you sad . "
" i am going away , " she said .
the decision had suddenly come to her .
why had she not seen before that it was inevitable ?
he seized her wrist as it lay on the wall , and she winced from the sudden pain of his grip .
" honora , i love you , " he said , " i must have you  i <name> have you .
i <name> make you happy .
i promise it on my soul .
i ca n't , i wo n't live without you . "
she did not listen to his words  she could not have repeated them afterwards .
the very tone of his voice was changed by passion ; creation spoke through him , and she heard and thrilled and swayed and soared , forgetting heaven and earth and hell as he seized her in his arms and covered her face with kisses .
thus <name> the red might have <unk> .
and by what <name> she spoke the word that delivered her she never knew .
as suddenly as he had seized her he released her , and she stood before him with flaming cheeks and painful breath .
" i love you , " he said , " i love you .
i have searched the world for you and found you , and by all the laws of god you are mine . "
and love was written in her eyes .
he had but to read it there , though her lips might deny it .
this was the man of all men she would have chosen , and she was his by right of conquest .
yet she held up her hand with a gesture of entreaty .
" no , <name>  it can not be , " she said .
" can not ! "
he cried .
" i <name> take you .
you love me . "
" i am married . "
" married !
do you mean that you would let that man stand between you and happiness ? "
" what do you mean ? "
she asked , in a frightened voice .
" just what i say , " he cried , with incredible vehemence .
" leave him  divorce him .
you can not live with him .
he is n't worthy to touch your hand . "
the idea planted itself with the force of a barbed arrow from a <unk> .
struggle as she might , she could not henceforth extract it .
" oh ! "
she cried .
he took her arm , gently , and forced her to sit down on the wall .
such was the completeness of his mastery that she did not resist .
he sat down beside her .
" listen , honora , " he said , and tried to speak calmly , though his voice was still vibrant ; " let us look the situation in the face .
as i told you once , the days of useless martyrdom are past .
the world is more enlightened today , and recognizes an individual right to happiness . "
" to happiness , " she repeated after him , like a child .
he forgot his words as he looked into her eyes : they were lighted as with all the candles of heaven in his honour .
" listen , " he said hoarsely , and his fingers tightened on her arm .
the current running through her from him made her his instrument .
did he say the sky was black , she would have exclaimed at the discovery .
" yes  i am listening . "
" honora ! "
" <name> , " she answered , and blinded him .
he was possessed by the tragic fear that she was acting a dream ; presently she would awake  and <unk> the universe .
his <unk> was too complete .
" i love you  i respect you .
you are making it very hard for me .
please try to understand what i am saying , " he cried almost fiercely .
" this thing , this miracle , has happened in spite of us .
henceforth you belong to me  do you hear ? "
once more the candles flared up .
" we can not drift .
we must decide now upon some definite action .
our lives are our own , to make as we choose .
you said you were going away .
and you meant  alone ? "
the eyes were wide , now , with fright .
" oh , i must  i must , " she said .
" do n't  do n't talk about it . "
and she put forth a hand over his .
" i <name> talk about it , " he declared , trembling .
" i have thought it all out , " and this time it was her fingers that tightened .
" you are going away .
and presently  when you are free  i <name> come to you . "
for a moment the current stopped .
" no , no ! "
she cried , almost in terror .
the first <unk> must have been a woman , and the vision of rent prison bars drove her mad .
" no , we could never be happy . "
" we can  we <name> be happy , " he said , with a conviction that was unshaken .
" do you hear me ?
i <name> not <unk> what i have to say by resorting to comparisons .
but  others i know have been happy are happy , though their happiness can not be spoken of with ours .
listen .
you <name> go away  for a little while  and afterwards we shall be together for all time .
nothing shall separate us : we never have known life , either of us , until now .
i , missing you , have run after the false gods .
and you  i say it with <unk> me .
we <name> go to live at grenoble , as my father and mother lived .
we <name> take up their duties there .
and if it seems possible , i <name> go into public life .
when i return , i shall find you  waiting for me  in the garden . "
so real had the <unk> become , that honora did not answer .
the desert and its journey fell away .
could such a thing , after all , be possible ?
did fate deal twice to those whom she had made <unk> ?
the <unk> , indeed , suddenly became reality  a <unk> only because she had proclaimed it such .
she had beheld in it , as he spoke , a grenoble which was paradise regained .
and why should paradise regained be a paradox ?
why paradise regained ?
paradise gained .
she had never known it , until he had flung wide the gates .
she had sought for it , and never found it until now , and her senses doubted it .
it was a paradise of love , to be sure ; but one , too , of duty .
duty made it real .
work was there , and fulfilment of the purpose of life itself .
and if his days hitherto had been useless , hers had in truth been barren .
it was only of late , after a life-long groping , that she had discovered their barrenness .
the right to happiness !
could she begin anew , and found it upon a rock ?
and was he the rock ?
the question startled her , and she <name> away from him first her hand , and then she turned her body , staring at him with widened eyes .
he did not resist the movement ; nor could he , being male , divine what was passing within her , though he watched her anxiously .
she had no thought of the first days ,  but afterwards .
for at such times it is the woman who <unk> the veil of the future .
how long would that beacon burn which flamed now in such prodigal waste ?
would not the very springs of it dry up ?
she looked at him , and she saw the viking .
but the viking had fled from the world , and they  they would be going into it .
could love prevail against its dangers and pitfalls and  duties ?
love was the word that rang out , as one calling through the garden , and her thoughts ran molten .
let love overflow  she gloried in the waste !
and let the <name> years come ,  she defied them to-day .
" oh , <name> ! "
she faltered .
" my dearest ! "
he cried , and would have seized her in his arms again but for a look of supplication .
that he had in him this innate and unsuspected chivalry filled her with an exquisite sweetness .
" you <name>  protect me ? "
she asked .
" with my life and with my honour , " he answered .
" honora , there <name> be no happiness like ours . "
" i wish i knew , " she sighed : and then , her look returning from the veil , rested on him with a tenderness that was inexpressible .
" i  i don't care , <name> .
i trust you . "
the sun was setting .
slowly they went back together through the paths of the tangled garden , which had doubtless seen many dramas , and the courses changed of many lives : overgrown and <unk> now , yet love was loth to leave it .
honora paused on the lawn before the house , and looked back at him over her shoulder .
" how happy we could have been here , in those days , " she sighed .
" we <name> be happier there , " he said .
honora loved .
many times in her life had she believed herself to have had this sensation , and yet had known nothing of these aches and ecstasies !
her mortal body , unattended , went out to dinner that evening .
never , it is said , was her success more pronounced .
the charm of <name> leffingwell , which had fascinated the nobility of three kingdoms , had descended on her , and <unk> had discovered that she possessed the magic touch necessary to make a dinner complete .
her quality , as we know , was not wit : it was something as old as the world , as new as modern psychology .
it was , in short , the power to stimulate .
she infused a sense of well-being ; and ordinary people , in her presence , surprised themselves by saying clever things .
lord <unk> , a <name> , <unk> gentleman , who was supposed to be on the verge of contracting an alliance with the eldest of the <unk> girls , regretted that mrs. spence was neither unmarried nor an heiress .
" you know , " he said to <name> grainger , who happened to be <unk> his wife 's dinner-party , " she 's the sort of woman for whom a man might consent to live in <name> . "
" and she 's the sort of woman , " replied , " a man could n't get to go to <name> . "
lord <unk> 's sigh was a proof of an intimate knowledge of the world .
" i suppose not , " he said .
" it 's always so .
and there are few american women who would throw everything overboard for a grand passion . "
" you ought to see her on the beach , " mr. grainger suggested .
" i intend to , " said <unk> .
" by the way , not a few of your american women get divorced , and keep their cake and eat it , too .
it 's a bit difficult , here at newport , for a stranger , you know . "
" i 'm willing to bet , " declared mr. grainger , " that it does n't pay .
when you 're divorced and married again you 've got to keep up appearances  the first time you do n't .
some of these people are working pretty hard . "
whereupon , for the englishman 's enlightenment , he <unk> a little gossip .
this , of course , was in the smoking room .
in the drawing-room , mrs. grainger 's cousin did not escape , and the biography was the subject of laughter .
" you see something of him , i hear , " remarked mrs. <unk> , a <name> the deficiency of whose neck was supplied by jewels , and whose conversation sounded like liquid coming out of an inverted bottle .
" is he really serious about the biography ? "
" you 'll have to ask mr. grainger , " replied honora .
" <name> ought to marry , " mrs. <unk> observed .
" why did he come back ? "
inquired another who had just returned from a prolonged residence abroad .
" was there a woman in the case ? "
" put it in the plural , and you 'll be nearer right , " laughed mrs. <unk> , and added to honora , " you 'd best take care , my dear , he's dangerous . "
honora seemed to be looking down on them from a great height , and to <name> farwell alone is due the discovery of this altitude ; his reputation for astuteness , after that evening , was secure .
he had sat next her , and had merely put two and two together  an operation that is probably at the root of most prophecies .
more than once that summer mr. farwell had taken sketches down honora 's <name> , for she was on what was known as his list of advisers : a <unk> of ewes , some one had called it , and he was always piqued when one of them went astray .
in addition to this , intuition told him that he had taken the name of a deity in vain  and that deity was chiltern .
these reflections resulted in another <unk> conversation to which we are not supposed to listen .
he found <name> shorter in a receptive mood , and <name> him into <name> grainger 's study , where this latter gentleman , when awake , carried on his <unk> of keeping a record of prize winners .
" i believe there is something between mrs. spence and <name> chiltern , after all , <name> , " he said .
" by jinks , you do n't say so ! "
exclaimed mr .
shorter , who had a profound respect for his friend 's <unk> in these matters .
" she was dazzling to-night , and her eyes were like stars .
i passed her in the hall just now , and i might as well have been in halifax . "
" she fairly withered me when i made a little fun of chiltern , " declared farwell .
" i tell you what it is , <name> , " remarked mr .
shorter , with more frankness than tact , " you could talk architecture with 'em from now to christmas , and nothing 'd happen , but it would take an iceberg to write a book with <name> and see him alone six days out of seven .
chiltern knocks women into a cocked hat .
i 've seen 'em stark raving crazy .
why , there was that mrs. <unk> six or seven years ago  you remember  that <name> grainger had such a deuce of a time with .
and there was mrs. <unk>  i was a committee to see her , when the old general was alive ,  to say nothing about a good many women you and i know . "
mr. farwell nodded .
" i 'm <unk> sorry if it 's so , " mr .
shorter continued , with sincerity .
" she has a brilliant future ahead of her .
she 's got good blood in her , she 's stunning to look at , and she 's made her own way in spite of that <unk> of a husband who talks like the original <unk> .
by the bye , wing is using him for a good thing .
he 's sent him out west to pull that street railway chestnut out of the fire .
i 'm not particularly <unk> , <name> , though i try to play the game straight myself  the way my father played it .
but by the lord <name> , i ca n't see the difference between <name> <unk> and wing and trixy <name> .
it 's hold and deliver with those fellows .
but if the police get anybody , their get spence . "
" the police never get anybody , " said farwell , <unk> ; for the change of topic bored him .
" no , i suppose they do n't , " answered mr .
shorter , cheerfully finishing his <unk> , and fixing his eye on one of the coloured <unk> of <name> horses on <name> grainger 's wall .
" i 'd talk to <name> , if i was n't as much afraid of him as of <name> <unk> .
i do n't want to see him ruin her career . "
" why should an affair with him ruin it ? "
asked farwell , unexpectedly .
" there was <name> <unk> .
i understand that went pretty far . "
" my dear boy , " said mr .
shorter , " it 's the women .
<name> grainger here , for instance  she 'd go right up in the air .
and the women had  well , a <unk> in <name> .
self-preservation is the first law  of women . "
" they say <name> has changed  that he wants to settle down , " said farwell .
" if you 'd ever gone to church , <name> , " said mr .
shorter , " you 'd know something about the limitations of the leopard . "
chapter vii .
" <name> , and the pursuit of happiness " that night was honora 's soul played upon by the unknown musician of the sleepless hours .
now a mad , ecstatic chorus <unk> in her ears and set her blood coursing ; and again despair seized her with a dirge .
periods of <unk> only came to her , and from one of these she was suddenly startled into <unk> by her own words .
" i have the right to make of my life what i can . "
but when she beheld the road of terrors that stretched between her and the shining places , it seemed as though she would never have the courage to fare forth along its way .
to look back was to survey a prospect even more dreadful .
the incidents of her life ranged by in procession .
not in natural sequence , but a group here and a group there .
and it was given her , for the first time , to see many things clearly .
but now she loved .
god alone knew what she felt for this man , and when she thought of him the very perils of her path were dwarfed .
on returning home that night she had given her maid her cloak , and had stood for a long time <unk> ,  gazing at her image in the <unk> .
" madame est <name> comme <unk> <unk> ! "
said the maid at length .
" am i really beautiful , <name> ? "
<name> raised her eyes and hands to heaven in a gesture that admitted no doubt .
<name> , moreover , could read a certain kind of history if the print were large enough .
honora looked in the glass again .
yes , she was beautiful .
he had found her so , he had told her so .
and here was the testimony of her own eyes .
the bloom on the nectarines that came every morning from mr. chamberlin 's greenhouse could not compare with the colour of her cheeks ; her hair was like the dusk ; her eyes like the blue pools among the rocks , and touched now by the sun ; her neck and arms of the whiteness of <unk> .
it was meet that she should be thus for him and for the love he brought her .
she turned suddenly to the maid .
" do you love me , <name> ? "
she asked .
<name> was not surprised .
she was , on the contrary , profoundly touched .
" how can madame ask ? "
she cried impulsively , and seized honora 's hand .
how was it possible to be near madame , and not love her ?
" and would you go  anywhere with me ? "
the scene came back to her in the night watches .
for the little maid had wept and vowed eternal fidelity .
it was not  until the first faint herald of the morning that honora could bring herself to pronounce the fateful thing that stood between her and happiness , that threatened to mar the perfection of a heaven-born love  divorce !
and thus , having named it resolutely several times , the demon of salvation began gradually to assume a kindly aspect that at times became almost benign .
in fact , this one was not a demon at all , but a <unk> : the demon , she perceived , stalked behind him , and his name was notoriety .
it was he who would <unk> her for <unk> with the <unk> .
what if she were flayed ?
once married to chiltern , once embarked upon that life of usefulness , once firmly established on ground of her own <unk> , and she was <unk> .
and this led her to a consideration of those she knew who had been flayed .
they were not few , and a <unk> of publicity is a sufficient reason for not <unk> them here .
and during this process of <unk> notoriety became a <unk> , too : he had been powerless to hurt them .
it must be true what chiltern had said that the world was changing .
the tragic and the ridiculous here joining hands , she remembered that <name> farwell had told her that he had recently made a trip to western new york to inspect a house he had built for a " <unk> " couple who were not wholly unknown .
the <unk> , he had called it .
the man , in his former marriage , had been renowned all up and down <unk> as a rake and a brute , and now it was an exception when he did not have at least one baby on his knee .
and he knew , according to mr. farwell , more about infant diet than the whole staff of a <unk> hospital .
at length , as she stared into the darkness , dissolution came upon it .
the <unk> of her windows outlined themselves , and a blurred foliage was sketched into the frame .
with a problem but half solved the day had surprised her .
she marvelled to see that it grew apace , and presently arose to look out upon a stillness like that of eternity : in the grey light the very leaves seemed to be holding their breath in expectancy of the thing that was to come .
presently the drooping roses raised their heads , from <name> to silver grew the light , and comparison ended .
the reds were aflame , the greens resplendent , the lawn <unk> with the diamonds of the dew .
a little travelling table was beside the window , and honora took her pen and wrote .
" my dearest , above all created things i love you .
morning has come , and it seems to me that i have travelled far since last i saw you .
i have come to a new place , which is neither hell nor heaven , and in the mystery of it you  you alone are real .
it is to your strength that i cling , and i know that you <name> not fail me .
" since i saw you , <name> , i have been through the valley of the shadow .
i have thought of many things .
one truth alone is clear  that i love you <unk> you have touched and awakened me into life .
i walk in a world unknown .
" there is the <name> of martyrdom in this message i send you now .
you must not come to me again until i send for you .
i can not , i <name> not trust myself or you .
i <name> keep this love which has come to me <unk> .
it has brought with it to me a new spirit , a spirit with a scorn for things base and mean .
though it were my last chance in life , i would not see you if you came .
if i thought you would not understand what i feel , i could not love you as i do .
" i <name> write to you again , when i see my way more clearly .
i told you in the garden before you spoke that i was going away .
do not seek to know my plans .
for the sake of the years to come , obey me .
" honora . "
she <unk> the letter , and sealed it .
a new and different exaltation had come to her  <unk> , perhaps , in the act of writing .
a new courage filled her , and now she contemplated the ordeal with a tranquillity that surprised her .
the disorder and chaos of the night were passed , and she welcomed the coming day , and those that were to follow it .
as though the fates were inclined to humour her impatience , there was a telegram on her breakfast tray , dated at new york , and informing her that her husband would be in newport about the middle of the afternoon .
his western trip was finished a day earlier than he expected .
honora rang her <name> .
" <name> , i am going away . "
" oui , madame . "
" and i should like you to go with me . "
" oui , madame . "
" it is only fair that you should understand , <name> .
i am going away alone .
i am not  coming back . "
the maid 's eyes filled with sudden tears .
" oh , madame , " she cried , in a burst of loyalty , " if madame <name> permit me to stay with her ! "
honora was troubled , but her strange calmness did not forsake her .
the morning was spent in packing , which was a simple matter .
she took only such things as she needed , and left her <unk> hanging in the closets .
a few precious books of her own she chose , but the jewellery her husband had given her was put in boxes and laid upon the <unk> .
in one of these boxes was her wedding ring .
when luncheon was over , an astonished and <unk> butler packed the leffingwell silver and sent it off to storage .
there had been but one interruption in honora 's labours .
a note had arrived  from him  a note and a box .
he would obey her !
she had known he would understand , and respect her the more .
what would their love have been , without that respect ?
she shuddered to think .
and he sent her this ring , as a token of that love , as undying as the fire in its stones .
would she wear it , that in her absence she might think of him ?
honora kissed it and slipped it on her finger , where it sparkled .
the letter was beneath her gown , though she knew it by heart .
chiltern had gone at last : he could not , he said , remain in newport and not see her .
at midday she made but the pretence of a meal .
it was not until afterwards , in wandering through the lower rooms of this house , become so dear to her , that agitation seized her , and a <name> to weep .
what was she leaving so precipitately ?
and whither going ?
the world indeed was wide , and these rooms had been her home .
the day had grown <unk> , and in the dining room the gentle face seemed to look down upon her <unk> from the portrait .
the scent of the roses overpowered her .
as she listened , no sound brake the quiet of the place .
would <name> never come ?
the train was in  had been in ten minutes .
hark , the sound of wheels !
her heart beating wildly , she ran to the windows of the drawing-room and peered through the lilacs .
yes , there he was , ascending the steps .
" mrs. spence is out , i suppose , " she heard him say to the butler , who followed with his bag .
" no , sir , she 's is the drawing-room . "
the sight of him , with his air of satisfaction and importance , proved an unexpected tonic to her strength .
it was as though he had brought into the room , <unk> behind him , all the horrors of her marriage , and she marvelled and shuddered anew at the thought of the years of that sufferance .
" well , i 'm back , " he said , " and we 've made a great killing , as i wrote you .
they were easier than i expected . "
he came forward for the usual <unk> kiss , but she recoiled , and it was then that his eye seemed to grasp the significance of her travelling suit and veil , and he glanced at her face .
" what 's up ?
where are you going ? "
he demanded .
" has anything happened ? "
" everything , " she said , and it was then , suddenly , that she felt the store of her resolution begin to ebb , and she trembled .
" <name> , i am going away . "
he stopped short , and thrust his hands into the pockets of his checked trousers .
" going away , " he repeated .
" where ? "
" i do n't know , " said honora ; " i 'm going away . "
as though to cap the climax of tragedy , he smiled as he produced his cigarette case .
and she was swept , as it were , by a <name> flame that deprived her for the moment of speech .
" well , " he said complacently , " there 's no accounting for women .
a case of nerves  eh , honora ?
been hitting the pace a little too hard , i guess . "
he lighted a match , <unk> unaware of the quality of her look .
" all of us have to get <unk> up once in a while .
i need it myself .
i 've had to drink a case of scotch whiskey out west to get this deal through .
now what 's the name of that new boat with everything on her from a cafe to a stock exchange ?
a <name> name . "
" i do n't know , " said honora .
she had answered automatically .
to the imminent peril of one of the <unk> of mrs. <unk> 's chairs , he sat down on it , placed his hands on his knees , flung back his head , and blew the smoke towards the ceiling .
still she stared at him , as in a state of <unk> .
" instead of going off to one of those <unk> doctors , let me <unk> for you , " he said .
" i 've handled some nervous men in my time , and i guess nervous women are n't much different .
you 've had these little attacks before , and they blow over  do n't they ?
wing owes me a vacation .
if i do say it myself , there are not five men in new york who would have pulled off this deal for him .
now the proposition i was going to make to you is this : that we get <unk> in a cabin de <unk> on that <name> boat , hire an automobile on the other side , and do up europe .
it 's a sort of a handicap never to have been over there . "
" oh , you 're making it very hard for me , <name> , " she cried .
" i might have known that you could n't understand , that you never could understand  why i am going away .
i 've lived with you all this time , and you do not know me any better than you know  the <unk> .
i 'm going away from you  forever . "
in spite of herself , she ended with an uncontrollable sob .
" forever ! "
he repeated , but he continued to smoke and to look at her without any evidences of emotion , very much as though he had received an ultimatum in a business transaction .
and then there crept into his expression something of a complacent pity that braced her to continue .
" why ? "
he asked .
" because  because i do n't love you .
because you do n't love me .
you don't know what love is  you never <name> . "
" but we 're married , " he said .
" we get along all right . "
" oh , ca n't you see that that makes it all the worse ! "
she cried .
" i can stand it no longer .
i ca n't live with you  i wo n't live with you .
i 'm of no use to you  you 're sufficient unto yourself .
it was all a frightful mistake .
i brought nothing into your life , and i take nothing out of it .
we are strangers  we have always been so .
i am not even your housekeeper .
your whole interest in life is in your business , and you come home to read the newspapers and to sleep !
home !
the very word is a mockery .
if you had to choose between me and your business you wouldn't hesitate an instant .
and i  i have been starved .
it is n't your fault , perhaps , that you do n't understand that a woman needs something more than <unk> and jewels and  and trips abroad .
her only possible compensation for living with a man is love .
love  and you have n't the faintest <name> of it .
it is n't your fault , perhaps .
it 's my fault for marrying you .
i did n't know any better . "
she paused with her breast heaving .
he rose and walked over to the fireplace and flicked his ashes into it before he spoke .
his calmness maddened her .
" why did n't you say something about this before ? "
he asked .
" because i did n't know it  i did n't realize it  until now . "
" when you married me , " he went on , " you had an idea that you were going to live in a house on fifth avenue with a ballroom , did n't you ? "
" yes , " said honora .
" i do not say i am not to blame .
i was a fool .
my standards were false .
in spite of the fact that my aunt and uncle are the most <unk> people that ever lived  perhaps because of it  i knew nothing of the values of life .
i have but one thing to say in my defence .
i thought i loved you , and that you could give me  what every woman needs . "
" you were never satisfied from the first , " he retorted .
" you wanted money and position  a mania with american women .
i 've made a success that few men of my age can duplicate .
and even now you are not satisfied when i come back to tell you that i have money enough to snap my fingers at half these people you know . "
" how , " asked honora , " how did you make it ? "
" what do you mean ? "
he asked .
she turned away from him with a gesture of weariness .
" no , you would n't understand that , either , <name> . "
it was not until then that he showed feeling .
" somebody has been talking to you about this deal .
i 'm not surprised .
a lot of these people are angry because we did n't let them in .
what have they been saying ? "
he demanded .
her eyes flashed .
" nobody has spoken to me on the subject , " she said .
" i only know what i have read , and what you have told me .
in the first place , you deceived the stockholders of these railways into believing their property was worthless , and in the second place , you intend to sell it to the public for much more than it is worth . "
at first he stared at her in surprise .
then he laughed .
" by <name> , you 'd make something of a financier yourself , honora , " he exclaimed .
and seeing that she did not answer , continued : " well , you've got it about right , only it 's easier said than done .
it takes brains .
that 's what business is  a survival of the fittest .
if you do n't do the other man , he 'll do you . "
he opened the cigarette case once more .
" and now , " he said , " let me give you a little piece of advice .
it 's a good motto for a woman not to meddle with what does n't concern her .
it isn't her business to make the money , but to spend it ; and she can usually do that to the <name> 's taste . "
" a high ideal ? "
she exclaimed .
" you ought to have some notion of where that ideal came from , " he retorted .
" you were all for getting <name> , in order to compete with these people .
now you 've got what you want  " " and i am going to throw it away .
that is like a woman , is n't it ? "
he glanced at her , and then at his watch .
" see here , honora , i ought to go over to mr. wing 's .
i wired him i 'd be there at <unk> . "
" do n't let me keep you , " she replied .
" by gad , you are pale ! "
he said .
" what 's got into the women these days ?
they never used to have these confounded nerves .
well , if you are bent on it , i suppose there 's no use trying to stop you .
go off somewhere and take a rest , and when you come back you 'll see things differently . "
she held out her hand .
" good-by , <name> , " she said .
" i wanted you to know that i did n't  bear you any ill-will  that i blame myself as much as you .
more , if anything .
i <name> you <name> be happy  i know you <name> .
but i must ask you to believe me when i say that i <name> n't come back .
i  i am leaving all the valuable things you gave me .
you <name> find them on my <unk> .
and i wanted to tell you that my uncle sent me a little legacy from my <unk> unexpected one  that makes me independent . "
he did not take her hand , but was staring at her now , incredulously .
" you mean you are actually going ? "
he exclaimed .
" yes . "
" but  what shall i say to mr. wing ?
what <name> he think ? "
despite the ache in her heart , she smiled .
" does it make any difference what mr. wing thinks ? "
she asked gently .
" need he know ?
is n't this a matter which concerns us alone ?
i shall go off , and after a certain time people <name> understand that i am not coming back . "
" but  have you considered that it may interfere with my prospects ? "
he asked .
" why should it ?
you are invaluable to mr. wing .
he ca n't afford to dispense with your services just because you <name> be divorced .
that would be ridiculous .
some of his own associates are divorced . "
" divorced ! "
he cried , and she saw that he had grown <name> white .
" on what grounds ?
have you been  " he did not finish .
" no , " she said , " you need fear no scandal .
there <name> be nothing in any way harmful to your  prospects . "
" what can i do ? "
he said , though more to himself than to her .
her quick ear detected in his voice a note of relief .
and yet , he struck in her , standing helplessly smoking in the middle of the floor , chords of pity .
" you can do nothing , <name> , " she said .
" if you lived with me from now to the <unk> you could n't make me love you , nor could you love me  the way i must be loved .
try to realize it .
the wrench is what you dread .
after it is over you <name> be much more contented , much happier , than you have been with me .
believe me . "
his next remark astonished her .
" what 's the use of being so damned precipitate ? "
he demanded .
" precipitate ! "
" because i can stand it no longer .
i should go mad , " she answered .
he took a turn up and down the room , stopped suddenly , and stared at her with eyes that had grown smaller .
suspicion is slow to seize the complacent .
was it possible that he had been supplanted ?
honora , with an instinct of what was coming , held up her head .
had he been angry , had he been a man , how much humiliation he would have spared her !
" so you 're in love ! "
he said .
" i might have known that something was at the bottom of this . "
she took account of and quivered at the many meanings behind his speech  meanings which he was too cowardly to voice in words .
" yes , " she answered , " i am in love  in love as i never hoped to be  as i did not think it possible to be .
my love is such that i would go through hell fire for the sake of it .
i do not expect you to believe me when i tell you that such is not the reason why i am leaving you .
if you had loved me with the least spark of passion , if i thought i were in the least bit needful to you as a woman and as a soul , as a helper and a <unk> , instead of a mere <unk> to advertise your prosperity , this would not  could not  have happened .
i love a man who would give up the world for me to-morrow .
i have but one life to live , and i am going to find happiness if i can . "
she paused , afire with an eloquence that had come unsought .
but her husband only stared at her .
she was transformed beyond his recognition .
surely he had not married this woman !
and , if the truth be told , down in his secret soul whispered a small , <unk> voice .
although he did not yet fully realize it , he was glad he had not .
honora , with an involuntary movement , pressed her handkerchief to her eyes .
" good-by , <name> , " she said .
" i  i did not expect you to understand .
if i had stayed , i should have made you miserably unhappy . "
he took her hand in a dazed manner , as though he knew not in the least what he was doing .
he muttered something and found speech impossible .
he gulped once , uncomfortably .
the english language had ceased to be a medium .
great is the force of habit !
in the emergency he reached for his cigarette case .
honora had given orders that the carriage was to wait at the door .
the servants might suspect , but that was all .
her maid had been discreet .
she <name> down her veil as she descended the steps , and told the coachman to drive to the station .
it was raining .
leaning forward from under the hood as the horses started , she took her last look at the lilacs .
chapter viii .
in which the law betrays a heart it was still raining when she got into a carriage at boston and drove under the elevated tracks , through the narrow , slippery business streets , to the hotel .
from the windows of her room , as the night fell , she looked out across the dripping foliage of the common .
below her , and robbed from that sacred ground , were the little granite buildings that housed the entrances to the <unk> , and for a long time she stood watching the people crowding into these .
most of them had homes to go to !
in the gathering gloom the <unk> shone , casting yellow streaks on the glistening pavement ; wagons and carriages plunged into the <unk> at the corner ; pedestrians dodged and slipped ; lightnings flashed from overhead wires , and clanging trolley cars pushed their greater bulk through the mass .
and presently the higher <unk> and more ominous <name> of an ambulance sounded on its way to the scene of an accident .
it was <name> who ordered her dinner and pressed her to eat .
but she had no heart for food .
in her bright sitting-room , with the shades tightly drawn , an inexpressible loneliness assailed her .
a large engraving of a picture of a sentimental school <name> on the wall : she could not bear to look at it , and yet her eyes , from time to time , were fatally drawn thither .
it was of a young girl taking leave of her lover , in early <name> times , before entering the arena .
it haunted honora , and wrought upon her imagination to such a pitch that she went into her bedroom to write .
for a long time nothing more was written of the letter than " dear uncle <name> and aunt <name> " : what to say to them ?
" i do not know what you <name> think of me .
i do not know , to-night , what to think of myself .
i have left <name> .
it is not because he was cruel to me , or untrue .
he does not love me , nor i him .
i can not expect you , who have known the happiness of marriage , to realize the tortures of it without love .
my pain in telling you this now is all the greater because i realize your belief as to the sacredness of the tie  and it is not your fault that you did not <unk> that belief into me .
i have had to live and to think and to suffer for myself .
i do not attempt to account for my action , and i hesitate to lay the blame upon the modern conditions and atmosphere in which i lived ; for i feel that , above all things , i must be honest with myself .
" my marriage with <name> was a frightful mistake , and i have grown slowly to realize it , until life with him became insupportable .
since he does not love me , since his one interest is his business , my departure makes no great difference to him .
" dear aunt <name> and uncle <name> , i realize that i owe you much  everything that i am .
i do not expect you to understand or to <unk> what i have done .
i only beg that you <name> continue to  love your niece , " honora . "
she tried to review this letter .
incoherent though it were and incomplete , in her present state of mind she was able to add but a few words as a postscript .
" i <name> write you my plans in a day or two , when i see my way more clearly .
i would fly to you  but i can not .
i am going to get a divorce . "
she sat for a time picturing the scene in the sitting-room when they should read it , and a longing which was almost irresistible seized her to go back to that shelter .
one force alone held her in misery where she was ,  her love for chiltern ; it <name> her on to suffer the horrors of exile and publicity .
when she suffered most , his image rose before her , and she kissed the ring on her hand .
where was he now , on this rainy night ?
on the seas ?
at the thought she heard again the <unk> and the <unk> .
her sleep was fitful .
many times she went over again her talk with <name> , and she surprised herself by wondering what he had thought and felt since her departure .
and ever and anon she was startled out of <unk> dreams by the clamour of <unk> trolley cars on their ceaseless round passing below .
at last came the slumber of exhaustion .
it was nine o'clock when she awoke and faced the distasteful task she had set herself for the day .
in her predicament she descended to the office , where the face of one of the clerks attracted her , and she waited until he was unoccupied .
" i should like you to tell me  the name of some reputable lawyer , " she said .
" certainly , mrs. spence , " he replied , and honora was startled at the sound of her name .
she might have realized that he would know her .
" i suppose a young lawyer would do  if the matter is not very important . "
" oh , no ! "
she cried , blushing to her temples .
" a young lawyer would do very well . "
the clerk reflected .
he glanced at honora again ; and later in the day she divined what had been going on in his mind .
" well , " he said , " there are a great many .
i happen to think of mr. wentworth , because he was in the hotel this morning .
he is in the <unk> building . "
she thanked him hurriedly , and was driven to the <unk> building , through the <unk> street that faced the still dripping trees of the common .
mounting in the elevator , she read on the glass door amongst the names of the four members of the firm that of <name> wentworth , and suddenly found herself face to face with the young man , in his private office .
he was well <unk> and deeply tanned , and he rose to meet her with a smile that revealed a line of perfect white teeth .
" how do you do , mrs .
spence ? "
he said .
" i did not think , when i met you at mrs. <unk> 's , that i should see you so soon in boston .
wo n't you sit down ? "
honora sat down .
there seemed nothing else to do .
she remembered him perfectly now , and she realized that the <unk> clerk had meant to send her to a gentleman .
" i thought , " she faltered , " i thought i was coming to a  a stranger .
they gave me your address at the hotel  when i asked for a lawyer . "
" perhaps , " suggested mr. wentworth , delicately , " perhaps you would prefer to go to some one else .
i can give you any number of addresses , if you like . "
she looked up at him gratefully .
he seemed very human and understanding ,  very honourable .
he belonged to her generation , after all , and she feared an older man .
" if you <name> be kind enough to listen to me , i think i <name> stay here .
it is only a matter of  of knowledge of the law . "
she looked at him again , and the pathos of her smile went straight to his heart .
for mr. wentworth possessed that organ , although he did not wear it on his sleeve .
he crossed the room , closed the door , and sat down beside her .
" anything i can do , " he said .
she glanced at him once more , helplessly .
" i do not know how to tell you , " she began .
" it all seems so dreadful . "
she paused , but he had the lawyer 's gift of silence  of sympathetic silence .
" i want to get a divorce from my husband . "
if mr. wentworth was surprised , he concealed it admirably .
his attitude of sympathy did not change , but he managed to ask her , in a business-like tone which she welcomed :  " on what grounds ? "
" i was going to ask you that question , " said honora .
this time mr. wentworth was surprised  genuinely so , and he showed it .
" but , my dear mrs. spence , " he protested , " you must remember that  that i know nothing of the case . "
" what are the grounds one can get divorced on ? "
she asked .
he coloured a little under his tan .
" they are different in different states , " he replied .
" i think  perhaps  the best way would be to read you the massachusetts statutes . "
" no  wait a moment , " she said .
" it 's very simple , after all , what i have to tell you .
i do n't love my husband , and he does n't love me , and it has become torture to live together .
i have left him with his knowledge and consent , and he understands that i <name> get a divorce . "
mr. wentworth appeared to be pondering  perhaps not wholly on the legal aspects of the case thus naively presented .
whatever may have been his private comments , they were hidden .
he pronounced <unk> , and a little absently , the word " desertion . "
" if the case could possibly be construed as desertion on your husband's part , you could probably get a divorce in three years in massachusetts . "
" three years ! "
cried honora , appalled .
" i could never wait three years ! "
she did not remark the young lawyer 's smile , which revealed a greater knowledge of the world than one would have suspected .
he said nothing , however .
" three years ! "
she repeated .
" why , it ca n't be , mr. wentworth .
there are the <unk>  she was mrs. <unk> , you remember .
and  and mrs. rindge  it was scarcely a year before  " he had the <name> to nod gravely , and to pretend not to notice the confusion in which she halted .
lawyers , even young ones with white teeth and clear eyes , are apt to be a little cynical .
he had doubtless seen from the beginning that there was a man in the background .
it was not his business to comment or to preach .
" some of the western states <name> <unk> on  on much easier terms , " he said politely .
" if you care to wait , i <name> go into our library and look up the laws of those states . "
" i wish you would , " answered honora .
" i do n't think i could bear to spend three years in such  in such an anomalous condition .
and at any rate i should much rather go west , out of sight , and have it all as quickly over with as possible . "
he bowed , and departed on his quest .
and honora waited , at moments growing hot at the recollection of her conversation with him .
why  she asked herself should the law make it so difficult , and subject her to such humiliation in a course which she felt to be right and natural and <name> ?
finally , her thoughts becoming too painful , she got up and looked out of the window .
and far below her , through the mist , she beheld the <unk> of boston 's illustrious dead which her cabman had pointed out to her as he passed .
she did not hear the door open as mr. wentworth returned , and she started at the sound of his voice .
" i take it for granted that you are really serious in this matter , mrs. spence , " he said .
" oh ! "
she exclaimed .
" and that you have thoroughly reflected , " he continued <unk> .
evidently , in spite of the cold impartiality of the law , a new england conscience had assailed him in the library .
" i can not take er  the responsibility of advising you as to a course of action .
you have asked me the laws of certain western states as to divorce i <name> read them . "
an office boy followed him , deposited several volumes on the <unk> , and mr. wentworth read from them in a voice magnificently judicial .
" there 's not much choice , is there ? "
she faltered , when he had finished .
he smiled .
" as places of residence  " he began , in an attempt to relieve the pathos .
" oh , i did n't mean that , " she cried .
" exile is  is exile . "
she flushed .
after a few moments of hesitation she named at random a state the laws of which required a six months ' residence .
she contemplated him .
" i hardly dare to ask you to give me the name of some reputable lawyer out there . "
he had looked for an instant into her eyes .
men of the law are not invulnerable , particularly at mr. wentworth 's age , and new england consciences to the contrary notwithstanding .
in spite of himself , her eyes had made him a partisan : an accomplice , he told himself afterwards .
" really , mrs. spence , " he began , and caught another appealing look .
he remembered the husband now , and a lecture on finance in the <unk> smoking room which <name> spence had delivered , and which had grated on boston sensibility .
" it is only right to tell you that our firm does not  does not  take divorce cases  as a rule .
not that we are taking this one , " he added hurriedly .
" but as a friend  " " oh , thank you ! "
said honora .
" merely as a friend who would be glad to do you a service , " he continued , " i <name> , during the day , try to get you the name of  of as reputable a lawyer as possible in that place . "
and mr. wentworth paused , as red as though he had asked her to marry him .
" how good of you ! "
she cried .
" i shall be at the <unk> until this evening . "
he escorted her through the corridor , bowed her into the elevator , and her spirits had risen perceptibly as she got into her cab and returned to the hotel .
there , she studied railroad <unk> .
one confidant was enough , and she dared not even ask the head <name> the way to a locality where  it was well known  <unk> were sold across a counter .
and as she worked over the intricacies of this problem the word her husband had applied to her action recurred to her  precipitate .
no doubt mr. wentworth , too , had thought her precipitate .
nearly every important act of her life had been precipitate .
but she was conscious in this instance of no regret .
delay , she felt , would have killed her .
let her exile begin at once .
she had scarcely finished luncheon when mr. wentworth was announced .
for reasons best known to himself he had come in person ; and he handed her , written on a card , the name of the honourable <name> beckwith .
" i 'll have to confess i do n't know much about him , mrs. spence , " he said , " except that he has been in congress , and is one of the prominent lawyers of that state . "
the gift of <unk> sympathy and assistance was peculiarly honora 's .
and if some one had predicted that morning to mr. wentworth that before nightfall he would not only have put a <name> in distress on the <unk> to obtaining a western divorce ( which he had hitherto looked upon as disgraceful ) , but that likewise he would miss his train for <unk> crossing , buy the <name> 's tickets , and see her off at the south station for chicago , he would have regarded the prophet as a lunatic .
but that is precisely what mr. wentworth did .
and when , as her train pulled out , honora bade him <unk> , she felt the tug at her <unk> which comes at parting with an old friend .
" and anything i can do for you here in the east , while  while you are out there , be sure to let me know , " he said .
she promised and waved at him from the platform as he stood motionless , staring after her .
romance had spent a whole day in boston !
and with mr. <name> wentworth , of all people !
fortunately for the sanity of the human race , the tension of grief is variable .
honora , closed in her stateroom , eased herself that night by writing a long , if somewhat <unk> , letter to chiltern ; and was able , the next day , to read the greater portion of a novel .
it was only when she arrived in chicago , after nightfall , that loneliness again assailed her .
she was within nine hours  so the <unk> said  of st. <name> !
of all her trials , the homesickness which she experienced as she drove through the deserted streets of the metropolis of the middle west was perhaps the worst .
a great city on <name> night !
what traveller has not felt the depressing effect of it ?
and , so far as the incoming traveller is concerned , chicago does not put her best foot forward .
the way from the station to the <unk> hotel was hacked and bruised  so it seemed  by the cruel battle of trade .
and she stared , in a kind of fascination that increased the ache in her heart ; at the ugliness and cruelty of the twentieth century .
to have imagination is unquestionably to possess a great capacity for suffering , and honora was paying the penalty for hers .
it ran riot now .
the huge buildings towered like formless monsters against the blackness of the sky under the sickly blue of the electric lights , across the dirty , <unk> pavements , strange black human figures seemed to wander aimlessly : an elevated train thundered overhead .
and presently she found herself the tenant of two rooms in that vast refuge of the homeless , the modern hotel , where she sat until the small hours looking down upon the myriad lights of the shore front , and out beyond them on the black waters of an inland sea .
... ... ... ... ... ... ... .. from newport to <unk> city , in a state not far from the pacific tier , is something of a transition in less than a week , though in modern life we should be surprised at nothing .
limited trains are wonderful enough ; but what shall be said of the modern mind , that travels faster than light ?
and much too fast for the pages of a chronicle .
<name> washington and the good ladies of her acquaintance knew nothing about the upper waters of the missouri , and the words " for better , for worse , for richer , for poorer " were not merely literature to them .
<unk> <unk> change tout <unk> ' , although there are yet certain <unk> to be eliminated .
in these enlightened times , if in one week a <name> is not entirely at home with husband number one , in the next week she may have travelled in comparative comfort some two-thirds across a continent , and be on the <unk> to husband number two .
why travel ?
why have to put up with all this useless expense and worry and waste of time ?
why not have one 's divorce sent , <unk> , to one 's door , or establish a new branch of the post-office department ?
american enterprise has surely <unk> in this .
seated in a <unk> rocking-chair that rocked on a track of its own , and thus saved the <unk> hotel carpet , the honourable <name> beckwith patiently explained the vexatious process demanded by his particular sovereign state before she should consent to cut the <unk> knot of marriage .
and his state  the honourable <name> remarked  was in the very <unk> of enlightenment in this respect : practically all that she demanded was that ladies in mrs. spence 's predicament should become , pro <unk> , her citizens .
married misery did not exist in the honourable <name> 's state , amongst her own <unk> <unk> citizens .
and , by a wise provision in the constitution of our glorious american union , no one state could tie the nuptial knot so tight that another state could not cut it at a blow .
six months ' residence , and a whole year before the divorce could be granted !
honora looked at the plush rocking-chair , the <unk> carpet , the inevitable ice-water on the marble-topped table , and the picture of a <name> the shape of a <unk> bottle playing tennis in the late <unk> , and sighed .
for one who is sensitive to surroundings , that room was a torture chamber .
" but mr. beckwith , " she exclaimed , " i never could spend a year here !
is n't there a  house i could get that is a  a little  a little better furnished ?
and then there is a certain publicity about staying at a hotel . "
the honourable <name> might have been justly called the friend of ladies in a temporary condition of loneliness .
his mission in life was not merely that of a <unk> , but his natural goodness led him to perform a hundred acts of kindness to make as comfortable as possible the purgatory of the unfortunates under his charge .
he was a man of a remarkable appearance , and not to be lightly forgotten .
his hair , above all , fascinated honora , and she found her eyes continually returning to it .
so incredibly short it was , and so incredibly stiff , that it reminded her of the needle points on the cylinder of an old-fashioned <unk> ; and she wondered , if it were properly inserted , what would be the <unk> <name> .
the honourable <name> 's head was like a cannon-ball painted white .
across the top of it ( a blemish that would undoubtedly have spoiled the tune ) was a long scar ,  a relic of one of the gentleman 's many personal difficulties .
he who made the <unk> , honora reflected , must have been a strong man .
the honourable <name> , indeed , had fought his way upward through life to the congress of the united states ; and many were the harrowing tales of frontier life he told honora in the long <name> evenings when the <unk> came down the river valley .
they would fill a book ; unfortunately , not this book .
the growing responsibilities of taking care of the lonely ladies that came in increasing <name> to <unk> city from the <unk> portions of the continent had at length compelled him to give up his congressional career .
the honourable <name> was unmarried ; and , he told honora , not likely to become so .
he was thus at once human and invulnerable , a high priest dedicated to freedom .
it is needless to say that the plush rocking-chair and the picture of the <unk> <name> did not jar on his <unk> .
like an eminent physician who has never himself experienced <unk> , the honourable <name> firmly believed that he understood the trouble from which his client was suffering .
he had seen many cases of it in ladies from the atlantic coast : the first had surprised him , no doubt .
<unk> city , though it contained the great boon , was not <unk> .
being a keen student of human nature , he rightly supposed that she would not care to join the colony , but he thought it his duty to mention that there was a colony .
honora repeated the word .
" out there , " he said , waving his cigar to the westward , " some of the ladies have ranches . "
some of the gentlemen , too , he added , for it appeared that exiles were not confined to one sex .
" it 's social  a little too social , i guess , " declared mr. beckwith , " for you . "
a delicate compliment of differentiation that honora accepted gravely .
" they 've got a <unk> , and they burn a good deal of electricity first and last .
they do n't bother <unk> city much .
once in a while , in the <name> , they come in a bunch to the theatre .
soon as i looked at you i knew you would n't want to go there . "
her exclamation was sufficiently eloquent .
" i 've got just the thing for you , " he said .
" it looks a little as if i was reaching out into the sanitarium business .
are you acquainted by any chance with mrs. <unk> , who married a fellow named <unk> ? "
he asked , taking momentarily out of his mouth the cigar he was smoking by permission .
honora confessed , with no great enthusiasm , that she knew the present mrs. <unk> .
not the least of her <unk> had been to listen to a partial recapitulation , by the honourable <name> , of the ladies he had assisted to a transfer of husbands .
what , indeed , had these ladies to do with her ?
she felt that the very mention of them tended to soil the pure garments of her martyrdom .
" what i was going to say was this , " the honourable <name> continued .
" mrs. <unk>  that is to say mrs. <unk>  could n't stand this hotel any more than you , and she felt like you do about the colony , so she rented a little house up on <unk> street and furnished it from the east .
i took the furniture off her hands : it 's still in the house , by the way , which has n't been rented .
for i figured it out that another <name> would be coming along with the same notions .
now you can look at the house any time you like . "
although she had to overcome the distaste of its <unk> , the house , or rather the furniture , was too much of a find in <unk> city to be resisted .
it had but six rooms , and was of wood , and painted grey , like its twin beside it .
but mrs. <unk> had removed the <unk> <unk> in the front door , deftly hidden the highly ornamental steam <unk> , and made other <unk> and improvements , including the white <unk> that still contained the <name> 's <name> reading fifty or more <unk> french novels and plays .
<unk> first care , after taking possession , was to order her maid to remove these from her sight : but it is to be feared that they found their way , directly , to <name> 's room .
honora would have liked to <unk> the house ; and yet , at the same time , she thanked her stars for it .
mr. <unk> <unk> found her a cook , and on thursday evening she sat down to supper in her <name> dining room .
she had found a temporary haven , at last .
suddenly she remembered that it was an anniversary .
one week ago that day , in the old garden at <unk> , had occurred the momentous event that had changed the current of her life !
chapter ix .
<unk> street there was a little <unk> porch before honora 's front door , and had she chosen she might have followed the example of her neighbours and sat there in the evenings .
she preferred to watch the life about her from the window-seat in the little parlour .
the word exile suggests , perhaps , to those who have never tried it , empty wastes , isolation , loneliness .
she had been prepared for these things , and <unk> street was a shock to her : in sending her there at this crisis in her life fate had perpetrated nothing less than a huge practical joke .
next door , for instance , in the twin house to hers , <unk> in the face of liberal divorce laws , was a young couple with five children .
honora counted them , from the eldest ones that ran over her little grass plot on their way to and from the public school , to the youngest that spent much of his time gazing skyward from a <unk> on the sidewalk .
six days of the week , about six o'clock in the evening , there was a celebration in the family .
father came home from work !
he was a <unk> young man whom a fortnight in the woods might have helped wonderfully  a clerk in the big department store .
he <unk> happiness .
when opposite honora 's front door he would open his arms  the signal for a race across her lawn .
sometimes it was the little girl , with <unk> the colour of pulled molasses <name> , who won the prize of the first kiss : again it was her brother , a year her <name> ; and when he was raised it was seen that the seat of his trousers was obviously double .
but each of the five received a reward , and the baby was invariably lifted out of the <unk> .
and finally there was a conjugal kiss on the <unk> porch .
the wife was a <unk> little body .
in the mornings , at the side windows , honora heard her singing as she worked , and sometimes the sun struck with a blinding flash the pan she was in the act of shining .
and one day she looked up and nodded and smiled .
strange indeed was the effect upon our heroine of that greeting !
it amazed honora herself .
a strange current ran through her and left her hot , and even as she smiled and nodded back , <unk> tears rose scalding to her eyes .
what was it ?
why was it ?
she went downstairs to the little bookcase , filled now with volumes that were not trash .
for <name> 's sake , she would try to improve herself this <name> by reading serious things .
but between her eyes and the book was the little woman 's smile .
a month before , at newport , how little she would have valued it .
one morning , as honora was starting out for her lonely walk  that usually led her to the bare <name> banks of the great river  she ran across her neighbour on the sidewalk .
the little woman was settling the baby for his <unk> , and she gave honora the same dazzling smile .
" good morning , mrs. spence , " she said .
" good morning , " replied honora , and in her strange confusion she leaned over the carriage .
" oh , what a beautiful baby ! "
" is n't he ! "
cried the little woman .
" of all of 'em , i think he 's the prize .
his father says so .
i guess , " she added , " i guess it was because i did n't know so much about 'em when they first began to come .
you take my word for it , the best way is to leave 'em alone .
do n't <unk> 'em .
it 's hard to keep your hands off 'em , but it 's right . "
" i 'm sure of it , " said honora , who was very red .
they made a strange contrast as they stood on that new street , with its new <unk> brick <unk> and white stone <unk> , and new little trees set out in front of new little houses : mrs. mayo ( for such , <unk> cook had informed her , was her name ) in a housekeeper 's apron and a <unk> , and honora , almost a head taller , in a walking costume of dark grey that would have done justice to fifth avenue .
the admiration in the little woman 's eyes was undisguised .
" you 're getting a <name> , i hear , " she said , after a moment .
" a <name> ? "
repeated honora .
" a <name> of divorce , " explained mrs. mayo .
honora was conscious of conflicting emotions : astonishment , resentment , and  most curiously  of relief that the little woman knew it .
" yes , " she answered .
but mrs. mayo did not appear to notice or resent her brevity .
" i took a fancy to you the minute i saw you , " she said .
" i ca n't say as much for the other <unk> that was here last year .
but i made up my mind that it must be a mighty mean man who would treat you badly . "
honora stood as though rooted to the pavement .
she found a reply impossible .
" when i think of my luck , " her neighbour continued , " i 'm almost ashamed .
we were married on fifteen dollars a week .
of course there have been trials , we must always expect that ; and we 've had to work hard , but  it has n't hurt us . "
she paused and looked up at honora , and added <unk> : " there !
i should n't have said anything .
it 's mean of me to talk of my happiness .
i 'll drop in some afternoon  if you 'll let me  when i get through my work , " said the little woman .
" i wish you would , " replied honora .
she had much to think of on her walk that morning , and new resolutions to make .
here was happiness growing and thriving , so far as she could see , without any of that rarer nourishment she had once thought so necessary .
and she had come two thousand miles to behold it .
she walked many miles , as a part of the <unk> and discipline to which she had set herself .
her haunting horror in this place , as she thought of the colony of which mr. beckwith had spoken and of mrs. <unk> row of french novels , was degeneration .
she was resolved to return to chiltern a better and a wiser and a truer woman , <unk> by the ordeal .
at the outskirts of the town she halted by the river 's bank , breathing deeply of the pure air of the vast plains that surrounded her .
she was seated that afternoon at her desk in the sitting-room upstairs when she heard the tinkle of the door-bell , and remembered her neighbour 's promise to call .
with something of a pang she pushed back her chair .
since the episode of the morning , the friendship of the little woman had grown to have a definite value ; for it was no small thing , in honora 's situation , to feel the presence of a warm heart next door .
all day she had been thinking of mrs. mayo and her strange happiness , and longing to talk with her again , and dreading it .
and while she was bracing herself for the trial <name> entered with a card .
" tell mrs. mayo i shall be down in a minute , " she said .
it was not a <name> , <name> replied , but a monsieur .
honora took the card .
for a long time she sat staring at it , while <name> waited .
it read : mr. <name> <name> .
" madame <name> see monsieur ? "
a great sculptor once said to the statesman who was to be his model : " wear your old coat .
there is as much of a man in the back of his old coat , i think , as there is in his face . "
as honora halted on the threshold , <name> was standing looking out of the <unk> plate-glass window , and his back was to her .
she was suddenly stricken .
not since she had been a child , not even in the weeks just passed , had she felt that pain .
and as a child , <unk> seized her  as a lost child , when darkness is setting in , and the <name> fails and distance <unk> .
scalding tears welled into her eyes as she seized the frame of the door , but it must have been her breathing that he heard .
he turned and crossed the room to her as she had known he would , and she clung to him as she had so often done in days gone by when , hurt and bruised , he had rescued and soothed her .
for the moment , the delusion that his power was still limitless prevailed , and her <name> whole again , so many times had he mended a world all awry .
he led her to the window-seat and gently disengaged her hands from his shoulders and took one of them and held it between his own .
he did not speak , for his was a rare intuition ; and gradually her hand ceased to tremble , and the uncontrollable sobs that shook her became less frequent .
" why did you come ?
why did you come ? "
she cried .
" to see you , honora . "
" but you might have  warned me . "
" yes , " he said , " it 's true , i might . "
she <name> her hand away , and gazed steadfastly at his face .
" why are n't you angry ? "
she said .
" you do n't believe in what i have done  you do n't sympathize with it  you do n't understand it . "
" i have come here to try , " he said .
she shook her head .
" you ca n't  you ca n't  you never could . "
" perhaps , " he answered , " it may not be so difficult as you think . "
grown calmer , she considered this .
what did he mean by it ?
to imply a knowledge of herself ?
" it <name> be useless , " she said <unk> .
" no , " he said , " it <name> not be useless . "
she considered this also , and took the broader meaning that such acts are not wasted .
" what do you intend to try to do ? "
she asked .
he smiled a little .
" to listen to as much as you care to tell me , honora . "
she looked at him again , and an <unk> thought slipped in between her larger anxieties .
wherever he went , how extraordinarily he seemed to <unk> with his surroundings .
at silverdale , and in the drawing-room of the new york house , and in the little parlour in this far western town .
what was it ?
his permanence ?
was it his power ?
she felt that , but it was a strange kind of power  not like other men 's .
she felt , as she sat there beside him , that his was a power more difficult to combat .
that to defeat it was at once to make it stronger , and to grow weaker .
she summoned her pride , she summoned her wrongs : she summoned the ego which had winged its triumphant flight far above his kindly , <unk> eye .
he had the ability to make her taste defeat in the very hour of victory .
and she knew that , when she fell , he would be there in his strength to lift her up .
" did  did they tell you to come ? "
she asked .
" there was no question of that , honora .
i was away when  when they learned you were here .
as soon as i returned , i came . "
" tell me how they feel , " she said , in a low voice .
" they think only of you .
and the thought that you are unhappy <unk> all others .
they believe that it is to them you should have come , if you were in trouble instead of coming here . "
" how could i ? "
she cried .
" how can you ask ?
that is what makes it so hard , that i can not be with them now .
but i should only have made them still more unhappy , if i had gone .
they would not have understood  they can not understand who have every reason to believe in marriage , why those to whom it has been a mockery and a torture should be driven to divorce . "
" why divorce ? "
he said .
" do you mean  do you mean that you wish me to give you the reasons why i felt justified in leaving my husband ? "
" not unless you care to , " he replied .
" i have no right to demand them .
i only ask you to remember , honora , that you have not explained these reasons very clearly in your letters to your aunt and uncle .
they do not understand them .
your uncle was unable , on many accounts , to come here ; and he thought that  that as an old friend , you might be willing to talk to me . "
" i ca n't live with  with my husband , " she cried .
" i do n't love him , and he does n't love me .
he does n't know what love is . "
<name> <name> glanced at her , but she was too absorbed then to see the thing in his eyes .
he made no comment .
" we have n't the same tastes , nor  nor the same way of looking at things  the same views about making money  for instance .
we became absolute strangers .
what more is there to say ? "
she added , a little defiantly .
" your husband committed no  flagrant offence against you ? "
he inquired .
" that would have made him human , at least , " she cried .
" it would have proved that he could feel  something .
no , all he cares for in the world is to make money , and he does n't care how he makes it .
no woman with an atom of soul can live with a man like that . "
if <name> <name> deemed this statement a trifle revolutionary , he did not say so .
" so you just  left him , " he said .
" yes , " said honora .
" he did n't care .
he was rather relieved than otherwise .
if i had lived with him till i died , i could n't have made him happy . "
" you tried , and failed , " said <name> .
she flushed .
" i could n't have made him happier , " she declared , correcting herself .
" he has no <name> of what real happiness is .
he thinks he is happy , he does n't need me .
he 'll be much more  contented without me .
i have nothing against him .
i was to blame for marrying him , i know .
but i have only one life to live , and i ca n't throw it away , <name> , i ca n't .
and i ca n't believe that a woman and a man were intended to live together without love .
it is too horrible .
surely that is n't your idea of marriage ! "
" my idea of marriage is n't worth very much , i 'm afraid , " he said .
" if i talked about it , i should have to confine myself to theories and  and dreams . "
" the moment i saw your card , <name> , i knew why you had come here , " she said , trying to steady her voice .
" it was to induce me to go back to my husband .
you do n't know how it hurts me to give you pain .
i love you  i love you as i love uncle <name> and aunt <name> .
you are a part of me .
but oh , you ca n't understand !
i knew you could not .
you have never made any mistakes  you have never lived .
it is useless .
i wo n't go back to him .
if you stayed here for weeks you could not make me change my mind . "
he was silent .
" you think that i could have prevented  this , if i had been less selfish , " she said .
" where you are concerned , honora , i have but one <name> , " he answered , " and that is to see you happy  in the best sense of the term .
if i could induce you to go back and give your husband another trial , i should return with a lighter heart .
you ask me whether i think you have been selfish .
i answer frankly that i think you have .
i do n't pretend to say your husband has not been selfish also .
neither of you have ever tried , apparently , to make your marriage a success .
it ca n't be done without an honest effort .
you have abandoned the most serious and sacred enterprise in the world as lightly as though it had been a piece of embroidery .
all that i can gather from your remarks is that you have left your husband because you have grown tired of him . "
" yes , " said honora , " and you can never realize how tired , unless you knew him as i did .
when love dies , it turns into hate . "
he rose , and walked to the other end of the room , and turned .
" could you be induced , " he said , " for the sake of your aunt and uncle , if not for your own , to consider a legal separation ? "
for an instant she stared at him hopelessly , and then she buried her face in her hands .
" no , " she cried .
" no , i could n't .
you do n't know what you ask . "
he went to her , and laid his hand lightly on her shoulder .
" i think i do , " he said .
there was a moment 's tense silence , and then she got to her feet and looked at him proudly .
" yes , " she cried , " it is true .
and i am not ashamed of it .
i have discovered what love is , and what life is , and i am going to take them while i can . "
she saw the blood slowly leave his face , and his hands tighten .
it was not until then that she guessed at the depth of his wound , and knew that it was <unk> .
for him had been reserved this supreme irony , that he should come here to plead for her husband and learn from her own lips that she loved another man .
she was suddenly filled with awe , though he turned away from her that she might not see his face : and she sought in vain for words .
she touched his hand , fearfully , and now it was he who trembled .
" <name> , " she exclaimed , " why do you bother with me ?
i  i am what i am .
i ca n't help it .
i was made so .
i can not tell you that i am sorry for what i have done  for what i am going to do .
i <name> not lie to you  and you forced me to speak .
i know that you do n't understand , and that i caused you pain , and that i shall cause  them pain .
it may be selfishness  i do n't know .
god alone knows .
whatever it is , it is stronger than i .
it is what i am .
though i were to be thrown into eternal fire i would not renounce it . "
she looked at him again , and her breath caught .
while she had been speaking , he had changed .
there was a fire in his eyes she had never seen before , in all the years she had known him .
" honora , " he said quietly , " the man who has done this is a scoundrel . "
she stared at him , doubting her senses , her pupils wide with terror .
" how dare you , <name> !
how dare you ! "
she cried .
" i dare to speak the truth , " he said , and crossed the room to where his hat was lying and picked it up .
she watched him as in a trance .
then he came back to her .
" some day , perhaps , you <name> forgive me for saying that , honora .
i <name> that day <name> come , although i shall never regret having said it .
i have caused you pain .
sometimes , it seems , pain is unavoidable .
i <name> you <name> remember that , with the exception of your aunt and uncle , you have no better friend than i .
nothing can alter that friendship , wherever you go , whatever you do .
<unk> . "
he caught her hand , held it for a moment in his own , and the door had closed before she realized that he had gone .
for a few moments she stood motionless where he had left her , and then she went slowly up the stairs to her own room ... . chapter x .
the price of freedom had he , <name> chiltern , been <unk> from all the high pulpits of the world , honora 's belief in him could not have been shaken .
<unk> and the knights of the round table to the contrary , there is no chivalry so exalted as that of a woman who loves , no courage higher , no endurance greater .
her knowledge is complete ; and hers the supreme <name> that is unmoved by <unk> and unbelief .
she alone knows .
the old chiltern did not belong to her : hers was the new man sprung <unk> from the sacred fire of their love ; and in that fire she , too , had been born again .
<name>  even <name> had no power to share such a <name> , though what he had said of chiltern had wounded her  wounded her because <name> , of all others , should <unk> and condemn him .
sometimes she <name> consolation from the thought that <name> had never seen him .
but she knew he could not understand him , or her , or what they had passed through : that kind of understanding comes alone through experience .
in the long days that followed she thought much about <name> , and failed to comprehend her feelings towards him .
she told herself that she ought to hate him for what he had so cruelly said , and at times indeed her resentment was akin to hatred : again , his face rose before her as she had seen it when he had left her , and she was swept by an incomprehensible wave of tenderness and reverence .
and yet  paradox of <unk>  chiltern possessed her !
on the days when his letters came it was as his <unk> that the sun shone to give her light in darkness , and she went about the house with a song on her lips .
they were filled , these letters , with an <unk> of which she drank <unk> to behold visions , and the weariness of her exile fell away .
the <unk> of high purpose .
never was love on such a plane !
he lifting her ,  no <name> in this ; and she  by a magic power of <unk> at which she never ceased to wonder  sustaining him .
by her aid he would make something of himself which would be worthy of her .
at last he had the incentive to enable him to take his place in the world .
he pictured their future life at grenoble until her heart was strained with yearning for it to begin .
here would be duty ,  let him who would <unk> it , duty and love combined with a wondrous happiness .
he at a man 's labour , she at a woman 's ; labour not for themselves alone , but for others .
a paradise such as never was heard of  a <unk> paradise , and the reward of courage .
he told her he could not go to grenoble now and begin the life without her .
until that blessed time he would remain a wanderer , avoiding the haunts of men .
first he had <unk> in the <unk> , and then camped and shot in canada ; and again , as <name> <name> on apace , had chartered another yacht , a larger one , and sailed away for the west indies , whence the letters came , stamped in strange ports , and sometimes as many as five together .
he , too , was in exile until his regeneration should begin .
well he might be at such a time .
one bright day in early <name> honora , returning from her walk across the bleak plains in the <name> of letters , found newspapers and periodicals instead , addressed in an unknown hand .
it matters not whose hand : honora never sought to know .
she had long regarded as inevitable this <unk> phase of her martyrdom , and the long nights of tears when entire paragraphs of the loathed stuff she had burned ran ceaselessly in her mind .
would she had burned it before reading it !
an <unk> curiosity had seized her , and she had read and read again until it was beyond the reach of fire .
save for its effect upon honora , it is immaterial to this chronicle .
it was merely the heaviest of her heavy payments for <name> .
but what , she asked herself shamefully , would be its effect upon chiltern ?
her face burned that she should doubt his loyalty and love ; and yet  the question returned .
there had been a sketch of <name> , dwelling upon the prominence into which he had sprung through his connection with mr. wing .
there had been a sketch of her ; and how she had taken what the writer was pleased to call society by storm : it had been intimated , with a cruelty known only to writers of such paragraphs , that ambition to marry a chiltern had been her motive !
there had been a sketch of chiltern 's career , in carefully veiled but thoroughly comprehensible language , which might have made a <unk> shudder .
this , of course , she bore best of all ; or , let it be said rather , that it cost her the least suffering .
was it not she who had changed and redeemed him ?
what tortured her most was the intimation that chiltern 's family connections were bringing pressure to bear upon him to save him from this supremest of all his follies .
and when she thought of this the strange eyes and baffling expression of mrs. grainger rose before her .
was it true ?
and if true , would chiltern resist , even as she , honora , had resisted , loyally ?
might this love for her not be another of his mad caprices ?
how honora hated herself for the thought that thus <unk> returned at this period of snows and blasts !
it was <name> .
had he seen the newspapers ?
he had not , for he was cruising : he had , for of course they had been sent him .
and he must have received , from his relatives , protesting letters .
a fortnight passed , and her mail contained nothing from him !
perhaps something had happened to his yacht !
visions of shipwreck cause her to scan the newspapers for storms at sea ,  but the shipwreck that haunted her most was that of her happiness .
how easy it is to doubt in exile , with happiness so far away !
one morning , when the wind dashed the snow against her windows , she found it impossible to rise .
if the big doctor suspected the cause of her illness , <name> knew it .
the maid tended her day and night , and sought , with the tact of her nation , to console and reassure her .
the little woman next door came and sat by her bedside .
cruel and infinitely happy little woman , filled with compassion , who brought delicacies in the making of which she had spent precious hours , and which honora could not eat !
the lord , when he had made mrs. mayo , had mercifully withheld the gift of imagination .
one topic filled her , she lived to one end : her <name> and <name> were husband and children , and she talked continually of their goodness and <unk> , of their <unk> , of their health , of their likes and dislikes , of their accomplishments and defects , until one day a surprising thing happened .
surprising for mrs. mayo .
" oh , do n't ! "
cried honora , suddenly .
" oh , do n't !
i ca n't bear it . "
" what is it ? "
cried mrs. mayo , frightened out of her wits .
" a turn ?
shall i telephone for the doctor ? "
" no , " relied honora , " but  but i ca n't talk any more  to-day . "
she apologized on the morrow , as she held mrs. mayo 's hand .
" it  it was your happiness , " she said ; " i was unstrung .
i could n't listen to it .
forgive me . "
the little woman burst into tears , and kissed her as she sat in bed .
" forgive you , <unk> ! "
she cried .
" i never thought . "
" it has been so easy for you , " honora faltered .
" yes , it has .
i ought to thank god , and i do  every night . "
she looked long and earnestly , through her tears , at the young <name> from the far away east as she lay against the lace pillows , her paleness enhanced by the pink gown , her dark hair in two great <unk> on her shoulders .
" and to think how pretty you are ! "
she exclaimed .
it was thus she expressed her opinion of mankind in general , outside of her own family circle .
once she had passionately desired beauty , the high school and the story of <name> of <name> notwithstanding .
now she began to look at it askance , as a fatal gift ; and to pity , rather than envy , its possessors .
as a <unk> , mrs. mayo raised geraniums and carnations in her front cellar , near the furnace , and once in a while <name> , with the <unk> hair , or <unk> <name> <name> , would come puffing up honora 's stairs under the weight of a flower-pot and deposit it triumphantly on the table at honora 's bedside .
<name> <name> did not object to being kissed : he had , at least , grown to accept the process as one of the unaccountable mysteries of life .
but something happened to him one afternoon , on the occasion of his giving proof of an intellect which may eventually bring him , in the footsteps of his great namesake , to the white house .
entering honora 's front door , he saw on the hall table a number of letters which the cook ( not gifted with his brains ) had left there .
he seized them in one fat hand , while with the other he hugged the flower-pot to his breast , mounted the steps , and arrived , breathless but radiant , on the threshold of the beautiful <name> 's room , and there calamity overtook him in the shape of one of the thousand articles which are left on the floor purposely to trip up little boys .
great was the disaster .
letters , geranium , pieces of flower-pot , a quantity of black earth , and a howling <name> <name> <unk> the floor .
and similar episodes , in his brief experience with this world , had not brought rewards .
it was from sheer amazement that his tears ceased to flow  amazement and lack of breath  for the beautiful <name> sprang up and seized him in her arms , and called <name> , who eventually brought a white and gold box .
and while <name> sat consuming its contents in ecstasy he suddenly realized that the beautiful <name> had forgotten him .
she had picked up the letters , every one , and stood reading them with parted lips and staring eyes .
it was <name> who saved him from a violent illness , closing the box and leading him downstairs , and whispered something incomprehensible in his ear as she pointed him homeward .
" <name> <unk> <unk>  c'est <name> , mon <name> . "
there was a reason why chiltern 's letters had not arrived , and great were honora 's <unk> and penitence .
with a party of englishmen he had gone up into the interior of a central american country to visit some famous ruins .
he sent her photographs of them , and of the englishmen , and of himself .
yes , he had seen the newspapers .
if she had not seen them , she was not to read them if they came to her .
and if she had , she was to remember that their love was too sacred to be soiled , and too perfect to be troubled .
as for himself , as she knew , he was a changed man , who thought of his former life with loathing .
she had made him clean , and filled him with a new strength .
the <name> passed .
the last snow melted on the little grass plot , which changed by patches from brown to <name> green ; and the children ran over it again , and tracked it in the soft places , but honora only smiled .
warm , still days were interspersed between the <name> ones , when the sky was turquoise blue , when the very river banks were steeped in new colours , when the distant , shadowy mountains became real .
<name> ran riot within her .
if he thought with loathing on his former life , so did she .
only a year ago she had been penned up in a new york street in that <unk> of her own making , hemmed in by surroundings which she had now learned to detest from her soul .
a few more penalties remained to be paid , and the heaviest of these was her letter to her aunt and uncle .
even as they had accepted other things in life , so had they accepted the hardest of all to bear  <unk> divorce .
a memorable letter her uncle <name> had written her after peter's return to tell them that remonstrances were useless !
she was their daughter in all but name , and they would not forsake her .
when she should have obtained her divorce , she should go back to them .
their house , which had been her home , should always remain so .
honora wept and pondered long over that letter .
should she write and tell them the truth , as she had told <name> ?
it was not because she was ashamed of the truth that she had kept it from them throughout the <name> : it was because she wished to spare them as long as possible .
<unk> circumstance of all , that a love so divine as hers should not be understood by them , and should cause them infinite pain !
the weeks and months slipped by .
their letters , after that first one , were such as she had always received from them : accounts of the weather , and of the doings of her friends at home .
but now the time was at hand when she must prepare them for her marriage with chiltern ; for they would expect her in st. <name> , and she could not go there .
and if she wrote them , they might try to stop the marriage , or at least to delay it for some years .
was it possible that a lingering doubt remained in her mind that to postpone her happiness would perhaps be to lose it ?
in her exile she had learned enough to know that a divorced woman is like a <unk> ship at sea , at the <name> of wind and wave and current .
she could not go back to her life in st. <name> : her situation there would be unbearable : her friends would not be the same friends .
no , she had crossed her rubicon and destroyed the bridge deep within her she felt that delay would be fatal , both to her and chiltern .
long enough had the banner of their love been trailed in the dust .
summer came again , with its <unk> and its dragging , interminable weeks : <unk> summer , when mrs. mayo quite frankly appeared at her side window in a dressing <unk> , and honora longed to do the same .
but time never stands absolutely still , and the day arrived when mr. beckwith called in a carriage .
honora , with an audibly beating heart , got into it , and they drove down town , past the department store where mr. mayo spent his days , and new blocks of banks and business houses that flanked the wide street , where the roaring and clanging of the <unk> trolley cars resounded .
honora could not define her sensations  excitement and shame and fear and <name> and <name> were so commingled .
the colours of the red and yellow brick had never been so brilliant in the <name> .
they stopped before the new court-house and climbed the granite steps .
in her sensitive state , honora thought that some of the people paused to look after them , and that some were smiling .
one woman , she thought , looked compassionate .
within , they crossed the marble pavement , the honourable <name> handed her into an elevator , and when it stopped she followed him as in a dream to an <unk> door marked with a legend she did not read .
within was an office , with leather chairs , a large oak desk , a <unk> , and portraits of grave legal gentlemen on the wall .
" this is judge <unk> 's office , " explained the honourable <name> .
" he'll let you stay here until the case is called . "
" is he the judge  before whom  the case is to be tried ? "
asked honora .
" he surely is , " answered the honourable <name> .
" <unk> 's a good friend of mine .
in fact , i may say , without exaggeration , i had something to do with his election .
now you must n't get <unk> , " he added .
" it isn't anything like as bad as goin ' to the dentist .
it do n't amount to shucks , as we used to say in missouri . "
with these cheerful words of encouragement he slipped out of a side door into what was evidently the court room , for honora heard a droning .
after a long interval he reappeared and beckoned her with a crooked finger .
she arose and followed him into the court room .
all was bustle and confusion there , and her counsel whispered that they were breaking up for the day .
the judge was stretching himself ; several men who must have been lawyers , and with whom mr. beckwith was exchanging <unk> behind the railing , were arranging their books and papers ; some of the people were leaving , and others talking in groups about the room .
the honourable <name> whispered to the judge , a tall , lank , <unk> gentleman with <unk> hair , who nodded .
honora was led forward .
the honourable <name> , standing very close to the judge and some distance from her , read in a low voice something that she could not catch  <unk> the petition .
it was all quite as vague to honora as the trial of the <name> of hearts ; the buzzing of the groups still continued around the court room , and nobody appeared in the least interested .
this was a comfort , though it robbed the ceremony of all vestige of reality .
it seemed incredible that the majestic and awful institution of the ages could be dissolved with no smoke or fire , with such infinite indifference , and so much spitting .
what was the use of all the pomp and circumstance and ceremony to tie the knot if it could be cut in the routine of a day 's business ?
the solemn fact that she was being put under oath meant nothing to her .
this , too , was <unk> and mumbled .
she found herself , trembling , answering questions now from her counsel , now from the judge ; and it is to be doubted to this day whether either heard her answers .
most convenient and considerate questions they were .
when and where she was married , how long she had lived with her husband , what happened when they ceased to live together , and had he failed ever since to contribute to her support ?
mercifully , mr. beckwith was in the habit of <unk> his words beforehand .
a reputable citizen of <unk> city was produced to prove her residence , and somebody cried out something , not loudly , in which she heard the name of spence mentioned twice .
the judge said , " take your decree , " and picked up a roll of papers and walked away .
her knees became weak , she looked around her dizzily , and beheld the triumphant professional smile of the honourable <name> beckwith .
" it did n't hurt much , did it ? "
he asked .
" allow me to congratulate you . "
" is it  is it all over ? "
she said , quite dazed .
" just like that , " he said .
" you 're free . "
" free ! "
the word rang in her ears as she drove back to the little house that had been her home .
the honourable <name> lifted his felt hat as he handed her out of the carriage , and said he would call again in the evening to see if he could do anything further for her .
<name> , who had been watching from the window , opened the door , and led her mistress into the parlour .
" it 's  it 's all over , <name> , " she said .
" mon dieu , madame , " said <name> , " c'est simple comme <unk> ! "
volume 7 .
chapter xi .
in which it is all done over again all morning she had gazed on the shining reaches of the hudson , their colour deepening to blue as she neared the sea .
a <unk> volume of <name> , with his name on the <unk> , lay in her lap .
and two lines she repeated softly to herself  two lines that held a vision : " he was as the sun in his fierce youth , as terrible and lovely as a tempest ; " she summoned him out of the chaos of the past , and the past became the present , and he stood before her as though in the flesh .
nay , she heard his voice , his laugh , she even recognized again the smouldering flames in his eyes as he glanced into hers , and his characteristic manners and gestures .
honora wondered .
in vain , during those long months of exile had she tried to reconstruct him thus the vision in its <unk> would not come : rare , fleeting , partial , and tantalizing glimpses she had been vouchsafed , it is true .
the whole of him had been withheld until this breathless hour before the <name> of her happiness .
yet , though his own impatient spirit had fared forth to meet her with this premature gift of his attributes , she had to fight the growing fear within her .
now that the days of suffering were as they had not been , insistent questions <unk> in her ears : was she entitled to the joys to come ?
what had she done to earn them ?
had hers not been an attempt , on a gigantic scale , to cheat the fates ?
nor could she say whether this feeling were a wholly natural failure to grasp a future too big , or the old sense of the unreality of events that had followed her so persistently .
the hudson disappeared .
factories , bridges , <unk> week-end resorts , <unk> houses , and blocks of new buildings were scattered here and there .
the train was running on a causeway between miles of tenements where women and children , overtaken by <unk> , <name> out of the windows : then the blackness of the tunnel , and honora closed her eyes .
four minutes , three minutes , two minutes ... .
the motion ceased .
at the steps of the car a uniformed station <name> seized her bag ; and she started to walk down the long , narrow platform .
suddenly she halted .
" drop anything , miss ? "
inquired the <name> .
" no , " answered honora , faintly .
he looked at her in concern , and she began to walk on again , more slowly .
it had suddenly come over her that the man she was going to meet she scarcely knew !
shyness seized her , a shyness that bordered on panic .
and what was he really like , that she should put her whole trust in him ?
she glanced behind her : that way was closed : she had a mad <name> to get away , to hide , to think .
it must have been an <unk> that had possessed her all these months .
the <name> was looking again , and he voiced her predicament .
" there 's only one way out , miss . "
and then , amongst the figures massed behind the exit in the <unk> , she saw him , his face <unk> with the sea tan , his crisp , curly head bared , his eyes alight with a terrifying welcome ; and a tremor of a fear akin to ecstasy ran through her : the fear of the women of days gone by whose courage carried them to the postern or the strand , and fainted there .
she could have taken no step farther  and there was no need .
new strength flowed from the hand she held that was to <name> her on and on .
he spoke her name .
he led her passive , obedient , through the press to the side street , and then he paused and looked into her burning face .
" i have you at last , " he said .
" are you happy ? "
" i do n't know , " she faltered .
" oh , <name> , it all seems so strange !
i do n't know what i have done . "
" i know , " he said <unk> ; " but to save my soul i ca n't believe it . "
she watched him , bewildered , while he put her maid into a cab , and by an effort roused herself .
" where are you going , <name> ? "
" to get married , " he replied promptly .
she pulled down her veil .
" please be sensible , " she implored .
" i 've arranged to go to a hotel . "
" what hotel ? "
" the  the <unk> , " she said .
the place had come to her memory on the train .
" it 's very nice and  and quiet  so i 've been told .
and i've telegraphed for my rooms . "
" i 'll humour you this once , " he answered , and gave the order .
she got into the carriage .
it had blue cushions with the familiar smell of carriage <unk> , and the people in the street still hurried about their business as though nothing in particular were happening .
the horses started , and some forgotten key in her <name> was touched as chiltern raised her veil again .
" you 'll tear it , <name> , " she said , and perforce lifted it herself .
her eyes met his  and she awoke .
not to memories or regrets , but to the future , for the recording <name> had mercifully destroyed his book .
" did you miss me ? "
she said .
" miss you !
my god , honora , how can you ask ?
when i look back upon these last months , i do n't see how i ever passed through them .
and you are changed , " he said .
" i could not have believed it possible , but you are .
you are  you are finer . "
he had chosen his word exquisitely .
and then , as they trotted <unk> through <name> avenue , he strained her in his arms and kissed her .
" oh , <name> ! "
she cried , <name> , as she disengaged , herself , " you must n't  here ! "
" you 're free ! "
he exclaimed .
" you 're mine at last !
i ca n't believe it !
look at me , and tell me so . "
she tried .
" yes , " she faltered .
" yes  what ? "
" yes .
i  i am yours . "
she looked out of the window to avoid those eyes .
was this new york , or jerusalem ?
were these the streets through which she had driven and trod in her former life ?
her whole soul cried out denial .
no episode , no accusing reminiscences stood out  not one : the very corners were changed .
would it all change back again if he were to lessen the insistent pressure on the hand in her lap .
" honora ? "
" yes ? "
she answered , with a start .
" you missed me ?
look at me and tell me the truth . "
" the truth ! "
she faltered , and shuddered .
the contrast was too great  the horror of it too great for her to speak of .
the pen of <name> had not been adequate .
" do n't ask me , <name> , " she begged , " i ca n't talk about it  i never shall be able to talk about it .
if i had not loved you , i should have died . "
how deeply he felt and understood and sympathized she knew by the quivering pressure on her hand .
ah , if he had not !
if he had failed to grasp the meaning of her purgatory .
" you are wonderful , honora , " was what he said in a voice broken by emotion .
she thanked him with one fleeting , tearful glance that was as a <name> of all her priceless possessions .
the carriage stopped , but it was some moments before they realized it .
" you may come up in a little while , " she whispered , " and lunch with me  if you like . "
" if i like ! "
he repeated .
but she was on the sidewalk , following the <name> boy into the cool , <unk> area of the hotel .
a smiling clerk handed her a pen , and set the new universe to rocking .
" mrs. leffingwell , i presume ?
we have your telegram . "
mrs. leffingwell !
who was that person ?
for an instant she stood blankly holding the pen , and then she wrote rapidly , if a trifle unsteadily : " mrs. leffingwell and maid . "
a pause .
where was her home ?
then she added the words , " st .
<name> . "
her rooms were above the narrow canon of the side street , looking over the roofs of the inevitable <unk> fronts opposite .
while <name> , in the adjoining chamber , unpacked her bag , honora stood gazing out of the sitting-room windows , trying to collect her thoughts .
her spirits had unaccountably fallen , the sense of <unk> that had pursued her all these months overtaken her once more .
never , never , she told herself , would she enter a hotel again alone ; and when at last he came she clung to him with a passion that thrilled him the more because he could not understand it .
" <name>  you <name> care for me ? "
she cried .
he kissed away her tears .
he could not follow her ; he only knew that what he held to him was a woman such as he had never known before .
tender , and again strangely and fiercely tender : an instrument of such miraculous delicacy as to respond , quivering , to the lightest touch ; an harmonious and perfect blending of strength and weakness , of <name> and sorrow ,  of all the warring elements in the world .
what he felt was the supreme masculine <name> of possession .
at last they sat down on either side of the white cloth the waiter had laid , for even the gods must eat .
not that our <unk> mortals ate much on this occasion .
<name> presided once more , and after the feast was over gently led them down the slopes until certain practical affairs began to take shape in the mind of the man .
presently he looked at his watch , and then at the woman , and made a suggestion .
" marry you now  this of afternoon ! "
she cried , aghast .
" <name> , are you in your right senses ? "
" yes , " he said , " i 'm reasonable for the first time in my life . "
she laughed , and immediately became serious .
but when she sought to marshal her arguments , she found that they had fled .
" oh , but i could n't , " she answered .
" and besides , there are so many things i ought to do .
i  i have n't any clothes . "
but this was a plea he could not be expected to recognize .
he saw no reason why she could not buy as many as she wanted after the ceremony .
" is that all ? "
he demanded .
" no  that is n't all .
ca n't you see that  that we ought to wait , <name> ? "
" no , " he exclaimed , " no i ca n't see it .
i can only see that every moment of waiting would be a misery for us both .
i can only see that the situation , as it is to-day , is an intolerable one for you . "
she had not expected him to see this .
" there are others to be thought of , " she said , after a moment's hesitation .
" what others ? "
the answer she should have made died on her lips .
" it seems <unk> , <name> . "
" <unk> ! "
he cried , and pushed back his chair and rose .
" what's <unk> about it ?
to leave you here alone in a hotel in new york would not only be <unk> , but senseless .
how long would you put it off ?
a week  a month  a year ?
where would you go in the meantime , and what would you do ? "
" but your friends , <name>  and mine ? "
" friends !
what have they got to do with it ? "
it was the woman , now , who for a moment turned practical  and for the man 's sake .
she loved , and the fair fabric of the future which they were to weave together , and the plans with which his letters had been filled and of which she had dreamed in exile , had become to-day as the stuff of which <unk> are made .
as she looked up at him , eternity itself did not seem long enough for the fulfilment of that love .
but he ?
would the time not come when he would demand something more ?
and suppose that something were denied ?
she tried to rouse herself , to think , to consider a situation in which her instinct had whispered just once  there must be some hidden danger : but the electric touch of his hand destroyed the process , and made her incapable of reason .
" what should we gain by a week 's or a fortnight 's delay , " he was saying , " except so much misery ? "
she looked around the hotel sitting-room , and tried to imagine the desolation of it , stripped of his presence .
why not ?
there was reason in what he said .
and yet , if she had known it , it was not to reason she yielded , but to the touch of his hand .
" we <name> be married to-day , " he decreed .
" i have planned it all .
i have bought the <unk> ' , the yacht which i chartered last <name> .
she is here .
we 'll go off on her together , away from the world , for as long as you like .
and then , " he ended triumphantly , " then we 'll go back to grenoble and begin our life . "
" and begin our life ! "
she repeated .
but it was not to him that she spoke .
" <name> , i positively have to have some clothes . "
" clothes ! "
his voice expressed his contempt for the mundane thought .
" yes , clothes , " she repeated resolutely .
he looked at his watch once more .
" very well , " he said , " we 'll get 'em on the way . "
" on the way ? "
she asked .
" we 'll have to have a marriage license , i 'm afraid , " he explained apologetically .
honora grew crimson .
a marriage license !
she yielded , of course .
who could resist him ?
nor need the details of that interminable journey down the crowded artery of broadway to the centre of things be entered into .
an ignoble errand , honora thought ; and she sat very still , with flushed cheeks , in the corner of the carriage .
chiltern 's finer feelings came to her rescue .
he , too , resented this senseless demand of civilization as an indignity to their <unk> loves .
and he was a man to chafe at all restraints .
but at last the odious thing was over , grim and implacable law satisfied after he had compelled them to stand in line for an interminable period before his <unk> , and mingle with those whom he chose , in his ignorance , to call their peers .
honora felt degraded as they emerged with the hateful paper , bought at such a price .
the city hall park , with its moving streams of people , <unk> itself in her memory .
" leave me , <name> , " she said ; " i <name> take this carriage  you must get another one . "
for once , he accepted his dismissal with comparative meekness .
" when shall i come ? "
he asked .
" she smiled a little , in spite of herself .
" you may come for me at six o'clock , " she replied .
" six o'clock ! "
he exclaimed ; but accepted with resignation and closed the carriage door .
<unk> sex !
<unk> sex indeed !
honora spent a feverish afternoon , rest and reflection being things she feared .
an afternoon in familiar places ; and ( strangest of all facts to be recorded ! )
memories and regrets troubled her not at all .
her old <unk> , her old <unk> , welcomed her as one risen , radiant , from the grave ; risen , in their estimation , to a higher life .
honora knew this , and was indifferent to the wealth of meaning that lay behind their discretion .
<unk> and <unk> read the newspapers and periodicals  certain periodicals .
well they knew that the <name> they flattered was the future mrs. <name> chiltern .
nothing whatever of an indelicate nature happened .
there was no mention of where to send the <name> , or of whom to send it to .
such things as she bought on the spot were placed in her carriage .
and happiest of all <unk> , she met no one she knew .
the praise that madame <unk> lavished on honora 's figure was not flattery , because the <name> models fitted her to perfection .
a little after five she returned to her hotel , to a <name> in a high state of suppressed excitement .
and at six , the appointed fateful hour , arrayed in a new street gown of dark green cloth , she stood awaiting him .
he was no <unk> .
the <name> on the church near by was still singing from the last stroke when he knocked , flung open the door , and stood for a moment staring at her .
not that she had been shabby when he had wished to marry her at noon : no self-respecting woman is ever shabby ; not that her present costume had any of the elements of <unk> ; far from it .
being a woman , she had her thrill of triumph at his exclamation .
<name> had no need , perhaps , of a french <unk> , but it is an open question whether she would have scorned them .
honora stood motionless , but her smile for him was like the first quivering shaft of day .
he opened a box , and with a strange mixture of impetuosity and reverence came forward .
and she saw that he held in his hand a string of great , glistening pearls .
" they were my mother 's , " he said .
" i have had them <unk>  for you . "
" oh , <name> ! "
she cried .
she could find no words to express the tremor within .
and she stood passively , her eyes half closed , while he clasped the string around the lace collar that pressed the slender column of her neck and kissed her .
even the humble beings who work in hotels are responsive to unusual disturbances in the ether .
at the <unk> , a <name> note prevailed : <name> boys , porters , clerk , and cashier , proud of their sudden wisdom , were wreathed in smiles .
a new automobile , in chiltern 's colours , with his crest on the panel , was panting beside the curb .
" i meant to have had it this morning , " he apologized as he handed her in , " but it was n't ready in time . "
honora heard him , and said something in reply .
she tried in vain to rouse herself from the lethargy into which she had fallen , to cast off the spell .
up fifth avenue they sped , past meaningless houses , to the park .
the <name> air of evening was suffused with the level evening light ; and as they wound in and out under the spreading trees she caught glimpses across the shrubbery of the deepening blue of waters .
pools of mystery were her eyes .
the upper west side is a definite place on the map , and full , undoubtedly , of palpitating human joys and sorrows .
so far as honora was concerned , it might have been bagdad .
the automobile had stopped before a residence , and she found herself mounting the steps at <unk> side .
a swedish maid opened the door .
" is mr. white at home ? "
chiltern asked .
it seemed that " the reverend mr. white " was .
he appeared , a portly gentleman with frock coat and lawn tie who resembled the man in the moon .
his head , like polished <name> , increased the beaming effect of his welcome , and the hand that pressed honora 's was large and soft and warm .
but dreams are queer things , in which no events surprise us .
the reverend gentleman , as he greeted chiltern , pronounced his name with unction .
his air of hospitality , of good-fellowship , of taking the world as he found it , could not have been improved upon .
he made it apparent at once that nothing could surprise him .
it was the most natural circumstance in life that two people should arrive at his house in an automobile at half-past six in the evening and wish to get married : if they chose this method instead of the one involving awnings and policemen and <unk> relations and friends , it was none of mr. white 's affair .
he led them into the gothic sanctum at the rear of the house where the famous sermons were written that shook the <unk> of the <name> where the gentleman preached ,  the sermons that sometimes got into the newspapers .
mr. white cleared his throat .
" i am  very familiar with your name , mr. chiltern , " he said , " and it is a pleasure to be able to serve you , and the <name> who is so shortly to be your wife .
your servant arrived with your note at four o'clock .
ten minutes later , and i should have missed him . "
and then honora heard chiltern saying somewhat coldly :  " in order to save time , mr. white , i wish to tell you that mrs. leffingwell has been divorced  " the reverend mr. white put up a hand before him , and looked down at the carpet , as one who would not dwell upon painful things .
" unfortunate  ahem  mistakes <name> occur in life , mr. chiltern  in the best of lives , " he replied .
" say no more about it .
i am sure , looking at you both  " " very well then , " said chiltern <unk> , " i knew you would have to know .
and here , " he added , " is an essential paper . "
a few minutes later , in continuation of the same strange dream , honora was standing at chiltern 's side and the reverend mr. white was addressing them : what he said  apart of it at least  seemed curiously familiar .
chiltern put a ring on a finger of her <unk> hand .
it was a supreme moment in her <name>  this she knew .
between her responses she repeated it to herself , but the mighty fact refused to be registered .
and then , suddenly , rang out the words : " those whom god hath joined together let no man put asunder . "
those whom god hath joined together !
mr. white was congratulating her .
other people were in the room  the minister 's son , his wife , his brother-in-law .
she was in the street again , in the automobile , without knowing how she got there , and chiltern close beside her in the <unk> .
" my wife ! "
he whispered .
was she ?
could it be true , be lasting , be binding for ever and ever ?
her hand pressed his convulsively .
" oh , <name> ! "
she cried , " care for me  stay by me forever .
<name> you promise ? "
" i promise , honora , " he repeated .
" henceforth we are one . "
honora would have prolonged forever that honeymoon on summer seas .
in those blissful days she was content to sit by the hour watching him as , bareheaded in the damp salt breeze , he sailed the great schooner and gave sharp orders to the crew .
he was a man who would be obeyed , and even his flashes of temper pleased her .
he was her master , too , and she gloried in the fact .
by the aid of the precious light within her , she studied him .
he loved her mightily , fiercely , but withal tenderly .
with her alone he was infinitely tender , and it seemed that something in him cried out for battle against the rest of the world .
he had his way , in port and out of it .
he <unk> no opposition , and delighted to <name> , against his captain 's advice , more canvas than was wise when it blew heavily .
but the yacht , like a woman , seemed a creature of his <name> ; to know no fear when she felt his guiding hand , even though the green water ran in the scuppers .
and every day anew she scanned his face , even as he scanned the face of the waters .
what was she searching for ?
to have so much is to become miserly , to fear lest a grain of the precious store be lost .
on the second day they had anchored , for an hour or two , between the <name> headlands of a small new england port , and she had stood on the deck watching his receding figure under the flag of the gasoline launch as it made its way towards the deserted wharves .
beyond the wharves was an <unk> village street , and above the verdure rose the white cupola of the house of some prosperous sea-captain of bygone times .
honora had not wished to go ashore .
first he had begged , and then he had laughed as he had leaped into the launch .
she lay in a chaise <unk> , watching it swinging idly at the dock .
the night before he had written letters and telegrams .
once he had looked up at her as she sat with a book in her hand across the saloon , and caught her eyes .
she had been pretending not to watch him .
" wedding <unk> , " he said .
and she had smiled back at him bravely .
such was the first acknowledgment between them that the world existed .
" a little late , " he observed , smiling in his turn as he changed his pen , " but they 'll have to make allowances for the exigencies of the situation .
and they 've been after me to settle down for so many years that they ought to be thankful to get them at all .
i 've told them that after a decent period they may come to grenoble  in the late autumn .
we do n't want anybody before then , do we , honora ? "
" no , " she said faintly ; and added , " i shall always be satisfied with you alone , <name> . "
he laughed happily , and presently she went up on deck and stood with her face to the breeze .
there were no sounds save the musical beat of the water against the <unk> , and the low hum of wind on the towering vibrant sails .
one <unk> silver <name> stood out above all others .
to the northward , somewhere beyond the spot where sea and sky met in the hidden kiss of night , was newport ,  were his relations and her friends .
what did they think ?
he , at least , had no anxieties about the world , why should she ?
their defiance of it had been no greater than that of an hundred others on whom it had smiled <unk> .
but had not the others <unk> more to its conventions ?
little she cared about it , indeed , and if he had turned the prow of the <unk> ' towards the <unk> places of the earth , her <name> would have been untroubled .
one after another the days glided by , while with the sharpened senses of a great love she watched for a sign of the thing that slept in him  of the thing that had driven him home from his wanderings to <unk> his life .
when it awoke , she would have to share him ; now he was hers alone .
her feelings towards this thing did not assume the proportions of jealousy or fear ; they were merely alert , vaguely disquieting .
the sleeping thing was not a monster .
no , but it might grow into one , if its appetite were not satisfied , and blame her .
she told herself that , had he lacked ambition , she could not have loved him , and did not stop to reflect upon the completeness of her satisfaction with the viking .
he seemed , indeed , in these weeks , one whom the sea has marked for its own , and her delight in watching him as he moved about the boat never <unk> .
his nose reminded her of the prow of a ship of war , and his <unk> eyes were continually searching the horizon for an enemy .
such were her fancies .
in the early morning when he donned his <unk> bathing suit , she could never resist the temptation to follow him on deck to see him plunge into the cold ocean : it gave her a delightful little shiver  and he was made like one of the gods of <unk> .
she had discovered , too , in these intimate days , that he had the <unk> 's temperament ; she both loved and dreaded his moods .
and sometimes , when the yacht glided over smoother seas , it was his pleasure to read to her , even poetry and the great <unk> .
that he should be fond of the cruel scotch ballads she was not surprised ; but his familiarity with the book of job , and his love for it , astonished her .
it was a singular library that he had put on board the <unk> ' .
one evening when the sails flapped idly and the blocks rattled , when they had been watching in silence the flaming orange of the sunset above the <unk> camden hills , he spoke the words for which she had been waiting .
" honora , what do you say to going back to grenoble ? "
she succeeded in smiling at him .
" whenever you like , <name> , " she said .
so the bowsprit of the <unk> ' was turned <unk> ; and with every league of water they left behind them his excitement and impatience seemed to grow .
" i ca n't wait to show it to you , honora  to see you in it , " he exclaimed .
" i have so long pictured you there , and our life as it <name> be . "
chapter xii .
the entrance into <name> they had travelled through the night , and in the early morning left the express at a junction .
honora sat in the <unk> seat of the smaller train with parted lips and beating heart , gazing now and again at the <name> mists rising from the little river valley they were climbing .
chiltern was like a schoolboy .
" we 'll soon be there , " he cried , but it was nearly nine o'clock when they reached the gothic station that marked the end of the line .
it was a chiltern line , he told her , and she was already within the feudal domain .
time indeed that she awoke !
she reached the platform to confront a group of upturned , staring faces , and for the moment her courage failed her .
somehow , with chiltern 's help , she made her way to a waiting omnibus backed up against the boards .
the footman touched his hat , the <unk> coachman saluted , and they got in .
as the horses started off at a quick trot , honora saw that the group on the station platform had with one consent swung about to stare after them .
they passed through the main street of the town , lined with plate-glass windows and lively signs , and already bustling with the business of the day , through humbler thoroughfares , and presently rumbled over a bridge that spanned a rushing stream confined between the foundation walls of mills .
hundreds of yards of mills stretched away on either side ; mills with windows wide open , and within them honora heard the clicking and roaring of machinery , and saw the men and women at their daily tasks .
life was a strange thing that they should be doing this while she should be going to live in luxury at a great country place .
on one of the walls she read the legend chiltern and company .
" they still keep our name , " said <name> , " although they are in the trust . "
he pointed out to her , with an air of pride , every landmark by the roadside .
in future they were to have a new meaning  they were to be shared with her .
and he spoke of the times  as child and youth , home from the seashore or college , he had driven over the same road .
it wound to the left , behind the mills , threaded a village of neat wooden houses where the better class of operatives lived , reached the river again , and turned at last through a brick gateway , past a lodge in the dense shade of sheltering boughs , into a wooded drive that climbed , by gentle degrees , a slope .
human care for generations had given to the place a tradition .
people had lived here and loved those trees  his people .
and could it be that she was to inherit all this , with him ?
was her name really chiltern ?
the beating of her heart became a pain when in the distance through the spreading branches she caught a glimpse of the long , low outline of the house , a vision at once familiar and unreal .
how often in the months gone by had she called up the memory of the photograph she had once seen , only to doubt the more that she should ever behold that house and these trees with him by her side !
they <name> up before the door , and a venerable , <unk> butler stood gravely on the steps to welcome them .
<name> leaped out .
he was still the schoolboy .
" starling , " he said , " this is mrs .
chiltern . "
honora smiled tremulously .
" how do you do , starling ? "
she said .
" starling 's an old friend , honora .
he 's been here ever since i can remember . "
the blue eyes of the old servant were fixed on her with a strange , searching expression .
was it compassion she read in them , on this that should be the happiest of her days ?
in that instant , unaccountably , her heart went out to the old man ; and something of what he had seen , and something of what was even now passing within him , came to her <unk> .
it was as though , unexpectedly , she had found a friend  and a friend who had had no previous intentions of friendship .
" i 'm sure i wish you happiness , madame ,  and mr. <name> , he said in a voice not altogether firm .
" happiness ! "
cried <name> .
" i 've never known what it was before now , starling . "
the old man 's eyes glistened .
" and you 've come to stay , sir ? "
" all my life , starling , " said <name> .
they entered the hall .
it was wide and cool , white <unk> to the ceiling , with a dark oak floor .
at the back of it was an <unk> stairway , with a band of red carpet running up the steps , and a <unk> guard with a <unk> rail .
halfway up , the stairway divided at a landing , lighted by great triple windows of small panes .
" you may have breakfast in half an hour , starling , " said chiltern , and led honora up the stairs into the east wing , where he flung open one of the high mahogany doors on the south side .
" these are your rooms , honora .
i have had keller do them all over for you , and i <name> you'll like them .
if you do n't , we 'll change them again . "
her answer was an exclamation of delight .
there was a bedroom in pink , with <unk> satin on the walls , and an <unk> window thrust out over the garden ; a <unk> boudoir at the corner of the house , with a marble mantel before which one of <name> <name> 's <unk> had warmed her feet ; and shelves lined with <unk> books .
from its windows , across the flowering shrubbery and through the trees , she saw the gleaming waters of a lake , and the hills beyond .
from this view she turned , and caught her breath , and threw her arms about her husband's neck .
he was astonished to see that her eyes were filled with tears .
" oh , <name> , " she cried , " it 's too perfect !
it almost makes me afraid . "
" we <name> be very happy , dearest , " he said , and as he kissed her he laughed at the fates .
" i <name> so  i pray so , " she said , as she clung to him .
" but  don't laugh ,  i ca n't bear it . "
he patted her cheek .
" what a strange little girl you are ! "
he said .
" i suppose i should n't be mad about you if you were n't that way .
sometimes i wonder how many women i have married . "
she smiled at him through her tears .
" is n't that polygamy , <name> ? "
she asked .
it was all like a breathless tale out of one of the wonder books of youth .
so , at least , it seemed to honora as she stood , refreshed with a new white linen gown , hesitating on the threshold of her door before descending .
some time the <name> must ring , or the cock crow , or the <name> beckon with a wand , and she would have to go back .
back where ?
she did not know  she could not remember .
<name> dreaming by the embers , perhaps .
he was awaiting her in the little breakfast room , its glass <unk> open to the garden with the wall and the round stone seat .
the <unk> urn , the white cloth , the shining silver , the big green melons that the hot summer sun had ripened for them alone , and <name> 's eyes as they rested on her  such was her illusion .
nor was it quite dispelled when he lighted a pipe and they started to explore their <name> , wandering through chambers with , low ceilings in the old part of the house , and larger , higher apartments in the portion that was called new .
in the great darkened library , side by side against the spanish leather on the walls , <name> the portraits of his father and mother in heavy frames of gilt .
her husband was pleased that she should remain so long before them .
and for a while , as she stood lost in contemplation , he did not speak .
once she glanced at him , and then back at the stern face of the general ,  stern , yet kindly .
the eyes , <unk> under bushy brows , like <name> 's , were full of fire ; and yet the artist had made them human , too .
a dark , reddish brown , <unk> mustache and beard hid the mouth and <name> .
<name> had inherited the nose , but the father 's forehead was wider and fuller .
<name> was at once a newer type , and an older .
the face and figure of the general were characteristic of the <unk> american of the northern states , a mixture of boldness and caution and <unk> , who had won his battles in war and commerce by a certain native quality of mind .
" i never appreciated him , " said <name> at length , " until after he died  long after .
until now , in fact .
at times we were good friends , and then something he would say or do would <unk> me , and i would purposely make him angry .
he had a time and a rule for everything , and i could not bear rules .
breakfast was on the minute , an hour in his study to attend to affairs about the place , so many hours in his office at the mills , in the president 's room at the bank , vestry and <name> meetings at regular intervals .
no movement in all this country round about was ever set on foot without him .
he was one to be finally reckoned with .
and since his death , many proofs have come to me of the things he did for people of which the world was ignorant .
i have found out at last that his way of life was , in the main , the right way .
but i know now , honora , " he added soberly , slipping his hand within her arm , " i know now that without you i never could do all i intend to do . "
" oh , do n't say that ! "
she cried .
" do n't say that ! "
" why not ? "
he asked , smiling at her vehemence .
" it is not a confession of weakness .
i had the determination , it is true .
i could  i should have done something , but my deeds would have lacked the one thing needful to lift them above the commonplace  at least for me .
you are the inspiration .
with you here beside me , i feel that i can take up this work with <name> .
do you understand ? "
she pressed his hand with her arm .
" <name> , " she said slowly , " i <name> that i shall be a help , and not  not a hindrance . "
" a hindrance ! "
he exclaimed .
" you do n't know , you ca n't realize , what you are to me . "
she was silent , and when she lifted her eyes it was to rest them on the portrait of his mother .
and she seemed to read in the sweet , sad eyes a question  a question not to be put into words .
chiltern , following her gaze , did not speak : for a space they looked at the portrait together , and in silence ... . from one end of the house to the other they went , <name> reviving at the sight of familiar objects a hundred memories of his childhood ; and she trying to imagine that childhood , so different from her own , passed in this wonderful place .
in the glass cases of the gun room , among the shining , blue barrels which he had used in all parts of the world , was the little shotgun his father had had made for him when he was twelve years old .
<name> locked the door after them when they came out , and smiled as he put the key in his pocket .
" my destroying days are over , " he declared .
honora put on a linen hat and they took the gravelled path to the stables , where the horses , one by one , were brought out into the courtyard for their inspection .
in anticipation of this hour there was a blood bay for honora , which chiltern had bought in new york .
she gave a little cry of delight when she saw the horse shining in the sunlight , his nostrils in the air , his brown eyes clear , his tapering neck <unk> with veins .
and then there was the dairy , with the <unk> cows and calves ; and the hillside pastures that ran down to the river , and the farm lands where the <unk> grain was <unk> .
they came back by the path that wound through the trees and shrubbery bordering the lake to the walled garden , ablaze in the mellow sunlight with reds and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
here he left her for a while , sitting dreamily on the stone bench .
mrs. <name> chiltern , of grenoble !
over and over she repeated that name to herself , and it refused somehow to <unk> with her identity .
yet was she mistress of this fair domain ; of that house which had sheltered them race for a century , and the lines of which her eye caressed with a loving reverence ; and the chiltern pearls even then lay hidden around her throat .
her thoughts went back , at this , to the gentle <name> to whom they had belonged , and whose look began again to haunt her .
honora 's superstition startled her .
what did it mean , that look ?
she tried to recall where she had seen it before , and suddenly remembered that the eyes of the old butler had held something not unlike it .
compassionate  this was the only word that would describe it .
no , it had not proclaimed her an intruder , though it may have been ready to do so the moment before her appearance ; for there was a note of surprise in it  surprise and compassion .
this was the <name> in whose footsteps she was to walk , whose charities and household cares she was to assume !
tradition , order , observance , responsibility , authority it was difficult to imagine these as a logical part of the natural sequence of her life .
she would begin to-day , if god would only <name> her these things she had once <unk> , and that seemed now so precious .
her life  her real life would begin to-day .
why not ?
how hard she would strive to be worthy of this incomparable gift !
it was hers , hers !
she listened , but the only answer was the humming of the bees in the still <name> morning .
chiltern 's voice aroused her .
he was standing in the breakfast room talking to the old butler .
" you 're sure there were no other letters , starling , besides these bills ? "
honora became tense .
" no , sir , " she heard the butler say , and she seemed to detect in his deferential voice the note of anxiety suppressed in the other 's .
" i'm most particular about letters , sir , as one who lived so many years with your father would be .
all that came were put in your study , mr .
<name> . "
" it does n't matter , " answered chiltern , carelessly , and stepped out into the garden .
he caught sight of her , hesitated the fraction of a moment , and as he came forward again the cloud in his eyes vanished .
and yet she was aware that he was regarding her curiously .
" what , " he said gayly , " still here ? "
" it is too beautiful ! "
she cried .
" i could sit here forever . "
she lifted her face <unk> , smilingly , to his , and he stooped down and kissed it ... . to give the jealous fates not the least chance to take offence , the higher life they were to lead began at once .
and yet it seemed at times to honora as though this higher life were the gift the fates would most <unk> : a gift reserved for others , the pretensions to which were a kind of <unk> .
merriment , forgetfulness , music , the dance ; the cup of pleasure and the feast of babylon  these might more readily have been vouchsafed ; even deemed to have been bargained for .
but to take that which <unk> had been renounced  virtue , <unk> , security , respect  would this be endured ?
she went about it breathlessly , like a thief .
never was there a more exemplary household .
they rose at half-past seven , they breakfasted at a quarter after eight ; at nine , young mr. manning , the farm superintendent , was in waiting , and <name> spent two or more hours in his company , inspecting , correcting , planning ; for two thousand acres of the original chiltern estate still remained .
two thousand acres which , since the general 's death , had been at <unk> and <unk> .
the general 's study , which was <name> 's now , was piled high with new and bulky books on cattle and cultivation of the soil .
government and state and private experts came and made tests and went away again ; new machinery arrived , and <name> passed hours in the sun , often with honora by his side , <unk> it .
general chiltern had been president and founder of the grenoble national bank , and <name> took up his duties as a director .
honora sought , with an energy that had in it an element of desperation , to keep pace with her husband .
for she was determined that he should have no interests in which she did not share .
in those first days it was her dread that he might grow away from her , and instinct told her that now or never must the effort be made .
she , too , studied farming ; not from books , but from him .
in their afternoon ride along the shady river road , which was the event of her day , she encouraged him to talk of his plans and problems , that he might thus early form the habit of bringing them to her .
and the unsuspecting male in him responded , innocent of the simple subterfuge .
after an exhaustive discourse on the elements lacking in the valley soil , to which she had listened in silent intensity , he would exclaim : " by <name> , honora , you 're a continual surprise to me .
i had no idea a woman would take an interest in these things , or grasp them the way you do . "
lordly <unk> these , and she would receive them with a flush of gratitude .
nor was it ever too hot , or she too busy with household cares , for her to follow him to the scene of his operations , whatever these might be : she would gladly stand for an hour listening to a consultation with the veterinary about an <unk> cow .
her fear was lest some matter of like importance should escape her .
she had private conversations with mr. manning , that she might surprise her husband by an unsuspected knowledge .
such were her <unk> .
the housekeeper who had come up from new york was the subject of a conjugal conversation .
" i am going to send her away , <name> , " honora announced .
" i don't believe  your mother had one . "
the housekeeper 's departure was the beginning of honora 's real intimacy with starling .
<unk> , perhaps , would be a better word for the commencement of this relationship .
first of all , there was an inspection of the family treasures : the <unk> , the silver , and the <name>  <unk> , <name> worcester , and <unk> , and the priceless <unk> , of <unk> which had belonged to <name> chiltern , reserved , for great occasions only : occasions that starling knew by heart ; their dates , and the guests the <unk> had honoured .
his air was ceremonial as he laid , reverently , the sample pieces on the table before her , but it seemed to honora that he spoke as one who recalls departed glories , who held a conviction that the <unk> would never be used again .
although by unalterable custom he submitted , at breakfast , the <unk> of the day to <name> , the old butler came afterwards to honora 's boudoir during her struggle with the account books .
sometimes she would look up and surprise his eyes fixed upon her , and one day she found at her elbow a long list made out in a painstaking hand .
" what 's this , starling ? "
she asked .
" if you please , madame , " he answered , " they 're the current prices in the markets  here . "
she thanked him .
nor was his exquisite delicacy in laying stress upon the locality lost upon her .
that he realized the magnitude  for her  of the task to which she had set herself ; that he sympathized deeply with the spirit which had undertaken it , she was as sure as though he had said so .
he helped her thus in a dozen unobtrusive ways , never once recognizing her ignorance ; but he made her feel the more that that ignorance was a shameful thing not to be spoken of .
speculations upon him were irresistible .
she was continually forgetting the nature of his situation , and he grew gradually to <unk> in her mind the grenoble of the past .
she knew his principles as well as though he had spoken them  which he never did .
for him , the world had become awry ; he abhorred divorce , and that this modern <unk> had touched the house of chiltern was a calamity that had shaken the very foundations of his soul .
in spite of this , he had remained .
why ?
perhaps from habit , perhaps from love of the family and <name> ,  perhaps to see !
and having stayed , fascination had laid hold of him ,  of that she was sure ,  and his affections had <unk> become involved .
he was as one assisting at a high tragedy not unworthy of him , the outcome of which he never for an instant doubted .
and he gave honora the impression that he alone , inscrutable , could have pulled aside the curtain and revealed the end .
chapter xiii .
of the world beyond the gates honora paused in her toilet , and contemplated for a moment the white skirt that her maid presented .
" i think i 'll wear the blue <unk> to-day , <name> , " she said .
the decision for the blue <unk> was the <unk> of a struggle begun with the opening of her eyes that morning .
it was <name> , and the time was at hand when she must face the world .
might it not be delayed a little while  a week longer ?
for the remembrance of the staring eyes which had greeted her on her arrival at the station at grenoble troubled her .
it seemed to her a cruel thing that the house of god should hold such terrors for her : to-day she had a longing for it that she had never felt in her life before .
chiltern was walking in the garden , waiting for her to breakfast with him , and her pose must have had in it an element of the self-conscious when she appeared , smilingly , at the door .
" why , you 're all dressed up , " he said .
" it 's <name> , <name> . "
" so it is , " he agreed , with what may have been a studied lightness  she could not tell .
" i 'm going to church , " she said bravely .
" i ca n't say much for old <unk> , " declared her husband .
" his sermons used to arouse all the original sin in me , when i had to listen to them . "
she poured out his coffee .
" i suppose one has to take one 's clergyman as one does the weather , " she said .
" we go to church for something else besides the sermon  do n't we ? "
" i suppose so , if we go at all , " he replied .
" old <unk> <unk> a pretty heavy penalty . "
" too heavy for you ? "
she asked , and smiled at him as she handed him the cup .
" too heavy for me , " he said , returning her smile .
" to tell you the truth , honora , i had an <unk> of church in my youth , here and at school , and i 've been trying to even up ever since . "
" you 'd like me to go , would n't you , <name> ? "
she ventured , after a silence .
" indeed i should , " he answered , and again she wondered to what extent his cordiality was studied , or whether it were studied at all .
" i 'm very fond of that church , in spite of the fact that  that i may be said to <unk> my fondness . "
she laughed with him , and he became serious .
" i still contribute  the family 's share toward its support .
my father was very proud of it , but it is really my mother 's church .
it was due to her that it was built . "
thus was comedy played  and honora by no the means sure that it was a comedy .
even her alert instinct had not been able to detect the acting , and the intervening hours were spent in speculating whether her fears had not been overdone .
nevertheless , under the eyes of starling , at twenty minutes to eleven she stepped into the <name> with an outward courage , and drove down the shady avenue towards the gates .
<unk> bells were ringing as she reached the residence portion of the town , and subdued pedestrians in groups and couples made their way along the sidewalks .
they stared at her ; and she in turn , with heightened colour , stared at her coachman 's back .
after all , this first <name> would be the most difficult .
the carriage turned into a street arched by old elms , and flanked by the houses of the most prosperous townspeople .
some of these were of the old-fashioned , classic type , and others new examples of a national architecture seeking to find itself ,  white and yellow colonial , <unk> modifications of the <unk> period , and nondescript mixtures of <unk> and shingles .
each was surrounded by trim lawns and shrubbery .
the church itself was set back from the street .
it was of bluish stone , and half covered with <name> creeper .
at this point , had the opportunity for a secret retreat presented itself , honora would have embraced it , for until now she had not realized the full extent of the ordeal .
had her arrival been heralded by sounding trumpets , the sensation it caused could not have been greater .
in her <name> , the world had been forgotten ; the hum of gossip beyond the gates had not reached her .
but now , as the horses approached the curb , their restive feet clattering on the hard pavement , in the darkened interior of the church she saw faces turned , and entering worshippers pausing in the doorway .
something of what the event meant for grenoble dawned upon her : something , not all ; but all that she could bear .
if it be true that there is no courage equal to that which a great love <unk> in a woman , honora 's at that moment was sublime .
her cheeks tingled , and her knees weakened under her as she ran the <unk> to the church door , where she was met by a gentleman on whose face she read astonishment <unk> : amazement , perhaps , is not too strong a word for the sensation it conveyed to her , and it occurred to her afterwards that there was an element in it of outrage .
it was a countenance peculiarly adapted to such an expression  yellow , smooth-shaven , <unk> , with one drooping eye ; and she needed not to be told that she had encountered , at the outset , the very pillar of pillars .
the frock coat , the heavy watch chain , the <unk> boots , all combined to make a presence .
an instinctive sense of drama amongst the onlookers seemed to create a hush , as though these had been the unwilling witnesses to an approaching collision and were awaiting the crash .
the gentleman stood planted in the inner doorway , his drooping eye fixed on hers .
" i am mrs. chiltern , " she faltered .
he hesitated the fraction of an instant , but he somehow managed to make it plain that the information was superfluous .
he turned without a word and marched majestically up the aisle before her to the fourth pew from the front on the right .
there he faced about and laid a protesting hand on the carved walnut , as though <unk> himself in the sight of his god and his fellow-citizens .
honora fell on her knees .
she strove to calm herself by prayer : but the glances of a congregation focussed between her shoulder-blades seemed to burn her back , and the thought of the concentration of so many minds upon her distracted her own .
she could think of no definite prayer .
was this god 's <unk> ?
or the market-place , and she at the tail of a cart ?
and was she not <name> chiltern 's wife , entitled to his seat in the place of worship of his fathers ?
she rose from her knees , and her eyes fell on the softly glowing colours of a <unk> window : in <unk>  <name> <unk> chiltern .
<name> 's mother , the <name> in whose seat she sat .
the <unk> , a <unk> young man , came in and began turning over his music , and the choir took <unk> , in the old-fashioned ' manner .
then came the clergyman .
his beard was white , his face long and narrow and shrivelled , his forehead protruding , his eyes of the cold blue of a <name> 's sky .
the service began , and honora repeated the familiar prayers which she had learned by heart in childhood  until her attention was arrested by the words she spoke : " we have offended against thy holy laws . "
had she ?
would not god bless her marriage ?
it was not until then that she began to pray with an intensity that blotted out the world that he would not punish her if she had done wrong in his sight .
surely , if she lived henceforth in fear of him , he would let her keep this priceless love which had come to her !
and it was impossible that he should regard it as an inordinate and sinful affection  since it had filled her life with light .
as the wife of <name> chiltern she sought a blessing .
would god withhold it ?
he would not , she was sure , if they lived a sober and a righteous life .
he would take that into account , for he was just .
then she grew calmer , and it was not until after the <unk> sermon which <name> had predicted that her heart began to beat painfully once more , when the gentleman who had conducted her to her seat passed her the plate .
he inspired her with an instinctive fear ; and she tried to imagine , in contrast , the erect and soldierly figure of general chiltern performing the same office .
would he have looked on her more kindly ?
when the benediction was pronounced , she made her way out of the church with downcast eyes .
the people parted at the door to let her pass , and she quickened her step , gained the carriage at last , and drove away  seemingly leaving at her back a buzz of comment .
would she ever have the courage to do it again ?
the old butler , as he flung open the doors at her approach , seemed to be scrutinizing her .
" where 's mr. chiltern , starling ? "
she asked .
" he 's gone for a ride , madame . "
<name> had gone for a ride !
she did not see him until lunch was announced , when he came to the table in his riding clothes .
it may have been that he began to talk a little eagerly about the excursion he had made to an outlying farm and the conversation he had had with the farmer who leased it .
" his lease is out in <name> , " said chiltern , " and when i told him i thought i 'd turn the land into the rest of the estate he tried to bribe me into a renewal . "
