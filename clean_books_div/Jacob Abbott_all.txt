preface .
the history of the life of every individual who has , for any reason , attracted extensively the attention of mankind , has been written in a great variety of ways by a multitude of authors , and persons sometimes wonder why we should have so many different accounts of the same thing .
the reason is , that each one of these accounts is intended for a different set of readers , who read with ideas and purposes widely dissimilar from each other .
among the twenty millions of people in the united states , there are perhaps two millions , between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five , who wish to become acquainted , in general , with the leading events in the history of the old world , and of ancient times , but who , coming upon the stage in this land and at this period , have ideas and conceptions so widely different from those of other nations and of other times , that a mere <unk> of existing accounts is not what they require .
the story must be told expressly for them .
the things that are to be explained , the points that are to be brought out , the comparative degree of prominence to be given to the various particulars , <name> all be different , on account of the difference in the situation , the ideas , and the objects of these new readers , compared with those of the various other classes of readers which former authors have had in view .
it is for this reason , and with this view , that the present series of historical narratives is presented to the public .
the author , having had some opportunity to become acquainted with the position , the ideas , and the intellectual wants of those whom he addresses , presents the result of his labors to them , with the <name> that it may be found successful in accomplishing its design .

<name> the great died when he was quite young .
he was but thirty-two years of age when he ended his career , and as he was about twenty when he commenced it , it was only for a period of twelve years that he was actually engaged in performing the work of his life .
<name> was nearly three times as long on the great field of human action .
notwithstanding the <unk> of <name> 's career , he ran through , during that short period , a very brilliant series of exploits , which were so bold , so romantic , and which led him into such adventures in scenes of the greatest magnificence and splendor , that all the world looked on with astonishment then , and mankind have continued to read the story since , from age to age , with the greatest interest and attention .
the secret of <name> 's success was his character .
he possessed a certain combination of mental and personal attractions , which in every age gives to those who exhibit it a mysterious and almost unbounded ascendency over all within their influence .
<name> was characterized by these qualities in a very remarkable degree .
he was finely formed in person , and very prepossessing in his manners .
he was active , athletic , and full of ardor and enthusiasm in all that he did .
at the same time , he was calm , collected , and considerate in emergencies requiring caution , and thoughtful and <unk> in respect to the bearings and consequences of his acts .
he formed strong attachments , was grateful for kindnesses shown to him , considerate in respect to the feelings of all who were connected with him in any way , faithful to his friends , and generous toward his foes .
in a word , he had a <name> character , though he devoted its energies unfortunately to conquest and war .
he lived , in fact , in an age when great personal and mental powers had scarcely any other field for their exercise than this .
he entered upon his career with great ardor , and the position in which he was placed gave him the opportunity to act in it with prodigious effect .
there were several circumstances combined , in the situation in which <name> was placed , to afford him a great opportunity for the exercise of his vast powers .
his native country was on the confines of europe and <name> .
now europe and <name> were , in those days , as now , marked and distinguished by two vast masses of social and civilized life , widely dissimilar from each other .
the asiatic side was occupied by the persians , the medes , and the <unk> .
the european side by the greeks and romans .
they were separated from each other by the waters of the hellespont , the Ã¦gean sea , and the mediterranean , as <name> be seen by the map .
these waters constituted a sort of natural barrier , which kept the two races apart .
the races formed , accordingly , two vast organizations , distinct and widely different from each other , and of course rivals and enemies .
it is hard to say whether the asiatic or european civilization was the highest .
the two were so different that it is difficult to compare them .
on the asiatic side there was wealth , luxury , and splendor ; on the european , energy , genius , and force .
on the one hand were vast cities , splendid palaces , and gardens which were the wonder of the world ; on the other , strong <unk> , military roads and bridges , and compact and <unk> towns .
the persians had enormous armies , perfectly provided for , with beautiful tents , horses elegantly caparisoned , arms and munitions of war of the finest workmanship , and officers magnificently dressed , and accustomed to a life of luxury and splendor .
the greeks and romans , on the other hand , prided themselves on their compact bodies of troops , inured to hardship and thoroughly disciplined .
their officers gloried not in luxury and parade , but in the courage , the steadiness , and implicit obedience of their troops , and in their own science , skill , and powers of military calculation .
thus there was a great difference in the whole system of social and military organization in these two quarters of the globe .
now <name> was born the heir to the throne of one of the grecian kingdoms .
he possessed , in a very remarkable degree , the energy , and enterprise , and military skill so characteristic of the greeks and romans .
he organized armies , crossed the boundary between europe and <name> , and spent the twelve years of his career in a most triumphant military incursion into the very center and seat of asiatic power , destroying the asiatic armies , conquering the most splendid cities , <unk> or taking captive the kings , and princes , and generals that opposed his progress .
the whole world looked on with wonder to see such a course of conquest , pursued so successfully by so young a man , and with so small an army , gaining continual victories , as it did , over such vast <name> of foes , and making conquests of such accumulated treasures of wealth and splendor .
the name of <name> 's father was <name> .
the kingdom over which he reigned was called macedon .
macedon was in the northern part of greece .
it was a kingdom about twice as large as the state of massachusetts , and one third as large as the state of new york .
the name of <name> 's mother was olympias .
she was the daughter of the king of epirus , which was a kingdom somewhat smaller than macedon , and lying westward of it .
both macedon and epirus <name> be found upon the map at the commencement of this volume .
olympias was a woman of very strong and determined character .
<name> seemed to inherit her energy , though in his case it was combined with other qualities of a more attractive character , which his mother did not possess .
he was , of course , as the young <name> , a very important personage in his father 's court .
every one knew that at his father 's death he would become king of macedon , and he was consequently the object of a great deal of care and attention .
as he gradually advanced in the years of his boyhood , it was observed by all who knew him that he was <unk> with extraordinary qualities of mind and of character , which seemed to indicate , at a very early age , his future greatness .
although he was a <name> , he was not brought up in habits of luxury and <unk> .
this would have been contrary to all the ideas which were entertained by the greeks in those days .
they had then no <unk> , so that in battle the combatants could not stand quietly , as they can now , at a distance from the enemy , coolly discharging musketry or cannon .
in ancient battles the soldiers rushed toward each other , and fought hand to hand , in close combat , with swords , or spears , or other weapons requiring great personal strength , so that headlong bravery and muscular force were the qualities which generally carried the day .
the duties of officers , too , on the field of battle , were very different then from what they are now .
an officer now must be calm , collected , and quiet .
his business is to plan , to calculate , to direct , and arrange .
he has to do this sometimes , it is true , in circumstances of the most imminent danger , so that he must be a man of great self-possession and of undaunted courage .
but there is very little occasion for him to exert any great physical force .
in ancient times , however , the great business of the officers , certainly in all the subordinate grades , was to lead on the men , and set them an example by performing themselves deeds in which their own great personal prowess was displayed .
of course it was considered extremely important that the child destined to be a general should become robust and powerful in constitution from his earliest years , and that he should be inured to hardship and fatigue .
in the early part of <name> 's life this was the main object of attention .
the name of the nurse who had charge of our hero in his infancy was <unk> .
she did all in her power to give strength and hardihood to his constitution , while , at the same time , she treated him with kindness and gentleness .
<name> acquired a strong affection for her , and he treated her with great consideration as long as he lived .
he had a governor , also , in his early years , named <unk> , who had the general charge of his education .
as soon as he was old enough to learn , they appointed him a <unk> also , to teach him such branches as were generally taught to young princes in those days .
the name of this <unk> was lysimachus .
they had then no printed books , but there were a few writings on parchment rolls which young scholars were taught to read .
some of these writings were treatises on philosophy , others were romantic histories , <unk> the exploits of the heroes of those days  of course , with much exaggeration and embellishment .
there were also some poems , still more romantic than the histories , though generally on the same themes .
the greatest productions of this kind were the writings of <name> , an ancient poet who lived and wrote four or five hundred years before <name> 's day .
the young <name> was greatly delighted with <name> 's tales .
these tales are <unk> of the exploits and adventures of certain great warriors at the siege of <name>  a siege which lasted ten years  and they are written with so much beauty and force , they contain such admirable <unk> of character , and such graphic and vivid descriptions of romantic adventures , and picturesque and striking scenes , that they have been admired in every age by all who have learned to understand the language in which they are written .
<name> could understand them very easily , as they were written in his mother tongue .
he was greatly excited by the <unk> themselves , and pleased with the flowing smoothness of the verse in which the tales were told .
in the latter part of his course of education he was placed under the charge of aristotle , who was one of the most eminent philosophers of ancient times .
aristotle had a beautiful copy of <name> 's poems prepared expressly for <name> , taking great pains to have it <unk> with perfect correctness , and in the most elegant manner .
<name> carried this copy with him in all his campaigns .
some years afterward , when he was obtaining conquests over the persians , he took , among the spoils of one of his victories , a very beautiful and costly casket , which king <name> had used for his jewelry or for some other <name> treasures .
<name> determined to make use of this box as a <unk> for his beautiful copy of <name> , and he always carried it with him , thus protected , in all his subsequent campaigns .
<name> was full of energy and spirit , but he was , at the same time , like all who ever become truly great , of a reflective and considerate turn of mind .
he was very fond of the studies which aristotle led him to pursue , although they were of a very abstruse and difficult character .
he made great progress in metaphysical philosophy and mathematics , by which means his powers of calculation and his judgment were greatly improved .
he early evinced a great degree of ambition .
his father <name> was a powerful warrior , and made many conquests in various parts of greece , though he did not cross into <name> .
when news of <name> 's victories came into macedon , all the rest of the court would be filled with rejoicing and delight ; but <name> , on such occasions , looked thoughtful and disappointed , and complained that his father would conquer every country , and leave him nothing to do .
at one time some embassadors from the persian court arrived in macedon when <name> was away .
these embassadors saw <name> , of course , and had opportunities to converse with him .
they expected that he would be interested in hearing about the splendors , and pomp , and parade of the persian monarchy .
they had stories to tell him about the famous hanging gardens , which were artificially constructed in the most magnificent manner , on arches raised high in the air ; and about a vine made of gold , with all sorts of precious stones upon it instead of fruit , which was wrought as an ornament over the throne on which the king of persia often gave audience ; of the splendid palaces and vast cities of the persians ; and the banquets , and <unk> , and magnificent entertainments and celebrations which they used to have there .
they found , however , to their surprise , that <name> was not interested in hearing about any of these things .
he would always turn the conversation from them to inquire about the geographical position of the different persian countries , the various routes leading into the interior , the organization of the asiatic armies , their system of military tactics , and , especially , the character and habits of <unk> , the persian king .
the embassadors were very much surprised at such evidences of maturity of mind , and of <unk> and reflective powers on the part of the young <name> .
they could not help comparing him with <unk> .
" <name> , " said they , " is great , while our king is only <name> . "
the truth of the judgment which these embassadors thus formed in respect to the qualities of the young macedonian , compared with those held in highest estimation on the asiatic side , was fully confirmed in the subsequent stages of <name> 's career .
in fact , this combination of a calm and calculating <unk> , with the ardor and energy which formed the basis of his character , was one great secret of <name> 's success .
the story of bucephalus , his famous horse , illustrates this in a very striking manner .
this animal was a <unk> of very spirited character , which had been sent as a present to <name> while <name> was young .
they took the horse out into one of the parks connected with the palace , and the king , together with many of his courtiers , went out to view him .
the horse pranced about in a very furious manner , and seemed entirely unmanageable .
no one dared to mount him .
<name> , instead of being gratified at the present , was rather disposed to be displeased that they had sent him an animal of so fiery and apparently vicious a nature that nobody dared to attempt to subdue him .
in the mean time , while all the other by-standers were joining in the general condemnation of the horse , <name> stood quietly by , watching his motions , and attentively studying his character .
he perceived that a part of the difficulty was caused by the agitations which the horse experienced in so strange and new a scene , and that he appeared , also , to be somewhat frightened by his own shadow , which happened at that time to be thrown very strongly and distinctly upon the ground .
he saw other indications , also , that the high excitement which the horse felt was not <unk> , but the excess of <name> and generous impulses .
it was courage , ardor , and the consciousness of great nervous and muscular power .
<name> had decided that the horse was useless , and had given orders to have him sent back to thessaly , whence he came .
<name> was very much concerned at the prospect of losing so fine an animal .
he begged his father to allow him to make the experiment of mounting him .
<name> at first refused , thinking it very presumptuous for such a youth to attempt to subdue an animal so vicious that all his experienced horsemen and grooms condemned him ; however , he at length consented .
<name> went up to the horse and took hold of his bridle .
he patted him upon the neck , and soothed him with his voice , showing , at the same time , by his easy and unconcerned manner , that he was not in the least afraid of him .
a spirited horse knows immediately when any one approaches him in a timid or cautious manner .
he appears to look with contempt on such a master , and to determine not to submit to him .
on the contrary , horses seem to love to yield obedience to man , when the individual who <unk> the obedience possesses those qualities of coolness and courage which their instincts enable them to appreciate .
[ illustration : <name> and bucephalus . ]
at any rate , bucephalus was calmed and subdued by the presence of <name> .
he allowed himself to be caressed .
<name> turned his head in such a direction as to prevent his seeing his shadow .
he quietly and gently laid off a sort of cloak which he wore , and sprang upon the horse 's back .
then , instead of attempting to restrain him , and worrying and checking him by useless efforts to hold him in , he gave him the rein freely , and animated and encouraged him with his voice , so that the horse flew across the plains at the top of his speed , the king and the courtiers looking on , at first with fear and trembling , but soon afterward with feelings of the greatest admiration and pleasure .
after the horse had satisfied himself with his run it was easy to rein him in , and <name> returned with him in safety to the king .
the courtiers overwhelmed him with their praises and congratulations .
<name> commended him very highly : he told him that he deserved a larger kingdom than macedon to govern .
<name> 's judgment of the true character of the horse proved to be correct .
he became very <unk> and docile , yielding a ready submission to his master in every thing .
he would kneel upon his fore legs at <name> 's command , in order that he might mount more easily .
<name> retained him for a long time , and made him his favorite war horse .
a great many stories are related by the historians of those days of his sagacity and his feats of war .
whenever he was equipped for the field with his military trappings , he seemed to be highly elated with pride and pleasure , and at such times he would not allow any one but <name> to mount him .
what became of him at last is not certainly known .
there are two accounts of his end .
one is , that on a certain occasion <name> got carried too far into the midst of his enemies , on a battle field and that , after fighting desperately for some time , bucephalus made the most extreme exertions to <name> him away .
he was severely wounded again and again , and though his strength was nearly gone , he would not stop , but pressed forward till he had carried his master away to a place of safety , and that then he dropped down exhausted , and died .
it may be , however , that he did not actually die at this time , but slowly recovered ; for some historians relate that he lived to be thirty years old  which is quite an old age for a horse  and that he then died .
<name> caused him to be buried with great ceremony , and built a small city upon the spot in honor of his memory .
the name of this city was <unk> .
<name> 's character matured rapidly , and he began very early to act the part of a man .
when he was only sixteen years of age , his father , <name> , made him regent of macedon while he was absent on a great military campaign among the other states of greece .
without doubt <name> had , in this regency , the counsel and aid of high officers of state of great experience and ability .
he acted , however , himself , in this high position , with great energy and with complete success ; and , at the same time , with all that modesty of deportment , and that delicate consideration for the officers under him  who , though inferior in rank , were yet his superiors in age and experience  which his position rendered proper , but which few persons so young as he would have manifested in circumstances so well calculated to awaken the feelings of vanity and elation .
afterward , when <name> was about eighteen years old , his father took him with him on a campaign toward the south , during which <name> fought one of his great battles at <unk> , in <unk> .
in the arrangements for this battle , <name> gave the command of one of the wings of the army to <name> , while he reserved the other for himself .
he felt some solicitude in giving his young son so important a charge , but he endeavored to guard against the danger of an unfortunate result by putting the ablest generals on <name> 's side , while he reserved those on whom he could place less reliance for his own .
thus organized , the army went into battle .
<name> soon ceased to feel any solicitude for <name> 's part of the duty .
boy as he was , the young <name> acted with the utmost bravery , coolness , and discretion .
the wing which he commanded was victorious , and <name> was obliged to urge himself and the officers with him to greater exertions , to avoid being outdone by his son .
in the end <name> was completely victorious , and the result of this great battle was to make his power paramount and supreme over all the states of greece .
notwithstanding , however , the extraordinary discretion and wisdom which characterized the mind of <name> in his early years , he was often haughty and headstrong , and in cases where his pride or his resentment were aroused , he was sometimes found very impetuous and uncontrollable .
his mother olympias was of a haughty and imperious temper , and she quarreled with her husband , king <name> ; or , perhaps , it ought rather to be said that he quarreled with her .
each is said to have been unfaithful to the other , and , after a bitter contention , <name> repudiated his wife and married another <name> .
among the festivities held on the occasion of this marriage , there was a great banquet , at which <name> was present , and an incident occurred which strikingly illustrates the impetuosity of his character .
one of the guests at this banquet , in saying something complimentary to the new <name> , made use of expressions which <name> considered as in <unk> of the character of his mother and of his own birth .
his anger was immediately aroused .
he threw the cup from which he had been drinking at the offender 's head .
<unk> , for this was his name , threw his cup at <name> in return ; the guests at the table where they were sitting rose , and a scene of uproar and confusion ensued .
<name> , incensed at such an interruption of the order and <name> of the wedding feast , <name> his sword and rushed toward <name> but by some accident he stumbled and fell upon the floor .
<name> looked upon his fallen father with contempt and scorn , and exclaimed , " what a fine hero the states of greece have to lead their armies  a man that can not get across the floor without tumbling down . "
he then turned away and left the palace .
immediately afterward he joined his mother olympias , and went away with her to her native country , epirus , where the mother and son remained for a time in a state of open quarrel with the husband and father .
in the mean time <name> had been planning a great expedition into <name> .
he had arranged the affairs of his own kingdom , and had formed a strong combination among the states of greece , by which powerful armies had been raised , and he had been designated to command them .
his mind was very intently engaged in this vast enterprise .
he was in the flower of his years , and at the height of his power .
his own kingdom was in a very prosperous and thriving condition , and his ascendency over the other kingdoms and states on the european side had been fully established .
he was excited with ambition , and full of <name> .
he was proud of his son <name> , and was relying upon his efficient aid in his schemes of conquest and aggrandizement .
he had married a youthful and beautiful bride , and was surrounded by scenes of festivity , <unk> , and rejoicing .
he was looking forward to a very brilliant career considering all the deeds that he had done and all the <name> which he had acquired as only the introduction and prelude to the far more distinguished and conspicuous part which he was intending to perform .
<name> , in the mean time , ardent and impetuous , and eager for <name> as he was , looked upon the position and prospects of his father with some envy and jealousy .
he was impatient to be monarch himself .
his taking sides so promptly with his mother in the domestic quarrel was partly owing to the feeling that his father was a <unk> and an obstacle in the way of his own greatness and fame .
he felt within himself powers and capacities <unk> him to take his father's place , and reap for himself the harvest of <name> and power which seemed to await the grecian armies in the coming campaign .
while his father lived , however , he could be only a <name> ; influential , accomplished , and popular , it is true , but still without any substantial and independent power .
he was restless and uneasy at the thought that , as his father was in the prime and vigor of manhood , many long years must elapse before he could emerge from this confined and subordinate condition .
his restlessness and uneasiness were , however , suddenly ended by a very extraordinary occurrence , which called him , with scarcely an hour 's notice , to take his father 's place upon the throne .

<name> was suddenly called upon to succeed his father on the macedonian throne , in the most unexpected manner , and in the midst of scenes of the greatest excitement and agitation .
the circumstances were these : <name> had felt very desirous , before setting out upon his great expedition into <name> , to become reconciled to <name> and olympias .
he wished for <name> 's co-operation in his plans ; and then , besides , it would be dangerous to go away from his own dominions with such a son left behind , in a state of resentment and hostility .
so <name> sent kind and conciliatory messages to olympias and <name> , who had gone , it <name> be recollected , to epirus , where her friends resided .
the brother of olympias was king of epirus .
he had been at first incensed at the indignity which had been put upon his sister by <name> 's treatment of her ; but <name> now tried to appease his anger , also , by friendly negotiations and messages .
at last he arranged a marriage between this king of epirus and one of his own daughters , and this completed the reconciliation .
olympias and <name> returned to macedon , and great preparations were made for a very splendid wedding .
<name> wished to make this wedding not merely the means of confirming his reconciliation with his former wife and son , and establishing friendly relations with the king of epirus : he also prized it as an occasion for paying marked and honorable attention to the princes and great generals of the other states of greece .
he consequently made his preparations on a very extended and sumptuous scale , and sent invitations to the influential and prominent men far and near .
these great men , on the other hand , and all the other public authorities in the various grecian states , sent compliments , congratulations , and presents to <name> , each seeming ambitious to contribute his share to the splendor of the celebration .
they were not wholly disinterested in this , it is true .
as <name> had been made commander-in-chief of the grecian armies which were about to undertake the conquest of <name> , and as , of course , his influence and power in all that related to that vast enterprise would be paramount and supreme ; and as all were ambitious to have a large share in the <name> of that expedition , and to participate , as much as possible , in the power and in the renown which seemed to be at <name> 's disposal , all were , of course , very anxious to secure his favor .
a short time before , they were contending against him ; but now , since he had established his ascendency , they all eagerly joined in the work of <unk> it and making it illustrious .
nor could <name> justly complain of the <unk> and <unk> of these professions of friendship .
the compliments and favors which he offered to them were equally hollow and heartless .
he wished to secure their favor as a means of aiding him up the steep path to fame and power which he was attempting to climb .
they wished for his , in order that he might , as he ascended himself , help them up with him .
there was , however , the greatest appearance of cordial and devoted friendship .
some cities sent him presents of golden crowns , beautifully wrought , and of high cost .
others dispatched <unk> , expressing their good wishes for him , and their confidence in the success of his plans .
athens , the city which was the great seat of literature and science in greece sent a poem , in which the history of the expedition into persia was given by anticipation .
in this poem <name> was , of course , triumphantly successful in his enterprise .
he conducted his armies in safety through the most dangerous passes and defiles ; he fought glorious battles , gained magnificent victories , and possessed himself of all the treasures of asiatic wealth and power .
it ought to be stated , however , in justice to the poet , that , in <unk> these imaginary exploits , he had sufficient delicacy to represent <name> and the persian monarch by fictitious names .
the wedding was at length celebrated , in one of the cities of macedon , with great pomp and splendor .
there were games , and shows , and military and civic spectacles of all kinds to amuse the thousands of spectators that assembled to witness them .
in one of these spectacles they had a procession of statues of the gods .
there were twelve of these statues , sculptured with great <name> , and they were borne along on elevated <unk> , with <unk> , and incense , and various ceremonies of homage , while vast multitudes of spectators lined the way .
there was a thirteenth statue , more magnificent than the other twelve , which represented <name> himself in the character of a god .
this was not , however , so impious as it would at first view seem , for the gods whom the ancients worshiped were , in fact , only <unk> of old heroes and kings who had lived in early times , and had acquired a reputation for supernatural powers by the fame of their exploits , exaggerated in descending by tradition in superstitious times .
the ignorant multitude accordingly , in those days , looked up to a living king with almost the same reverence and homage which they felt for their <unk> heroes ; and these <unk> heroes furnished them with all the ideas they had of god .
making a monarch a god , therefore , was no very extravagant flattery .
after the procession of the statues passed along , there came bodies of troops , with trumpets sounding and banners flying .
the officers rode on horses elegantly caparisoned , and prancing proudly .
these troops escorted princes , embassadors , generals , and great officers of state , all gorgeously decked in their robes , and wearing their badges and insignia .
at length king <name> himself appeared in the procession .
he had arranged to have a large space left , in the middle of which he was to walk .
this was done in order to make his position the more conspicuous , and to <name> more strongly his own high distinction above all the other potentates present on the occasion .
guards preceded and followed him , though at considerable distance , as has been already said .
he was himself clothed with white robes , and his head was adorned with a splendid crown .
the procession was moving toward a great theater , where certain games and spectacles were to be exhibited .
the statues of the gods were to be taken into the theater , and placed in conspicuous positions there , in the view of the assembly , and then the procession itself was to follow .
all the statues had entered except that of <name> , which was just at the door , and <name> himself was advancing in the midst of the space left for him , up the avenue by which the theater was approached , when an occurrence took place by which the whole character of the scene , the <name> of <name> , and the fate of fifty nations , was suddenly and totally changed .
it was this .
an officer of the guards , who had his position in the procession near the king , was seen advancing impetuously toward him , through the space which separated him from the rest , and , before the spectators had time even to wonder what he was going to do , he stabbed him to the heart .
<name> fell down in the street and died .
a scene of indescribable tumult and confusion ensued .
the murderer was immediately cut to pieces by the other guards .
they found , however , before he was dead , that it was <unk> , a man of high standing and influence , a general officer of the guards .
he had had horses provided , and other assistance ready , to enable him to make his escape , but he was cut down by the guards before he could avail himself of them .
an officer of state immediately hastened to <name> , and announced to him his father 's death and his own accession to the throne .
an assembly of the leading counselors and statesmen was called , in a hasty and tumultuous manner , and <name> was proclaimed king with prolonged and general acclamations .
<name> made a speech in reply .
the great assembly looked upon his youthful form and face as he arose , and listened with intense interest to hear what he had to say .
he was between nineteen and twenty years of age ; but , though thus really a boy , he spoke with all the decision and confidence of an energetic man .
he said that he should at once assume his father 's position , and <name> forward his plans .
he hoped to do this so efficiently that every thing would go directly onward , just as if his father had continued to live , and that the nation would find that the only change which had taken place was in the name of the king .
the motive which induced <unk> to murder <name> in this manner was never fully ascertained .
there were various opinions about it .
one was , that it was an act of private revenge , occasioned by some neglect or injury which <unk> had received from <name> .
others thought that the murder was <unk> by a party in the states of greece , who were hostile to <name> , and unwilling that he should command the allied armies that were about to penetrate into <name> .
demosthenes , the celebrated orator , was <name> 's great enemy among the greeks .
many of his most powerful orations were made for the purpose of arousing his countrymen to resist his ambitious plans and to curtail his power .
these orations were called his <unk> , and from this origin has arisen the practice , which has prevailed ever since that day , of applying the term <unk> to denote , in general , any strongly <unk> <unk> .
now demosthenes , it is said , who was at this time in athens , announced the death of <name> in an athenian assembly before it was possible that the news could have been conveyed there .
he accounted for his early possession of the intelligence by saying it was communicated to him by some of the gods .
many persons have accordingly supposed that the plan of <unk> <name> was devised in greece ; that demosthenes was a party to it ; that <unk> was the agent for carrying it into execution ; and that demosthenes was so confident of the success of the plot , and exulted so much in this certainty , that he could not resist the temptation of thus anticipating its announcement .
there were other persons who thought that the persians had plotted and accomplished this murder , having induced <unk> to execute the deed by the promise of great rewards .
as <unk> himself , however , had been instantly killed , there was no opportunity of gaining any information from him on the motives of his conduct , even if he would have been disposed to impart any .
at all events , <name> found himself suddenly elevated to one of the most conspicuous positions in the whole political world .
it was not simply that he succeeded to the throne of macedon ; even this would have been a lofty position for so young a man ; but macedon was a very small part of the realm over which <name> had extended his power .
the ascendency which he had acquired over the whole grecian empire , and the vast arrangements he had made for an incursion into <name> , made <name> the object of universal interest and attention .
the question was , whether <name> should attempt to take his father 's place in respect to all this general power , and undertake to sustain and <name> on his vast projects , or whether he should content himself with ruling , in quiet , over his native country of macedon .
most prudent persons would have advised a young <name> , under such circumstances , to have decided upon the latter course .
but <name> had no idea of bounding his ambition by any such limits .
he resolved to spring at once completely into his father 's seat , and not only to possess himself of the whole of the power which his father had acquired , but to commence , immediately , the most energetic and vigorous efforts for a great extension of it .
his first plan was to punish his father 's murderers .
he caused the circumstances of the case to be investigated , and the persons suspected of having been connected with <unk> in the plot to be tried .
although the designs and motives of the murderers could never be fully ascertained , still several persons were found guilty of <unk> in it , and were condemned to death and publicly executed .
<name> next decided not to make any change in his father's appointments to the great offices of state , but to let all the departments of public affairs go on in the same hands as before .
how sagacious a line of conduct was this !
most ardent and enthusiastic young men , in the circumstances in which he was placed , would have been elated and vain at their elevation , and would have replaced the old and <unk> servants of the father with personal favorites of their own age , inexperienced and incompetent , and as conceited as themselves .
<name> , however , made no such changes .
he continued the old officers in command , endeavoring to have every thing go on just as if his father had not died .
there were two officers in particular who were the ministers on whom <name> had mainly relied .
their names were antipater and parmenio .
antipater had charge of the civil , and parmenio of military affairs .
parmenio was a very distinguished general .
he was at this time nearly sixty years of age .
<name> had great confidence in his military powers , and felt a strong personal attachment for him .
parmenio entered into the young king 's service with great readiness , and accompanied him through almost the whole of his career .
it seemed strange to see men of such age , standing , and experience , obeying the orders of such a boy ; but there was something in the genius , the power , and the enthusiasm of <name> 's character which inspired ardor in all around him , and made every one eager to join his standard and to aid in the execution of his plans .
macedon , as <name> be seen on the following map , was in the northern part of the country occupied by the greeks , and the most powerful states of the confederacy and all the great and influential cities were south of it .
there was athens , which was magnificently built , its splendid citadel crowning a <name> hill in the center of it .
it was the great seat of literature , philosophy , and the arts , and was thus a center of attraction for all the civilized world .
there was corinth , which was distinguished for the gayety and pleasure which reigned there .
all possible means of luxury and amusement were concentrated within its walls .
the lovers of knowledge and of <name> , from all parts of the earth , flocked to athens , while those in pursuit of pleasure , dissipation , and indulgence chose corinth for their home .
corinth was beautifully situated on the isthmus , with prospects of the sea on either hand .
it had been a famous city for a thousand years in <name> 's day .
[ illustration : map of macedon and greece . ]
there was also thebes .
thebes was farther north than athens and corinth .
it was situated on an elevated plain , and had , like other ancient cities , a strong citadel , where there was at this time a macedonian garrison , which <name> had placed there .
thebes was very wealthy and powerful .
it had also been celebrated as the <unk> of many poets and philosophers , and other eminent men .
among these was pindar , a very celebrated poet who had flourished one or two centuries before the time of <name> .
his descendants still lived in thebes , and <name> , some time after this , had occasion to confer upon them a very distinguished honor .
there was sparta also , called sometimes <unk> .
the inhabitants of this city were famed for their courage , hardihood , and physical strength , and for the energy with which they devoted themselves to the work of war .
they were nearly all soldiers , and all the arrangements of the state and of society , and all the plans of education , were designed to promote military ambition and pride among the officers and fierce and indomitable courage and endurance in the men .
these cities and many others , with the states which were attached to them , formed a large , and flourishing , and very powerful community , extending over all that part of greece which lay south of macedon .
<name> , as has been already said , had established his own ascendency over all this region , though it had cost him many perplexing negotiations and some <unk> battles to do it .
<name> considered it somewhat uncertain whether the people of all these states and cities would be disposed to transfer readily , to so youthful a <name> as he , the high commission which his father , a very powerful monarch and soldier , had extorted from them with so much difficulty .
what should he do in the case ?
should he give up the expectation of it ?
should he send embassadors to them , presenting his claims to occupy his father 's place ?
or should he not act at all , but wait quietly at home in macedon until they should decide the question ?
instead of doing either of these things , <name> decided on the very bold step of setting out himself , at the head of an army , to march into southern greece , for the purpose of presenting in person , and , if necessary , of enforcing his claim to the same post of honor and power which had been conferred upon his father .
considering all the circumstances of the case , this was perhaps one of the boldest and most decided steps of <name> 's whole career .
many of his macedonian advisers counseled him not to make such an attempt ; but <name> would not listen to any such <unk> .
he collected his forces , and set forth at the head of them .
between macedon and the southern states of greece was a range of lofty and almost impassable mountains .
these mountains extended through the whole interior of the country , and the main route leading into southern greece passed around to the eastward of them , where they terminated in cliffs , leaving a narrow passage between the cliffs and the sea .
this pass was called the pass of thermopylÃ¦ , and it was considered the key to greece .
there was a town named <unk> near the pass , on the outward side .
there was in those days a sort of general congress or assembly of the states of greece , which was held from time to time , to decide questions and disputes in which the different states were continually getting involved with each other .
this assembly was called the <unk> council , on account , as is said , of its having been established by a certain king named <unk> .
a meeting of this council was appointed to receive <name> .
it was to be held at thermopylÃ¦ , or , rather , at <unk> , which was just without the pass , and was the usual place at which the council assembled .
this was because the pass was in an intermediate position between the northern and southern portions of greece , and thus equally accessible from either .
in proceeding to the southward , <name> had first to pass through thessaly , which was a very powerful state immediately south of macedon .
he met with some show of resistance at first , but not much .
the country was impressed with the boldness and decision of character manifested in the taking of such a course by so young a man .
then , too , <name> , so far as he became personally known , made a very favorable impression upon every one .
his manly and athletic form , his <name> and open manners , his spirit , his generosity , and a certain air of confidence , independence , and conscious superiority , which were combined , as they always are in the case of true greatness , with an unaffected and unassuming modesty  these and other traits , which were obvious to all who saw him , in the person and character of <name> , made every one his friend .
common men take pleasure in yielding to the influence and ascendency of one whose spirit they see and feel stands on a higher eminence and <unk> higher powers than their own .
they like a leader .
it is true , they must feel confident of his superiority ; but when this superiority stands out so clearly and distinctly marked , combined , too , with all the graces and attractions of youth and manly beauty , as it was in the case of <name> , the minds of men are brought very easily and rapidly under its sway .
the <unk> gave <name> a very favorable reception .
they expressed a cordial readiness to <unk> him in the position which his father had occupied .
they joined their forces to his , and proceeded southward toward the pass of thermopylÃ¦ .
here the great council was held .
<name> took his place in it as a member .
of course , he must have been an object of universal interest and attention .
the impression which he made here seems to have been very favorable .
after this assembly separated , <name> proceeded southward , accompanied by his own forces , and tended by the various princes and potentates of greece , with their attendants and followers .
the feelings of exultation and pleasure with which the young king defiled through the pass of thermopylÃ¦ , thus attended , must have been exciting in the extreme .
the pass of thermopylÃ¦ was a scene strongly associated with ideas of military <name> and renown .
it was here that , about a hundred and fifty years before , leonidas , a spartan general , with only three hundred soldiers , had attempted to withstand the pressure of an immense persian force which was at that time invading greece .
he was one of the kings of sparta , and he had the command , not only of his three hundred spartans , but also of all the allied forces of the greeks that had been assembled to repel the persian invasion .
with the help of these allies he withstood the persian forces for some time , and as the pass was so narrow between the cliffs and the sea , he was enabled to resist them successfully .
at length , however , a strong detachment from the immense persian army contrived to find their way over the mountains and around the pass , so as to establish themselves in a position from which they could come down upon the small greek army in their rear .
leonidas , perceiving this , ordered all his allies from the other states of greece to withdraw , leaving himself and his three hundred countrymen alone in the defile .
he did not expect to repel his enemies or to defend the pass .
he knew that he must die , and all his brave followers with him , and that the torrent of invaders would pour down through the pass over their bodies .
but he considered himself stationed there to defend the passage , and he would not desert his post .
when the battle came on he was the first to fall .
the soldiers gathered around him and defended his dead body as long as they could .
at length , overpowered by the immense <name> of their foes , they were all killed but one man .
he made his escape and returned to sparta .
a monument was erected on the spot with this inscription : " go , traveler , to sparta , and say that we lie here , on the spot at which we were stationed to defend our country . "
<name> passed through the defile .
he advanced to the great cities south of it  to athens , to thebes , and to corinth .
another great assembly of all the monarchs and potentates of greece was convened in corinth ; and here <name> attained the object of his ambition , in having the command of the great expedition into <name> conferred upon him .
the impression which he made upon those with whom he came into connection by his personal qualities must have been favorable in the extreme .
that such a youthful <name> should be selected by so powerful a confederation of nations as their leader in such an enterprise as they were about to engage in , indicates a most extraordinary power on his part of acquiring an ascendency over the minds of men , and of impressing all with a sense of his commanding superiority .
<name> returned to macedon from his expedition to the southward in triumph , and began at once to arrange the affairs of his kingdom , so as to be ready to enter , unembarrassed , upon the great career of conquest which he imagined was before him .

the country which was formerly occupied by macedon and the other states of greece is now turkey in europe .
in the northern part of it is a vast chain of mountains called now the <unk> .
in <name> 's day it was mount <unk> .
this chain forms a broad belt of lofty and <unk> land , and extends from the black sea to the adriatic .
a branch of this mountain range , called <unk> , extends <unk> from about the middle of its length , as may be seen by the map .
<unk> separated macedonia from a large and powerful country , which was occupied by a somewhat rude but warlike race of men .
this country was thrace .
thrace was one great fertile basin or valley , sloping toward the center in every direction , so that all the streams from the mountains , increased by the rains which fell over the whole surface of the ground , flowed together into one river , which <unk> through the center of the valley , and flowed out at last into the Ã¦gean sea .
the name of this river was the <unk> .
all this may be seen distinctly upon the map .
[ illustration : map of macedon and greece . ]
the <unk> , or mount <unk> , as it was then called , formed the great northern frontier of macedon and thrace .
from the summits of the range , looking northward , the eye surveyed a vast extent of land , constituting one of the most extensive and fertile valleys on the globe .
it was the valley of the danube .
it was inhabited , in those days , by rude tribes whom the greeks and romans always designated as barbarians .
they were , at any rate , wild and warlike , and , as they had not the <name> of writing , they have left us no records of their institutions or their history .
we know nothing of them , or of the other <unk> nations that occupied the central parts of europe in those days , except what their inveterate and perpetual enemies have thought fit to tell us .
according to their story , these countries were filled with nations and tribes of a wild and half-savage character , who could be kept in check only by the most vigorous exertion of military power .
soon after <name> 's return into macedon , he learned that there were symptoms of revolt among these nations .
<name> had subdued them , and established the kind of peace which the greeks and romans were accustomed to enforce upon their neighbors .
but now , as they had heard that <name> , who had been so terrible a warrior , was no more , and that his son , scarcely out of his teens , had succeeded to the throne , they thought a suitable occasion had arrived to try their strength .
<name> made immediate arrangements for moving northward with his army to settle this question .
he conducted his forces through a part of thrace without meeting with any serious resistance , and approached the mountains .
the soldiers looked upon the rugged precipices and lofty summits before them with awe .
these northern mountains were the seat and throne , in the imaginations of the greeks and romans , of old <unk> , the hoary god of the north wind .
they conceived of him as dwelling among those cold and <name> summits , and making excursions in <name> , carrying with him his vast stores of frost and snow , over the southern valleys and plains .
he had wings , a long beard , and white locks , all powdered with flakes of snow .
instead of feet , his body terminated in tails of serpents , which , as he flew along , lashed the air , writhing from under his robes .
he was violent and impetuous in temper , rejoicing in the devastation of <name> , and in all the sublime phenomena of tempests , cold , and snow .
the greek <name> of <unk> made an impression upon the human mind that twenty centuries have not been able to efface .
the north wind of <name> is <unk> as <unk> to the present day in the literature of every nation of the western world .
the <unk> forces had assembled in the defiles , with other troops from the northern countries , to arrest <name> 's march , and he had some difficulty in <unk> them .
they had got , it is said , some sort of loaded wagons upon the summit of an ascent , in the pass of the mountains , up which <name> 's forces would have to march .
these wagons were to be run down upon them as they ascended .
<name> ordered his men to advance , notwithstanding this danger .
he directed them , where it was practicable , to open to one side and the other , and allow the descending wagon to pass through .
when this could not be done , they were to fall down upon the ground when they saw this strange military engine coming , and locking their shields together over their heads , allow the wagon to roll on over them , bracing up energetically against its weight .
notwithstanding these precautions , and the prodigious muscular power with which they were carried into effect , some of the men were crushed .
the great body of the army was , however , unharmed ; as soon as the force of the wagons was spent , they rushed up the ascent , and attacked their enemies with their pikes .
the barbarians fled in all directions , terrified at the force and <unk> of men whom loaded wagons , rolling over their bodies down a steep descent , could not kill .
<name> advanced from one conquest like this to another , moving toward the northward and eastward after he had crossed the mountains , until at length he approached the mouths of the danube .
here one of the great chieftains of the barbarian tribes had taken up his position , with his family and court , and a principal part of his army , upon an island called <unk> , which may be seen upon the map at the beginning of this chapter .
this island divided the current of the stream , and <name> , in attempting to attack it , found that it would be best to endeavor to effect a landing upon the upper point of it .
to make this attempt , he collected all the boats and vessels which he could obtain , and embarked his troops in them above , directing them to fall down with the current , and to land upon the island .
this plan , however , did not succeed very well ; the current was too rapid for the proper management of the boats .
the shores , too , were lined with the forces of the enemy , who discharged showers of spears and arrows at the men , and pushed off the boats when they attempted to land .
<name> at length gave up the attempt , and concluded to leave the island , and to cross the river itself further above , and thus <name> the war into the very heart of the country .
it is a serious undertaking to get a great body of men and horses across a broad and rapid river , when the people of the country have done all in their power to remove or destroy all possible means of transit , and when hostile bands are on the opposite bank , to embarrass and impede the operations by every mode in their power .
<name> , however , advanced to the undertaking with great resolution .
to cross the danube especially , with a military force , was , in those days , in the estimation of the greeks and romans , a very great exploit .
the river was so distant , so broad and rapid , and its banks were bordered and defended by such ferocious foes , that to cross its <unk> tide , and penetrate into the unknown and unexplored regions beyond , leaving the broad , and deep , and rapid stream to cut off the hopes of retreat , implied the possession of extreme self-reliance , courage , and decision .
<name> collected all the canoes and boats which he could obtain up and down the river .
he built large rafts , attaching to them the skins of beasts sewed together and inflated , to give them buoyancy .
when all was ready , they began the transportation of the army in the night , in a place where the enemy had not expected that the attempt would have been made .
there were a thousand horses , with their riders , and four thousand foot soldiers , to be conveyed across .
it is customary , in such cases , to swim the horses over , leading them by lines , the ends of which are held by men in boats .
the men themselves , with all the arms , ammunition , and baggage , had to be carried over in the boats or upon the rafts .
before morning the whole was accomplished .
the army landed in a field of grain .
this circumstance , which is casually mentioned by historians , and also the story of the wagons in the passes of mount <unk> , proves that these northern nations were not absolute barbarians in the sense in which that term is used at the present day .
the arts of cultivation and of construction must have made some progress among them , at any rate ; and they proved , by some of their conflicts with <name> , that they were <unk> and <unk> soldiers .
the macedonians swept down the waving grain with their pikes , to open a way for the advance of the cavalry , and early in the morning <name> found and attacked the army of his enemies , who were utterly astonished at finding him on their side of the river .
as may be easily anticipated , the barbarian army was beaten in the battle that ensued .
their city was taken .
the booty was taken back across the danube to be distributed among the soldiers of the army .
the neighboring nations and tribes were overawed and subdued by this exhibition of <name> 's courage and energy .
he made satisfactory treaties with them all ; took hostages , where necessary , to secure the observance of the treaties , and then recrossed the danube and set out on his return to macedon .
he found that it was time for him to return .
the southern cities and states of greece had not been unanimous in raising him to the office which his father had held .
the spartans and some others were opposed to him .
the party thus opposed were inactive and silent while <name> was in their country , on his first visit to southern greece ; but after his return they began to contemplate more decisive action , and afterward , when they heard of his having undertaken so desperate an enterprise as going northward with his forces , and actually crossing the danube , they considered him as so completely out of the way that they grew very courageous , and meditated open rebellion .
the city of thebes did at length rebel .
<name> had conquered this city in former struggles , and had left a macedonian garrison there in the citadel .
the name of the citadel was <unk> .
the officers of the garrison , supposing that all was secure , left the soldiers in the citadel , and came , themselves , down to the city to reside .
things were in this condition when the rebellion against <name> 's authority broke out .
they killed the officers who were in the city , and summoned the garrison to surrender .
the garrison refused , and the <unk> besieged it .
this outbreak against <name> 's authority was in a great measure the work of the great orator demosthenes , who spared no exertions to arouse the southern states of greece to resist <name> 's dominion .
he especially exerted all the powers of his eloquence in athens in the endeavor to bring over the athenians to take sides against <name> .
while things were in this state  the <unk> having understood that <name> had been killed at the north , and supposing that , at all events , if this report should not be true , he was , without doubt , still far away , involved in contentions with the barbarian nations , from which it was not to be expected that he could be very speedily extricated  the whole city was suddenly thrown into consternation by the report that a large macedonian army was approaching from the north , with <name> at its head , and that it was , in fact , close upon them .
it was now , however , too late for the <unk> to repent of what they had done .
they were far too deeply impressed with a conviction of the decision and energy of <name> 's character , as manifested in the whole course of his proceedings since he began to reign , and especially by his sudden reappearance among them so soon after this outbreak against his authority , to imagine that there was now any <name> for them except in determined and successful resistance .
they shut themselves up , therefore , in their city , and prepared to defend themselves to the last extremity .
<name> advanced , and , passing round the city toward the southern side , established his head-quarters there , so as to cut off effectually all communication with athens and the southern cities .
he then extended his posts all around the place so as to invest it entirely .
these preparations made , he paused before he commenced the work of subduing the city , to give the inhabitants an opportunity to submit , if they would , without compelling him to resort to force .
the conditions , however , which he imposed were such that the <unk> thought it best to take their chance of resistance .
they refused to surrender , and <name> began to prepare for the onset .
he was very soon ready , and with his characteristic ardor and energy he determined on attempting to <name> the city at once by assault .
fortified cities generally require a siege , and sometimes a very long siege , before they can be subdued .
the army within , sheltered behind the <unk> of the walls , and standing there in a position above that of their assailants , have such great advantages in the contest that a long time often <unk> before they can be compelled to surrender .
the besiegers have to invest the city on all sides to cut off all supplies of provisions , and then , in those days , they had to construct engines to make a breach somewhere in the walls , through which an assaulting party could attempt to force their way in .
the time for making an assault upon a besieged city depends upon the comparative strength of those within and without , and also , still more , on the ardor and resolution of the besiegers .
in warfare , an army , in investing a fortified place , spends ordinarily a considerable time in burrowing their way along in trenches , half under ground , until they get near enough to plant their cannon where the balls can take effect upon some part of the wall .
then some time usually <unk> before a breach is made , and the garrison is sufficiently weakened to render an assault advisable .
when , however , the time at length arrives , the most bold and desperate portion of the army are designated to lead the attack .
bundles of small branches of trees are provided to fill up ditches with , and ladders for mounting embankments and walls .
the city , sometimes , seeing these preparations going on , and convinced that the assault <name> be successful , <unk> before it is made .
when the besieged do thus surrender , they save themselves a vast amount of suffering , for the carrying of a city by assault is perhaps the most horrible scene which the passions and crimes of men ever offer to the view of heaven .
it is horrible , because the soldiers , exasperated to fury by the resistance which they meet with , and by the awful malignity of the passions always excited in the hour of battle , if they succeed , burst suddenly into the precincts of domestic life , and find sometimes thousands of families  mothers , and children , and defenseless maidens  at the <name> of passions excited to phrensy .
soldiers , under such circumstances , can not be restrained , and no imagination can conceive the horrors of the sacking of a city , carried by assault , after a protracted siege .
tigers do not spring upon their prey with greater ferocity than man springs , under such circumstances , to the <unk> of every possible cruelty upon his fellow man .
after an ordinary battle upon an open field , the conquerors have only men , armed like themselves , to wreak their vengeance upon .
the scene is awful enough , however , here .
but in carrying a city by storm , which takes place usually at an unexpected time , and often in the night , the maddened and victorious <unk> suddenly burst into the sacred scenes of domestic peace , and seclusion , and love  the very worst of men , filled with the worst of passions , stimulated by the resistance they have encountered , and <unk> by their victory to give all these passions the fullest and most <unk> gratification .
to plunder , burn , destroy , and kill , are the lighter and more harmless of the crimes they perpetrate .
thebes was carried by assault .
<name> did not wait for the slow operations of a siege .
he watched a favorable opportunity , and burst over and through the outer line of fortifications which defended the city .
the attempt to do this was very desperate , and the loss of life great ; but it was triumphantly successful .
the <unk> were driven back toward the inner wall , and began to crowd in , through the gates , into the city , in terrible confusion .
the macedonians were close upon them , and pursuers and pursued , struggling together , and trampling upon and killing each other as they went , flowed in , like a boiling and raging torrent which nothing could resist , through the open <unk> .
it was impossible to close the gates .
the whole macedonian force were soon in full possession of the now defenseless houses , and for many hours screams , and <unk> , and cries of horror and despair testified to the awful atrocity of the crimes attendant on the sacking of a city .
at length the soldiery were restrained .
order was restored .
the army retired to the posts assigned them , and <name> began to deliberate what he should do with the conquered town .
he determined to destroy it  to offer , once for all , a terrible example of the consequences of rebellion against him .
the case was not one , he considered , of the ordinary conquest of a foe .
the states of greece  thebes with the rest  had once solemnly conferred upon him the authority against which the <unk> had now rebelled .
they were traitors , therefore , in his judgment , not mere enemies , and he determined that the penalty should be utter destruction .
but , in carrying this terrible decision into effect , he acted in a manner so deliberate , discriminating , and cautious , as to diminish very much the irritation and resentment which it would otherwise have caused , and to give it its full moral effect as a measure , not of angry resentment , but of calm and deliberate retribution  just and proper , according to the ideas of the time .
in the first place , he released all the priests .
then , in respect to the rest of the population , he <unk> carefully between those who had favored the rebellion and those who had been true to their allegiance to him .
the latter were allowed to depart in safety .
and if , in the case of any family , it could be shown that one individual had been on the macedonian side , the single instance of fidelity <unk> the treason of the other members , and the whole family was saved .
and the officers appointed to <name> out these provisions were liberal in the interpretation and application of them , so as to save as many as there could be any possible pretext for saving .
the descendants and family connections of pindar , the celebrated poet , who has been already mentioned as having been born in thebes , were all pardoned also , whichever side they may have taken in the contest .
the truth was , that <name> , though he had the sagacity to see that he was placed in circumstances where prodigious moral effect in strengthening his position would be produced by an act of great severity , was swayed by so many generous impulses , which raised him above the ordinary excitements of irritation and revenge , that he had every <name> to make the suffering as light , and to limit it by as narrow bounds , as the nature of the case would allow .
he doubtless also had an instinctive feeling that the moral effect itself of so dreadful a retribution as he was about to inflict upon the devoted city would be very much increased by forbearance and generosity , and by extreme regard for the security and protection of those who had shown themselves his friends .
after all these exceptions had been made , and the persons to whom they applied had been dismissed , the rest of the population were sold into slavery , and then the city was utterly and entirely destroyed .
the number thus sold was about thirty thousand , and six thousand had been killed in the assault and storming of the city .
thus thebes was made a ruin and a desolation , and it remained so , a monument of <name> 's terrible energy and decision , for twenty years .
the effect of the destruction of thebes upon the other cities and states of greece was what might have been expected .
it came upon them like a <unk> .
although thebes was the only city which had openly revolted , there had been strong symptoms of disaffection in many other places .
demosthenes , who had been silent while <name> was present in greece , during his first visit there , had again been endeavoring to arouse opposition to macedonian ascendency , and to concentrate and bring out into action the influences which were hostile to <name> .
he said in his speeches that <name> was a mere boy , and that it was disgraceful for such cities as athens , sparta , and thebes to submit to his sway .
<name> had heard of these things , and , as he was coming down into greece , through the straits of thermopylÃ¦ , before the destruction of thebes , he said , " they say i am a boy .
i am coming to teach them that i am a man . "
he did teach them that he was a man .
his unexpected appearance , when they imagined him entangled among the mountains and wilds of unknown regions in the north ; his sudden <unk> of thebes ; the assault ; the calm deliberations in respect to the <name> of the city , and the slow , cautious , discriminating , but inexorable energy with which the decision was carried into effect , all coming in such rapid succession , impressed the grecian commonwealth with the conviction that the personage they had to deal with was no boy in character , whatever might be his years .
all symptoms of disaffection against the rule of <name> instantly disappeared , and did not soon revive again .
nor was this effect due entirely to the terror inspired by the retribution which had been visited upon thebes .
all greece was impressed with a new admiration for <name> 's character as they witnessed these events , in which his impetuous energy , his cool and calm decision , his forbearance , his magnanimity , and his faithfulness to his friends , were all so conspicuous .
his <unk> the priests , whether they had been for him or against him , made every friend of religion incline to his favor .
the same interposition in behalf of the poet 's family and descendants spoke directly to the heart of every poet , orator , historian , and philosopher throughout the country , and tended to make all the lovers of literature his friends .
his magnanimity , also , in deciding that one single friend of his in a family should save that family , instead of <unk> , as a more short-sighted conqueror would have done , that a single enemy should condemn it , must have awakened a strong feeling of gratitude and regard in the hearts of all who could appreciate fidelity to friends and generosity of spirit .
thus , as the news of the destruction of thebes , and the selling of so large a portion of the inhabitants into slavery , spread over the land , its effect was to turn over so great a part of the population to a feeling of admiration of alexander's character , and confidence in his extraordinary powers , as to leave only a small minority disposed to take sides with the punished rebels , or resent the destruction of the city .
from thebes <name> proceeded to the southward .
<unk> from the cities were sent to him , congratulating him on his victories , and offering their adhesion to his cause .
his influence and ascendency seemed firmly established now in the country of the greeks , and in due time he returned to macedon , and celebrated at <unk> , which was at this time his capital , the establishment and confirmation of his power , by games , shows , spectacles , illuminations , and sacrifices to the gods , offered on a scale of the greatest pomp and magnificence .
he was now ready to turn his thoughts toward the <unk> plan of the expedition into <name> .

on <name> 's arrival in macedon , he immediately began to turn his attention to the subject of the invasion of <name> .
he was full of ardor and enthusiasm to <name> this project into effect .
considering his extreme youth , and the <unk> character of the enterprise , it is strange that he should have exercised so much deliberation and caution as his conduct did really evince .
he had now settled every thing in the most thorough manner , both within his dominions and among the nations on his borders , and , as it seemed to him , the time had come when he was to commence active preparations for the great asiatic campaign .
he brought the subject before his ministers and counselors .
they , in general , concurred with him in opinion .
there were , however , two who were in doubt , or rather who were , in fact , opposed to the plan , though they expressed their <unk> in the form of doubts .
these two persons were antipater and parmenio , the venerable officers who have been already mentioned as having served <name> so faithfully , and as transferring , on the death of the father , their attachment and allegiance at once to the son .
antipater and parmenio represented to <name> that if he were to go to <name> at that time , he would put to extreme hazard all the interests of macedon .
as he had no family , there was , of course , no direct heir to the crown , and , in case of any misfortune happening by which his life should be lost , macedon would become at once the prey of contending factions , which would immediately arise , each presenting its own candidate for the vacant throne .
the sagacity and foresight which these statesmen evinced in these suggestions were abundantly confirmed in the end .
<name> did die in <name> , his vast kingdom at once fell into pieces , and it was desolated with internal commotions and civil wars for a long period after his death .
parmenio and antipater accordingly advised the king to postpone his expedition .
they advised him to seek a wife among the princesses of greece , and then to settle down quietly to the duties of domestic life , and to the government of his kingdom for a few years ; then , when every thing should have become settled and consolidated in greece , and his family was established in the hearts of his countrymen , he could leave macedon more safely .
public affairs would go on more steadily while he lived , and , in case of his death , the crown would descend , with comparatively little danger of civil commotion , to his heir .
but <name> was fully decided against any such policy as this .
he resolved to embark in the great expedition at once .
he concluded to make antipater his <unk> in macedon during his absence , and to take parmenio with him into <name> .
it <name> be remembered that antipater was the statesman and parmenio the general ; that is , antipater had been employed more by <name> in civil , and parmenio in military affairs , though in those days every body who was in public life was more or less a soldier .
<name> left an army of ten or twelve thousand men with antipater for the protection of macedon .
he organized another army of about thirty-five thousand to go with him .
this was considered a very small army for such a vast undertaking .
one or two hundred years before this time , <name> , a king of persia , had invaded greece with an army of five hundred thousand men , and yet he had been defeated and driven back , and now <name> was undertaking to <unk> with a great deal less than one tenth part of the force .
of <name> 's army of thirty-five thousand , thirty thousand were foot soldiers , and about five thousand were horse .
more than half the whole army was from macedon .
the remainder was from the southern states of greece .
a large body of the horse was from thessaly , which , as <name> be seen on the map , [ a ] was a country south of macedon .
it was , in fact , one broad expanded valley , with mountains all around .
torrents descended from these mountains , forming streams which flowed in currents more and more deep and slow as they descended into the plains , and combining at last into one central river , which flowed to the eastward , and escaped from the <unk> of mountains through a most celebrated <name> called the vale of <unk> .
on the north of this valley is olympus , and on the south the two twin mountains <unk> and <unk> .
there was an ancient story of a war in thessaly between the giants who were imagined to have lived there in very early days , and the gods .
the giants piled <unk> upon <unk> to enable them to get up to heaven in their assault upon their celestial enemies .
the fable has led to a proverb which prevails in every language in europe , by which all extravagant and unheard-of exertions to accomplish an end is said to be a piling of <unk> upon <unk> .
[ footnote a : at the commencement of chapter iii . ]
thessaly was famous for its horses and its horsemen .
the slopes of the mountains furnished the best of pasturage for the rearing of the animals , and the plains below afforded broad and open fields for training and exercising the bodies of cavalry formed by means of them .
the <unk> horses were famous throughout all greece .
bucephalus was reared in thessaly .
<name> , as king of macedon , possessed extensive estates and revenues , which were his own personal property , and were independent of the revenues of the state .
before setting out on his expedition , he <unk> these among his great officers and generals , both those who were to go and those who were to remain .
he evinced great generosity in this , but it was , after all , the spirit of ambition , more than that of generosity , which led him to do it .
the two great impulses which animated him were the pleasure of doing great deeds , and the fame and <name> of having done them .
these two principles are very distinct in their nature , though often conjoined .
they were paramount and supreme in <name> 's character , and every other human principle was subordinate to them .
money was to him , accordingly , only a means to enable him to accomplish these ends .
his distributing his estates and revenues in the manner above described was only a judicious appropriation of the money to the promotion of the great ends he wished to attain ; it was expenditure , not gift .
it answered admirably the end he had in view .
his friends all looked upon him as extremely generous and self-sacrificing .
they asked him what he had reserved for himself .
" <name> , " said <name> .
at length all things were ready , and <name> began to celebrate the religious sacrifices , spectacles , and shows which , in those days , always preceded great undertakings of this kind .
there was a great ceremony in honor of jupiter and the nine muses , which had long been celebrated in macedon as a sort of annual national festival .
<name> now caused great preparations for this festival .
in the days of the greeks , public worship and public amusement were combined in one and the same series of spectacles and ceremonies .
all worship was a theatrical show , and almost all shows were forms of worship .
the religious instincts of the human heart demand some sort of sympathy and aid , real or imaginary , from the invisible world , in great and solemn undertakings , and in every momentous crisis in its history .
it is true that <name> 's soldiers , about to leave their homes to go to another quarter of the globe , and into scenes of danger and death from which it was very improbable that many of them would ever return , had no other celestial protection to look up to than the spirits of ancient heroes , who , they imagined , had , somehow or other , found their final home in a sort of heaven among the summits of the mountains , where they reigned , in some sense , over human affairs ; but this , small as it seems to us , was a great deal to them .
they felt , when sacrificing to these gods , that they were <unk> their presence and sympathy .
these deities having been engaged in the same enterprises themselves , and animated with the same hopes and fears , the soldiers imagined that the semi-human divinities invoked by them would take an interest in their dangers , and rejoice is their success .
the muses , in honor of whom , as well as jupiter , this great macedonian festival was held , were nine singing and dancing maidens , beautiful in countenance and form , and <unk> graceful in all their movements .
they came , the ancients imagined , from thrace , in the north , and went first to jupiter upon mount olympus , who made them goddesses .
afterward they went southward , and spread over greece , making their residence , at last , in a palace upon mount <unk> , which <name> be found upon the map just north of the gulf of corinth and west of <unk> .
they were worshiped all over greece and italy as the goddesses of music and dancing .
in later times particular sciences and arts were assigned to them respectively , as history , astronomy , tragedy , & c. , though there was no distinction of this kind in early days .
the festivities in honor of jupiter and the muses were continued in macedon nine days , a number corresponding with that of the dancing goddesses .
<name> made very magnificent preparations for the celebration on this occasion .
he had a tent made , under which , it is said , a hundred tables could be spread ; and here he entertained , day after day , an enormous company of princes , potentates , and generals .
he offered sacrifices to such of the gods as he supposed it would please the soldiers to imagine that they had <unk> .
connected with these sacrifices and <unk> , there were athletic and military spectacles and shows  races and <unk>  and mock contests , with blunted spears .
all these things encouraged and quickened the ardor and animation of the soldiers .
it aroused their ambition to distinguish themselves by their exploits , and gave them an increased and stimulated <name> for honor and fame .
thus <unk> by new desires for human praise , and trusting in the sympathy and protection of powers which were all that they conceived of as divine , the army prepared to set forth from their native land , bidding it a long , and , as it proved to most of them , a final farewell .
by following the course of <name> 's expedition upon the map at the commencement of chapter iii. , it <name> be seen that his route lay first along the northern coasts of the Ã¦gean sea .
he was to pass from europe into <name> by crossing the hellespont between <unk> and <unk> .
he sent a fleet of a hundred and fifty galleys , of three banks of oars each , over the Ã¦gean sea , to land at <unk> , and be ready to transport his army across the straits .
the army , in the mean time , marched by land .
they had to cross the rivers which flow into the Ã¦gean sea on the northern side ; but as these rivers were in macedon , and no opposition was encountered upon the banks of them , there was no serious difficulty in effecting the passage .
when they reached <unk> , they found the fleet ready there , awaiting their arrival .
it is very strikingly characteristic of the mingling of poetic sentiment and enthusiasm with calm and calculating business efficiency , which shone conspicuously so often in <name> 's career , that when he arrived at <unk> , and found that the ships were there , and the army safe , and that there was no enemy to oppose his landing on the asiatic shore , he left parmenio to conduct the transportation of the troops across the water , while he himself went away in a single galley on an excursion of sentiment and romantic adventure .
a little south of the place where his army was to cross , there lay , on the asiatic shore , an extended plain , on which were the ruins of <name> .
now <name> was the city which was the scene of <name> 's poems  those poems which had excited so much interest in the mind of <name> in his early years ; and he determined , instead of crossing the hellespont with the main body of his army , to proceed southward in a single galley , and land , himself , on the asiatic shore , on the very spot which the romantic imagination of his youth had dwelt upon so often and so long .
[ illustration : the plain of <name> . ]
<name> was situated upon a plain .
<name> describes an island off the coast , named <unk> , and a mountain near called mount <name> .
there was also a river called the <unk> .
the island , the mountain , and the river remain , preserving their original names to the present day , except that the river is now called the <unk> , but , although various vestiges of ancient ruins are found scattered about the plain , no spot can be identified as the site of the city .
some scholars have maintained that there probably never was such a city ; that <name> invented the whole , there being nothing real in all that he describes except the river , the mountain , and the island .
his story is , however , that there was a great and powerful city there , with a kingdom attached to it , and that this city was besieged by the greeks for ten years , at the end of which time it was taken and destroyed .
the story of the origin of this war is substantially this .
priam was king of <name> .
his wife , a short time before her son was born , dreamed that at his birth the child turned into a torch and set the palace on fire .
she told this dream to the soothsayers , and asked them what it meant .
they said it must mean that her son would be the means of bringing some terrible calamities and disasters upon the family .
the mother was terrified , and , to avert these calamities , gave the child to a slave as soon as it was born , and ordered him to destroy it .
the slave pitied the helpless babe , and , not liking to destroy it with his own hand , carried it to mount <name> , and left it there in the forests to die .
a she bear , roaming through the woods , found the child , and , experiencing a feeling of maternal tenderness for it , she took care of it , and reared it as if it had been her own offspring .
the child was found , at last , by some shepherds who lived upon the mountain , and they adopted it as their own , robbing the brute mother of her charge .
they named the boy <name> .
he grew in strength and beauty , and gave early and extraordinary proofs of courage and energy , as if he had imbibed some of the qualities of his fierce <name> mother with the milk she gave him .
he was so remarkable for athletic beauty and manly courage , that he not only easily won the heart of a <unk> of mount <name> , named <unk> , whom he married , but he also attracted the attention of the goddesses in the heavens .
at length these goddesses had a dispute which they agreed to refer to him .
the origin of the dispute was this .
there was a wedding among them , and one of them , irritated at not having been invited , had a golden apple made , on which were engraved the words , " to be given to the most beautiful . "
she threw this apple into the assembly : her object was to make them quarrel for it .
in fact , she was herself the goddess of discord , and , independently of her cause of pique in this case , she loved to promote disputes .
it is in allusion to this ancient tale that any subject of dispute , brought up unnecessarily among friends , is called to this day an apple of discord .
three of the goddesses claimed the apple , each insisting that she was more beautiful than the others , and this was the dispute which they agreed to refer to <name> .
they accordingly exhibited themselves before him in the mountains , that he might look at them and decide .
they did not , however , seem willing , either of them , to trust to an impartial decision of the question , but each offered the judge a bribe to induce him to decide in her favor .
one promised him a kingdom , another great fame , and the third , <name> , promised him the most beautiful woman in the world for his wife .
he decided in favor of <name> ; whether because she was justly entitled to the decision , or through the influence of the bribe , the story does not say .
all this time <name> remained on the mountain , a simple shepherd and herdsman , not knowing his relationship to the monarch who reigned over the city and kingdom on the plain below .
king priam , however , about this time , in some games which he was celebrating , offered , as a prize to the <name> , the finest bull which could be obtained on mount <name> .
on making examination , <name> was found to have the finest bull and the king , exercising the despotic power which kings in those days made no scruple of assuming in respect to helpless peasants , took it away .
<name> was very indignant .
it happened , however , that a short time afterward there was another opportunity to contend for the same bull , and <name> , <unk> himself as a <name> , appeared in the lists , conquered every competitor , and bore away the bull again to his home in the fastnesses of the mountain .
in consequence of this his appearance at court , the daughter of priam , whose name was <name> , became acquainted with him , and , inquiring into his story , succeeded in ascertaining that he was her brother , the long-lost child , that had been supposed to be put to death .
king priam was convinced by the evidence which she brought forward , and <name> was brought home to his father 's house .
after becoming established in his new position , he remembered the promise of <name> that he should have the most beautiful woman in the world for his wife , and he began , accordingly , to inquire where he could find her .
[ illustration : <name> and <name> . ]
there was in sparta , one of the cities of southern greece , a certain king <unk> , who had a youthful bride named <name> , who was famed far and near for her beauty .
<name> came to the conclusion that she was the most lovely woman in the world , and that he was entitled , in virtue of <name> 's promise , to obtain possession of her , if he could do so by any means whatever .
he accordingly made a journey into greece , visited sparta , formed an acquaintance with <name> , persuaded her to abandon her husband and her duty , and <unk> with him to <name> .
<unk> was indignant at this outrage .
he called on all greece to take up arms and join him in the attempt to recover his bride .
they responded to this demand .
they first sent to priam , demanding that he should restore <name> to her husband .
priam refused to do so , taking part with his son .
the greeks then raised a fleet and an army , and came to the plains of <name> , encamped before the city , and persevered for ten long years in besieging it , when at length it was taken and destroyed .
these stories relating to the origin of the war , however , marvelous and entertaining as they are , were not the points which chiefly interested the mind of <name> .
the portions of <name> 's narratives which most excited his enthusiasm were those relating to the characters of the heroes who fought , on one side and on the other , at the siege , their various adventures , and the <unk> of their motives and principles of conduct , and the emotions and excitements they experienced in the various circumstances in which they were placed .
<name> described with great beauty and force the workings of ambition , of resentment , of pride , of rivalry , and all those other impulses of the human heart which would excite and control the action of impetuous men in the circumstances in which his heroes were placed .
each one of the heroes whose history and adventures he gives , possessed a well-marked and striking character , and differed in temperament and action from the rest .
achilles was one .
he was fiery , impetuous , and implacable in character , fierce and merciless ; and , though perfectly undaunted and fearless , entirely destitute of magnanimity .
there was a river called the <unk> , the waters of which were said to have the property of making any one invulnerable .
the mother of achilles dipped him into it in his infancy , holding him by the heel .
the heel , not having been immersed , was the only part which could be wounded .
thus he was safe in battle , and was a terrible warrior .
he , however , quarreled with his comrades and withdrew from their cause on slight pretexts , and then became reconciled again , influenced by equally frivolous reasons .
[ illustration : achilles . ]
<unk> was the commander-in-chief of the greek army .
after a certain victory , by which some captives were taken , and were to be divided among the victors , <unk> was obliged to restore one , a <name> <name> , who had fallen to his share , and he took away the one that had been assigned to achilles to replace her .
this incensed achilles , and he withdrew for a long time from the contest ; and , in consequence of his absence , the trojans gained great and continued victories against the greeks .
for a long time nothing could induce achilles to return .
at length , however , though he would not go himself , he allowed his intimate friend , whose name was <unk> , to take his armor and go into battle .
<unk> was at first successful , but was soon killed by <name> , the brother of <name> .
this aroused anger and a spirit of revenge in the mind of achilles .
he gave up his quarrel with <unk> and returned to the combat .
he did not <unk> his exertions till he had slain <name> , and then he expressed his brutal exultation , and satisfied his revenge , by dragging the dead body at the wheels of his chariot around the walls of the city .
he then sold the body to the distracted father for a ransom .
it was such stories as these , which are related in the poems of <name> with great beauty and power , that had chiefly interested the mind of <name> .
the subjects interested him ; the accounts of the contentions , the rivalries , the exploits of these warriors , the <unk> of their character and springs of action , and the <unk> of the various incidents and events to which such a war gave rise , were all calculated to <unk> the imagination of a young martial hero .
<name> accordingly resolved that his first landing in <name> should be at <name> .
he left his army under the charge of parmenio , to cross from <unk> to <unk> , while he himself set forth in a single galley to proceed to the southward .
there was a port on the trojan shore where the greeks had been accustomed to <unk> , and he steered his course for it .
he had a bull on board his galley which he was going to offer as a sacrifice to neptune when half way from shore to shore .
neptune was the god of the sea .
it is true that the hellespont is not the open ocean , but it is an arm of the sea , and thus belonged properly to the dominions which the ancients assigned to the divinity of the waters .
neptune was conceived of by the ancients as a monarch dwelling on the seas or upon the coasts , and riding over the waves seated in a great shell , or sometimes in a chariot , drawn by <unk> or <unk> .
in these excursions he was attended by a train of <unk> and <unk> , who , half floating , half swimming , followed him over the billows .
instead of a scepter neptune carried a <unk> .
a <unk> was a sort of <unk> harpoon , such as was used in those days by the fishermen of the mediterranean .
it was from this circumstance , probably , that it was chosen as the badge of authority for the god of the sea .
<name> took the helm , and steered the galley with his own hands toward the asiatic shore .
just before he reached the land , he took his place upon the prow , and threw a javelin at the shore as he approached it , a symbol of the spirit of defiance and hostility with which he advanced to the frontiers of the eastern world .
he was also the first to land .
after <unk> his company , he offered sacrifices to the gods , and then proceeded to visit the places which had been the scenes of the events which <name> had described .
<name> had written five hundred years before the time of <name> , and there is some doubt whether the ruins and the remains of cities which our hero found there were really the scenes of the narratives which had interested him so deeply .
he , however , at any rate , believed them to be so , and he was filled with enthusiasm and pride as he wandered among them .
he seems to have been most interested in the character of achilles , and he said that he envied him his happy lot in having such a friend as <unk> to help him perform his exploits , and such a poet as <name> to celebrate them .
after completing his visit upon the plain of <name> , <name> moved toward the northeast with the few men who had accompanied him in his single galley .
in the mean time parmenio had crossed safely , with the main body of the army , from <unk> to <unk> .
<name> overtook them on their march , not far from the place of their landing .
to the northward of this place , on the left of the line of march which <name> was taking , was the city of <unk> .
now a large portion of <name> minor , although for the most part under the dominion of persia , had been in a great measure settled by greeks , and , in previous wars between the two nations , the various cities had been in possession , sometimes of one power and sometimes of the other .
in these contests the city of <unk> had incurred the high displeasure of the greeks by <unk> , as they said , on one occasion , against them .
<name> determined to destroy it as he passed .
the inhabitants were aware of this intention , and sent an embassador to <name> to implore his <name> .
when the embassador approached , <name> , knowing his errand , uttered a declaration in which he bound himself by a solemn oath not to <name> the request he was about to make .
" i have come , " said the embassador , " to implore you to destroy <unk> . "
<name> , pleased with the readiness of the embassador in giving his language such a sudden turn , and perhaps influenced by his oath , spared the city .
he was now fairly in <name> .
the persian forces were gathering to attack him , but so unexpected and sudden had been his invasion that they were not prepared to meet him at his arrival , and he advanced without opposition till he reached the banks of the little river <unk> .

although <name> had landed safely on the asiatic shore , the way was not yet fairly open for him to advance into the interior of the country .
he was upon a sort of plain , which was separated from the territory beyond by natural barriers .
on the south was the range of lofty land called mount <name> .
from the northeastern slopes of this mountain there descended a stream which flowed north into the sea , thus <unk> <name> 's army in .
he must either scale the mountain or cross the river before he could penetrate into the interior .
he thought it would be easiest to cross the river .
it is very difficult to get a large body of horsemen and of <unk> soldiers , with all their attendants and baggage , over high elevations of land .
this was the reason why the army turned to the northward after landing upon the asiatic shore .
<name> thought the <unk> less of an obstacle than mount <name> .
it was not a large stream , and was easily <unk> .
[ illustration : the <unk> . ]
it was the custom in those days , as it is now when armies are marching , to send forward small bodies of men in every direction to explore the roads , remove obstacles , and discover sources of danger .
these men are called , in modern times , scouts ; in <name> 's day , and in the greek language , they were called <unk> , which means <unk> .
it is the duty of these pioneers to send messengers back continually to the main body of the army , informing the officers of every thing important which comes under their observation .
in this case , when the army was gradually drawing near to the river , the <unk> came in with the news that they had been to the river , and found the whole opposite shore , at the place of crossing , lined with persian troops , collected there to dispute the passage .
the army continued their advance , while <name> called the leading generals around him , to consider what was to be done .
parmenio recommended that they should not attempt to pass the river immediately .
the persian army consisted chiefly of cavalry .
now cavalry , though very terrible as an enemy on the field of battle by day , are peculiarly exposed and defenseless in an encampment by night .
the horses are scattered , feeding or at rest .
the arms of the men are light , and they are not accustomed to fighting on foot ; and on a sudden incursion of an enemy at midnight into their camp , their horses and their horsemanship are alike useless , and they fall an easy prey to resolute invaders .
parmenio thought , therefore , that the persians would not dare to remain and encamp many days in the vicinity of <name> 's army , and that , accordingly , if they waited a little , the enemy would retreat , and <name> could then cross the river without <unk> the danger of a battle .
but <name> was unwilling to adopt any such policy .
he felt confident that his army was courageous and strong enough to march on , directly through the river , ascend the bank upon the other side , and force their way through all the opposition which the persians could make .
he knew , too , that if this were done it would create a strong sensation throughout the whole country , impressing every one with a sense of the energy and power of the army which he was conducting , and would thus tend to intimidate the enemy , and facilitate all future operations .
but this was not all ; he had a more powerful motive still for wishing to march right on , across the river , and force his way through the vast bodies of cavalry on the opposite shore , and this was the pleasure of performing the exploit .
accordingly , as the army advanced to the banks , they <unk> to form in order of battle , and prepared to continue their march as if there were no obstacle to oppose them .
the general order of battle of the macedonian army was this .
there was a certain body of troops , armed and organized in a peculiar manner , called the phalanx .
this body was placed in the center .
the men composing it were very heavily armed .
they had shields upon the left arm , and they carried spears sixteen feet long , and pointed with iron , which they held firmly in their two hands , with the points projecting far before them .
the men were arranged in lines , one behind the other , and all facing the enemy  sixteen lines , and a thousand in each line , or , as it is expressed in military phrase , a thousand in rank and sixteen in file , so that the phalanx contained sixteen thousand men .
the spears were so long that when the men stood in close order , the rear ranks being brought up near to those before them , the points of the spears of eight or ten of the ranks projected in front , forming a bristling wall of points of steel , each one of which was held in its place by the strong arms of an athletic and <unk> soldier .
this wall no force which could in those days be brought against it could penetrate .
men , horses , elephants , every thing that attempted to rush upon it , rushed only to their own destruction .
every spear , feeling the impulse of the vigorous arms which held it , seemed to be alive , and darted into its enemy , when an enemy was at hand , as if it felt itself the fierce hostility which directed it .
if the enemy remained at a distance , and threw javelins or darts at the phalanx , they fell harmless , stopped by the shields which the soldiers wore upon the left arm , and which were held in such a manner as to form a system of scales , which covered and protected the whole mass , and made the men almost invulnerable .
the phalanx was thus , when only defending itself and in a state of rest , an army and a fortification all in one , and it was almost impregnable .
but when it took an aggressive form , put itself in motion , and advanced to an attack , it was infinitely more formidable .
it became then a terrible monster , covered with scales of brass , from beneath which there projected forward ten thousand living , darting points of iron .
it advanced deliberately and calmly , but with a prodigious momentum and force .
there was nothing human in its appearance at all .
it was a huge animal , ferocious , dogged , stubborn , insensible to pain , knowing no fear , and bearing down with resistless and merciless destruction upon every thing that came in its way .
the phalanx was the center and soul of <name> 's army .
powerful and impregnable as it was , however , in ancient days , it would be helpless and defenseless on a modern battle-field .
solid balls of iron , flying through the air with a velocity which makes them invisible , would tear their way through the pikes and the shields , and the bodies of the men who bore them , without even feeling the obstruction .
the phalanx was subdivided into brigades , regiments , and battalions , and regularly officered .
in marching , it was separated into these its constituent parts , and sometimes in battle it acted in divisions .
it was stationed in the center of the army on the field , and on the two sides of it were bodies of cavalry and foot soldiers , more lightly armed than the soldiers of the phalanx , who could accordingly move with more <unk> and speed , and <name> their action readily wherever it might be called for .
those troops on the sides were called the wings .
<name> himself was accustomed to command one wing and parmenio the other , while the phalanx crept along slowly but terribly between .
the army , thus arranged and organized , advanced to the river .
it was a broad and shallow stream .
the persians had assembled in vast <name> on the opposite shore .
some historians say there were one hundred thousand men , others say two hundred thousand , and others six hundred thousand .
however this may be , there is no doubt their <name> were vastly superior to those of <name> 's army , which it <name> be recollected was less than forty thousand .
there was a narrow plain on the opposite side of the river , next to the shore , and a range of hills beyond .
the persian cavalry covered the plain , and were ready to dash upon the macedonian troops the moment they should emerge from the water and attempt to ascend the bank .
the army , led by <name> , descended into the stream , and moved on through the water .
they encountered the onset of their enemies on the opposite shore .
a terrible and a protracted struggle ensued , but the coolness , courage , and strength of <name> 's army carried the day .
the persians were driven back , the greeks effected their landing , reorganized and formed on the shore , and the persians , finding that all was lost , fled in all directions .
<name> himself took a conspicuous and a very active part in the contest .
he was easily recognized on the field of battle by his dress , and by a white plume which he wore in his helmet .
he exposed himself to the most imminent danger .
at one time , when desperately engaged with a troop of horse , which had galloped down upon him , a persian horseman aimed a blow at his head with a sword .
<name> saved his head from the blow , but it took off his plume and a part of his helmet .
<name> immediately thrust his antagonist through the body .
at the same moment , another horseman , on another side , had his sword raised , and would have killed <name> before he could have turned to defend himself , had no help intervened ; but just at this instant a third <unk> , one of <name> 's friends , seeing the danger , brought down so terrible a blow upon the shoulder of this second assailant as to separate his arm from his body .
such are the stories that are told .
they may have been literally and fully true , or they may have been exaggerations of circumstances somewhat resembling them which really occurred , or they may have been fictitious altogether .
great generals , like other great men , have often the credit of many exploits which they never perform .
it is the special business of poets and historians to magnify and embellish the actions of the great , and this <name> was understood as well in ancient days as it is now .
we must remember , too , in reading the accounts of these transactions , that it is only the greek side of the story that we hear .
the persian narratives have not come down to us .
at any rate , the persian army was defeated , and that , too , without the assistance of the phalanx .
the horsemen and the light troops were alone engaged .
the phalanx could not be formed , nor could it act in such a position .
the men , on emerging from the water , had to climb up the banks , and rush on to the attack of an enemy consisting of squadrons of horse ready to dash at once upon them .
the persian army was defeated and driven away .
<name> did not pursue them .
he felt that he had struck a very heavy blow .
the news of this defeat of the persians would go with the speed of the wind all over <name> minor , and operate most powerfully in his favor .
he sent home to greece an account of the victory , and with the account he forwarded three hundred suits of armor , taken from the persian horsemen killed on the field .
these suits of armor were to be <name> up in the parthenon , a great <name> at athens ; the most conspicuous position for them , perhaps , which all europe could afford .
the name of the persian general who commanded at the battle of the <unk> was <unk> .
he had been opposed to the plan of <unk> a battle .
<name> had come to <name> with no provisions and no money .
he had relied on being able to sustain his army by his victories .
<unk> , therefore , strongly urged that the persians should retreat slowly , carrying off all the valuable property , and destroying all that could not be removed , taking especial care to leave no provisions behind them .
in this way he thought that the army of <name> would be reduced by privation and want , and would , in the end , fall an easy prey .
his opinion was , however , overruled by the views of the other commanders , and the battle of the <unk> was the consequence .
<name> encamped to refresh his army and to take care of the wounded .
he went to see the wounded men one by one , inquired into the circumstances of each case , and listened to each one who was able to talk , while he gave an account of his adventures in the battle , and the manner in which he received his wound .
to be able thus to tell their story to their general , and to see him listening to it with interest and pleasure , filled their hearts with pride and <name> ; and the whole army was inspired with the highest spirit of enthusiasm , and with eager desires to have another opportunity occur in which they could encounter danger and death in the service of such a leader .
it is in such traits as these that the true greatness of the soul of <name> shines .
it must be remembered that all this time he was but little more than twenty-one .
he was but just of age .
from his encampment on the <unk> <name> turned to the southward , and moved along on the eastern shores of the Ã¦gean sea .
the country generally surrendered to him without opposition .
in fact , it was hardly persian territory at all .
the inhabitants were mainly of greek extraction , and had been sometimes under greek and sometimes under persian rule .
the conquest of the country resulted simply in a change of the executive officer of each province .
<name> took special pains to lead the people to feel that they had nothing to fear from him .
he would not allow the soldiers to do any injury .
he protected all private property .
he took possession only of the <unk> , and of such governmental property as he found there , and he continued the same taxes , the same laws , and the same <unk> as had existed before his invasion .
the cities and the provinces accordingly surrendered to him as he passed along , and in a very short time all the western part of <name> minor submitted peacefully to his sway .
the narrative of this progress , as given by the ancient historians , is diversified by a great variety of adventures and incidents , which give great interest to the story , and strikingly illustrate the character of <name> and the spirit of the times .
in some places there would be a contest between the greek and the persian parties before <name> 's arrival .
at ephesus the animosity had been so great that a sort of civil war had broken out .
the greek party had gained the ascendency , and were threatening a general massacre of the persian inhabitants .
<name> promptly interposed to protect them , though they were his enemies .
the intelligence of this act of forbearance and generosity spread all over the land , and added greatly to the influence of <name> 's name , and to the estimation in which he was held .
it was the custom in those days for the mass of the common soldiers to be greatly influenced by what they called omens , that is , signs and tokens which they observed in the flight or the actions of birds , and other similar appearances .
in one case , the fleet , which had come along the sea , accompanying the march of the army on land , was pent up in a harbor by a stronger persian fleet outside .
one of the vessels of the macedonian fleet was aground .
an eagle lighted upon the mast , and stood perched there for a long time , looking toward the sea .
parmenio said that , as the eagle looked toward the sea , it indicated that victory lay in that quarter , and he recommended that they should arm their ships and push boldly out to attack the persians .
but <name> maintained that , as the eagle alighted on a ship which was aground , it indicated that they were to look for their success on the shore .
the omens could thus almost always be interpreted any way , and sagacious generals only sought in them the means of confirming the courage and confidence of their soldiers , in respect to the plans which they adopted under the influence of other considerations altogether .
<name> knew very well that he was not a sailor , and had no <name> to embark in contests from which , however they might end , he would himself personally obtain no <name> .
when the <name> came on , <name> and his army were about three or four hundred miles from home ; and , as he did not intend to advance much farther until the spring should open , he announced to the army that all those persons , both officers and soldiers who had been married within the year , might go home if they chose , and spend the <name> with their brides , and return to the army in the spring .
no doubt this was an admirable stroke of policy ; for , as the number could not be large , their absence could not materially weaken his force , and they would , of course , fill all greece with tales of alexander's energy and courage , and of the nobleness and generosity of his character .
it was the most effectual way possible of <unk> through europe the most brilliant accounts of what he had already done .
besides , it must have awakened a new bond of sympathy and <unk> between himself and his soldiers , and greatly increased the attachment to him felt both by those who went and those who remained .
and though <name> must have been aware of all these advantages of the act , still no one could have thought of or adopted such a plan unless he was accustomed to consider and regard , in his dealings with others , the feelings and affections of the heart , and to <name> a warm sympathy for them .
the bridegroom soldiers , full of exultation and pleasure , set forth on their return to greece , in a detachment under the charge of three generals , themselves <unk> too .
<name> , however , had no idea of remaining idle during the <name> .
he marched on from province to province , and from city to city , meeting with every variety of adventures .
he went first along the southern coast , until at length he came to a place where a mountain chain , called <unk> , comes down to the sea-coast , where it terminates abruptly in cliffs and precipices , leaving only a narrow beach between them and the water below .
this beach was sometimes covered and sometimes bare .
it is true , there is very little tide in the mediterranean , but the level of the water along the shores is altered considerably by the long-continued pressure exerted in one direction or another by winds and storms .
the water was up when <name> reached this pass ; still he determined to march his army through it .
there was another way , back among the mountains , but <name> seemed disposed to gratify the love of adventure which his army felt , by introducing them to a novel scene of danger .
they accordingly defiled along under these cliffs , marching , as they say , sometimes up to the waist in water , the swell rolling in upon them all the time from the offing .
having at length succeeded in passing safely round this frowning <unk> of the mountains , <name> turned northward , and advanced into the very heart of <name> minor .
in doing this he had to pass over the range which he had come round before ; and , as it was <name> , his army were , for a time , enveloped in snows and storms among the wild and frightful defiles .
they had here , in addition to the dangers and hardships of the way and of the season , to encounter the hostility of their foes , as the tribes who inhabited these mountains assembled to dispute the passage .
<name> was victorious , and reached a valley through which there flows a river which has handed down its name to the english language and literature .
this river was the <unk> .
its beautiful windings through verdant and fertile valleys were so renowned , that every stream which imitates its example is said to <unk> to the present day .
during all this time parmenio had remained in the western part of <name> minor with a considerable body of the army .
as the spring approached , <name> sent him orders to go to <unk> , whither he was himself proceeding , and meet him there .
he also directed that the detachment which had gone home should , on <unk> the hellespont , on their return , proceed eastward to <unk> , thus making that city the general rendezvous for the commencement of his next campaign .
one reason why <name> desired to go to <unk> was that he wished to untie the famous <unk> knot .
the story of the <unk> knot was this .
<unk> was a sort of mountain farmer .
one day he was plowing , and an eagle came down and alighted upon his yoke , and remained there until he had finished his plowing .
this was an omen , but what was the signification of it ?
<unk> did not know , and he accordingly went to a neighboring town in order to consult the prophets and soothsayers .
on his way he met a damsel , who , like <name> in the days of <name> , was going forth to draw water .
<unk> fell into conversation with her , and related to her the occurrence which had interested him so strongly .
the maiden advised him to go back and offer a sacrifice to jupiter .
finally , she consented to go back with him and aid him .
the affair ended in her becoming his wife , and they lived together in peace for many years upon their farm .
they had a son named <unk> .
the father and mother were accustomed to go out sometimes in their cart or wagon , drawn by the oxen , <unk> driving .
one day they were going into the town in this way , at a time when it happened that there was an assembly convened , which was in a state of great perplexity on account of the civil dissensions and contests which prevailed in the country .
they had just inquired of an oracle what they should do .
the oracle said that " a cart would bring them a king , who would terminate their eternal <unk> . "
just then <unk> came up , driving the cart in which his father and mother were seated .
the assembly thought at once that this must be the cart meant by the oracle , and they made <unk> king by <unk> .
they took the cart and the yoke to preserve as sacred relics , <unk> them to jupiter ; and <unk> tied the yoke to the pole of the cart by a thong of leather , making a knot so close and complicated that nobody could untie it again .
it was called the <unk> knot .
the oracle afterward said that whoever should untie this knot should become monarch of all <name> .
thus far , nobody had succeeded .
<name> felt a great <name> to see this knot and try what he could do .
he went , accordingly , into the <name> where the sacred cart had been deposited , and , after looking at the knot , and satisfying himself that the task of <unk> it was hopeless , he cut it to pieces with his sword .
how far the circumstances of this whole story are true , and how far fictitious , no one can tell ; the story itself , however , as thus related , has come down from generation to generation , in every country of europe , for two thousand years , and any <unk> of one 's self from a difficulty by violent means has been called cutting the <unk> knot to the present day .
[ illustration : the bathing in the river <unk> . ]
at length the whole army was assembled , and the king recommenced his progress .
he went on successfully for some weeks , moving in a <unk> direction , and bringing the whole country under his dominion , until , at length , when he reached tarsus , an event occurred which nearly terminated his career .
there were some circumstances which caused him to press forward with the utmost effort in approaching tarsus , and , as the day was warm , he got very much overcome with heat and fatigue .
in this state , he went and plunged suddenly into the river <unk> to bathe .
now the <unk> is a small stream , flowing by tarsus , and it comes down from mount <unk> at a short distance back from the city .
such streams are always very cold .
<name> was immediately seized with a very violent chill , and was taken out of the water shivering excessively , and , at length , fainted away .
they thought he was dying .
they bore him to his tent , and , as tidings of their leader 's danger spread through the camp , the whole army , officers and soldiers , were thrown into the greatest consternation and grief .
a violent and protracted fever came on .
in the course of it , an incident occurred which strikingly illustrates the boldness and originality of <name> 's character .
the name of his physician was <name> .
<name> had been preparing a particular medicine for him , which , it seems , required some days to make ready .
just before it was presented , <name> received a letter from parmenio , informing him that he had good reason to believe that <name> had been bribed by the persians to murder him , during his sickness , by administering poison in the name of medicine .
he wrote , he said , to put him on his guard against any medicine which <name> might offer him .
<name> put the letter under his pillow , and communicated its contents to no one .
at length , when the medicine was ready , <name> brought it in .
<name> took the cup containing it with one hand , and with the other he handed <name> the communication which he had received from parmenio , saying , " read that letter . "
as soon as <name> had finished reading it , and was ready to look up , <name> drank off the draught in full , and laid down the cup with an air of perfect confidence that he had nothing to fear .
some persons think that <name> watched the countenance of his physician while he was reading the letter , and that he was led to take the medicine by his confidence in his power to determine the guilt or the innocence of a person thus accused by his looks .
others suppose that the act was an expression of his implicit <name> in the integrity and fidelity of his servant , and that he intended it as testimony , given in a very pointed and decisive , and , at the same time , delicate manner , that he was not suspicious of his friends , or easily led to distrust their faithfulness .
<name> was , at any rate , extremely gratified at the procedure , and <name> recovered .
<name> had now traversed the whole extent of <name> minor , and had subdued the entire country to his sway .
he was now advancing to another district , that of syria and palestine , which lies on the eastern shores of the mediterranean sea .
to enter this new territory , he had to pass over a narrow plain which lay between the mountains and the sea , at a place called <unk> .
here he was met by the main body of the persian army , and the great battle of <unk> was fought .
this battle <name> be the subject of the next chapter .
chapter <name> .

thus far <name> had had only the lieutenants and generals of the persian monarch to contend with .
<name> had at first looked upon the invasion of his vast dominions by such a mere boy , as he called him , and by so small an army , with contempt .
he sent word to his generals in <name> minor to seize the young fool , and send him to persia bound hand and foot .
by the time , however , that <name> had possessed himself of all <name> minor , <name> began to find that , though young , he was no fool , and that it was not likely to be very easy to seize him .
accordingly , <name> collected an immense army himself , and advanced to meet the macedonians in person .
nothing could exceed the pomp and magnificence of his preparations .
there were immense <name> of troops , and they were of all nations .
there were even a great many greeks among his forces , many of them enlisted from the greeks of <name> minor .
there were some from greece itself  <unk> , as they were called ; that is , soldiers who fought for pay , and who were willing to enter into any service which would pay them best .
there were even some greek officers and counselors in the family and court of <name> .
one of them , named <unk> , offended the king very much by the free opinion which he expressed of the uselessness of all his pomp and parade in preparing for an encounter with such an enemy as <name> .
" perhaps , " said <unk> , " you may not be pleased with my speaking to you plainly , but if i do not do it now , it <name> be too late hereafter .
this great parade and pomp , and this enormous multitude of men , might be formidable to your asiatic neighbors ; but such sort of preparation <name> be of little avail against <name> and his greeks .
your army is resplendent with purple and gold .
no one who had not seen it could conceive of its magnificence ; but it <name> not be of any avail against the terrible energy of the greeks .
their minds are bent on something very different from idle show .
they are intent on securing the substantial excellence of their weapons , and on acquiring the discipline and the hardihood essential for the most efficient use of them .
they <name> despise all your parade of purple and gold .
they <name> not even value it as plunder .
they <name> in their ability to dispense with all the luxuries and conveniences of life .
they live upon the <unk> food .
at night they sleep upon the bare ground .
by day they are always on the march .
they brave hunger , cold , and every species of exposure with pride and pleasure , having the greatest contempt for any thing like softness and <unk> of character .
all this pomp and pageantry , with inefficient weapons , and inefficient men to wield them , <name> be of no avail against their invincible courage and energy ; and the best disposition that you can make of all your gold , and silver , and other treasures , is to send it away and procure good soldiers with it , if indeed gold and silver <name> procure them . "
the greeks were habituated to energetic speaking as well as acting , but <unk> did not sufficiently consider that the persians were not accustomed to hear such plain language as this .
<name> was very much displeased .
in his anger he condemned him to death .
" very well , " said <unk> , " i can die .
but my avenger is at hand .
my advice is good , and <name> <name> soon punish you for not regarding it . "
very gorgeous descriptions are given of the pomp and magnificence of the army of <name> , as he commenced his march from the euphrates to the mediterranean .
the persians worship the sun and fire .
over the king 's tent there was an image of the sun in <name> , and supported in such a manner as to be in the view of the whole army .
they had also silver altars , on which they kept constantly burning what they called the sacred fire .
these altars were borne by persons appointed for the purpose , who were clothed in magnificent costumes .
then came a long procession of priests and magi , who were dressed also in very splendid robes .
they performed the services of public worship .
following them came a chariot consecrated to the sun .
it was drawn by white horses , and was followed by a single white horse of large size and <name> form , which was a sacred animal , being called the horse of the sun .
the <unk> , that is , the attendants who had charge of this horse , were also all dressed in white , and each carried a golden <name> in his hand .
there were bodies of troops distinguished from the rest , and occupying positions of high honor , but these were selected and advanced above the others , not on account of their courage , or strength , or superior martial efficiency , but from considerations connected with their birth , and rank , and other aristocratic qualities .
there was one body called the kinsmen , who were the relatives of the king , or , at least , so considered , though , as there were fifteen thousand of them , it would seem that the relationship could not have been , in all cases , very near .
they were dressed with great magnificence , and prided themselves on their rank , their wealth , and the splendor of their armor .
there was also a corps called the immortals .
they were ten thousand in number .
they wore a dress of gold tissue , which glittered with <unk> and precious stones .
these bodies of men , thus dressed , made an appearance more like that of a civic procession , on an occasion of ceremony and rejoicing , than like the march of an army .
the appearance of the king in his chariot was still more like an exhibition of pomp and parade .
the carriage was very large , elaborately carved and gilded , and ornamented with statues and sculptures .
here the king sat on a very elevated seat , in sight of all .
he was clothed in a vest of purple , striped with silver , and over his vest he wore a robe glittering with gold and precious stones .
around his waist was a golden girdle , from which was suspended his <unk>  a species of sword  the scabbard of which was resplendent with gems .
he wore a <name> upon his head of very costly and elegant workmanship , and enriched , like the rest of his dress , with brilliant ornaments .
the guards who preceded and followed him had pikes of silver , mounted and tipped with gold .
it is very extraordinary that king <name> took his wife and all his family with him , and a large portion of his treasures , on this expedition against <name> .
his mother , whose name was <unk> , was in his family , and she and his wife came , each in her own chariot , immediately after the king .
then there were fifteen carriages filled with the children and their attendants , and three or four hundred ladies of the court , all dressed like queens .
after the family there came a train of many hundreds of camels and mules , carrying the <name> treasures .
it was in this style that <name> set out upon his expedition , and he advanced by a slow progress toward the westward , until at length he approached the shores of the mediterranean sea .
he left his treasures in the city of damascus , where they were deposited under the charge of a sufficient force to protect them , as he supposed .
he then advanced to meet <name> , going himself from syria toward <name> minor just at the time that <name> was coming from <name> minor into syria .
[ illustration : plain of <unk> . ]
it <name> be observed by looking upon the map , that the chain of mountains called mount <unk> extends down near to the coast , at the northeastern corner of the mediterranean .
among these mountains there are various tracts of open country , through which an army may march to and fro , between syria and <name> minor .
now it happened that <name> , in going toward the west , took a more inland route than <name> , who , on coming eastward , kept nearer to the sea .
<name> did not know that <name> was so near ; and as for <name> , he was confident that <name> was retreating before him ; for , as the macedonian army was so small , and his own forces constituted such an innumerable host , the idea that <name> would remain to brave a battle was , in his opinion , entirely out of the question .
he had , therefore , no doubt that <name> was retreating .
it is , of course , always difficult for two armies , fifty miles apart , to obtain correct ideas of each other's movements .
all the ordinary <unk> of the country are of course stopped , and each general has his scouts out , with orders to intercept all travelers , and to interrupt the communication of intelligence by every means in their power .
in consequence of these and other circumstances of a similar nature , it happened that <name> and <name> actually passed each other , without either of them being aware of it .
<name> advanced into syria by the plains of <unk> , marked a upon the map , and a narrow pass beyond , called the gates of syria , while <name> went farther to the north , and arrived at <unk> after <name> had left it .
here each army learned to their astonishment that their enemy was in their rear .
<name> could not credit this report when he first heard it .
he dispatched a galley with thirty oars along the shore , up the gulf of <unk> , to ascertain the truth .
the galley soon came back and reported that , beyond the gates of syria , they saw the whole country , which was nearly level land , though gently rising from the sea , covered with the vast encampments of the persian army .
the king then called his generals and counselors together , informed them of the facts , and made known to them his determination to return immediately through the gates of syria and attack the persian army .
the officers received the intelligence with enthusiastic expressions of <name> .
it was now near the evening .
<name> sent forward a strong reconnoitering party , ordering them to proceed cautiously , to ascend <unk> and look far before them , to guard carefully against surprise , and to send back word immediately if they came upon any traces of the enemy .
at the present day the operations of such a reconnoitering party are very much aided by the use of <unk> , which are made now with great care expressly for military purposes .
the instrument , however , was not known in <name> 's day .
when the evening came on , <name> followed the reconnoitering party with the main body of the army .
at midnight they reached the defile .
when they were secure in the possession of it , they halted .
strong watches were stationed on all the surrounding heights to guard against any possible surprise .
<name> himself ascended one of the <unk> , from whence he could look down upon the great plain beyond , which was dimly illuminated in every part by the smouldering fires of the persian encampment .
an encampment at night is a spectacle which is always grand , and often sublime .
it must have appeared sublime to <name> in the highest degree , on this occasion .
to stand stealthily among these dark and somber mountains , with the defiles and passes below filled with the columns of his small but undaunted army , and to look onward , a few miles beyond , and see the countless fires of the vast hosts which had got between him and all <name> of retreat to his native land ; to feel , as he must have done , that his fate , and that of all who were with him , depended upon the events of the day that was soon to <name>  to see and feel these things must have made this night one of the most exciting and solemn scenes in the conqueror 's life .
he had a soul to enjoy its excitement and sublimity .
he gloried in it ; and , as if he wished to add to the solemnity of the scene , he caused an altar to be erected , and offered a sacrifice , by <unk> , to the deities on whose aid his soldiers imagined themselves most dependent for success on the morrow .
of course a place was selected where the lights of the torches would not attract the attention of the enemy , and sentinels were stationed at every advantageous point to watch the persian camp for the slightest indications of movement or alarm .
in the morning , at break of day , <name> commenced his march down to the plain .
in the evening , at sunset , all the valleys and defiles among the mountains around the plain of <unk> were thronged with vast masses of the persian army , broken , disordered , and in confusion , all pressing forward to escape from the victorious macedonians .
they crowded all the roads , they choked up the mountain passes , they trampled upon one another , they fell , exhausted with fatigue and mental agitation .
<name> was among them , though his flight had been so sudden that he had left his mother , and his wife , and all his family behind .
he pressed on in his chariot as far as the road allowed his chariot to go , and then , leaving every thing behind , he mounted a horse and rode on for his life .
<name> and his army soon abandoned the pursuit , and returned to take possession of the persian camp .
the tents of king <name> and his household were inconceivably splendid , and were filled with gold and silver vessels , <unk> , vases , boxes of perfumes , and every imaginable article of luxury and show .
the mother and wife of <name> <unk> their hard fate with cries and tears , and continued all the evening in an agony of consternation and despair .
<name> , hearing of this , sent <unk> , his former teacher , a man of years and gravity , to quiet their fears and comfort them , so far as it was possible to comfort them .
in addition to their own captivity , they supposed that <name> was killed , and the mother was mourning bitterly for her son , and the wife for her husband .
<unk> , attended by some soldiers , advanced toward the tent where these mourners were dwelling .
the attendants at the door ran in and informed them that a body of greeks were coming .
this threw them into the greatest consternation .
they anticipated violence and death , and threw themselves upon the ground in agony .
<unk> waited some time at the door for the attendants to return .
at length he entered the tent .
this renewed the terrors of the women .
they began to entreat him to spare their lives , at least until there should be time for them to see the remains of the son and husband whom they mourned , and to pay the last sad tribute to his memory .
<unk> soon relieved their fears .
he told them that he was charged by <name> to say to them that <name> was alive , having made his escape in safety .
as to themselves , <name> assured them , he said , that they should not be injured ; that not only were their persons and lives to be protected , but no change was to be made in their condition or mode of life ; they should continue to be treated like queens .
he added , moreover , that <name> wished him to say that he felt no animosity or ill <name> whatever against <name> .
he was but technically his enemy , being only engaged in a generous and honorable contest with him for the empire of <name> .
saying these things , <unk> raised the disconsolate ladies from the ground , and they gradually regained some degree of composure .
<name> himself went to pay a visit to the captive princesses the next day .
he took with him <unk> .
<unk> was alexander's personal friend .
the two young men were of the same age , and , though <name> had the good sense to retain in power all the old and experienced officers which his father had employed , both in the court and army , he showed that , after all , ambition had not overwhelmed and stifled all the <unk> feelings of the heart , by his strong attachment to this young companion .
<unk> was his confidant , his associate , his personal friend .
he did what very few monarchs have done , either before or since ; in securing for himself the pleasures of friendship , and of intimate social communion with a heart kindred to his own , without ruining himself by committing to a favorite powers which he was not qualified to wield .
<name> left the wise and experienced parmenio to manage the camp , while he took the young and handsome <unk> to accompany him on his visit to the captive queens .
when the two friends entered the tent , the ladies were , from some cause , deceived , and mistook <unk> for <name> , and addressed him , accordingly , with tokens of high respect and homage .
one of their attendants immediately <unk> the mistake , telling them that the other was <name> .
the ladies were at first overwhelmed with confusion , and attempted to apologize ; but the king reassured them at once by the easy and good-natured manner with which he passed over the mistake , saying it was no mistake at all .
" it is true , " said he , " that i am <name> , but then he is <name> too . "
the wife of <name> was young and very beautiful , and they had a little son who was with them in the camp .
it seems almost unaccountable that <name> should have brought such a helpless and defenseless charge with him into camps and fields of battle .
but the truth was that he had no idea of even a battle with <name> , and as to defeat , he did not contemplate the remotest possibility of it .
he regarded <name> as a mere boy  energetic and daring it is true , and at the head of a desperate band of adventurers ; but he considered his whole force as altogether too insignificant to make any stand against such a vast military power as he was bringing against him .
he presumed that he would retreat as fast as possible before the persian army came near him .
the idea of such a boy coming down at break of day , from narrow defiles of the mountains , upon his vast encampment covering all the plains , and in twelve hours putting the whole mighty mass to flight , was what never entered his imagination at all .
the exploit was , indeed , a very extraordinary one .
<name> 's forces may have consisted of forty or fifty thousand men , and , if we may believe their story , there were over a hundred thousand persians left dead upon the field .
many of these were , however , killed by the dreadful confusion and violence of the retreat as vast bodies of horsemen , pressing through the defiles , rode over and trampled down the foot soldiers who were toiling in awful confusion along the way , having fled before the horsemen left the field .
<name> had heard that <name> had left the greater part of his <name> treasures in damascus , and he sent parmenio there to seize them .
this expedition was successful .
an enormous amount of gold and silver fell into <name> 's hands .
the plate was coined into money , and many of the treasures were sent to greece .
<name> got together a small remnant of his army and continued his flight .
he did not stop until he had crossed the euphrates .
he then sent an embassador to <name> to make propositions for peace .
he remonstrated with him , in the communication which he made , for coming thus to invade his dominions , and urged him to withdraw and be satisfied with his own kingdom .
he offered him any sum he might name as a ransom for his mother , wife , and child , and agreed that if he would deliver them up to him on the payment of the ransom , and depart from his dominions , he would thenceforth regard him as an ally and a friend .
<name> replied by a letter , expressed in brief but very decided language .
he said that the persians had , under the ancestors of <name> , crossed the hellespont , invaded greece , laid waste the country , and destroyed cities and towns , and had thus done them incalculable injury ; and that <name> himself had been plotting against his ( <name> 's ) life , and offering rewards to any one who would kill him .
" i am acting , then , " continued <name> , " only on the defensive .
the gods , who always favor the right , have given me the victory .
i am now monarch of a large part of <name> , and your sovereign king .
if you <name> admit this , and come to me as my subject , i <name> restore to you your mother , your wife , and your child , without any ransom .
and , at any rate , whatever you decide in respect to these proposals , if you wish to communicate with me on any subject hereafter , i shall pay no attention to what you send unless you address it to me as your king . "
one circumstance occurred at the close of this great victory which illustrates the magnanimity of <name> 's character , and helps to explain the very strong personal attachment which every body within the circle of his influence so obviously felt for him .
he found a great number of envoys and embassadors from the various states of greece at the persian court , and these persons fell into his hands among the other captives .
now the states and cities of greece , all except sparta and thebes , which last city he had destroyed , were combined ostensibly in the confederation by which <name> was sustained .
it seems , however , that there was a secret enmity against him in greece , and various parties had sent messengers and agents to the persian court to aid in plots and schemes to interfere with and defeat <name> 's plans .
the <unk> , scattered and disorganized as they were , had sent envoys in this way .
now <name> , in considering what disposition he should make of these emissaries from his own land , decided to regard them all as traitors except the <unk> .
all except the <unk> were traitors , he maintained , for acting secretly against him , while ostensibly , and by solemn <unk> , they were his friends .
" the case of the <unk> is very different , " said he .
" i have destroyed their city , and they have a right to consider me their enemy , and to do all they can to oppose my progress , and to regain their own lost existence and their former power . "
so he gave them their <name> and sent them away with marks of consideration and honor .
as the vast army of the persian monarch had now been defeated , of course none of the smaller kingdoms or provinces thought of resisting .
they yielded one after another , and <name> appointed governors of his own to rule over them .
he advanced in this manner along the eastern shores of the mediterranean sea , meeting with no obstruction until he reached the great and powerful city of tyre .

the city of tyre stood on a small island , three or four miles in diameter , [ b ] on the eastern shores of the mediterranean sea .
it was , in those days , the greatest commercial city in the world , and it exercised a great maritime power by means of its fleets and ships , which traversed every part of the mediterranean .
[ footnote b : there are different statements in respect to the size of this island , varying from three to nine miles in circumference . ]
tyre had been built originally on the <unk> ; but in some of the wars which it had to encounter with the kings of babylon in the east , this old city had been abandoned by the inhabitants , and a new one built upon an island not far from the shore , which could be more easily defended from an enemy .
the old city had gone to ruin , and its place was occupied by old walls , fallen towers , stones , columns , arches , and other remains of the ancient magnificence of the place .
the island on which the tyre of <name> 's day had been built was about half a mile from the shore .
the water between was about eighteen feet deep , and formed a harbor for the vessels .
the great business of the <unk> was commerce .
they bought and sold merchandise in all the ports of the mediterranean sea , and transported it by their merchant vessels to and fro .
they had also fleets of war galleys , which they used to protect their interests on the high seas , and in the various ports which their merchant vessels visited .
they were thus wealthy and powerful , and yet they lived shut up upon their little island , and were almost entirely independent of the <unk> .
the city itself , however , though contracted in extent on account of the small dimensions of the island , was very compactly built and strongly fortified , and it contained a vast number of stately and magnificent edifices , which were filled with stores of wealth that had been accumulated by the mercantile enterprise and thrift of many generations .
extravagant stories are told by the historians and <unk> of those days , in respect to the scale on which the structures of tyre were built .
it was said , for instance , that the walls were one hundred and fifty feet high .
it is true that the walls rose directly from the surface of the water , and of course a considerable part of their elevation was required to bring them up to the level of the surface of the land ; and then , in addition to this , they had to be carried up the whole ordinary height of a city wall to afford the usual protection to the edifices and dwellings within .
there might have been some places where the walls themselves , or structures connected with them , were carried up to the elevation above named , though it is scarcely to be supposed that such could have been their ordinary dimensions .
at any rate , tyre was a very wealthy , magnificent , and powerful city , intent on its commercial operations , and well furnished with means of protecting them at sea , but feeling little interest , and taking little part , in the contentions continually arising among the rival powers which had possession of the land .
their policy was to retain their independence , and yet to keep on good terms with all other powers , so that their commercial intercourse with the ports of all nations might go on undisturbed .
it was , of course , a very serious question with <name> , as his route lay now through <unk> and in the neighborhood of tyre , what he should do in respect to such a port .
he did not like to leave it behind him and proceed to the eastward ; for , in case of any reverses happening to him , the <unk> would be very likely to act decidedly against him , and their power on the mediterranean would enable them to act very efficiently against him on all the coasts of greece and <name> minor .
on the other hand , it seemed a desperate undertaking to attack the city .
he had none but land forces , and the island was half a mile from the shore .
besides its enormous walls , rising perpendicularly out of the water , it was defended by ships well armed and manned .
it was not possible to surround the city and starve it into submission , as the inhabitants had wealth to buy , and ships to bring in , any quantity of provisions and stores by sea .
<name> , however , determined not to follow <name> toward the east , and leave such a stronghold as this behind him .
the <unk> wished to avoid a quarrel if it were possible .
they sent complimentary messages to <name> , congratulating him on his conquests , and <unk> all feelings of hostility to him .
they also sent him a golden crown , as many of the other states of <name> had done , in token of their yielding a general submission to his authority .
<name> returned very gracious replies , and expressed to them his intention of coming to tyre for the purpose of offering sacrifices , as he said , to hercules , a god whom the <unk> worshiped .
the <unk> knew that wherever <name> went he went at the head of his army , and his coming into tyre at all implied necessarily his taking military possession of it .
they thought it might , perhaps , be somewhat difficult to <unk> such a visitor after he should once get installed in their castles and palaces .
so they sent him word that it would not be in their power to receive him in the city itself , but that he could offer the sacrifice which he intended on the <unk> , as there was a <name> sacred to hercules among the ruins there .
<name> then called a council of his officers , and stated to them his views .
he said that , on reflecting fully upon the subject , he had come to the conclusion that it was best to postpone pushing his expedition forward into the heart of persia until he should have subdued tyre completely , and made himself master of the mediterranean sea .
he said , also , that he should take possession of egypt before turning his arms toward the forces that <name> was gathering against him in the east .
the generals of the army concurred in this opinion , and <name> advanced toward tyre .
the <unk> prepared for their defense .
after examining carefully all the circumstances of the case , <name> conceived the very bold plan of building a broad causeway from the <unk> to the island on which the city was founded , out of the ruins of old tyre , and then marching his army over upon it to the walls of the city , where he could then plant his engines and make a breach .
this would seem to be a very desperate undertaking .
it is true the stones remaining on the site of the old city afforded sufficient materials for the construction of the pier , but then the work must go on against a tremendous opposition , both from the walls of the city itself and from the <unk> ships in the harbor .
it would seem to be almost impossible to protect the men from these attacks so as to allow the operations to proceed at all , and the difficulty and danger must increase very rapidly as the work should approach the walls of the city .
but , notwithstanding these objections , <name> determined to proceed .
tyre must be taken , and this was obviously the only possible mode of taking it .
the soldiers advanced to undertake the work with great readiness .
their strong personal attachment to <name> ; their confidence that whatever he should plan and attempt would succeed ; the novelty and boldness of this design of reaching an island by building an isthmus to it from the <unk>  these and other similar considerations excited the ardor and enthusiasm of the troops to the highest degree .
in constructing works of this kind in the water , the material used is sometimes stone and sometimes earth .
so far as earth is employed , it is necessary to resort to some means to prevent its spreading under the water , or being washed away by the dash of the waves at its sides .
this is usually effected by driving what are called piles , which are long beams of wood , pointed at the end , and driven into the earth by means of powerful engines .
<name> sent parties of men into the mountains of lebanon , where were vast forests of cedars , which were very celebrated in ancient times , and which are often alluded to in the sacred scriptures .
they cut down these trees , and brought the stems of them to the shore , where they sharpened them at one end and drove them into the sand , in order to protect the sides of their embankment .
others brought stones from the ruins and tumbled them into the sea in the direction where the pier was to be built .
it was some time before the work made such progress as to attract much attention from tyre .
at length , however , when the people of the city saw it gradually increasing in size and advancing toward them , they concluded that they must engage in <name> in the work of arresting its progress .
they accordingly constructed engines on the walls to throw heavy darts and stones over the water to the men upon the pier .
they sent secretly to the tribes that inhabited the valleys and ravines among the mountains , to attack the parties at work there , and they landed forces from the city at some distance from the pier , and then marched along the shore , and attempted to drive away the men that were engaged in carrying stones from the ruins .
they also fitted up and manned some galleys of large size , and brought them up near to the pier itself , and attacked the men who were at work upon it with stones , darts , arrows , and missiles of every description .
but all was of no avail .
the work , though impeded , still went on .
<name> built large screens of wood upon the pier , covering them with hides , which protected his soldiers from the weapons of the enemy , so that they could <name> on their operations safely behind them .
by these means the work advanced for some distance further .
as it advanced , various structures were erected upon it , especially along the sides and at the end toward the city .
these structures consisted of great engines for driving piles , and machines for throwing stones and darts , and towers carried up to a great height , to enable the men to throw stones and heavy weapons down upon the galleys which might attempt to approach them .
at length the <unk> determined on attempting to destroy all these wooden works by means of what is called in modern times a fire ship .
they took a large galley , and filled it with combustibles of every kind .
they loaded it first with light dry wood , and they poured pitch , and tar , and oil over all this wood to make it burn with fiercer flames .
they saturated the sails and the cordage in the same manner , and laid trains of combustible materials through all parts of the vessel , so that when fire should be set in one part it would immediately spread every where , and set the whole mass in flames at once .
they towed this ship , on a <name> day , near to the enemy 's works , and on the side from which the wind was blowing .
they then put it in motion toward the pier at a point where there was the greatest collection of engines and machines , and when they had got as near as they dared to go themselves , the men who were on board set the trains on fire , and made their escape in boats .
the flames ran all over the vessel with inconceivable rapidity .
the vessel itself drifted down upon <name> 's works , notwithstanding the most strenuous exertions of his soldiers to keep it away .
the frames and engines , and the enormous and complicated machines which had been erected , took fire , and the whole mass was soon enveloped in a general conflagration .
the men made desperate attempts to defend their works , but all in vain .
some were killed by arrows and darts , some were burned to death , and others , in the confusion , fell into the sea .
finally , the army was obliged to draw back , and to abandon all that was combustible in the vast construction they had reared , to the devouring flames .
[ illustration : the siege of tyre . ]
not long after this the sea itself came to the aid of the <unk> .
there was a storm ; and , as a consequence of it , a heavy swell rolled in from the offing , which soon undermined and washed away a large part of the pier .
the effects of a heavy sea on the most massive and substantial structures , when they are fairly exposed to its impulse , are far greater than would be conceived possible by those who had not witnessed them .
the most ponderous stones are removed , the strongest fastenings are torn asunder , and embankments the most compact and solid are undermined and washed away .
the storm , in this case , destroyed in a few hours the work of many months , while the army of <name> looked on from the shore witnessing its ravages in dismay .
when the storm was over , and the first shock of chagrin and disappointment had passed from the minds of the men , <name> prepared to resume the work with fresh vigor and energy .
the men commenced repairing the pier and widening it , so as to increase its strength and capacity .
they dragged whole trees to the edges of it , and sunk them , branches and all , to the bottom , to form a sort of platform there , to prevent the stones from sinking into the slime .
they built new towers and engines , covering them with green hides to make them fire-proof ; and thus they were soon advancing again , and gradually drawing nearer to the city , and in a more threatening and formidable manner than ever .
<name> , finding that his efforts were impeded very much by the ships of the <unk> , determined on collecting and <unk> a fleet of his own .
this he did at <unk> , which was a town a short distance north of tyre .
he embarked on board this fleet himself , and came down with it into the <unk> seas .
with this fleet he had various success .
he chained many of the ships together , two and two , at a little distance apart , covering the inclosed space with a platform , on which the soldiers could stand to fight .
the men also erected engines on these platforms to attack the city .
these engines were of various kinds .
there was what they called the battering ram , which was a long and very heavy beam of wood , headed with iron or brass .
this beam was suspended by a chain in the middle , so that it could be swung back and forth by the soldiers , its head striking against the wall each time , by which means the wall would sometimes be soon battered down .
they had also machines for throwing great stones , or beams of wood , by means of the elastic force of strong bars of wood , or of steel , or that of twisted ropes .
the part of the machine upon which the stone was placed would be drawn back by the united strength of many of the soldiers , and then , as it recovered itself when released , the stone would be thrown off into the air with prodigious velocity and force .
<name> 's double galleys answered very well as long as the water was smooth ; but sometimes , when they were caught out in a swell , the rolling of the waves would rack and twist them so as to tear the platforms asunder , and sink the men in the sea .
thus difficulties unexpected and formidable were continually arising .
<name> , however , persevered through them all .
the <unk> , finding themselves pressed more and more , and seeing that the dangers impending became more and more formidable every day , at length concluded to send a great number of the women and children away to carthage , which was a great commercial city in africa .
they were determined not to submit to <name> , but to <name> their resistance to the very last extremity .
and as the closing scenes of a siege , especially if the place is at last taken by storm , are awful beyond description , they wished to save their wives , and daughters , and helpless babes from having to witness them .
in the mean time , as the siege advanced , the parties became more and more incensed against each other .
they treated the captives which they took on either side with greater and greater cruelty , each thinking that they were only <unk> worse injuries from the other .
the macedonians approached nearer and nearer .
the resources of the unhappy city were gradually cut off and its strength worn away .
the engines approached nearer and nearer to the walls , until the battering rams bore directly upon them , and breaches began to be made .
at length one great breach on the southern side was found to be " practicable , " as they call it .
<name> began to prepare for the final assault , and the <unk> saw before them the horrible prospect of being taken by storm .
still they would not submit .
submission would now have done but little good , though it might have saved some of the final horrors of the scene .
<name> had become greatly exasperated by the long resistance which the <unk> had made .
they probably could not now have averted destruction , but they might , perhaps , have prevented its coming upon them in so terrible a shape as the irruption of thirty thousand frantic and infuriated soldiers through the breaches in their walls to take their city by storm .
the breach by which <name> proposed to force his entrance was on the southern side .
he prepared a number of ships , with platforms raised upon them in such a manner that , on getting near the walls , they could be let down , and form a sort of bridge , over which the men could pass to the broken fragments of the wall , and thence ascend through the breach above .
the plan succeeded .
the ships advanced to the proposed place of landing .
the bridges were let down .
the men crowded over them to the foot of the wall .
they clambered up through the breach to the battlements above , although the <unk> thronged the passage and made the most desperate resistance .
hundreds were killed by darts , and arrows , and falling stones , and their bodies tumbled into the sea .
the others , paying no attention to their falling comrades , and drowning the horrid screams of the crushed and the dying with their own frantic shouts of rage and fury , pressed on up the broken wall till they reached the battlements above .
the vast throng then rolled along upon the top of the wall till they came to stairways and slopes by which they could descend into the city , and , pouring down through all these avenues , they spread over the streets , and <unk> the hatred and rage , which had been gathering strength for seven long months , in bursting into houses , and killing and destroying all that came in their way .
thus the city was stormed .
after the soldiers were weary with the work of slaughtering the wretched inhabitants of the city , they found that many still remained alive , and <name> tarnished the character for generosity and forbearance for which he had thus far been distinguished by the cruelty with which he treated them .
some were executed , some thrown into the sea ; and it is even said that two thousand were crucified along the sea-shore .
this may mean that their bodies were placed upon crosses after life had been destroyed by some more humane method than crucifixion .
at any rate , we find frequent indications from this time that prosperity and power were beginning to exert their usual unfavorable influence upon <name> 's character .
he became haughty , imperious , and cruel .
he lost the modesty and gentleness which seemed to characterize him in the earlier part of his life , and began to assume the moral character , as well as perform the exploits , of a military hero .
a good illustration of this is afforded by the answer that he sent to <name> , about the time of the storming of tyre , in reply to a second communication which he had received from him proposing terms of peace .
<name> offered him a very large sum of money for the ransom of his mother , wife , and child , and agreed to give up to him all the country he had conquered , including the whole territory west of the euphrates .
he also offered him his daughter <unk> in marriage .
he recommended to him to accept these terms , and be content with the possessions he had already acquired ; that he could not expect to succeed , if he should try , in crossing the mighty rivers of the east , which were in the way of his march toward the persian dominions .
<name> replied , that if he wished to marry his daughter he could do it without his consent ; as to the ransom , he was not in want of money ; in respect to <name> 's offering to give him up all west of the euphrates , it was absurd for a man to speak of giving what was no longer his own ; that he had crossed too many seas in his military expeditions , since he left macedon , to feel any concern about the rivers that he might find in his way ; and that he should continue to pursue <name> wherever he might retreat in search of safety and protection , and he had no fear but that he should find and conquer him at last .
it was a harsh and cruel message to send to the unhappy monarch whom he had already so greatly injured .
parmenio advised him to accept <name> 's offers .
" i would , " said he , " if i were <name> . "
" yes , " said <name> , " and so would i if i were parmenio . "
what a reply from a youth of twenty-two to a venerable general of sixty , who had been so tried and faithful a friend , and so efficient a <unk> both to his father and to himself , for so many years .
the siege and storming of tyre has always been considered one of the greatest of <name> 's exploits .
the boldness , the perseverance , the indomitable energy which he himself and all his army manifested , during the seven months of their <unk> toil , attracted the admiration of the world .
and yet we find our feelings of sympathy for his character , and interest in his fate , somewhat alienated by the indications of pride , <unk> , and cruelty which begin to appear .
while he rises in our estimation as a military hero , he begins to sink somewhat as a man .
and yet the change was not sudden .
he bore during the siege his part in the privations and difficulties which the soldiers had to endure ; and the dangers to which they had to be exposed , he was always willing to share .
one night he was out with a party upon the mountains .
among his few immediate attendants was lysimachus , one of his former teachers , who always loved to accompany him at such times .
lysimachus was advanced in life , and somewhat infirm , and consequently could not keep up with the rest in the march .
<name> remained with lysimachus , and ordered the rest to go on .
the road at length became so rugged that they had to dismount from their horses and walk .
finally they lost their way , and found themselves obliged to stop for the night .
they had no fire .
they saw , however , at a distance , some camp fires blazing which belonged to the barbarian tribes against whom the expedition was directed .
<name> went to the nearest one .
there were two men lying by it , who had been stationed to take care of it .
he advanced stealthily to them and killed them both , probably while they were asleep .
he then took a brand from their fire , carried it back to his own encampment , where he made a blazing fire for himself and lysimachus , and they passed the night in comfort and safety .
this is the story .
how far we are to give credit to it , each reader must judge for himself .
one thing is certain , however , that there are many military heroes of whom such stories would not be even <unk> .

after completing the subjugation of tyre , <name> commenced his march for egypt .
his route led him through judea .
the time was about three hundred years before the birth of christ , and , of course , this passage of the great conqueror through the land of <name> took place between the historical periods of the old testament and of the new , so that no account of it is given in the sacred volume .
there was a jewish writer named josephus , who lived and wrote a few years after christ , and , of course , more than three hundred years after <name> .
he wrote a history of the jews , which is a very entertaining book to read ; but he liked so much to magnify the importance of the events in the history of his country , and to embellish them with marvelous and supernatural incidents , that his narratives have not always been received with implicit <name> .
josephus says that , as <name> passed through palestine , he went to pay a visit to jerusalem .
the circumstances of this visit , according to his account , were these .
the city of tyre , before <name> besieged it , as it lived entirely by commerce , and was surrounded by the sea , had to depend on the neighboring countries for a supply of food .
the people were accordingly accustomed to purchase grain in <unk> , in judea , and in egypt , and transport it by their ships to the island .
<name> , in the same manner , when besieging the city , found that he must depend upon the neighboring countries for supplies of food ; and he accordingly sent <unk> for such supplies to several places , and , among others , to judea .
the jews , as josephus says , refused to send any such supplies , saying that it would be inconsistent with fidelity to <name> , under whose government they were .
<name> took no notice of this reply at the time , being occupied with the siege of tyre ; but , as soon as that city was taken , and he was ready to pass through judea , he directed his march toward jerusalem with the intention of destroying the city .
now the chief magistrate at jerusalem at this time , the one who had the command of the city , ruling it , of course , under a general responsibility to the persian government , was the high priest .
his name was <unk> .
in the time of christ , about three hundred years after this , the name of the <unk> , as the reader <name> recollect , was <unk> .
<unk> and all the inhabitants of jerusalem were very much alarmed .
they knew not what to do .
the siege and capture of tyre had impressed them all with a strong sense of <name> 's terrible energy and martial power , and they began to anticipate certain destruction .
<unk> caused great sacrifices to be offered to almighty god , and public and solemn prayers were made , to implore his guidance and protection .
the next day after these services , he told the people that they had nothing to fear .
god had appeared to him in a dream , and directed him what to do .
" we are not to resist the conqueror , " said he , " but to go forth to meet him and welcome him .
we are to <unk> the city with flowers , and adorn it as for a festive celebration .
the priests are to be dressed in their <unk> robes and go forth , and the inhabitants are to follow them in a civic procession .
in this way we are to go out to meet <name> as he advances  and all <name> be well . "
these directions were followed .
<name> was coming on with a full determination to destroy the city .
when , however , he saw the procession , and came near enough to distinguish the appearance and dress of the high priest , he stopped , seemed surprised and pleased , and advanced toward him with an air of the profoundest deference and respect .
he seemed to pay him almost religious homage and adoration .
every one was astonished .
parmenio asked him for an explanation .
<name> made the following extraordinary statement : " when i was in macedon , before setting out on this expedition , while i was revolving the subject in my mind , musing day after day on the means of conquering <name> , one night i had a remarkable dream .
in my dream this very priest appeared before me , dressed just as he is now .
he <unk> me to banish every fear , to cross the hellespont boldly , and to push forward into the heart of <name> .
he said that god would march at the head of my army , and give me the victory over all the persians .
i recognize this priest as the same person that appeared to me then .
he has the same countenance , the same dress , the same stature , the same air .
it is through his encouragement and aid that i am here , and i am ready to worship and adore the god whose service he <unk> . "
<name> joined the high priest in the procession , and they returned to jerusalem together .
there <name> united with them and with the jews of the city in the celebration of religious rites , by offering sacrifices and <unk> in the jewish manner .
the writings which are now printed together in our bibles , as the old testament , were , in those days , written separately on parchment rolls , and kept in the <name> .
the priests produced from the rolls the one containing the prophecies of <name> , and they read and interpreted some of these prophecies to <name> , which they considered to have reference to him , though written many hundred years before .
<name> was , as josephus relates , very much pleased at the sight of these ancient predictions , and the interpretation put upon them by the priests .
he assured the jews that they should be protected in the exercise of all their rights , and especially in their religious worship , and he also promised them that he would take their brethren who resided in media and babylon under his special charge when he should come into possession of those places .
these jews of media and babylon were the descendants of captives which had been carried away from their native land in former wars .
such is the story which josephus relates .
the greek historians , on the other hand , make no mention of this visit to jerusalem ; and some persons think that it was never made , but that the story arose and was propagated from generation to generation among the jews , through the influence of their <name> to magnify the importance and influence of their worship , and that josephus incorporated the account into his history without sufficiently <unk> the facts .
however it may be in regard to jerusalem , <name> was delayed at <unk> , which , as may be seen upon the map , is on the shore of the mediterranean sea .
it was a place of considerable commerce and wealth , and was , at this time , under the command of a governor whom <name> had stationed there .
his name was <unk> .
<unk> refused to surrender the place .
<name> stopped to <unk> it , and the siege delayed him two months .
he was very much exasperated at this , both against <unk> and against the city .
his unreasonable anger was very much increased by a wound which he received .
he was near a mound which his soldiers had been constructing near the city , to place engines upon for an attack upon the walls , when an arrow shot from one of the engines upon the walls struck him in the breast .
it penetrated his armor , and wounded him deeply in the shoulder .
the wound was very painful for some time , and the suffering which he endured from it only added fuel to the flame of his anger against the city .
at last breaches were made in the walls , and the place was taken by storm .
<name> treated the wretched captives with extreme cruelty .
he cut the garrison to pieces , and sold the inhabitants to slavery .
as for <unk> , he dealt with him in a manner almost too horrible to be described .
the reader <name> recollect that achilles , at the siege of <name> , after killing <name> , dragged his dead body around the walls of the city .
<name> , growing more cruel as he became more accustomed to war and bloodshed , had been intending to imitate this example so soon as he could find an enemy worthy of such a fate .
he now determined to <name> his plan into execution with <unk> .
he ordered him into his presence .
a few years before , he would have rewarded him for his fidelity in his master 's service ; but now , grown selfish , hard hearted , and <unk> , he looked upon him with a countenance full of vindictive exultation , and said , " you are not going to die the simple death that you <name> .
you have got the worst torments that revenge can invent to suffer . "
<unk> did not reply , but looked upon <name> with a calm , and composed , and <unk> air , which incensed the conqueror more and more .
" observe his dumb arrogance , " said <name> ; " but i <name> conquer him .
i <name> show him that i can draw groans from him , if nothing else . "
he then ordered holes to be made through the heels of his unhappy captive , and , passing a rope through them , had the body fastened to a chariot , and dragged about the city till no life remained .
<name> found many <name> treasures in <unk> .
he sent a large part of them to his mother olympias , whom he had left in macedon .
alexander's affection for his mother seems to have been more permanent than almost any other good trait in his character .
he found , in addition to other stores of valuable merchandise , a large quantity of <unk> and <unk> .
these are gums which were brought from arabia , and were very costly .
they were used chiefly in making offerings and in burning incense to the gods .
when <name> was a young man in macedon , before his father 's death , he was one day present at the offering of sacrifices , and one of his teachers and guardians , named <unk> , who was standing by , thought he was rather profuse in his consumption of <unk> and <unk> .
he was taking it up by handfuls and throwing it upon the fire .
<unk> reproved him for this extravagance , and told him that when he became master of the countries where these costly gums were procured , he might be as prodigal of them as he pleased , but that in the mean time it would be proper for him to be more prudent and economical .
<name> remembered this reproof , and , finding vast stores of these expensive gums in <unk> , he sent the whole quantity to <unk> , telling him that he sent him this abundant supply that he might not have occasion to be so reserved and sparing for the future in his sacrifices to the gods .
after this conquest and destruction of <unk> , <name> continued his march southward to the frontiers of egypt .
he reached these frontiers at the city of pelusium .
the egyptians had been under the persian dominion , but they abhorred it , and were very ready to submit to <name> 's sway .
they sent embassadors to meet him upon the frontiers .
the governors of the cities , as he advanced into the country , finding that it would be useless to resist , and warned by the terrible example of thebes , tyre , and <unk> , surrendered to him as fast as he summoned them .
he went to memphis .
memphis was a great and powerful city , situated in what was called lower egypt , on the nile , just above where the branches which form the mouths of the nile separate from the main stream .
all that part of egypt is flat country , having been formed by the deposits brought down by the nile .
such land is called alluvial ; it is always level , and , as it consists of successive deposits from the turbid waters of the river , made in the successive inundations , it forms always a very <name> soil , deep and inexhaustible , and is , of course , extremely fertile .
egypt has been celebrated for its <unk> fertility from the earliest times .
it waves with fields of corn and grain , and is adorned with groves of the most luxuriant growth and richest verdure .
it is only , however , so far as the land is formed by the deposits of the nile , that this scene of verdure and beauty extends .
on the east it is bounded by ranges of barren and <name> hills , and on the west by vast deserts , consisting of moving sands , from which no animal or vegetable life can derive the means of existence .
the reason of this sterility seems to be the absence of water .
the geological formation of the land is such that it furnishes few springs of water , and no streams , and in that climate it seldom or never rains .
if there is water , the most barren sands <name> clothe themselves with some species of vegetation , which , in its decay , <name> form a soil that <name> nourish more and more fully each succeeding generation of plants .
but in the absence of water , any surface of earth <name> soon become a barren sand .
the wind <name> drive away every thing <unk> , leaving only the heavy sands , to drift in storms , like fields of snow .
among these african deserts , however , there are some fertile spots .
they are occasioned by springs which arise in little <unk> , and which <unk> the ground with moisture for some distance around them .
the water from these springs flows for some distance , in many cases , in a little stream , before it is finally lost and absorbed in the sands .
the whole tract under the influence of this irrigation clothes itself with verdure .
trees grow up to shade it .
it forms a spot whose beauty , absolutely great , is heightened by the contrast which it presents to the gloomy and desolate desert by which it is surrounded .
such a green spot in the desert is called an oasis .
they are the resort and the refuge of the traveler and the pilgrim , who seek shelter and repose upon them in their weary journeys over the trackless wilds .
nor must it be supposed that these islands of fertility and verdure are always small .
some of them are very extensive , and contain a considerable population .
there is one called the great oasis , which consists of a chain of fertile tracts of about a hundred miles in length .
another , called the oasis of <unk> , has , in modern times , a population of eight thousand souls .
this last is situated not far from the shores of the mediterranean sea  at least not very far : perhaps two or three hundred miles  and it was a very celebrated spot in <name> 's day .
the cause of its celebrity was that it was the seat and center of the worship of a famous deity called jupiter ammon .
this god was said to be the son of jupiter , though there were all sorts of stories about his origin and early history .
he had the form of a ram , and was worshiped by the people of egypt , and also by the carthaginians , and by the people of northern africa generally .
his <name> was in this oasis , and it was surrounded by a considerable population , which was supported , in a great degree , by the expenditures of the <unk> who came as pilgrims , or otherwise , to sacrifice at his shrine .
it is said that <name> , finding that the various objects of human ambition which he had been so rapidly attaining by his victories and conquests for the past few years were insufficient to satisfy him , began now to aspire for some supernatural honors , and he accordingly conceived the design of having himself declared to be the son of a god .
the heroes of <name> were sons of the gods .
<name> envied them the fame and honor which this distinction gave them in the opinion of mankind .
he determined to visit the <name> of jupiter ammon in the oasis of <unk> , and to have the declaration of his divine origin made by the priests there .
he proceeded , accordingly , to the mouth of the nile , where he found a very eligible place , as he believed , for the foundation of a commercial city , and he determined to build it on his return .
thence he marched along the shores of the mediterranean , toward the west , until he reached a place called <unk> , which <name> be found upon the map .
he then left the sea-shore and marched south , striking at once into the desert when he left the sea .
he was accompanied by a small detachment of his army as an escort , and they journeyed eleven days before they reached the oasis .
they had a variety of perilous adventures in crossing the desert .
for the first two days the soldiers were excited and pleased with the novelty and romantic grandeur of the scene .
the desert has , in some degree , the sublimity of the ocean .
there is the same boundless expanse , the same vast , unbroken curve of the horizon , the same <unk> , the same solitude .
there is , in addition , a certain profound and awful stillness and repose , which imparts to it a new element of impressiveness and grandeur .
its dread and solemn silence is far more imposing and sublime than the loudest thunders of the seas .
the third day the soldiers began to be weary of such a march .
they seemed afraid to penetrate any further into such boundless and terrible solitudes .
they had been obliged to bring water with them in <unk> , which were carried by camels .
the camel is the only beast of burden which can be employed upon the deserts .
there is a peculiarity in the anatomical structure of this animal by which he can take in , at one time , a supply of water for many days .
he is formed , in fact , for the desert .
in his native state he lives in the <unk> and in the valleys .
he eats the herbage which grows among the rocks and hills that alternate with the great <name> plains in all these countries .
in passing from one of his scanty pasturages to another , he has long journeys to make across the sands , where , though he can find food here and there , there is no water .
providence has formed him with a structure adapted to this <unk> , and by means of it he becomes extremely useful to man .
the soldiers of <name> did not take a sufficient supply of water , and were reduced , at one time , to great distress .
they were relieved , the story says , by a rain , though rain is extremely unusual in the deserts .
<name> attributed this supply to the miraculous interposition of heaven .
they catch the rain , in such cases , with cloths , and afterward wring out the water ; though in this instance , as the historians of that day say , the soldiers did not wait for this tardy method of supply , but the whole detachment held back their heads and opened their mouths , to catch the drops of rain as they fell .
there was another danger to which they were exposed in their march , more terrible even than the scarcity of water .
it was that of being overwhelmed in the clouds of sand and dust which sometimes swept over the desert in gales of wind .
these were called <unk> .
the fine sand flew , in such cases , in driving clouds , which filled the eyes and stopped the breath of the traveler , and finally buried his body under its drifts when he laid down to die .
a large army of fifty thousand men , under a former persian king , had been overwhelmed and destroyed in this way , some years before , in some of the egyptian deserts .
<name> 's soldiers had heard of this calamity , and they were threatened sometimes with the same fate .
they , however , at length escaped all the dangers of the desert , and began to approach the green and fertile land of the oasis .
the change from the barren and dismal loneliness of the <name> plains to the groves and the villages , the beauty and the verdure of the oasis , was delightful both to <name> himself and to all his men .
the priests at the great <name> of jupiter ammon received them all with marks of great distinction and honor .
the most solemn and magnificent ceremonies were performed , with offerings , <unk> , and sacrifices .
the priests , after conferring in secret with the god in the <name> , came out with the annunciation that <name> was indeed his son , and they paid him , accordingly , almost divine honors .
he is supposed to have bribed them to do this by presents and pay .
<name> returned at length to memphis , and in all his subsequent orders and decrees he styled himself <name> king , son of jupiter ammon .
[ illustration : a focus . ]
but , though <name> was thus willing to impress his ignorant soldiers with a mysterious veneration for his fictitious divinity , he was not deceived himself on the subject ; he sometimes even made his pretensions to the divine character a subject of joke .
for instance , they one day brought him in too little fire in the focus .
the focus , or fire-place used in <name> 's day was a small metallic stand , on which the fire was built .
it was placed wherever convenient in the tent , and the smoke escaped above .
they had put upon the focus too little fuel one day when they brought it in .
<name> asked the officer to let him have either some wood or some <unk> ; they might consider him , he said , as a god or as a man , whichever they pleased , but he wished to be treated either like one or the other .
on his return from the oasis <name> carried forward his plan of building a city at the mouth of the nile .
he <name> the plan , it is said , with his own hands .
he superintended the constructions , and invited artisans and mechanics from all nations to come and reside in it .
they accepted the invitation in great <name> , and the city soon became large , and wealthy , and powerful .
it was intended as a commercial post , and the wisdom and sagacity which <name> manifested in the selection of the site , is shown by the fact that the city rose immediately to the rank of the great seat of trade and commerce for all those shores , and has continued to hold that rank now for twenty centuries .
there was an island near the coast , opposite the city , called the island of pharos .
they built a most magnificent <unk> upon one extremity of this island , which was considered , in those days , one of the wonders of the world .
it was said to be five hundred feet high .
this may have been an exaggeration .
at any rate , it was celebrated throughout the world in its day , and its existence and its greatness made an impression on the human mind which has not yet been effaced .
pharos is the name for <unk> , in many languages , to the present day .
in building the city of <name> , <name> laid aside , for a time , his natural and proper character , and assumed a mode of action in strong contrast with the ordinary course of his life .
he was , throughout most of his career , a destroyer .
he roamed over the world to interrupt commerce , to break in upon and disturb the peaceful pursuits of industry , to batter down city walls , and burn dwellings , and kill men .
this is the true vocation of a hero and a conqueror ; but at the mouth of the nile <name> laid aside this character .
he turned his energies to the work of planning means to do good .
he constructed a port ; he built warehouses ; he provided accommodations and protection for merchants and artisans .
the nations exchanged their commodities far more easily and extensively in consequence of these facilities , and the means of comfort and enjoyment were multiplied and increased in thousands and thousands of huts in the great cities of egypt , and in the rural districts along the banks of the nile .
the good , too , which he thus commenced , has perpetuated itself .
<name> has continued to fulfill its beneficent function for two thousand years .
it is the only monument of his greatness which remains .
every thing else which he accomplished perished when he died .
how much better would it have been for the happiness of mankind , as well as for his own true fame and <name> , if doing good had been the rule of his life instead of the exception .

all the western part of <name> was now in <name> 's power .
he was undisputed master of <name> minor , <unk> , judea , and egypt .
he returned from egypt to tyre , leaving governors to rule in his name in all the conquered provinces .
the injuries which had been done to tyre , during the siege and at the assault , were repaired , and it was again a wealthy , powerful , and prosperous city .
<name> rested and refreshed his army there , and spent some weeks in most splendid festivities and rejoicings .
the princes and potentates of all the neighboring countries assembled to partake of his hospitality , to be entertained by the games , the plays , the spectacles , and the <unk> , and to unite in swelling his court and doing him honor .
in a word , he was the general center of attraction for all eyes , and the object of universal homage .
all this time , however , he was very far from being satisfied , or feeling that his work was done .
<name> , whom he considered his great enemy , was still in the field <unk> .
he had retreated across the euphrates , and was employed in assembling a vast collection of forces from all the eastern nations which were under his sway , to meet <name> in the final contest .
<name> therefore made arrangements at tyre for the proper government of the various kingdoms and provinces which he had already conquered , and then began to prepare for marching eastward with the main body of his army .
during all this time the ladies of <name> 's family , who had been taken captive at <unk> , had been retained in captivity , and made to accompany <name> 's army in its marches .
<name> refused to accede to any of the plans and propositions which <name> made and offered for the redemption of his wife and mother , but insisted on retaining them as his prisoners .
he , however , treated them with respect and high consideration .
he provided them with <name> tents of great magnificence , and had them conveyed from place to place , when his army moved , with all the <name> state to which they had been accustomed when in the court of <name> .
it has been generally thought a proof of nobleness of spirit and generosity in <name> that he treated his captives in this manner .
it would seem , however , that true generosity would have prompted the restoration of these unhappy and harmless prisoners to the husband and father who mourned their separation from him , and their cruel sufferings , with bitter grief .
it is more probable , therefore , that policy , and a regard for his own aggrandizement , rather than compassion for the suffering , led him to honor his captive queens .
it was a great <name> to him , in a martial point of view , to have such trophies of his victory in his train ; and , of course , the more highly he honored the personages , the more glorious the trophy appeared .
accordingly , <name> did every thing in his power to magnify the importance of his <name> captives , by the splendor of their retinue , and the pomp and pageantry with which he invested their movements .
a short time after leaving tyre , on the march eastward , <unk> , the wife of <name> , was taken suddenly ill and died .
[ c ] the tidings were immediately brought to <name> , and he repaired without delay to <unk> 's tent .
<unk> was the mother of <name> .
she was in the greatest agony of grief .
she was lying upon the floor of her tent , surrounded by the ladies of her court , and entirely overwhelmed with sorrow .
<name> did all in his power to calm and comfort her .
[ footnote c : it was the birth of an infant that caused her death , exhausted and worn down as she doubtless was , by her captivity and her sorrows . ]
one of the officers of <name> <unk> 's household [ d ] made his escape from the camp immediately after his mistress 's death , and fled across the country to <name> , to <name> him the heavy tidings .
<name> was overwhelmed with affliction .
the officer , however , in farther interviews , gave him such an account of the kind and respectful treatment which the ladies had received from <name> , during all the time of their captivity , as greatly to relieve his mind , and to afford him a high degree of comfort and consolation .
he expressed a very strong sense of gratitude to <name> for his generosity and kindness , and said that if his kingdom of persia must be conquered , he sincerely wished that it might fall into the hands of such a conqueror as <name> .
[ footnote d : a <unk> , a sort of officer employed in eastern nations in attendance upon ladies of high rank . ]
by looking at the map at the commencement of the volume , it <name> be seen that the <unk> and the euphrates are parallel streams , flowing through the heart of the western part of <name> toward the southeast , and emptying into the persian gulf .
the country between these two rivers , which was extremely populous and fertile , was called <unk> .
<name> had collected an immense army here .
the various detachments filled all the plains of <unk> .
<name> turned his course a little northward , intending to pass the river euphrates at a famous ancient crossing at <unk> , which may be seen upon the map .
when he arrived at this place he found a small persian army there .
they , however , retired as he approached .
<name> built two bridges across the river , and passed his army safely over .
in the mean time , <name> , with his enormous host , passed across the <unk> , and moved toward the northward , along the eastern side of the river .
he had to cross the various branches of the <unk> as he advanced .
at one of them , called the <unk> , which may also be seen upon the map , there was a bridge .
it took the vast host which <name> had collected five days to pass this bridge .
while <name> had been thus advancing to the northward into the latitude where he knew that <name> must cross the rivers , <name> himself , and his small but compact and fearless body of grecian troops , were moving eastward , toward the same region to which <name> 's line of march was tending .
<name> at length reached the <unk> .
he was obliged to ford this stream .
the banks were steep and the current was rapid , and the men were in great danger of being swept away .
to prevent this danger , the ranks , as they advanced , linked their arms together , so that each man might be sustained by his comrades .
they held their shields above their heads to keep them from the water .
<name> waded like the rest , though he kept in front , and reached the bank before the others .
standing there , he indicated to the advancing column , by <unk> , where to land , the noise of the water being too great to allow his voice to be heard .
to see him standing there , safely landed , and with an expression of confidence and triumph in his attitude and air , awakened fresh energy in the heart of every soldier in the columns which were crossing the stream .
notwithstanding this encouragement , however , the passage of the troops and the landing on the bank produced a scene of great confusion .
many of the soldiers had tied up a portion of their clothes in bundles , which they held above their heads , together with their arms , as they waded along through the swift current of the stream .
they , however , found it impossible to <name> these bundles , but had to abandon them at last in order to save themselves , as they staggered along through deep and rapid water , and over a concealed bottom of slippery stones .
thousands of these bundles , mingled with spears , darts , and every other sort of weapon that would float , were swept down by the current , to impede and embarrass the men who were passing below .
at length , however , the men themselves succeeded in getting over in safety , though a large quantity of arms and of clothing was lost .
there was no enemy upon the bank to oppose them .
<name> could not , in fact , well meet and oppose <name> in his attempt to cross the river , because he could not determine at what point he would probably make the attempt , in season to concentrate so large an army to oppose him .
<name> 's troops , being a comparatively small and compact body , and being accustomed to move with great promptness and celerity , could easily evade any attempt of such an unwieldy mass of forces to oppose his crossing at any particular point upon the stream .
at any rate , <name> did not make any such attempt , and <name> had no difficulties to encounter in crossing the <unk> other than the physical obstacles presented by the current of the stream .
<name> 's plan was , therefore , not to intercept <name> on his march , but to choose some great and convenient battle-field , where he could collect his forces , and marshal them advantageously , and so await an attack there .
he knew very well that his enemy would seek him out , wherever he was , and , consequently , that he might choose his position .
he found such a field in an extensive plain at <unk> , not far from the city of <unk> .
the spot has received historical immortality under the name of the plain of <unk> .
<name> was several days in concentrating his vast armies upon this plain .
he constructed encampments ; he leveled the inequalities which would interfere with the movements of his great bodies of cavalry ; he guarded the approaches , too , as much as possible .
there is a little instrument used in war called a <unk> .
[ e ] it consists of a small ball of iron , with several sharp points projecting from it one or two inches each way .
if these instruments are thrown upon the ground at random , one of the points must necessarily be upward , and the horses that tread upon them are lamed and disabled at once .
<name> caused <unk> to be scattered in the grass and along the roads , wherever the army of <name> would be likely to approach his troops on the field of battle .
[ footnote e : it receives its name from a kind of thistle called the <unk> . ]
[ illustration : the <unk> . ]
<name> , having crossed the river , encamped for a day or two on the banks , to rest and refresh , and to <unk> his army .
while here , the soldiers were one night thrown into consternation by an eclipse of the moon .
whenever an eclipse of the moon takes place , it is , of course , when the moon is full , so that the eclipse is always a sudden , and , among an ignorant people , an unexpected waning of the orb in the height of its splendor ; and as such people know not the cause of the phenomenon , they are often extremely terrified .
<name> 's soldiers were thrown into consternation by the eclipse .
they considered it the manifestation of the displeasure of heaven at their presumptuous daring in crossing such rivers , and penetrating to such a distance to invade the territories of another king .
in fact , the men were <unk> to fear .
having wandered to a vast distance from home , having passed over such mountains and deserts , and now , at last , having crossed a deep and dangerous river , and thrown themselves into the immediate vicinity of a foe ten times as numerous as themselves , it was natural that they should feel some misgivings .
and when , at night , impressed with the sense of solemnity which night always imparts to strange and novel scenes , they looked up to the bright round moon , pleased with the expression of cheerfulness and companionship which beams always in her light , to find her suddenly waning , changing her form , withdrawing her bright beams , and looking down upon them with a lurid and murky light , it was not surprising that they felt an emotion of terror .
in fact , there is always an element of terror in the emotion excited by looking upon an eclipse , which an instinctive feeling of the heart inspires .
it <unk> the spectacle with a solemn grandeur .
it holds the spectator , however cultivated and refined , in silence while he gazes at it .
it <unk> with a scientific appreciation of the vastness of the movements and <unk> by which the effect is produced , and while the one occupies the intellect , the other impresses the soul .
the mind that has lost , through its philosophy , the power of feeling this emotion of awe in such scenes , has sunk , not risen .
its possessor has made himself inferior , not superior , to the rest of his species , by having paralyzed one of his <unk> of pleasure .
to him an eclipse is only curious and wonderful ; to others it is sublime .
the soldiers of <name> were extremely terrified .
a great panic spread throughout the encampment .
<name> himself , instead of attempting to allay their fears by reasoning , or treating them as of no importance , immediately gave the subject his most serious attention .
he called together the soothsayers , and directed them to consult together , and let him know what this great phenomenon portended .
this mere committing of the subject to the attention of the soothsayers had a great effect among all the soldiers of the army .
it calmed them .
it changed their agitation and terror into a feeling of suspense , in awaiting the answer of the soothsayers , which was far less painful and dangerous ; and at length , when the answer came , it allayed their anxiety and fear altogether .
the soothsayers said that the sun was on <name> 's side , and the moon on that of the persians , and that this sudden waning of her light <unk> the defeat and destruction which the persians were about to undergo .
the army were satisfied with this decision , and were inspired with new confidence and ardor .
it is often idle to attempt to oppose ignorance and absurdity by such feeble instruments as truth and reason , and the wisest managers of mankind have generally been most successful when their plan has been to counteract one folly by means of the influence of another .
<name> 's army consisted of about fifty thousand men , with the phalanx in the center .
this army moved along down the eastern bank of the <unk> , the scouts pressing forward as far as possible in every direction in front of the main army , in order to get intelligence of the foe .
it is in this way that two great armies feel after each other , as it were , like insects creeping over the ground , exploring the way before them with their antennÃ¦ .
at length , after three days' advance , the scouts came in with intelligence of the enemy .
<name> pressed forward with a detachment of his army to meet them .
they proved to be , however , not the main body of <name> 's army , but only a single corps of a thousand men , in advance of the rest .
they retreated as <name> approached .
he , however , succeeded in capturing some horsemen , who gave the information that <name> had assembled his vast forces on the plain of <unk> , and was waiting there in readiness to give his advancing enemy battle .
<name> halted his troops .
he formed an encampment , and made arrangements for depositing his baggage there .
he refreshed the men , examined and repaired their arms , and made the arrangements for battle .
these operations consumed several days .
at the end of that time , early one morning , long before day , the camp was in motion , and the columns , armed and equipped for immediate contest , moved forward .
they expected to have reached the camp of <name> at daybreak , but the distance was greater than they had supposed .
at length , however , the macedonians , in their march , came upon the brow of a range of hills , from which they looked down upon numberless and endless lines of infantry and cavalry , and ranges after ranges of tents , which filled the plain .
here the army paused while <name> examined the field , studying for a long time , and with great attention , the <name> and disposition of the enemy .
they were four miles distant still , but the murmuring sounds of their voices and movements came to the ears of the macedonians through the calm autumnal air .
<name> called the leading officers together , and held a consultation on the question whether to march down and attack the persians on the plain that night , or to wait till the next day .
parmenio was in favor of a night attack , in order to surprise the enemy by coming upon them at an unexpected time .
but <name> said no .
he was sure of victory .
he had got his enemies all before him ; they were fully in his power .
he would , therefore , take no advantage , but would attack them fairly and in open day .
<name> had fifty thousand men ; the persians were variously estimated between five hundred thousand and a million .
there is something sublime in the idea of such a pause , made by the macedonian phalanx and its wings , on the slopes of the hills , <unk> its attack upon ten times its number , to give the mighty mass of their enemies the chances of a fair and equal contest .
<name> made <unk> addresses to his soldiers on the occasion of their having now at last before them , what they had so long toiled and labored to attain , the whole concentrated force of the persian empire .
they were now going to contend , not for single provinces and kingdoms , as heretofore , but for general empire ; and the victory which they were about to achieve would place them on the summit of human <name> .
in all that he said on the subject , the unquestionable certainty of victory was assumed .
<name> completed his arrangements , and then retired to rest .
he went to sleep  at least he appeared to do so .
early in the morning parmenio arose , summoned the men to their posts , and arranged every thing for the march .
he then went to <name> 's tent .
<name> was still asleep .
he awoke him , and told him that all was ready .
parmenio expressed surprise at his sleeping so quietly at a time when such vast issues were at stake .
" you seem as calm , " said he , " as if you had had the battle and gained the victory . "
" i have done so , " said <name> .
" i consider the whole work done when we have gained access to <name> and his forces , and find him ready to give us battle . "
<name> soon appeared at the head of his troops .
of course this day was one of the most important ones of his life , and one of the historians of the time has preserved an account of his dress as he went into battle .
he wore a short tunic , girt close around him , and over it a linen <unk> , strongly <unk> .
the belt by which the tunic was held was <unk> with figures of beautiful workmanship .
this belt was a present to him from some of the people of the conquered countries through which he had passed , and it was very much admired .
he had a helmet upon his head , of polished steel , with a neck piece , also of steel , ornamented with precious stones .
his helmet was surmounted with a white plume .
his sword , which was a present to him from the king of cyprus , was very light and slender , and of the most perfect temper .
he carried , also , a shield and a <name> , made in the best possible manner for use , not for display .
thus his dress corresponded with the character of his action .
it was simple , compact , and whatever of value it possessed consisted in those substantial excellencies which would give the bearer the greatest efficiency on the field of battle .
the persians were accustomed to make use of elephants in their wars .
they also had chariots , with <unk> placed at the <unk> , which they were accustomed to drive among their enemies and <unk> them down .
<name> resorted to none of these contrivances .
there was the phalanx  the terrible phalanx  advancing irresistibly either in one body or in detachments , with columns of infantry and flying troops of horsemen on the wings .
<name> relied simply on the strength , the courage , the energy , and the calm and steady , but resistless ardor of his men , arranging them in simple combinations , and leading them forward directly to their work .
the macedonians cut their way through the mighty mass of their enemies with irresistible force .
the elephants turned and fled .
the foot soldiers seized the horses of some of the <unk> chariots and cut the traces .
in respect to others , they opened to the right and left and let them pass through , when they were easily captured by the men in the rear .
in the mean time the phalanx pressed on , enjoying a great advantage in the level nature of the ground .
the persian troops were broken in upon and driven away wherever they were attacked .
in a word , before night the whole mighty mass was scattering every where in confusion , except some hundreds of thousands left trampled upon and dead , or else writhing upon the ground , and groaning in their dying agonies .
<name> himself fled .
<name> pursued him with a troop of horse as far as <unk> , which had been <name> 's head-quarters , and where he had deposited immense treasures .
<name> had gone through and escaped when <name> arrived at <unk> , but the city and the treasures fell into <name> 's hands .
although <name> had been so completely victorious over his enemies on the day of battle , and had maintained his ground against them with such invincible power , he was , nevertheless , a few days afterward , driven entirely off the field , and completely away from the region where the battle had been fought .
what the living men , standing erect in arms , and full of martial vigor , could not do , was easily and effectually accomplished by their dead bodies <unk> on the plain .
the corpses of three hundred thousand men , and an equal bulk of the bodies of elephants and horses , was too enormous a mass to be buried .
it had to be abandoned ; and the horrible <unk> and pestilence which it emitted drove all the inhabitants of the country away .
<name> marched his troops rapidly off the ground , leaving , as the direct result of the battle , a wide extent of country <unk> and desolate , with this vast mass of <unk> and pestilence reigning in awful silence and solitude in the midst of it .
<name> went to babylon .
the governor of the city prepared to receive him as a conqueror .
the people came out in throngs to meet him , and all the avenues of approach were crowded with spectators .
all the city walls , too , were covered with men and women , assembled to witness the scene .
as for <name> himself , he was filled with pride and pleasure at thus arriving at the full accomplishment of his earliest and <unk> dreams of <name> .
the great <unk> of the <name> treasures of persia was at susa , a strong city east of babylon .
susa was the <name> residence of the persian kings , as <unk> , further north , among the mountains , was their summer residence .
there was a magnificent palace and a very strong citadel at susa , and the treasures were kept in the citadel .
it is said that in times of peace the persian monarchs had been accustomed to collect coin , melt it down , and cast the gold in earthen jars .
the jars were afterward broken off from the gold , leaving the bullion in the form of the interior of the jars .
an enormous amount of gold and silver , and of other treasures , had been thus collected .
<name> was aware of this <unk> before he advanced to meet <name> , and , on the day of the battle of <unk> , as soon as the victory was decided , he sent an officer from the very field to summon susa to surrender .
they obeyed the summons , and <name> , soon after his great public entrance into babylon , marched to susa , and took possession of the vast stores of wealth accumulated there .
the amount was enormous , both in quantity and value , and the seizing of it was a very magnificent act of plunder .
in fact , it is probable that <name> 's slaughter of the persian army at <unk> , and subsequent <unk> of susa , constitute , taken together , the most gigantic case of murder and robbery which was ever committed by man ; so that , in performing these deeds , the great hero attained at last to the <name> of having perpetrated the grandest and most imposing of all human crimes .
that these deeds were really crimes there can be no doubt , when we consider that <name> did not pretend to have any other motive in this invasion than love of conquest , which is , in other words , love of violence and plunder .
they are only technically <unk> from being called crimes by the fact that the earth has no laws and no <unk> high enough to condemn such enormous <unk> as that of one quarter of the globe breaking violently and <unk> in upon and robbing the other .
besides the treasures , <name> found also at susa a number of trophies which had been brought by xerxes from greece ; for xerxes had invaded greece some hundred years before <name> 's day , and had brought to susa the spoils and the trophies of his victories .
<name> sent them all back to greece again .
from susa the conqueror moved on to <unk> , the great persian capital .
on his march he had to pass through a defile of the mountains .
the mountaineers had been accustomed to exact tribute here of all who passed , having a sort of right , derived from ancient usage , to the payment of a toll .
they sent to <name> when they heard that he was approaching , and informed him that he could not pass with his army without paying the customary toll .
<name> sent back word that he would meet them at the pass , and give them their due .
they understood this , and prepared to defend the pass .
some persian troops joined them .
they built walls and <unk> across the narrow passages .
they collected great stones on the <unk> of precipices , and on the declivities of the mountains , to roll down upon the heads of their enemies .
by these and every other means they attempted to stop <name> 's passage .
but he had contrived to send detachments around by circuitous and precipitous paths , which even the mountaineers had deemed impracticable , and thus attack his enemies suddenly and unexpectedly from above their own positions .
as usual , his plan succeeded .
the mountaineers were driven away , and the conqueror advanced toward the great persian capital .

<name> 's march from susa to <unk> was less a march than a triumphal progress .
he felt the pride and elation so naturally resulting from success very strongly .
the moderation and forbearance which had characterized him in his earlier years , gradually disappeared as he became great and powerful .
he was intoxicated with his success .
he became haughty , vain , capricious , and cruel .
as he approached <unk> , he conceived the idea that , as this city was the capital and center of the persian monarchy , and , as such , the point from which had <unk> all the persian hostility to greece , he owed it some signal retribution .
accordingly , although the inhabitants made no opposition to his entrance , he marched in with the phalanx formed , and gave the soldiers <name> to kill and plunder as they pleased .
there was another very striking instance of the capricious recklessness now beginning to appear in <name> 's character , which occurred soon after he had taken possession of <unk> .
he was giving a great banquet to his friends , the officers of the army , and to persians of distinction among those who had submitted to him .
there was , among other women at this banquet , a very beautiful and accomplished female named <unk> .
<name> made her his favorite and companion , though she was not his wife .
<unk> did all in her power to <unk> and please <name> during the feast by her vivacity , her wit , her adroit attentions to him , and the display of her charms , and at length , when he himself , as well as the other guests , were excited with wine , she asked him to allow her to have the pleasure of going herself and setting fire , with her own hands , to the great palace of the persian kings in the city .
<unk> was a native of attica in greece , a kingdom of which athens was the capital .
xerxes , who had built the great palace of <unk> , had formerly invaded greece and had burned athens , and now <unk> desired to burn his palace in <unk> , to gratify her revenge , by making of its conflagration an evening spectacle to entertain the macedonian party after their supper .
<name> agreed to the proposal , and the whole company moved forward .
taking the torches from the <unk> halls , they sallied forth , alarming the city with their shouts , and with the flashing of the lights they bore .
the plan of <unk> was carried fully into effect , every <unk> guest assisting , by putting fire to the immense pile wherever they could get access to it .
they performed the barbarous deed with shouts of vengeance and exultation .
there is , however , something very solemn and awful in a great conflagration at night , and very few <unk> can gaze upon the fury of the lurid and frightful flames which they have caused to ascend without some misgivings and some remorse .
<name> was sobered by the grand and sublime , but terrible spectacle .
he was awed by it .
he repented .
he ordered the fire to be extinguished ; but it was too late .
the palace was destroyed , and one new blot , which has never since been effaced , was cast upon <name> 's character and fame .
and yet , notwithstanding these increasing proofs of pride and cruelty , which were beginning to be developed , <name> still preserved some of the early traits of character which had made him so great a favorite in the commencement of his career .
he loved his mother , and sent her presents continually from the treasures which were falling all the time into his possession .
she was a woman of a proud , imperious , and ungovernable character , and she made antipater , whom <name> had left in command in macedon , infinite trouble .
she wanted to exercise the powers of government herself , and was continually urging this .
<name> would not comply with these wishes , but he paid her personally every attention in his power , and bore all her invectives and reproaches with great <name> and good humor .
at one time he received a long letter from antipater , full of complaints against her ; but <name> , after reading it , said that they were heavy charges it was true , but that a single one of his mother 's tears would <unk> ten thousand such accusations .
olympias used to write very frequently to <name> , and in these letters she would criticise and discuss his proceedings , and make comments upon the characters and actions of his generals .
<name> kept these letters very secret , never showing them to any one .
one day , however , when he was reading one of these letters , <unk> , the personal friend and companion who has been already several times mentioned , came up , half playfully , and began to look over his shoulder .
<name> went on , allowing him to read , and then , when the letter was finished he took the <unk> ring from his finger and pressed it upon <unk> 's lips , a signal for silence and secrecy .
<name> was very kind to <unk> , the mother of <name> , and also to <name> 's children .
he would not give these unhappy captives their <name> , but in every other respect he treated them with the greatest possible kindness and consideration .
he called <unk> mother , loaded her with presents  presents , it is true , which he had plundered from her son , but to which it was considered , in those days , that he had acquired a just and perfect title .
when he reached susa , he established <unk> and the children there in great state .
this had been their usual residence in most seasons of the year , when not at <unk> , so that here they were , as it were , at home .
<unk> [ f ] was , as has been already mentioned , further north , among the mountains .
after the battle of <unk> , while <name> marched to babylon and to susa , <name> had fled to <unk> , and was now there , his family being thus at one of the <name> palaces under the command of the conqueror , and he himself independent , but <unk> , in the other .
he had with him about forty thousand men , who still remained faithful to his fallen fortunes .
among these were several thousand greeks , whom he had collected in <name> minor and other grecian countries , and whom he had attached to his service by means of pay .
[ footnote f : the modern <unk> . ]
he called the officers of his army together , and explained to them the determination that he had come to in respect to his future movements .
" a large part of those , " said he , " who formerly served as officers of my government have abandoned me in my adversity , and gone over to <name> 's side .
they have surrendered to him the towns , and <unk> , and provinces which i intrusted to their fidelity .
you alone remain faithful and true .
as for myself , i might yield to the conqueror , and have him assign to me some province or kingdom to govern as his subordinate ; but i <name> never submit to such a degradation .
i can die in the struggle , but never <name> yield .
i <name> wear no crown which another puts upon my brow , nor give up my right to reign over the empire of my ancestors till i give up my life .
if you agree with me in this determination , let us act energetically upon it .
we have it in our power to terminate the injuries we are suffering , or else to avenge them . "
the army responded most cordially to this appeal .
they were ready , they said , to follow him wherever he should lead .
all this apparent enthusiasm , however , was very <unk> and <unk> .
a general named bessus , combining with some other officers in the army , conceived the plan of seizing <name> and making him a prisoner , and then taking command of the army himself .
if <name> should pursue him , and be likely to overtake and conquer him , he then thought that , by giving up <name> as a prisoner , he could <unk> for <name> and safety , and perhaps great rewards , both for himself and for those who acted with him .
if , on the other hand , they should succeed in increasing their own forces so as to make head against <name> , and finally to drive him away , then bessus was to usurp the throne , and dispose of <name> by <unk> him , or <unk> him for life in some remote and solitary castle .
bessus communicated his plans , very cautiously at first , to the leading officers of the army .
the greek soldiers were not included in the plot .
they , however , heard and saw enough to lead them to suspect what was in preparation .
they warned <name> , and urged him to rely upon them more than he had done ; to make them his body-guard ; and to pitch his tent in their part of the encampment .
but <name> declined these proposals .
he would not , he said , distrust and abandon his countrymen , who were his natural <unk> , and put himself in the hands of strangers .
he would not betray and desert his friends in anticipation of their deserting and betraying him .
in the mean time , as <name> advanced toward <unk> , <name> and his forces retreated from it toward the eastward , through the great tract of country lying south of the caspian sea .
there is a mountainous region here , with a defile traversing it , through which it would be necessary for <name> to pass .
this defile was called the caspian gates , [ g ] the name referring to rocks on each side .
the marching of an army through a narrow and dangerous defile like this always causes detention and delay , and <name> hastened forward in hopes to overtake <name> before he should reach it .
he advanced with such speed that only the strongest and most robust of his army could keep up .
thousands , worn out with exertion and toil , were left behind , and many of the horses sank down by the road side , exhausted with heat and fatigue , to die .
<name> pressed desperately on with all who were able to follow .
[ footnote g : <unk> <unk> on the map , which means the caspian gates . ]
it was all in vain , however ; it was too late when he arrived at the pass .
<name> had gone through with all his army .
<name> stopped to rest his men , and to allow time for those behind to come up .
he then went on for a couple of days , when he encamped , in order to send out <unk> parties  that is to say , small detachments , dispatched to explore the surrounding country in search of grain and other food for the horses .
food for the horses of an army being too bulky to be transported far , has to be collected day by day from the neighborhood of the line of march .
while halting for these <unk> parties to return , a persian nobleman came into the camp , and informed <name> that <name> and the forces accompanying him were encamped about two days ' march in advance , but that bessus was in command  the conspiracy having been successful , and <name> having been deposed and made a prisoner .
the greeks , who had adhered to their fidelity , finding that all the army were combined against them , and that they were not strong enough to resist , had abandoned the persian camp , and had retired to the mountains , where they were awaiting the result .
<name> determined to set forward immediately in pursuit of bessus and his prisoner .
he did not wait for the return of the <unk> parties .
he selected the ablest and most active , both of foot soldiers and horsemen , ordered them to take two days ' provisions , and then set forth with them that very evening .
the party pressed on all that night , and the next day till noon .
they halted till evening , and then set forth again .
very early the next morning they arrived at the encampment which the persian nobleman had described .
they found the remains of the camp-fires , and all the marks usually left upon a spot which has been used as the bivouac of an army .
the army itself , however , was gone .
the pursuers were now too much fatigued to go any further without rest .
<name> remained here , accordingly , through the day , to give his men and his horses refreshment and repose .
that night they set forward again , and the next day at noon they arrived at another encampment of the persians , which they had left scarcely twenty-four hours before .
the officers of <name> 's army were excited and animated in the highest degree , as they found themselves thus drawing so near to the great object of their pursuit .
they were ready for any exertions , any privation and fatigue , any measures , however extraordinary , to accomplish their end .
<name> inquired of the inhabitants of the place whether there were not some shorter road than the one along which the enemy were moving .
there was one <unk> , but it led through a desolate and desert tract of land , destitute of water .
in the march of an army , as the men are always heavily loaded with arms and provisions , and water can not be carried , it is always considered essential to choose routes which <name> furnish supplies of water by the way .
<name> , however , disregarded this consideration here , and prepared at once to push into the <unk> with a small detachment .
he had been now two years advancing from macedon into the heart of <name> , always in quest of <name> as his great opponent and enemy .
he had conquered his armies , taken his cities , plundered his palaces , and made himself master of his whole realm .
still , so long as <name> himself remained at <name> and in the field , no victories could be considered as complete .
to capture <name> himself would be the last and crowning act of his conquest .
he had now been pursuing him for eighteen hundred miles , advancing slowly from province to province , and from kingdom to kingdom .
during all this time the strength of his flying foe had been wasting away .
his armies had been broken up , his courage and <name> had gradually failed , while the animation and <name> of the pursuer had been gathering fresh and increasing strength from his successes , and were excited to wild enthusiasm now , as the hour for the final consummation of all his desires seemed to be drawing nigh .
guides were ordered to be furnished by the inhabitants , to show the detachment the way across the solitary and desert country .
the detachment was to consist of horsemen entirely , that they might advance with the utmost celerity .
to get as efficient a corps as possible , <name> dismounted five hundred of the cavalry , and gave their horses to five hundred men  officers and others  selected for their strength and courage from among the foot soldiers .
all were ambitious of being designated for this service .
besides the honor of being so selected , there was an intense excitement , as usual toward the close of a <name> , to arrive at the end .
this body of horsemen were ready to set out in the evening .
<name> took the command , and , following the guides , they trotted off in the direction which the guides indicated .
they traveled all night .
when the day dawned , they saw , from an elevation to which they had attained , the body of the persian troops moving at a short distance before them , foot soldiers , chariots , and horsemen pressing on together in great confusion and disorder .
as soon as bessus and his company found that their pursuers were close upon them , they attempted at first to hurry forward , in the vain <name> of still effecting their escape .
<name> was in a chariot .
they urged this chariot on , but it moved heavily .
then they concluded to abandon it , and they called upon <name> to mount a horse and ride off with them , leaving the rest of the army and the baggage to its fate .
but <name> refused .
he said he would rather trust himself in the hands of <name> than in those of such traitors as they .
rendered desperate by their situation , and exasperated by this reply , bessus and his confederates thrust their spears into <name> 's body , as he sat in his chariot , and then galloped away .
they divided into different parties , each taking a different road .
their object in doing this was to increase their chances of escape by confusing <name> in his plans for pursuing them .
<name> pressed on toward the ground which the enemy were abandoning , and sent off separate detachments after the various divisions of the flying army .
in the mean time <name> remained in his chariot wounded and bleeding .
he was worn out and exhausted , both in body and mind , by his complicated sufferings and sorrows .
his kingdom lost ; his family in captivity ; his beloved wife in the grave , where the sorrows and sufferings of separation from her husband had borne her ; his cities sacked ; his palaces and treasures plundered ; and now he himself , in the last hour of his extremity , abandoned and betrayed by all in whom he had placed his confidence and trust , his heart sunk within him in despair .
at such a time the soul turns from <unk> friends to an open foe with something like a feeling of confidence and attachment .
<name> 's exasperation against bessus was so intense , that his hostility to <name> became a species of friendship in comparison .
he felt that <name> was a sovereign like himself , and would have some sympathy and <unk> for a sovereign 's misfortunes .
he thought , too , of his mother , his wife , and his children , and the kindness with which <name> had treated them went to his heart .
he lay there , accordingly , faint and bleeding in his chariot , and looking for the coming of <name> as for that of a protector and friend , the only one to whom he could now look for any relief in the extremity of his distress .
the macedonians searched about in various places , thinking it possible that in the sudden dispersion of the enemy <name> might have been left behind .
at last the chariot in which he was lying was found .
<name> was in it , pierced with spears .
the floor of the chariot was covered with blood .
they raised him a little , and he spoke .
he called for water .
men wounded and dying on the field of battle are tormented always with an insatiable and intolerable thirst , the manifestations of which constitute one of the greatest horrors of the scene .
they cry piteously to all who pass to bring them water , or else to kill them .
they crawl along the ground to get at the <unk> of their dead companions , in hopes to find , remaining in them , some drops to drink ; and if there is a little <name> meandering through the battle-field , its bed gets filled and choked up with the bodies of those who crawled there , in their agony , to <unk> their horrible thirst , and die .
<name> was suffering this thirst .
it bore down and silenced , for the time , every other suffering , so that his first cry , when his enemies came around him with shouts of exultation , was not for his life , not for <name> , not for relief from the pain and anguish of his wounds  he begged them to give him some water .
he spoke through an interpreter .
the interpreter was a persian prisoner whom the macedonian army had taken some time before , and who had learned the greek language in the macedonian camp .
anticipating some occasion for his services , they had brought him with them now , and it was through him that <name> called for water .
a macedonian soldier went immediately to get some .
others hurried away in search of <name> , to bring him to the spot where the great object of his hostility , and of his long and protracted pursuit , was dying .
<name> received the drink .
he then said that he was extremely glad that they had an interpreter with them , who could understand him , and bear his message to <name> .
he had been afraid that he should have had to die without being able to communicate what he had to say .
" tell <name> , " said he , then , " that i feel under the strongest obligations to him which i can now never repay , for his kindness to my wife , my mother , and my children .
he not only spared their lives , but treated them with the greatest consideration and care , and did all in his power to make them happy .
the last feeling in my heart is gratitude to him for these favors .
i <name> now that he <name> go on prosperously , and finish his conquests as triumphantly as he has begun them . "
he would have made one last request , he added , if he had thought it necessary , and that was , that <name> would pursue the traitor bessus , and avenge the murder he had committed ; but he was sure that <name> would do this of his own accord , as the punishment of such treachery was an object of common interest for every king .
<name> then took <unk> , the macedonian who had brought him the water , by the hand , saying , " give <name> thy hand as i now give thee mine ; it is the pledge of my gratitude and affection . "
<name> was too weak to say much more .
they gathered around him , endeavoring to sustain his strength until <name> should arrive ; but it was all in vain .
he sank gradually , and soon ceased to breathe .
<name> came up a few minutes after all was over .
he was at first shocked at the spectacle before him , and then overwhelmed with grief .
he wept bitterly .
some <unk> of conscience may have visited his heart at seeing thus before him the ruin he had made .
<name> had never injured him or done him any wrong , and yet here he lay , hunted to death by a persevering and relentless hostility , for which his conqueror had no excuse but his innate love of dominion over his fellow-men .
<name> spread his own military cloak over the dead body .
he immediately made arrangements for having the body embalmed , and then sent it to susa , for <unk> , in a very costly coffin , and with a procession of <name> magnificence .
he sent it to her that she might have the satisfaction of seeing it deposited in the tombs of the persian kings .
what a present !
the killer of a son sending the dead body , in a splendid coffin , to the mother , as a token of respectful regard !
<name> pressed on to the northward and eastward in pursuit of bessus , who had soon collected the scattered remains of his army , and was doing his utmost to get into a posture of defense .
he did not , however , overtake him till he had crossed the <unk> , a large river which <name> be found upon the map , flowing to the northward and westward into the caspian sea .
he had great difficulty in crossing this river , as it was too deep to be forded , and the banks and bottom were so <name> and yielding that he could not make the foundations of bridges stand .
he accordingly made floats and rafts , which were supported by skins made buoyant by inflation , or by being stuffed with straw and hay .
after getting his army , which had been in the mean time greatly <unk> and strengthened , across this river , he moved on .
the generals under bessus , finding all <name> of escape failing them , resolved on betraying him as he had betrayed his commander .
they sent word to <name> that if he would send forward a small force where they should indicate , they would give up bessus to his hands .
<name> did so , <unk> the command to an officer named ptolemy .
ptolemy found bessus in a small walled town whither he had fled for refuge , and easily took him prisoner .
he sent back word to <name> that bessus was at his disposal , and asked for orders .
the answer was , " put a rope around his neck and send him to me . "
when the wretched prisoner was brought into <name> 's presence , <name> demanded of him how he could have been so base as to have seized , bound , and at last murdered his kinsman and benefactor .
it is a curious instance in proof of the permanence and stability of the great characteristics of human nature , through all the changes of civilization and lapses of time , that bessus gave the same answer that <unk> almost always give when brought to account for their wrongs .
he laid the fault upon his accomplices and friends .
it was not his act , it was theirs .
<name> ordered him to be publicly scourged ; then he caused his face to be mutilated in a manner customary in those days , when a tyrant wished to stamp upon his victim a perpetual <name> of infamy .
in this condition , and with a mind in an agony of suspense and fear at the thought of worse tortures which he knew were to come , <name> sent him as a second present to <unk> , to be dealt with , at susa , as her revenge might direct .
she inflicted upon him the most extreme tortures , and finally , when <unk> with the pleasure of seeing him suffer , the story is that they chose four very elastic trees , growing at a little distance from each other , and bent down the tops of them toward the central point between them .
they fastened the exhausted and dying bessus to these trees , one limb of his body to each , and then releasing the stems from their confinement , they flew upward , tearing the body asunder , each holding its own dissevered portion , as if in triumph , far over the heads of the multitude assembled to witness the spectacle .
chapter xi .
deterioration of character .
b.c .
329 <name> at the summit of his <unk>  sad <unk>  <name> becomes <unk>  his officers became <unk>  character of <unk>  his services to alexander.  parmenio 's son , <unk>  his dissolute character.  <unk>  plot of <unk>  <unk> destroys <unk>  philotas <unk>  the council of <unk>  philotas <unk>  arrest of <unk>  the body of <unk>  alexander's address to the army.  philotas brought to <unk>  defense of <unk>  he is put to the <unk>  confession of <unk>  he is stoned to death.  parmenio condemned to death.  mission of <unk>  <unk>  brutal murder of <unk>  story of <unk>  he saves <name> 's life.  services of <unk>  occurrences at the <unk>  clitus reproaches alexander.  alexander's <unk>  <name> <unk> <unk>  his remorse .
<name> was now twenty-six years of age .
he had accomplished fully the great objects which had been the aim of his ambition .
<name> was dead , and he was himself the undisputed master of all western <name> .
his wealth was almost boundless .
his power was supreme over what was , in his view , the whole known world .
but , during the process of rising to this ascendency , his character was sadly changed .
he lost the simplicity , the temperance , the moderation , and the sense of justice which characterized his early years .
he adopted the dress and the luxurious manners of the persians .
he lived in the palaces of the persian kings , imitating all their state and splendor .
he became very fond of <unk> entertainments and of wine , and often drank to excess .
he provided himself a <unk> of three hundred and sixty young females , in whose company he spent his time , giving himself up to every form of <unk> and dissipation .
in a word , he was no longer the same man .
the decision , the energy of character , the steady pursuit of great ends by <name> , forethought , patient effort , and self-denial , all disappeared ; nothing now seemed to interest him but banquets , <unk> , parties of pleasure , and whole days and nights spent in dissipation and vice .
this state of things was a great cause of mortification and chagrin to the officers of his army .
many of them were older than himself , and better able to resist these temptations to luxury , <unk> , and vice .
they therefore remained firm in their original simplicity and integrity , and after some respectful but ineffectual remonstrances , they stood aloof , alienated from their commander in heart , and condemning very strongly , among themselves , his wickedness and folly .
on the other hand , many of the younger officers followed alexander's example , and became as vain , as irregular , and as fond of vicious indulgence as he .
but then , though they joined him in his pleasures , there was no strong bond of union between him and them .
the tie which binds mere companions in pleasure together is always very slight and frail .
thus <name> gradually lost the confidence and affection of his old friends , and gained no new ones .
his officers either disapproved his conduct , and were distant and cold , or else joined him in his dissipation and vice , without feeling any real respect for his character , or being bound to him by any principle of fidelity .
parmenio and his son philotas were , respectively , striking examples of these two kinds of character .
parmenio was an old general , now considerably advanced in life .
he had served , as has already been stated , under <name> , <name> 's father , and had acquired great experience and great fame before <name> succeeded to the throne .
during the whole of <name> 's career parmenio had been his principal lieutenant general , and he had always placed his greatest reliance upon him in all trying emergencies .
he was cool , calm , intrepid , sagacious .
he held <name> back from many rash enterprises , and was the efficient means of his accomplishing most of his plans .
it is the custom among all nations to give kings the <name> of all that is effected by their generals and officers ; and the writers of those days would , of course , in <unk> the exploits of the macedonian army , exaggerate the share which <name> had in their performances , and <unk> those of parmenio .
but in modern times , many impartial readers , in reviewing calmly these events , think that there is reason to doubt whether <name> , if he had set out on his great expedition without parmenio , would have succeeded at all .
philotas was the son of parmenio , but he was of a very different character .
the difference was one which is very often , in all ages of the world , to be observed between those who inherit greatness and those who acquire it for themselves .
we see the same analogy reigning at the present day , when the sons of the wealthy , who are born to fortune , substitute pride , and arrogance , and vicious <unk> and waste for the modesty , and <name> , and virtue of their <unk> , by means of which the fortune was acquired .
philotas was proud , <unk> , extravagant , and addicted , like <name> his master , to every species of indulgence and dissipation .
he was universally hated .
his father , out of <name> with his haughty airs , his <unk> , and his pomp and parade , advised him , one day , to " make himself less . "
but <unk> prudent advice to his son was thrown away .
philotas spoke of himself as <name> 's great reliance .
" what would <name> have been or have done , " said he , " without my father parmenio ?
and what would <name> have been or have done , without me ? "
these things were reported to <name> , and thus the mind of each was filled with suspicion , fear , and hatred toward the other .
courts and camps are always the scenes of conspiracy and treason , and <name> was continually hearing of conspiracies and plots formed against him .
the strong sentiment of love and devotion with which he inspired all around him at the commencement of his career , was now gone , and his generals and officers were continually planning schemes to depose him from the power which he seemed no longer to have the energy to wield ; or , at least , <name> was continually suspecting that such plans were formed , and he was kept in a continual state of uneasiness and anxiety in discovering and punishing them .
at last a conspiracy occurred in which philotas was implicated .
<name> was informed one day that a plot had been formed to depose and destroy him ; that philotas had been made acquainted with it by a friend of <name> 's , in order that he might make it known to the king ; that he had neglected to do so , thus making it probable that he was himself in league with the conspirators .
<name> was informed that the leader and originator of this conspiracy was one of his generals named <unk> .
he immediately sent an officer to <unk> to summon him into his presence .
<unk> appeared to be struck with consternation at this summons .
instead of obeying it , he <name> his sword , thrust it into his own heart , and fell dead upon the ground .
<name> then sent for philotas , and asked him if it was indeed true that he had been informed of this conspiracy , and had neglected to make it known .
philotas replied that he had been told that such a plot was formed , but that he did not believe it ; that such stories were continually invented by the malice of <unk> men , and that he had not considered the report which came to his ears as worthy of any attention .
he was , however , now convinced , by the terror which <unk> had manifested , and by his suicide , that all was true , and he asked <name> 's pardon for not having taken immediate measures for communicating promptly the information he had received .
<name> gave him his hand , said that he was convinced that he was innocent , and had acted as he did from disbelief in the existence of the conspiracy , and not from any guilty participation in it .
so philotas went away to his tent .
<name> , however , did not drop the subject here .
he called a council of his ablest and best friends and advisers , consisting of the principal officers of his army , and laid the facts before them .
they came to a different conclusion from his in respect to the guilt of philotas .
they believed him implicated in the crime , and demanded his trial .
trial in such a case , in those days , meant putting the accused to the torture , with a view of forcing him to confess his guilt .
<name> yielded to this proposal .
perhaps he had secretly <unk> it .
the advisers of kings and conquerors , in such circumstances as this , generally have the sagacity to discover what advice <name> be agreeable .
at all events , <name> followed the advice of his counselors , and made arrangements for arresting philotas on that very evening .
these circumstances occurred at a time when the army was preparing for a march , the various generals lodging in tents pitched for the purpose .
<name> placed extra guards in various parts of the encampment , as if to impress the whole army with a sense of the importance and solemnity of the occasion .
he then sent officers to the tent of philotas , late at night , to arrest him .
the officers found their unhappy victim asleep .
they awoke him , and made known their errand .
philotas arose , and obeyed the summons , dejected and distressed , aware , apparently , that his destruction was impending .
the next morning <name> called together a large assembly , consisting of the principal and most important portions of the army , to the number of several thousands .
they came together with an air of impressive solemnity , expecting , from the preliminary preparations , that business of very solemn moment was to come before them , though they knew not what it was .
these impressions of awe and solemnity were very much increased by the spectacle which first met the eyes of the assembly after they were convened .
this spectacle was that of the dead body of <unk> , bloody and ghastly , which <name> ordered to be brought in and exposed to view .
the death of <unk> had been kept a secret , so that the appearance of his body was an unexpected as well as a shocking sight .
when the first feeling of surprise and wonder had a little subsided , <name> explained to the assembly the nature of the conspiracy , and the circumstances connected with the <unk> of one of the guilty <unk> in it .
the spectacle of the body , and the statement of the king , produced a scene of great and universal excitement in the assembly , and this excitement was raised to the highest pitch by the announcement which <name> now made , that he had reason to believe that philotas and his father parmenio , officers who had enjoyed his highest favor , and in whom he had placed the most unbounded confidence , were the authors and <unk> of the whole design .
he then ordered philotas to be brought in .
he came guarded as a criminal , with his hands tied behind him , and his head covered with a coarse cloth .
he was in a state of great dejection and despondency .
it is true that he was brought forward for trial , but he knew very well that trial meant torture , and that there was no <name> for him as to the result .
<name> said that he would leave the accused to be dealt with by the assembly , and withdrew .
the authorities of the army , who now had the proud and domineering spirit which had so long excited their hatred and envy completely in their power , listened for a time to what philotas had to say in his own justification .
he showed that there was no evidence whatever against him , and appealed to their sense of justice not to condemn him on mere vague surmises .
in reply , they decided to put him to the torture .
there was no evidence , it was true , and they wished , accordingly , to supply its place by his own confession , extorted by pain .
of course , his most inveterate and implacable enemies were appointed to conduct the operation .
they put philotas upon the rack .
the rack is an instrument of wheels and pulleys , into which the victim is placed , and his limbs and <unk> are stretched by it in a manner which produces most excruciating pain .
philotas bore the beginning of his torture with great resolution and fortitude .
he made no complaint , he uttered no cry : this was the signal to his executioners to increase the tension and the agony .
of course , in such a trial as this , there was no question of guilt or innocence at issue .
the only question was , which could stand out the longest , his enemies in witnessing horrible sufferings , or he himself in enduring them .
in this contest the unhappy philotas was vanquished at last .
he begged them to release him from the rack , saying he would confess whatever they required , on condition of being allowed to die in peace .
they accordingly released him , and , in answer to their questions , he confessed that he himself and his father were involved in the plot .
he said yes to various other inquiries relating to the circumstances of the conspiracy , and to the guilt of various individuals whom those that managed the torture had suspected , or who , at any rate , they wished to have condemned .
the answers of philotas to all these questions were written down , and he was himself sentenced to be stoned .
the sentence was put in execution without any delay .
during all this time parmenio was in media , in command of a very important part of <name> 's army .
it was decreed that he must die ; but some careful management was necessary to secure his execution while he was at so great a distance , and at the head of so great a force .
the affair had to be conducted with great secrecy as well as dispatch .
the plan adopted was as follows : there was a certain man , named <unk> , who was regarded as parmenio 's particular friend .
<unk> was commissioned to go to media and see the execution performed .
he was selected , because it was supposed that if any enemy , or a stranger , had been sent , parmenio would have received him with suspicion or at least with caution , and kept himself on his guard .
they gave <unk> several letters to parmenio , as if from his friends , and to one of them they attached the seal of his son philotas , the more completely to deceive the unhappy father .
<unk> was eleven days on his journey into media .
he had letters to <unk> , the governor of the province of media , which contained the king 's warrant for parmenio 's execution .
he arrived at the house of <unk> in the night .
he delivered his letters , and they together concerted the plans for carrying the execution into effect .
after having taken all the precautions necessary , <unk> went , with many attendants accompanying him , to the quarters of parmenio .
the old general , for he was at this time eighty years of age , was walking in his grounds .
<unk> being admitted , ran up to accost him , with great appearance of cordiality and friendship .
he delivered to him his letters , and parmenio read them .
he seemed much pleased with their contents , especially with the one which had been written in the name of his son .
he had no means of detecting the imposture , for it was very customary in those days for letters to be written by secretaries , and to be authenticated solely by the seal .
parmenio was much pleased to get good tidings from <name> , and from his son , and began conversing upon the contents of the letters , when <unk> , watching his opportunity , <name> forth a dagger which he had concealed upon his person , and plunged it into parmenio 's side .
he <name> it forth immediately and struck it at his throat .
the attendants rushed on at this signal , and thrust their swords again and again into the fallen body until it ceased to breathe .
the death of parmenio and of his son in this violent manner , when , too , there was so little evidence of their guilt , made a very general and a very unfavorable impression in respect to <name> ; and not long afterward another case occurred , in some respects still more painful , as it evinced still more strikingly that the mind of <name> , which had been in his earlier days filled with such <name> and lofty sentiments of justice and generosity , was gradually getting to be under the supreme dominion of selfish and ungovernable passions : it was the case of clitus .
clitus was a very celebrated general of <name> 's army , and a great favorite with the king .
he had , in fact , on one occasion saved <name> 's life .
it was at the battle of the <unk> .
<name> had exposed himself in the thickest of the combat , and was surrounded by enemies .
the sword of one of them was actually raised over his head , and would have fallen and killed him on the spot , if clitus had not rushed forward and cut the man down just at the instant when he was about striking the blow .
such acts of fidelity and courage as this had given <name> great confidence in clitus .
it happened , shortly after the death of parmenio , that the governor of one of the most important provinces of the empire resigned his post .
<name> appointed clitus to fill the vacancy .
the evening before his departure to take charge of his government , <name> invited him to a banquet , made , partly at least , in honor of his elevation .
clitus and the other guests assembled .
they drank wine , as usual , with great freedom .
<name> became excited , and began to speak , as he was now often accustomed to do , <unk> of his own exploits , and to <unk> those of his father <name> in comparison .
men half intoxicated are very prone to quarrel , and not the less so for being excellent friends when sober .
clitus had served under <name> .
he was now an old man , and , like other old men , was very tenacious of the <name> that belonged to the exploits of his youth .
he was very restless and uneasy at hearing <name> claim for himself the merit of his father <name> 's victory at <unk> , and began to murmur something to those who sat next to him about kings claiming and getting a great deal of <name> which did not belong to them .
<name> asked what it was that clitus said .
no one replied .
clitus , however , went on talking , speaking more and more audibly as he became gradually more and more excited .
he praised the character of <name> , and applauded his military exploits , saying that they were far superior to any of the enterprises of their day .
the different parties at the table took up the subject , and began to dispute , the old men taking the part of <name> and former days , and the younger defending <name> .
clitus became more and more excited .
he praised parmenio , who had been <name> 's greatest general , and began to <unk> the justice of his late condemnation and death .
<name> retorted and clitus , rising from his seat , and losing now all self-command , reproached him with severe and bitter words .
" here is the hand , " said he , extending his arm , " that saved your life at the battle of the <unk> , and the fate of parmenio shows what sort of gratitude and what rewards faithful servants are to expect at your hands . "
<name> , burning with rage , commanded clitus to leave the table .
clitus obeyed , saying , as he moved away , " he is right not to bear <unk> men at his table who can only tell him the truth .
he is right .
it is fitting for him to pass his life among barbarians and slaves , who <name> be proud to pay their adoration to his persian girdle and his splendid robe . "
<name> seized a javelin to hurl at clitus 's head .
the guests rose in confusion , and with many outcries pressed around him .
some seized <name> 's arm , some began to hurry clitus out of the room , and some were engaged in loudly <unk> and threatening each other .
they got clitus out of the apartment , but as soon as he was in the hall he broke away from them , returned by another door , and began to renew his insults to <name> .
the king hurled his javelin and struck clitus down , saying , at the same time , " go , then , and join <name> and parmenio . "
the company rushed to the rescue of the unhappy man , but it was too late .
he died almost immediately .
<name> , as soon as he came to himself was overwhelmed with remorse and despair .
he mourned bitterly , for many days , the death of his <unk> and faithful friend , and <unk> the intoxication and passion , on his part , which had caused it .
he could not , however , restore clitus to life , nor remove from his own character the indelible stains which such deeds necessarily fixed upon it .

after the events narrated in the last chapter , <name> continued , for two or three years , his expeditions and conquests in <name> , and in the course of them he met with a great variety of adventures which can not be here particularly described .
he penetrated into <name> as far as the banks of the indus , and , not content with this , was preparing to cross the indus and go on to the ganges .
his soldiers , however , resisted this design .
they were alarmed at the stories which they heard of the indian armies , with elephants bearing castles upon their backs , and soldiers armed with strange and unheard-of weapons .
these rumors , and the natural <name> of the soldiers not to go away any further from their native land , produced almost a mutiny in the army .
at length , <name> , learning how strong and how extensive the spirit of insubordination was becoming , summoned his officers to his own tent , and then ordering the whole army to gather around , he went out to meet them .
he made an address to them , in which he <unk> all their past exploits , praised the courage and perseverance which they had shown thus far , and endeavored to animate them with a <name> to proceed .
they listened in silence , and no one attempted to reply .
this solemn pause was followed by marks of great agitation throughout the assembly .
the army loved their commander , notwithstanding his faults and failings .
they were extremely unwilling to make any resistance to his authority ; but they had lost that extreme and unbounded confidence in his energy and virtue which made them ready , in the former part of his career , to press forward into any difficulties and dangers whatever , where he led the way .
at last one of the army approached the king and addressed him somewhat as follows : " we are not changed , sir , in our affection for you .
we still have , and shall always retain , the same zeal and the same fidelity .
we are ready to follow you at the hazard of our lives , and to march wherever you may lead us .
still we must ask you , most respectfully , to consider the circumstances in which we are placed .
we have done all for you that it was possible for man to do .
we have crossed seas and land .
we have marched to the end of the world , and you are now meditating the conquest of another , by going in search of new <unk> , unknown to the indians themselves .
such a thought may be worthy of your courage and resolution , but it <unk> ours , and our strength still more .
look at these ghastly faces , and these bodies covered with wounds and scars .
remember how numerous we were when first we set out with you , and see how few of us remain .
the few who have escaped so many toils and dangers have neither courage nor strength to follow you any further .
they all long to <unk> their country and their homes , and to enjoy , for the remainder of their lives , the fruits of all their toils .
forgive them these desires , so natural to man . "
the expression of these sentiments confirmed and strengthened them in the minds of all the soldiers .
<name> was greatly troubled and distressed .
a disaffection in a small part of an army may be put down by decisive measures ; but when the determination to resist is universal , it is useless for any commander , however imperious and absolute in temper , to attempt to withstand it .
<name> , however , was extremely unwilling to yield .
he remained two days shut up in his tent , the prey to disappointment and chagrin .
the result , however , was , that he abandoned plans of further conquest , and turned his steps again toward the west .
he met with various adventures as he went on , and incurred many dangers , often in a rash and foolish manner , and for no good end .
at one time , while attacking a small town , he seized a scaling ladder and mounted with the troops .
in doing this , however , he put himself forward so rashly and <unk> that his ladder was broken , and while the rest retreated he was left alone upon the wall , whence he descended into the town , and was immediately surrounded by enemies .
his friends raised their ladders again , and pressed on desperately to find and rescue him .
some gathered around him and defended him , while others contrived to open a small gate , by which the rest of the army gained admission .
by this means <name> was saved ; though , when they brought him out of the city , there was an arrow three feet long , which could not be extracted , sticking into his side through his coat of mail .
the surgeons first very carefully cut off the wooden shaft of the arrow , and then , enlarging the wound by <unk> , they <name> out the barbed point .
the soldiers were indignant that <name> should expose his person in such a <unk> way , only to endanger himself , and to compel them to rush into danger to rescue him .
the wound very nearly proved fatal .
the loss of blood was attended with extreme exhaustion ; still , in the course of a few weeks he recovered .
<name> 's habits of intoxication and vicious excess of all kinds were , in the mean time , continually increasing .
he not only indulged in such excesses himself , but he encouraged them in others .
he would offer prizes at his banquets to those who would drink the most .
on one of these occasions , the man who conquered drank , it is said , eighteen or twenty pints of wine , after which he lingered in misery for three days , and then died ; and more than forty others , present at the same entertainment , died in consequence of their excesses .
<name> returned toward babylon .
his friend <unk> was with him , sharing with him every where in all the vicious indulgences to which he had become so prone .
<name> gradually separated himself more and more from his old macedonian friends , and linked himself more and more closely with persian associates .
he married <unk> , the oldest daughter of <name> , and gave the youngest daughter to <unk> .
he encouraged similar marriages between macedonian officers and persian maidens , as far as he could .
in a word , he seemed intent in <unk> , in every way , his original character and habits of action in the <unk> , luxury , and vice of the eastern world , which he had at first so looked down upon and despised .
<name> 's entrance into babylon , on his return from his indian campaigns , was a scene of great magnificence and splendor .
embassadors and princes had assembled there from almost all the nations of the earth to receive and welcome him , and the most ample preparations were made for processions , shows , parades , and spectacles to do him honor .
the whole country was in a state of extreme excitement , and the most expensive preparations were made to give him a reception worthy of one who was the conqueror and monarch of the world , and the son of a god .
when <name> approached the city , however , he was met by a deputation of <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> were a class of philosophers who pretended , in those days , to foretell human events by means of the motions of the stars .
the motions of the stars were studied very closely in early times , and in those eastern countries , by the shepherds , who had often to remain in the open air , through the summer nights , to watch their flocks .
these shepherds observed that nearly all the stars were fixed in relation to each other , that is , although they rose successively in the east , and , passing over , set in the west , they did not change in relation to each other .
there were , however , a few that wandered about among the rest in an irregular and unaccountable manner .
they called these stars the wanderers  that is , in their language , the planets  and they watched their mysterious movements with great interest and awe .
they naturally imagined that these changes had some connection with human affairs , and they endeavored to <unk> from them the events , whether prosperous or adverse , which were to befall mankind .
whenever a comet or an eclipse appeared , they thought it portended some terrible calamity .
the study of the motions and appearances of the stars , with a view to foretell the course of human affairs , was the science of <unk> .
the <unk> came , in a very solemn and imposing procession , to meet <name> on his march .
they informed him that they had found <unk> evidence in the stars that , if he came into babylon , he would hazard his life .
they accordingly begged him not to approach any nearer , but to choose some other city for his capital .
<name> was very much perplexed by this announcement .
his mind , weakened by <unk> and dissipation , was very susceptible to superstitious fears .
it was not merely by the <unk> influence of vicious indulgence on the nervous constitution that this effect was produced .
it was , in part , the moral influence of conscious guilt .
guilt makes men afraid .
it not only increases the power of real dangers , but <unk> the mind to all sorts of imaginary fears .
<name> was very much troubled at this announcement of the <unk> .
he suspended his march , and began anxiously to consider what to do .
at length the greek philosophers came to him and reasoned with him on the subject , persuading him that the science of <unk> was not worthy of any belief .
the greeks had no <name> in <unk> .
they foretold future events by the flight of birds , or by the appearances presented in the dissection of beasts offered in sacrifice !
at length , however , <name> 's fears were so far allayed that he concluded to enter the city .
he advanced , accordingly , with his whole army , and made his entry under circumstances of the greatest possible parade and splendor .
as soon , however , as the excitement of the first few days had passed away , his mind relapsed again , and he became anxious , troubled , and unhappy .
<unk> , his great personal friend and companion , had died while he was on the march toward babylon .
he was brought to the grave by diseases produced by dissipation and vice .
<name> was very much moved by his death .
it threw him at once into a fit of despondency and gloom .
it was some time before he could at all overcome the melancholy reflections and forebodings which this event produced .
he determined that , as soon as he arrived in babylon , he would do all possible honor to <unk> 's memory by a magnificent funeral .
he accordingly now sent orders to all the cities and kingdoms around , and collected a vast sum for this purpose .
he had a part of the city wall pulled down to furnish a site for a monumental edifice .
this edifice was constructed of an enormous size and most elaborate architecture .
it was ornamented with long rows of <unk> of ships , taken by <name> in his victories , and by statues , and columns , and sculptures , and gilded ornaments of every kind .
there were images of <unk> on the <unk> near the roof , which , by means of a mechanism concealed within , were made to sing <unk> and mournful songs .
the expense of this edifice , and of the games , shows , and spectacles connected with its consecration , is said by the historians of the day to have been a sum which , on calculation , is found equal to about ten millions of dollars .
there were , however , some limits still to <name> 's extravagance and folly .
there was a mountain in greece , mount <unk> , which a certain <unk> said could be carved and fashioned into the form of a man  probably in a <unk> posture .
there was a city on one of the declivities of the mountain , and a small river , issuing from springs in the ground , came down on the other side .
the artist who conceived of this prodigious piece of sculpture said that he would so shape the figure that the city should be in one of its hands , and the river should flow out from the other .
[ illustration : proposed improvement of mount <unk> . ]
<name> listened to this proposal .
the name mount <unk> recalled to his mind the attempt of xerxes , a former persian king , who had attempted to cut a road through the rocks upon a part of mount <unk> , in the invasion of greece .
he did not succeed , but left the unfinished work a lasting memorial both of the attempt and the failure .
<name> concluded at length that he would not attempt such a sculpture .
" mount <unk> , " said he , " is already the monument of one king 's folly ; i <name> not make it that of another . "
as soon as the excitement connected with the funeral obsequies of <unk> were over , <name> 's mind relapsed again into a state of gloomy melancholy .
this depression , caused , as it was , by previous dissipation and vice , seemed to admit of no remedy or relief but in new excesses .
the traces , however , of his former energy so far remained that he began to form magnificent plans for the improvement of babylon .
he commenced the execution of some of these plans .
his time was spent , in short , in strange alternations : resolution and energy in forming vast plans one day , and utter abandonment to all the excesses of dissipation and vice the next .
it was a mournful spectacle to see his former greatness of soul still struggling on , though more and more faintly , as it became gradually overborne by the resistless inroads of intemperance and sin .
the scene was at length suddenly terminated in the following manner : on one occasion , after he had spent a whole night in drinking and carousing , the guests , when the usual time arrived for separating , proposed that , instead of this , they should begin anew , and commence a second banquet at the end of the first .
<name> , half intoxicated already , entered warmly into this proposal .
they assembled , accordingly , in a very short time .
there were twenty present at this new feast .
<name> , to show how far he was from having exhausted his powers of drinking , began to pledge each one of the company individually .
then he drank to them all together .
there was a very large cup , called the bowl of hercules , which he now called for , and , after having filled it to the brim , he drank it off to the health of one of the company present , a macedonian named <unk> .
this feat being received by the company with great applause , he ordered the great bowl to be filled again , and drank it off as before .
the work was now done .
his faculties and his strength soon failed him , and he sank down to the floor .
they bore him away to his palace .
a violent fever intervened , which the physicians did all in their power to allay .
as soon as his reason returned a little , <name> aroused himself from his lethargy , and tried to persuade himself that he should recover .
he began to issue orders in regard to the army , and to his ships , as if such a turning of his mind to the thoughts of power and empire would help bring him back from the brink of the grave toward which he had been so obviously tending .
he was determined , in fact , that he would not die .
he soon found , however , notwithstanding his efforts to be vigorous and resolute , that his strength was fast ebbing away .
the vital powers had received a fatal wound , and he soon felt that they could sustain themselves but little longer .
he came to the conclusion that he must die .
he <name> his <unk> ring off from his finger ; it was a token that he felt that all was over .
he handed the ring to one of his friends who stood by his <unk> .
" when i am gone , " said he , " take my body to the <name> of jupiter ammon , and inter it there . "
the generals who were around him advanced to his <unk> , and one after another kissed his hand .
their old affection for him revived as they saw him about to take leave of them forever .
they asked him to whom he wished to leave his empire .
" to the most worthy , " said he .
he meant , doubtless , by this evasion , that he was too weak and exhausted to think of such affairs .
he knew , probably , that it was useless for him to attempt to control the government of his empire after his death .
he said , in fact , that he foresaw that the decision of such questions would give rise to some strange funeral games after his decease .
soon after this he died .
the palaces of babylon were immediately filled with cries of mourning at the death of the <name> , followed by bitter and interminable disputes about the succession .
it had not been the aim of alexander's life to establish firm and <unk> governments in the countries that he conquered , to encourage order , and peace , and industry among men , and to introduce system and regularity in human affairs , so as to leave the world in a better condition than he found it .
in this respect his course of conduct presents a strong contrast with that of washington .
it was washington 's aim to mature and perfect organizations which would move on prosperously of themselves , without him ; and he was continually withdrawing his hand from action and control in public affairs , taking a higher pleasure in the independent working of the institutions which he had formed and protected , than in exercising , himself , a high personal power .
<name> , on the other hand , was all his life intent solely on enlarging and strengthening his own personal power .
he was all in all .
he wished to make himself so .
he never thought of the welfare of the countries which he had subjected to his sway , or did any thing to guard against the anarchy and civil wars which he knew full well would break out at once over all his vast dominions , as soon as his power came to an end .
the result was as might have been foreseen .
the whole vast field of his conquests became , for many long and weary years after alexander's death , the prey to the most ferocious and protracted civil wars .
each general and governor seized the power which <name> 's death left in his hands , and endeavored to defend himself in the possession of it against the others .
thus the devastation and misery which the making of these conquests brought upon europe and <name> were continued for many years , during the slow and terrible process of their return to their original condition .
in the <unk> of the moment , however , at <name> 's death , the generals who were in his court at the time assembled forthwith , and made an attempt to appoint some one to take the immediate command .
they spent a week in <name> debates on this subject .
<name> had left no legitimate heir , and he had declined when on his death-bed , as we have already seen , to appoint a successor .
among his wives  if , indeed , they may be called wives  there was one named <name> , who had a son not long after his death .
this son was ultimately named his successor ; but , in the mean time , a certain relative named <unk> was chosen by the generals to assume the command .
the selection of <unk> was a sort of compromise .
he had no talents or capacity whatever , and was chosen by the rest on that very account , each one thinking that if such an imbecile as <unk> was nominally the king , he could himself manage to get possession of the real power .
<unk> accepted the appointment , but he was never able to make himself king in any thing but the name .
in the mean time , as the tidings of <name> 's death spread over the empire , it produced very various effects , according to the personal feelings in respect to <name> entertained by the various personages and powers to which the intelligence came .
some , who had admired his greatness , and the splendor of his exploits , without having themselves experienced the bitter fruits of them , mourned and lamented his death .
others , whose fortunes had been ruined , and whose friends and relatives had been destroyed , in the course , or in the sequel of his victories , rejoiced that he who had been such a scourge and curse to others , had himself sunk , at last under the just judgment of heaven .
we should have expected that <unk> , the bereaved and widowed mother of <name> , would have been among those who would have exulted most highly at the conqueror 's death ; but history tells us that , instead of this , she mourned over it with a protracted and <unk> grief .
<name> had been , in fact , though the implacable enemy of her son , a faithful and generous friend to her .
he had treated her , at all times , with the utmost respect and consideration , had supplied all her wants , and <unk> , in every way , to her comfort and happiness .
she had gradually learned to think of him and to love him as a son ; he , in fact , always called her mother ; and when she learned that he was gone , she felt as if her last earthly protector was gone .
her life had been one continued scene of affliction and sorrow , and this last blow brought her to her end .
she pined away , perpetually restless and distressed .
she lost all <name> for food , and refused , like others who are suffering great mental anguish , to take the sustenance which her friends and attendants offered and urged upon her .
at length she died .
they said she starved herself to death ; but it was , probably , grief and despair at being thus left , in her declining years , so hopelessly friendless and alone , and not hunger , that destroyed her .
in striking contrast to this mournful scene of sorrow in the palace of <unk> , there was an exhibition of the most wild and tumultuous <name> in the streets , and in all the public places of resort in the city of athens , when the tidings of the death of the great macedonian king arrived there .
the athenian commonwealth , as well as all the other states of southern greece , had submitted very reluctantly to the macedonian supremacy .
they had resisted <name> , and they had resisted <name> .
their opposition had been at last suppressed and silenced by <name> 's terrible vengeance upon thebes , but it never was really subdued .
demosthenes , the orator , who had exerted so powerful an influence against the macedonian kings , had been sent into banishment , and all outward expressions of discontent were restrained .
the discontent and hostility existed still , however , as inveterate as ever , and was ready to break out anew , with redoubled violence , the moment that the terrible energy of <name> himself was no longer to be feared .
when , therefore , the rumor arrived at athens  for at first it was a mere rumor  that <name> was dead in babylon , the whole city was thrown into a state of the most tumultuous <name> .
the citizens assembled in the public places , and congratulated and <unk> each other with expressions of the greatest exultation .
they were for proclaiming their independence and declaring war against macedon on the spot .
some of the older and more sagacious of their counselors were , however , more composed and calm .
they recommended a little delay , in order to see whether the news was really true .
<unk> , in particular , who was one of the prominent statesmen of the city , endeavored to quiet the excitement of the people .
" do not let us be so precipitate , " said he .
" there is time enough .
if <name> is really dead to-day , he <name> be dead to-morrow , and the next day , so that there <name> be time enough for us to act with deliberation and discretion . "
just and true as this view of the subject was , there was too much of rebuke and satire in it to have much influence with those to whom it was addressed .
the people were resolved on war .
they sent commissioners into all the states of the peloponnesus to organize a league , offensive and defensive , against macedon .
they recalled demosthenes from his banishment , and adopted all the necessary military measures for establishing and maintaining their freedom .
the consequences of all this would doubtless have been very serious , if the rumor of <name> 's death had proved false ; but , fortunately for demosthenes and the athenians , it was soon abundantly confirmed .
the return of demosthenes to the city was like the triumphal entry of a conqueror .
at the time of his recall he was at the island of Ã¦gina , which is about forty miles southwest of athens , in one of the <unk> of the Ã¦gean sea .
they sent a public galley to receive him , and to bring him to the land .
it was a galley of three banks of oars , and was fitted up in a style to do honor to a public guest .
athens is situated some distance back from the sea , and has a small port , called the <unk> , at the shore  a long , straight avenue leading from the port to the city .
the galley by which demosthenes was conveyed landed at the <unk> .
all the civil and religious authorities of the city went down to the port , in a grand procession , to receive and welcome the exile on his arrival , and a large portion of the population followed in the train , to witness the spectacle , and to swell by their acclamations the general expression of <name> .
in the mean time , the preparations for <name> 's funeral had been going on , upon a great scale of magnificence and splendor .
it was two years before they were complete .
the body had been given , first , to be embalmed , according to the egyptian and <unk> <name> , and then had been placed in a sort of sarcophagus , in which it was to be conveyed to its long home .
<name> , it <name> be remembered , had given directions that it should be taken to the <name> of jupiter ammon , in the egyptian oasis , where he had been pronounced the son of a god .
it would seem incredible that such a mind as his could really admit such an absurd superstition as the story of his divine origin , and we must therefore suppose that he gave this direction in order that the place of his interment might confirm the idea of his superhuman nature in the general opinion of mankind .
at all events , such were his orders , and the authorities who were left in power at babylon after his death , prepared to execute them .
it was a long journey .
to convey a body by a regular funeral procession , formed as soon after the death as the arrangements could be made , from babylon to the eastern frontiers of egypt , a distance of a thousand miles , was perhaps as grand a plan of interment as was ever formed .
it has something like a parallel in the removal of <unk> body from st. <name> to <name> , though this was not really an interment , but a transfer .
<name> 's was a simple burial procession , going from the palace where he died to the proper cemetery  a march of a thousand miles , it is true , but all within his own dominions the greatness of it resulted simply from the magnitude of the scale on which every thing pertaining to the mighty here was performed , for it was nothing but a simple passage from the dwelling to the <unk> on his own estates , after all .
a very large and elaborately constructed carriage was built to convey the body .
the accounts of the richness and splendor of this vehicle are almost incredible .
the spokes and staves of the wheels were overlaid with gold , and the extremities of the <unk> , where they appeared outside at the centers of the wheels , were adorned with massive golden ornaments .
the wheels and <unk> were so large , and so far apart , that there was supported upon them a platform or floor for the carriage twelve feet wide and eighteen feet long .
upon this platform there was erected a magnificent pavilion , supported by <unk> columns , and profusely ornamented , both within and without , with purple and gold .
the interior constituted an apartment , more or less open at the sides , and resplendent within with gems and precious stones .
the space of twelve feet by eighteen forms a chamber of no inconsiderable size , and there was thus ample room for what was required within .
there was a throne , raised some steps , and placed back upon the platform , profusely carved and gilded .
it was empty ; but crowns , representing the various nations over whom <name> had reigned , were <name> upon it .
at the foot of the throne was the coffin , made , it is said , of solid gold , and containing , besides the body , a large quantity of the most costly spices and <unk> perfumes , which filled the air with their odor .
the arms which <name> wore were laid out in view , also , between the coffin and the throne .
on the four sides of the carriage were <unk> <unk> , that is , sculptured figures raised from a surface , representing <name> himself , with various military <unk> .
there were macedonian columns , and persian squadrons , and elephants of <name> , and troops of horse , and various other emblems of the departed hero 's greatness and power .
around the pavilion , too , there was a fringe or net-work of golden lace , to the <unk> of which were attached bells , which <unk> continually , with a mournful sound , as the carriage moved along .
a long column of mules , sixty-four in number , arranged in sets of four , <name> this ponderous car .
these mules were all selected for their great size and strength , and were splendidly caparisoned .
they had collars and harnesses mounted with gold , and enriched with precious stones .
before the procession set out from babylon an army of pioneers and workmen went forward to repair the roads , strengthen the bridges , and remove the obstacles along the whole line of route over which the train was to pass .
at length , when all was ready , the solemn procession began to move , and passed out through the gates of babylon .
no pen can describe the enormous throngs of spectators that assembled to witness its departure , and that gathered along the route , as it passed slowly on from city to city , in its long and weary way .
notwithstanding all this pomp and parade , however , the body never reached its intended destination .
ptolemy , the officer to whom egypt fell in the division of <name> 's empire , came forth with a grand escort of troops to meet the funeral procession as it came into egypt .
he preferred , for some reason or other , that the body should be interred in the city of <name> .
it was accordingly deposited there , and a great monument was erected over the spot .
this monument is said to have remained standing for fifteen hundred years , but all vestiges of it have now disappeared .
the city of <name> itself , however , is the conqueror 's real monument ; the greatest and best , perhaps , that any conqueror ever left behind him .
it is a monument , too , that time <name> not destroy ; its position and character , as <name> foresaw , by bringing it a continued <unk> , secure its perpetuity .
<name> earned well the name and reputation of the great .
he was truly great in all those powers and capacities which can elevate one man above his fellows .
we can not help applauding the extraordinary energy of his genius , though we condemn the selfish and cruel ends to which his life was devoted .
he was simply a robber , but yet a robber on so vast a scale , that mankind , in contemplating his career , have generally lost sight of the wickedness of his crimes in their admiration of the enormous magnitude of the scale on which they were perpetrated .

the object of this little work , and of others of its family , which may perhaps follow , is , like that of the " rollo books , " to furnish useful and instructive reading to young children .
the aim is not so directly to communicate knowledge , as it is to develop the moral and intellectual powers ,  to cultivate habits of discrimination and correct reasoning , and to establish sound principles of moral conduct .
the " rollo books " embrace principally intellectual and moral discipline ; " <name> , " and the others of its family , <name> include also religious training , according to the <unk> views of <name> truth which the author has been accustomed to entertain , and which he has inculcated in his more serious writings .

<name> was a <unk> , blue-eyed boy , with <unk> hair and happy countenance .
and yet he was rather pale and slender .
he had been sick .
his father and mother lived in boston , but now he was spending the summer at <name> river country , with his grandmother .
his father thought that if he could run about a few months in the open air , and play among the rocks and under the trees , he would grow more strong and healthy , and that his cheeks would not look so pale .
his grandmother made him a blue jacket with bright buttons .
she liked metal buttons , because they would wear longer than covered ones , but he liked them because they were more beautiful .
" besides , " said he , " i can see my face in them , grandmother . "
little <name> then went to the window , so as to see his face plainer .
he stood with his back to the window , and held the button so that the light from the window could shine directly upon it .
" why grandmother , " said <name> , " i can not see now so well as i could before . "
" that is because your face is turned away from the light , " said she .
" and the button is turned towards the light , " said <name> .
" but when you want to see any thing reflected in a glass , you must have the light shine upon the thing you want to see reflected , not upon the glass itself ; and i suppose it is so with a bright button . "
then <name> turned around , so as to have his face towards the light ; and he found that he could then see it reflected very distinctly .
his grandmother went on with her work , and <name> sat for some time in silence .
the house that <name> lived in was in a narrow <name> valley .
a stream of water ran over a <name> bed , in front of the house , and a rugged mountain towered behind it .
across the stream , too , there was a high , <name> hill , which was in full view from the parlour window .
this hill was covered with wild evergreens , which clung to their sides , and to the interstices of the rocks ; and mosses , green and brown , in long <unk> , <name> from their limbs .
here and there crags and precipices peeped out from among the foliage , and a grey old <name> towered above , at the summit .
<name> turned his button round again towards the window , and of course turned his face from the window .
the reflection of his face was now dim , as before , but in a moment his eye caught the reflection of the crags and trees across the little valley .
" o , grandmother , " said he again , " i can see the rocks in my buttons , and the trees .
and there is an old stump , " he continued , his voice falling to a low tone , as if he was talking to himself ,  " and there is a tree ,  and ,  why  why , what is that ?
it is a bear , <unk> , "  calling aloud to her ,  " i see a bear upon the mountain . "
" nonsense , <name> , " said the grandmother .
" i do certainly , " said <name> , and he dropped the corner of his jacket , which had the button attached to it , and looked out of the window directly at the mountain .
presently <name> turned away from the window , and ran to the door .
there was a little green yard in front of the house , with a large , smooth , flat stone for a door-step .
<name> stood on this step , and looked intently at the mountain .
in a moment he ran back to his grandmother , and said , " grandmother , do come and see this black bear . "
" why , child , " said she , smiling , " it is nothing but some old black stump or log . "
" but it moves , grandmother .
it certainly moves . "
so his grandmother smiled , and said , " well , i suppose i must come and see . "
so she laid down her work , and took off her spectacles , and <name> took hold of her hand , and trotted along before her to the step of the door .
it was a beautiful <name> morning in <name> .
" there , " said <name> , triumphantly pointing to a spot among the rocks and bushes half-way up the mountain ,  " there , what do you call that ? "
his grandmother looked a moment intently in silence , and then said , " i do see something there under the bushes . "
" and is n't it moving ? "
said <name> .
" why , yes , " said she .
" and is n't it black ? "
" yes , " said she .
" then it is a bear , " said <name> , <unk> , and half afraid , " isn't it , grandmother ?
i 'll go and get the gun . "
there was an old gun behind the high desk , in the back sitting-room ; but it had not been loaded for twenty years , and had no back upon it .
still <name> always supposed that some how or other it would shoot .
" shall i , grandmother ? "
said he eagerly , " no , " said she .
" i do n't think it is a bear . "
" what then ? "
said <name> .
" i think it is <name> . "
" <name> ! "
said <name> .
" yes , <name> , " said she .
" run and see if you can find the boys . "
<name> was the cow .
she had strayed from the pasture the day before , and they could not find her .
she was called <name> from her colour ; for although she had looked almost black , as <name> had seen her in the bushes , she was really a <name> colour .
<name> saw at once , as soon as his grandmother said that it was <name> , that she was correct .
in fact , he could see her head and horns , as she was holding her head up to eat the leaves from the bushes .
however he did not stop to talk about it , but , obeying his grandmother immediately , he ran off after the boys .
he went out to the back door , where the boys had been at play , and shouted out , " <name> !
da  <unk> !
<unk>  <unk> !
da  <unk> ! "
but there was no reply , except a distant <name> of " <name> " and " <name> " from the rocks and mountains .
so <name> came back , and said that he could not find the boys , and that he supposed that they had gone to school .
" then we must call <name> , " said she .
" and may i ring for him , grandmother ? "
said <name> .
grandmother said he might : and so <name> ran off to the porch at the back door , and took down quite a large <name> , which was hanging there .
<name> stood upon the steps of the porch , and grasping the great handle of the <name> with both hands , he rang it with all his might .
in a minute or two he stopped ; and then he heard a faint and distant " <unk> " coming , from a field .
<name> put the <name> back into its place , and then went again to his grandmother .
in a few minutes <name> came in .
he was a <unk> and rather tall young man , broad-shouldered and strong ,  slow in his motions , and of a very sober countenance .
<name> heard his heavy step in the entry , though he came slowly and carefully , as if he tried to walk without making a noise .
" did you want me , madam <name> ? "
said he , holding his hat in his hand .
<name> 's grandmother was generally called madam <name> .
" yes , " said she .
" <name> has got up on the rocks .
<name> spied her there ; he <name> shew you where , and i should like to have you go and drive her down . "
<name> wanted to go too ; but his grandmother said it would not do very well , for he could not keep up with <name> ; and besides , she said that she wanted him .
so <name> went out with <name> under the great elm before the house , and pointed out the place among the rocks , where he had seen <name> .
she was not there then , at least she was not in sight ; but <name> knew that she could not have gone far from the place , so he walked down over the bridge , and soon disappeared .
while <name> stood watching <name> , as he walked off with long strides towards the mountain , his grandmother came to the door and said , " come , <name> . "
<name> turned and ran to his grandmother .
she had in her hand a little red morocco book , and taking <name> 's hand , she went slowly up stairs , he <unk> and capering around her all the way .
there was a bed in the room , with a white covering , and by the window an easy chair , with a high back , and round <unk> arms .
madam <name> went to the easy chair and sat down and took <name> in her lap .
<name> looked out upon the long drooping branches of the elm which <name> near the window .
<name> 's countenance was pale ; and he was slender in form , and delicate in appearance .
he had been sick , and even now , he was not quite well .
his little taper fingers rested upon the window-sill , while his grandmother opened her little bible and began to read .
<name> sat still in her lap , with a serious and attentive expression of countenance .
" two men went up into the <name> to pray ; the one a pharisee , the other a publican . "
" what is a pharisee and a publican ? "
asked <name> .
" you <name> hear presently .
'and the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself : god , i thank thee that i am not as other men are , <unk> , unjust , <unk> . "
" what are all those ? "
asked <name> .
" o , different kinds of crimes and sins .
the pharisee thanked god that he had not committed any of them . "
" was he a good man , grandmother ? "
" very likely he had not committed any of these great crimes . "
" very well , grandmother , go on . "
" 'or even as this publican . '
a publican , you must know , was a <unk> .
he used to collect the taxes from the people .
they did not like to pay their taxes , and so they did not like the <unk> , and despised them .
and thus the pharisee thanked god that he was not like that publican .
'i fast twice in the week .
i pay <unk> of all that i possess . '
" <unk> ? "
said <name> .
" yes , that was money which god had commanded them to pay .
they were to pay in proportion to the property they had .
but some dishonest men used to conceal some of their property , so as not to have to pay so much ; but this pharisee said he paid <unk> of all that he possessed . "
" that was right , grandmother , " said <name> .
" yes , " said his grandmother , " that was very well . "
" if he really did it , " continued <name> doubtfully .
" do you think he did , grandmother ? "
" i think it very probable .
i presume he was a pretty good man , outside . "
" what do you mean by that , grandmother ? "
" why , his heart might have been bad , but he was probably pretty careful about all his actions , which could be seen of men .
but we <name> go on . "
" 'and the publican , standing afar off , would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven , but smote upon his breast , saying , god be merciful to me a sinner .
i tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other . ' "
" which man ? "
said <name> .
" the publican . "
" the publican was justified ? "
said <name> , " what does justified mean ? "
" forgiven and approved .
god was pleased with the publican , because he confessed his sins honestly ; but he was displeased with the pharisee , because he came boasting of his good deeds . "
here there was a pause .
<name> sat still and seemed thoughtful .
his grandmother did not interrupt him , but waited to hear what he would say .
" yes ; but , grandmother , if the pharisee really was a good man , it wasn't right for him to thank god for it ? "
" it reminds me of <name> 's acorns , " said madam <name> .
" <name> 's acorns ! "
said <name> , " tell me about them , grandmother . "
" why , <name> and his brother <name> were sent to school .
they stopped to play by the way , until it was so late that they did not dare to go in .
then they staid playing about the fields till it was time to go home .
they felt pretty bad and out of humour , and at last they separated and went home different ways .
" in going home , <name> found an <unk> with acorns under it .
'ah ! '
said he , 'i <name> <name> mother home some acorns . '
he had observed that his mother was pleased whenever he brought her things ; and he had an idea of soothing his own feelings of guilt , and securing his mother's favour , by the good deed of carrying her home some acorns .
so , when he came into the house , he took off his hat carefully , with the acorns in it , and holding it in both hands , marched up to his mother with a smiling face , and look of great <unk> , and said , 'here , mother , i have got you some acorns . ' "
" and what did his mother say ? "
asked <name> .
" she shook her head sorrowfully , and told him to go and put the acorns away .
she knew where he had been .
" then presently <name> came in .
he put away his cap , walked in softly , and put his face down in his mother 's lap , and said , with tears and sobs , <unk> , i have been doing something very wrong . '
now , which of these do you think came to his mother right ? ' "
" why ,  <name> , " said he , " certainly . "
" yes , and that was the way the publican came ; but the pharisee covered up all his sins , being pleased and satisfied himself , and thinking that god would be pleased and satisfied with his acorns . "
here madam <name> paused , and <name> sat still , thinking of what he had heard .
madam <name> then closed her eyes , and , in a low , gentle voice , she spoke a few words of prayer ; and then she told <name> that he must always remember in all his prayers to confess his sins fully and freely , and never cover them up and conceal them , with an idea that his good deeds made him worthy .
then she put <name> down , and he ran down stairs to play .
he asked his grandmother to let him go over the bridge , so as to be ready to meet <name> , when he should come back with the cow .
she at first advised him not to go , for she was afraid , she said , that he might get lost , or fall into the <name> ; but <name> was very desirous to go , and finally she consented .
he had a little whip that <name> had made for him .
the handle was made from the branch of a <unk> , which <name> cut first to make a cane of , for himself ; but he broke his cane , and so he gave <name> the rest of the stick for a <unk> .
the lash was made of leather .
it was cut out of a round piece of thick leather , round and round , as they made leather <unk> , and then rolled upon a board .
this is a fine way to make lashes and reins for boys .
<name> took his whip for company , and sauntered along over the bridge .
when he had crossed the bridge , he walked along the bank of the stream , watching the <unk> and butterflies , and now and then cutting off the head of a weed with the lash of his whip .
the banks of the <name> were in some places high , and the water deep ; in other places , there was a sort of beach , sloping down to the <unk> edge ; and here , the water was generally shallow , to a considerable distance from the shore .
<name> was allowed to come down to the water at these shallow places ; but he had often been told that he must not go near the steep places , because there was danger that he would fall in .
now , boys are not very naturally inclined to obey their parents .
they have to be taught with great pains and care .
they must be punished for disobedience , in some way or other , a good many times .
but neglected children , that is , those that are left to themselves , are almost always very disobedient and <unk> .
<name> , now , was not a neglected child .
he had been taught to submit and obey , when he was very young , and his grandmother could trust him now .
besides , <name> , had still less disposition now to disobey his grandmother than usual , for he had been sick , and was still pale and feeble ; and this state of health often makes children quiet , gentle , and submissive .
so <name> walked slowly along , carefully avoiding all the high banks , but sometimes going down to the water , where the shore was sloping and safe .
at length , at one of these little landing places he stopped longer than usual .
he called it the cotton landing .
<name> and <name> gave it that name , because they always found , wedged in , in a corner between a log and the shore , a pile of cotton , as they called it .
it was , in reality , light , white froth , which always lay there ; and even if they pushed it all away with a stick , they would find a new supply the next day .
<name> stood upon the shore , and with the lash of his whip , cut into the pile of " cotton . "
the pile broke up into large masses , and moved slowly and lightly away into the stream .
one small tuft of it floated towards the shore , and <name> reached it with his <unk> , and took a part of it in , saying , " now i <name> see what it is made of . "
on closely examining it , he found to his surprise , that it was composed of an infinite number of very small bubbles , piled one upon another , like the little stones in a heap of gravel .
it was white and beautiful , and in some of the biggest bubbles , <name> could see all the colours of the rainbow .
he wondered where this foam could come from , and he determined to <name> some of it home to his grandmother .
so he stripped off a flat piece of birch bark from a neighbouring tree , and took up a little of the froth upon it , and placed it very carefully upon a rock on the bank , where it would remain safely , he thought , till he was ready to go home .
just above where he stood was a little waterfall in the <name> .
the current was stopped by some stones and logs , and the water tumbled over the obstruction , forming quite a little cataract , which sparkled in the sun .
<name> threw sticks and pieces of bark into the water , above the fall , and watched them as they sailed on , faster and faster , and then pitched down the descent .
then he would go and whip them into his landing , and thus he could take them out , and sail them down again .
after amusing himself some time in this manner , he began to wonder why <name> did not come , and he concluded to take his foam , and go along .
he went to the rock and took up his birch bark ; but , to his surprise , the foam had disappeared .
he was wondering what had become of it , when he heard across the road , and at a little distance above him , a scrambling in the bushes , on the side of the mountain .
at first , he was afraid ; but in a moment more , he caught a glimpse of the cow coming out of the bushes , and supposing that <name> was behind , he threw down his birch bark , and began to gallop off to meet him , lashing the ground with his whip .
at the same time , the cow , somewhat worried by being driven pretty fast down the rocks , came running out into the road , and when she saw <name> coming towards her , and with such antics , began to cut <unk> too .
she came on , in a kind of <unk> , <unk> canter , shaking her horns ; and <name> , before he got very near her , began to be somewhat frightened .
at first he stopped , looking at her with alarm .
then he began to fall back to the side of the road , towards the <name> .
at this instant <name> appeared coming out of the bushes , and , seeing <name> , called out to him to stand still .
" stand still , <name> , till she goes by : she <name> not hurt you . "
but <name> could not control his fears .
his little heart beat quick , and his pale cheek grew paler .
he could not control his fears , though he knew very well that what <name> said must be true .
he kept retreating backwards nearer and nearer to the <name> , as the cow came on , whipping the air , towards her to keep her off .
he was now at some little distance above the cotton landing , and opposite to a part of the bank where the water was deep .
<name> perceived his danger , and as he was now on the very brink , he shouted out suddenly , " <name> !
<name> !
take care ! "
but the sudden call only frightened poor <name> still more ; and before the " take care " was uttered , his foot slipped , and he slid back into the water , and sank into it until he entirely disappeared .
<name> rushed to the place , and in an instant was in the water by his side , and pulling <name> out , he carried him gasping to the shore .
he wiped his face with his handkerchief , and tried to cheer and encourage him .
" never , mind , <name> , " said he ; " it wo n't hurt you .
it is a warm <name> morning . "
<name> cried a few minutes , but , finally , became pretty nearly calm , and <name> led him along towards home , sobbing as he went , " o dear me !  what <name> my grandmother say ? "
chapter ii .
trouble .
as <name> walked along by the side of <name> , and came upon the bridge , he was seen both by his grandmother , who happened to be standing at the door , and also at the same instant , by the two boys , <name> and <name> , who were just then coming home from school .
<name> , seeing <name> walking along so sadly , his clothes and hair thoroughly drenched , set up a shout , and ran towards him over the bridge .
<name> was of a more quiet and sober turn , and he followed more slowly , but with a face full of surprise and curiosity .
madam <name> , too , perceived that her little grandson had been in the <name> , and she said , " can it be possible that he has disobeyed ? "
then , again , the next thought was , " well , if he has , he has been punished for it pretty severely , and so i <name> treat him kindly . "
<name> and <name> came eagerly up , with exclamations , and questions without number .
this made poor <name> feel worse and worse  he wanted to get home as soon as possible , and he could not tell the boys all the story there ; and presently <name> , finding that he could not get by them very well , took him up in his arms , and carried him towards the house , <name> and <name> following behind .
<name> expected that his grandmother would think him very much to blame , and so , as he came near enough to speak to her , he raised his head from <name> 's shoulder , and began to say , " i am very sorry , grandmother ; but i could not help it .
i certainly could not help it . "
but he saw at once , by his grandmother 's pleasant-looking face , that she was not going to find any fault with him .
" you have not hurt yourself , <name> , i <name> , " said she , as <name> put him down .
" no , " said he , " but i feel rather cold . "
his grandmother said she would soon warm him , and she led him into a little bedroom , where he was accustomed to sleep , and undressed him , talking <unk> with him all the while , so as to relieve his fears , and make him feel more happy .
she wiped him dry with soft flannel , and gave him some clean , dry clothes , and made him very comfortable again .
she did not ask him how he happened to fall in the water , for she knew it would trouble him to talk about it .
so she amused him by talking about other things , and at last let him out again into the parlour .
the wetting did <name> no injury ; but the fright and the suddenness of the plunge gave him a shock , which , in his feeble state of health , he was ill able to bear .
a good stout boy , with red cheeks and plump limbs , would not have regarded it at all , but would have been off to play again just as soon as his clothes were changed .
but poor <name> sat down in his little rocking chair by the side of his grandmother , and began to rock back and forth , as if he was rocking away the memory of his troubles , while his grandmother went on with her work .
presently he stopped to listen to the voices of <name> and <name> , who were out before the house .
" grandmother , " said he , " is that the boys ? "
" yes , " said she , " i believe it is . "
then <name> went on rocking , and the voices died away .
presently , they came nearer again .
the boys seemed to be passing down in front of the house , with a wheelbarrow , towards the water .
" grandmother , " said <name> , stopping again , " what do you suppose the boys are doing ? "
" i do n't know , " said she , " should not you like to go and see ?
you can play with them half an hour before dinner , if you please . "
<name> did not answer , but began to rock again .
he did not seem inclined to go .
soon after he heard a splash , as of stones thrown into the water .
<name> started up and said , " grandmother , what can they be doing ? "
" i do n't know , " said she , " if you want to know very much , you must go and see . "
<name> rose slowly , put his rocking chair back into its place , and went to the door .
he looked down towards the bank of the <name> before the house , and saw <name> and <name> there .
they had a wheelbarrow close to the edge of the water , with a few stones in it , some as big as <unk> head .
each of the boys had a stone in his hand , which he was just throwing into the <name> .
<name> had a great <name> to go down and see what they were doing ; but he felt weak and tired , and so , after looking on a moment , he said to himself , " i had rather sit down here . "
so he sat down upon the step of the door , and looked on .
after the boys had thrown one or two large stones into the water , they took hold of the wheelbarrow , and , then , <unk> it up , the whole load slid down into the water , close to the shore .
the boys then came back , wheeling the great wheelbarrow up into the road .
they went after another load of stones , and <name> 's curiosity was so far awakened , that he rose slowly , and walked down towards the place .
in a few minutes , the boys came back with their load ; <name> wheeling , and <name> walking along by his side , and pushing as well as he could , to help .
as soon as he saw <name> , he began to call out , " o <name> , you were afraid of a cow ! "
<name> looked sad and unhappy .
<name> said , " i would not laugh at him , <name> .
<name> , we are building a mole . "
" a mole ! "
said <name> .
" what is that ? "
" why , it is a kind of wharf , built out far into the water , to make a harbour for our shipping .
we learned about it in our geography . "
" yes , " said <name> , coming up , eagerly , to <name> , " you see the current carries all our vessels down the stream , you know , <name> , and we are going to build out a long mole , out into the middle of the <name> , and that <name> stop our vessels ; and then we are going to make it pretty wide , so that we can walk out upon it , and the end of it <name> do for a wharf . "
" yes , it <name> be a sort of harbour for 'em , " said <name> .
<name> looked quite pleased at this plan and wanted the boys to let him help ; and <name> said he might go and help them get their next load of stones .
but <name> did not help much , although he really tried to help .
he kept getting into the other boys ' way .
at last <name> got out of <name> , and said , " <name> , you do n't help us the least mite .
i wish you would go away . "
but <name> wanted to help ; and <name> tried to make him go away .
presently , he began to laugh at him for being afraid of a cow .
" i suppose i could frighten you by <unk> at you , <name> . "
<name> did not answer , but walked along by the side of the wheelbarrow .
<name> was wheeling it ; for they had now got it loaded , and were going back to the shore of the <name> , <name> on one side , and <name> upon the other .
<name> saw that <name> <name> his head , and looked confused .
" <unk> !
<unk> !  " said <name> .
<name> walked along silent as before .
" <unk> !
<unk> !  " said <name> , running round to <name> 's side of the wheelbarrow , and <unk> close into his ear .
<name> let go of the wheelbarrow , turned around , burst into tears , and walked slowly and sorrowfully away towards the house .
" there , now , " said <name> , " you have made him cry .
what do you want to trouble him so for ? "
<name> looked after <name> , and seeing that he was going to the house , he was afraid that he would tell his grandmother .
so he ran after him , and began to call to him to stop ; but , before he had gone many steps , he saw his grandmother standing at the door of the house , and calling to them all to come .
<name> had nearly stopped crying when he came up to his grandmother .
she did not say any thing to him about the cause of his trouble , but asked him if he was willing to go down cellar with <name> <name> , and help her choose a <unk> of apples for dinner .
his eye brightened at this proposal , and <name> <name> , who was sitting at the window , reading , rose , laid down her book , took hold of his hand with a smile , and led him away .
madam <name> then went to her seat in her great arm-chair , and <name> and <name> came and stood by her side .
" i am sorry , <name> , that you wanted to trouble <name> . "
" but , mother , " said <name> , " i only <unk> at him a little . "
" and what did you do it for ? "
" o , only for fun , mother . "
" did you suppose it gave him pain ? "
" why ,  i do n't know . "
" did you suppose it gave him pleasure ? "
" why , no , " said <name> , looking down .
" and did not you know that it gave him pain ?
now , tell me , honestly . "
" why , yes , mother , i knew it plagued him a little ; but then i only did it for fun . "
" i know it , " said madam <name> ; " and that is the very thing that makes me so sorry for it . "
" why , mother ? "
said <name> in a tone of surprise .
" because if you had given <name> four times as much pain for any other reason , i should not have thought half so much of it , as to have you trouble him for fun .
if it had been to do him any good , or to do any body else any good , or from mistake , or mere <unk> , i should not have thought so much of it ; but to do it for fun ! "
here madam <name> stopped , as if she did not know what to say .
" i rather think , mother , it was only <unk> , " said <name> , by way of <unk> <name> .
" no ; because he knew that it gave <name> pain , and it was , in fact , for the very purpose of giving him pain , that <name> did it .
if he had been saying <unk> accidentally , without thinking of troubling <name> , that would have been <unk> ; but it was not so .
and what makes me most unhappy about this , " continued madam <name> , putting her hand gently on <name> 's head , " is that my dear <name> has a heart capable under some circumstances , of taking pleasure in the sufferings of a helpless little child . "
<name> and <name> were both silent , though they saw clearly that what their mother said was true .
" and yet , perhaps , you think it is a very little thing after all , " she continued , " just <unk> at <name> a little .
the pain it gave him was soon over .
just sending him down cellar to get apples , made him forget it in a moment ; so that you see it is not the mischief that is done , in this case , but the spirit of mind in you , that it shews .
it is a little thing , i know ; but then it is a little symptom of a very bad disease .
it is very hard to cure . "
" well , mother , " said <name> , looking up , and speaking very positively , " i am determined not to trouble <name> any more . "
" yes , but i am afraid your <unk> wo n't reach the difficulty .
as long as the spirit of mind remains , so that you are capable of taking pleasure in the sufferings of another , your <unk> not to indulge the bad spirit , <name> not do much good .
you <name> forget them all , when the temptation comes .
do n't you remember how often i have talked with you about this , and how often you have promised not to do it , before ? "
" why , yes , mother , " said <name> , <unk> .
" so , you see <unk> <name> not do much good .
as long as your heart is malicious , the malice <name> come out in spite of all your <unk> . "
just at this moment <name> came in , bringing his plate of apples , with an air of great importance and satisfaction .
he had nearly forgotten his troubles .
soon after this , dinner was brought in , and madam <name> said no more to the boys about malice .
after dinner , they went out again to play .
chapter iii .
building the mole .
<name> sat down upon the step of the door , eating a piece of bread , while <name> and <name> returned to their work of building the mole .
they got the wheelbarrow , and loaded it with stones .
<name> sat a few minutes more at the door , and then he went into the house , and got his little rocking chair , and brought it out under the elm , and sat down there , looking towards the boys , who were at work near the water .
at last , <name> spied him sitting there , and said , " there is <name> , sitting under the great tree . "
<name> looked around , and then , throwing down the stone that he had in his hands , he said , " i mean to go and get him to come here . "
so he ran towards him , and said , " come , <name> , come down here , and help us make our mole . "
" no , " said <name> , shaking his head , and , turning away a little ; " i don't want to go . "
" o , do come , <name> , " said <name> ; " i wo n't trouble you any more . "
" no , " said <name> : " i am tired , and i had rather stay here in my little chair . "
" but i <name> <name> your chair down to the <name> ; and there is a beautiful place there to sit and see us tumble in the stones . "
so <name> got up , and <name> took his chair , and they walked together down to the shore of the <name> .
<name> found a little spot so smooth and level , that the rocking-chair would stand very even upon it , though it would not rock very well , for the ground was not hard , like a floor .
<name> rested his elbow upon the arm of his chair , and his pale cheek in his little slender hand , and watched the stones , as , one after another , they fell into the <name> .
the <name> at this place , was very wide and shallow , and the current was not very rapid , so that they got along pretty fast ; and thus the mole advanced steadily out into the stream .
" well , <name> , " said <name> , as he stopped , after they had tossed out all the stones from the wheelbarrow , " and how do you like our mole ? "
" o , not very well , " said <name> .
" why not ? "
said <name> , surprised .
" it is so stony . "
" stony ? "
said <name> .
" yes , " said <name> , " i do n't think i could walk on it very well . "
" o , " said <name> , " we are going to make the top very smooth , when we get it done . "
" how ? "
said <name> .
" why , we are going to haul gravel on it , and smooth it all down . "
" why ca n't we do it now ? "
said <name> , " as we go along : and then we can wheel our wheelbarrow out upon it , and tip our stones in at the end . "
" agreed , " said <name> ; and they accordingly leveled the stones off on the top , and put small stones in at all the interstices , that is , the little spaces between the large stones , so as to prevent the gravel from running down through .
then they went and got a load of gravel out of a bank pretty near , and spread it down over the top , and it made a good , smooth road ; only , it was not trodden down hard at first , and so it was not very easy wheeling over it .
they found one difficulty , however , and that was that the gravel rolled over each side of the mole , and went into the water .
to prevent this , they arranged the largest stones on each side , in a row , for the edge , and then filled in with gravel up to the edge , and thus they gradually advanced towards the middle of the stream , finishing the mole completely as they went on .
<name> then said he liked it very much , and wanted to walk on it .
so the boys let him .
he went out to the end , and stood there a minute , and then said that he wished he had his whip there , to whip in a stick which was sailing down a little way off .
" where is your whip ? "
said <name> .
" i suppose it is hanging up on its nail , " said <name> , " i mean to go and get it . "
so <name> walked off the mole , and went slowly up towards the house , singing by the way , while <name> and <name> went after another load of gravel .
while they were putting down this load , and spreading it on , <name> came back , looking disappointed and sorrowful , and saying that he could not find his whip .
" where did you put it when you had it last ? "
asked <name> .
" i put it on the nail , " said <name> , " i always put it on the nail . "
" o , no , <name> , " said <name> ; " you must have left it about somewhere . "
" no , " said <name> , shaking his head with a positive air , " i am sure i put it on my nail . "
" when did you have it last ? "
" why ,  let me see , " said <name> , thinking .
" i had it yesterday , playing horses on the <unk> : and then i had it this morning ,  i believe ,  when i went up the <name> to meet <name> . "
" then you left it up there , i know , " said <name> .
" no , " said <name> , " i am sure i put it on my nail . "
" you did not have it , <name> , " said <name> , mildly , " when we met you on the bridge . "
" did n't i ? "
said <name> , standing still and trying to think .
" no , " replied <name> , decidedly .
" i wish you would go up there with me , and help me find it . "
" why , we want to finish our mole , " said <name> .
" i 'll go , " said <name> , " while you , <name> , get another load of gravel .
come , <name> , " said he , " go and shew me where it was . "
so <name> and <name> walked on .
they went down to the bridge , crossed the stream upon it , then turned up , on the opposite bank , and walked on until they came to the cotton landing .
<name> then pointed to the place where he had fallen in ; and they looked all about there , upon the bank , and in the water , but in vain .
no whip was to be found .
before they returned , they stopped a moment at the cotton landing , and <name> shewed <name> that the cotton was all made of little bubbles .
they got some of it to the shore and examined it , and then , just as they were going away .
<name> exclaimed , suddenly , " there is your whip , now , <name> . "
<name> looked round , and saw that <name> was pointing towards the little fall or rather great ripple of water , and there , just in the fall , was the <unk> floating , and kept from drifting away by the lash , which had got caught in the rocks .
there the handle lay , or rather <name> , bobbing up and down , and struggling as if it was trying to get free .
after various attempts to liberate it , by throwing sticks and stones at it , <name> took off his shoes , turned up his pantaloons to his knees , and waded in to the place , and after carefully <unk> the whip , brought it safely to the shore .
" i am very glad i have got my whip again , " said <name> , while <name> was putting on his shoes .
" i am glad too , " said <name> .
" but you told a lie about it , <name> . "
" a lie ! "
said <name> .
" yes : you said you certainly <name> it up upon the nail , " said <name> , as they began to walk along .
" well , i thought i did , " said <name> .
" that makes no difference .
you did not say you thought you <name> it up , but that you were sure you did . "
" well , i certainly thought i did , " said <name> ; " and i am sure it wasn't a lie . "
<name> insisted that it was , and <name> determined to ask his grandmother .
they returned to the mole .
it was not long after this , that <name> , on looking towards the house , called out that his mother was coming .
it was true .
she put on her bonnet , and was coming slowly down to the <name> , to see how the boys got on with their work .
they were rejoiced to see her coming .
they took <name> 's chair , and laid it down upon its side , and then put one of the <unk> of the wheelbarrow upon it with the clean side up ; and this made quite a comfortable seat for her , though it was a little unsteady .
she sat down upon it , and made a good many enquiries about their plan and the progress of the work .
" well , boys , " said she , " that is a capital plan , and you <name> have a great <name> above your mole . "
" an <name> ! "
said <name> , " what is that ? "
" why , the water coming down , <name> strike upon the outer end of your mole , and be turned in towards the shore , and then <name> go round , and <name> come into the stream again .
there , you can see it is beginning to run so already . "
so the boys looked above the mole , and they saw the little bubbles that were floating in the water , sailing round and round slowly , in a small circle , between the upper side of the mole and the shore .
" when you get it built away out , " said madam <name> , " there <name> be quite a whirlpool ; you might call it the <unk> .
there , you see , <name> can have a little harbour up there on the shore , and one of you can go out to the end of the mole , and put a little ship into the water , and the <name> <name> <name> it round to him .
then he can take out the cargo , and put in a new one , and then set the ship in the water , and the current <name> <name> it back again , round on the other side of the whirlpool . "
the boys were very much delighted at this prospect , and they determined to build out the mole very far , so as to have " a great sweep , " as <name> called it , in the <name> .
<name> went out upon the part of the mole which was finished , and put in a piece of wood , and watched it with great delight as it slowly sailed round .
chapter iv .
a discussion .
while <name> stood upon the mole , he began to whip the water ; and , in doing so , he spattered <name> and <name> a little .
<name> said , " take care , <name>  do n't <unk> us ; " and he went up to him , and was going gently to take hold of his whip , to take it away .
" let me have the whip , " said he .
" no , " said <name> , holding it firmly , " i want it . "
" let go of it , <name> , " said madam <name> .
" why , mother , he ought to let me have it , for i went and got it for him .
he would not have had it at all without me . "
" you must not take it by violence , " said his mother , " if you have ever so good a right to it .
but did you get it for him ? "
" yes , mother ; and he told a lie about it . "
" o , <name> , " said his mother , " you ought not to say so .
i ca n't think <name> would tell a lie . "
" he did , mother ; he said he was sure he <name> it up , when , after all , he dropped it in the water ; and we agreed to leave it to you if that was not telling a lie . "
" did you know , <name> , when you said you <name> it up , that you had really left it in the water ? "
" no , grandmother , " said <name> , very earnestly ; " i really thought i had <name> it up . "
" then it was not telling a lie , <name> .
a lie is told with an intention to deceive .
to make it a lie it is necessary that the person who says a thing , must know distinctly at the time that he says it , that it is not true ; and he must say it with the particular intention to deceive .
now , <name> did not do this . "
" well , mother , " said <name> , " i am sure you have told us a good many times that we must never say any thing unless we are sure it is true . "
" so i have .
i admit that <name> did wrong in saying so positively that he had <name> his whip up , when he did not know certainly that he had .
but this does not prove that it was telling a lie .
you know there are a great many other faults besides telling lies ; and this is one of them . "
" what do you call it , mother ? "
said <name> .
" i do n't know , " said she , hesitating .
" it is a very common fault ,  asserting a thing positively , when you do not know whether it is true or not .
but if you think it is true , even if you have no proper grounds for thinking so , and are entirely mistaken , it is not telling a lie . "
" in fact , " she continued , " i once knew a case where one boy was justly punished for falsehood when what he said was true ; and another was rewarded for his truth , when what he said was false . "
" why , mother ? "
said <name> and <name> together , with great surprise .
" yes , " said madam <name> ; " the case was this .
they were farmers ' boys , and they wanted to go into the barn , and play upon the hay .
their father told them they might go , but charged them to be careful to shut the door after them in going in , so as not to let the colt get out .
so the boys ran off to the barn in high glee , and were so eager to get upon the hay , that they forgot altogether to shut the door .
when they came down they found the door open , and to their great alarm , the colt was nowhere to be seen .
<unk> , one of the boys , said , 'let us shut the door now , and not tell father that we let the colt out , and he <name> think somebody else did it . '
" 'no , ' said <name> , the other , 'let us tell the truth . '
" so about an hour afterwards , <unk> went into the house , and his father said , <unk> , did you let the colt out ? '
" 'no , sir , ' said <unk> .
" not long after he met <name> .
" <unk> , ' said he , 'you had a fine time upon the hay , i suppose .
i <name> you did not let the colt out . '
" <name> <name> his head , and said , 'why , yes , sir , we did .
we forgot to shut the door , and so he got away . '
" now , which of these boys , do you suppose , was guilty of telling a lie ? "
" why , <unk> , certainly , " said <name> , <name> , and <name> , all together .
" yes , and yet the colt had not got away . "
" had n't he ? "
said <name> .
" no , he was safely coiled up in a corner upon some hay , out of sight ; and there the farmer found him safe and sound , when he went in to look .
but did that make any difference in <unk> 's guilt , do you think ? "
" no , mother , " said <name> .
<name> , at the same time shook his head , shewing that he entertained the same opinion .
" i think it did not , " continued madam <name> , " and the farmer thought so too ; for he very properly punished <unk> , and rewarded <name> . "
<name> seemed to assent to this rather reluctantly , as if he was almost sorry that <name> had not been proved guilty of telling a lie .
" well , mother , " he said presently , with a more lively tone , " at any rate he disobeyed you ; for you told him not to go near the <name> where the bank was high ; and he did , or else he never would have fallen in . "
" but i could not help it , " said <name> , " the cow frightened me so . "
" yes , you could help it , " said <name> ; " for the cow did not come up and push you ; you walked back yourself , of your own accord . "
madam <name> observed that <name> appeared more pale and languid than usual ; and this new charge which <name> brought against him , made him more sad and melancholy still .
madam <name> accordingly then said she would not talk any more about it then , for she must go in , and she asked <name> whether he would rather go in with her , or remain out there with the boys .
he said he would rather go in .
so he took hold of madam <name> 's hand , and walked along by her side .
<name> said he would bring his rocking-chair for him , when he and <name> should come in .
chapter v. the story of blind <name> .
madam <name> went into the house , and sat down in her large rocking-chair , by a window , in a back parlour that looked out upon a little garden , and began to sew .
<name> played around a little while , rather languidly , and at last came up to his grandmother , and leaning upon her lap , asked her if she would not take him up , and rock him a little .
she could not help pitying him , he looked so feeble and sad ; and she accordingly laid down her work , and lifted him up ,  he was not heavy .
" well <name> , you have not asked me to take you up , and tell you a story so , for a long time .
this is the way i used to do when you were quite a little boy ; only then you used to kneel in my lap , and lay your head upon my shoulder , so that my mouth was close to your ear .
but you are too big now . "
<name> smiled a little , for he was glad to find that he was growing big ; but it was rather a faint and sad smile .
" but i do n't grow any stronger , grandmother , " said he .
" i wish i was well and strong , like the other boys . "
" you do n't know what would be best for you , my little <name> .
god leads you along in his own way through life , and you must go patiently and pleasantly on , just where he thinks best .
you are like blind <name> , going through the woods with his father . "
" how was that , grandmother ? "
said he , sitting up , and turning round to look at her .
" you sit still , " said she , gently laying him back again , " and i <name> tell you . "
" <name> was a blind boy .
he had been away , and was now going home with his father .
his father led him , and he walked along by his side .
presently , they came to a large <name> , and , before they got near it , they heard it roaring .
his father said , <unk> , i think there is a freshet . '
'i think so too , ' said <name> , 'for i hear the water roaring . '
when they came in sight of the stream , his father said , 'yes , <name> , there has been a great freshet , and the bridge is carried away . '
'and what shall we do now ? '
said <name> .
'why we must go round by the path through the woods . '
'that <name> be bad for me , ' said <name> 'but i <name> lead you , ' said his father , 'all the way ; just trust every thing to me . '
'yes , father , ' said <name> , 'i <name> . '
" so his father took a string out of his pocket , and gave one end of it to <name> .
'there , <name> , ' said he , 'take hold of that , and that <name> guide you ; and walk directly after me . ' "
" how long was the string ? "
said <name> .
" o not very long , " replied madam <name> ; " so as just to let him walk a step or two behind . "
" after he had walked on a short distance , he said , <unk> , i wish you would let me take hold of your hand . '
'but you said , ' replied his father , 'that you would trust every thing to me . '
'so i <name> , father , ' said <name> ; 'but i do wish you would let me take hold of your hand , instead of this string . '
'very well , ' said his father , 'you may try your way . '
" so <name> came and took hold of his father 's hand , and tried to walk along by his father 's side .
but the path was narrow ; there was not more than room for one , and though his father walked as far on one side as possible , yet <name> had not room enough .
the branches scratched his face , and he stumbled continually upon roots and stones .
at length he said , <unk> , you know best .
i <name> take hold of the string , and walk behind . '
" so , after that , he was patient and submissive , and followed his father wherever he led .
after a time his father saw a serpent in the road directly before them .
so he turned aside , to go round by a compass in the woods . "
" a compass ? "
said <name> .
" yes , " said his grandmother ; " that is a <unk> way .
but it was very rough and stony .
presently , <name> stopped and said , <unk> , it seems to me it is pretty stony ; have n't we got out of the path ? '
" 'yes , ' said his father ; 'but you promised to be patient and submissive , and trust every thing to me . '
" 'well , ' said <name> , 'you know best , and i <name> follow . '
" so he walked on again .
when they had got by , his father told him that the reason why he had gone out of the road was , that there was a serpent there .
and so , when god leads us in a difficult way , <name> , that we do n't understand at the time , we often see the reason of it afterwards . "
<name> did not answer , and madam <name> went on with her story .
" by and by , his father came within the sound of the <name> again , and stopped a minute or two , and then he told <name> that he should have to leave him a short time , and that he might sit down upon a log , and wait until he came back .
'but , father , ' said <name> , 'i do n't want to be left alone here in the woods , in the dark . '
'it is not dark , ' said his father .
'it is all dark to me , ' said <name> .
'i know it is , ' said his father , 'and i am very sorry ; but you promised to leave every thing to me , and be obedient and submissive . '
'so i <name> , father ; you know best , and i <name> do just as you say . '
so <name> sat down upon the log , and his father went away .
he was a little terrified by the solitude , and the darkness , and the roaring of the water ; but he trusted to his father , and was still .
" by and by , he heard a noise as of something heavy falling into the water .
he was frightened , for he thought it was his father .
but it was not his father .
what do you think it was , <name> ? "
<name> did not answer .
madam <name> looked down to see why he did not speak , and as she moved him a little , so as to see his face , his head rolled over to one side ; and , in short , madam <name> found that he was fast asleep .
" poor little fellow ! "
said she ; and she rose carefully , and carried him to the bed , and laid him down .
he opened his eyes a moment , when his cheek came in contact with the cool pillow , but turned his face over immediately , shut his eyes again , and was soon in a sound sleep .
chapter <name> .
engineering .
when <name> awoke it was almost evening .
the rays of the setting sun were shining in at the window .
<name> opened his eyes , and , after lying still a few moments , began to sing .
he thought it was morning , and that it was time for him to get up .
presently , however , he observed that the sun was shining in at the wrong window for morning : then he noticed that he was not undressed ; and , finally , he thought it must be night ; but he could not think how he came to be asleep there at that time .
<name> went out into the parlour .
<name> and <name> were just putting the chairs around the tea table .
at tea time , the boys talked a good deal about the mole , and they asked <name> <name> if she would help them rig some vessels to sail in the <unk> .
" sail in the <unk> ! "
said <name> <name> ; " whoever heard of sailing in the <unk> ?
that is a great whirlpool , which swallows up ships ; they never sail in it .
you had better call it the gulf stream . "
" well , " said <name> , " we <name> ; and <name> you help us rig some vessels ? "
" yes , " said <name> <name> , " when you get the mole done . "
<name> <name> was a beautiful girl , about seventeen years old , with a mild and gentle expression of countenance , and very pleasant tone of voice .
she helped the children in all their plays , and they were always pleased when she was with them .
she had great stores of pasteboard and coloured papers , to make boxes , and <unk> , and little <unk> , and <unk> of ; and she had a <unk> , and pencils , and <unk> , and <unk> of pictures and drawing lessons .
she rigged the boys ' vessels , and covered their balls , and made them beautiful flags and banners out of her pieces of coloured silk .
she advised them to have a flag-staff out at the end of the mole , as they generally have on all fortifications and national works .
she told them she would make them a handsome flag for the purpose .
after tea she went down with them to see the works .
she seemed to like the mole very much .
the whirlpool was moving very regularly , and she advised them to build the mole out pretty far .
" yes , " said <name> ; " and we are going to have a piece across up and down the stream , at the end of it , so as to make a t of it . "
" i think you had better make a y of it , " said <name> <name> .
" a y ! "
said <name> , " how ? "
" why instead of having the end piece go straight across the end of the mole , let the two parts of it branch out into the stream , one upwards and the other down . "
" what good <name> that do ? "
said <name> .
" why , if you make it straight like a t , the current <name> run directly along the outer edge of it , and so your vessels <name> not stay there .
but if you have it <unk> , there <name> be a little sort of harbour in the crotch , where your vessels can lie quietly , while the current flows along by , out beyond the forks . "
" that <name> be excellent , " said <name> , clapping his hands .
" and besides , " said she , " the upper part of the y <name> run out obliquely into the stream , and so turn more of the current into your <name> , and make the whirlpool larger . "
" well , and we <name> make it so , " said <name> ; " and then it <name> be an excellent mole . "
" yes , " said <name> <name> , " there <name> be all sorts of water around it ;  a whirlpool above , a little harbour in the crotch , a current in front , and still water below .
it <name> be as good a place for sailing boats as i ever saw . "
but the twilight was coming on , and they all soon returned to the house .
madam <name> had a little <unk> , as it was called , where she slept .
it was called a <unk> , because it consisted , in fact , of two small rooms , with a large arched opening between them , without any door .
in one room was the bed , which moved in and out on little trucks , for <name> .
in the other room was a table in the middle , with books and papers upon it .
there was a window in one side , and opposite the arched opening which led to the bedroom was a small sofa .
now , it was madam <name> 's custom every evening , before the children went to bed , to take them into her bedroom , and hear them read a few verses of the bible ; and then she would explain the verses , and talk with them a little about what had occurred during the day , and give them good advice and good instruction .
at such times the children usually sat upon the sofa , on one side of the table , and madam <name> took her seat on the other side of the table , in the chair , so as to face them .
the children generally liked this very much ; and yet she very seldom told them any stories at these times .
it was almost all reasonings and explanations ; and yet the children liked it very much .
chapter vii .
the sofa .
the boys took their places on the sofa , and afterwards laid their books upon the table .
after that madam <name> began to talk about the occurrences of the day , as follows :  " there are two or three things , boys , that i have been keeping to talk with you about this evening .
one is the question you asked , <name> , about <name> 's disobeying me , when he fell into the water . "
" yes , mother , " said <name> , looking up at once , very eagerly ; " you told him never to go near the bank ; and yet he went , and so he fell in . "
" but i could not help it , " said <name> .
" why , yes , mother , he certainly could help it ; for he walked there himself of his own accord . "
" very well ; that is the question for us to consider ; but , first , we must all be in a proper state of mind to consider it , or else it <name> do us no good .
now , <name> , i am going to ask you a question , and i want to have you answer it honestly :  which way do you wish to have this question , about <name> 's disobedience , decided ? "
" why ,  i do n't know , " said <name> .
" suppose i should come to the conclusion that <name> did right , and should prove it by arguments , should you feel a little glad , or a little sorry ? "
<name> <name> his head , and seemed somewhat confused , but said , doubtfully , that he did not know .
" now , i think , myself , " said his mother , " that you have a secret wish to have it appear that <name> is guilty of disobedience .
you said he disobeyed , at first , from unkind feelings , which you seemed to feel towards him at the moment ; and now , i suppose , you wish to adhere to it , so as to get the victory .
now , honestly , is n't it so ? "
<name> did not answer at first .
he looked somewhat ashamed .
presently , however , he concluded , that it was best to be <name> and honest ; so he looked up and acknowledged that it was so .
" yes , " said his mother ; " and while you are under the influence of such a prejudice , it would do no good for us to discuss the subject , for you would not be convinced ; so you had better give it up . "
madam <name> saw , while she was speaking , that <name> did not look sullen and dissatisfied , but good-natured and pleasant ; and so she knew that he had concluded to listen , candidly , to what she had to say .
" i think that <name> was not to blame at all , " said madam <name> , " for two reasons .
one is , that he was probably overwhelmed with terror .
to be sure , as you say , the cow did not push him .
he walked himself ,  yet still he was impelled as strongly as if he had been pushed , though in a different manner . "
" then there is another reason why <name> is innocent of any disobedience .
when i told him that he must not go to the high banks , i did not mean that he never must go , in any case whatever . "
" i thought you said he never must , " said <name> .
" i presume i did say so , and i made no exceptions ; but still some exceptions are always implied in such a case .
in all commands , however positive they may be , there is always some exception implied . "
" why , mother ? "
said <name> with surprise .
" it is so , " said his mother .
" suppose , for instance , that i were to tell you to sit down by the parlour fire , and study a lesson , and not to get out of your chair on any account .
and suppose that , after i had gone and left you , the fire should fall down , and some coals roll out upon the floor , would it not be your duty to get up , and brush them back ? "
" why , yes , " said <name> .
" so in all cases , very extreme and extraordinary occurrences , that could not , by possibility , have been considered , make exceptions .
and <name> , thinking , as he did , that he was in great danger from the cow , if he had thought of my command at all , he would have done perfectly right to have considered so extraordinary a case an exception , and so have retreated towards the <name> , notwithstanding my commands .
and now that question is settled . "
here little <name> , who had been sitting up very straight , and looking eagerly at his grandmother and at the other boys , during the progress of the conversation , <name> a long breath , and leaned back against the sofa , as if he felt a good deal relieved .
" and now , <name> , there is one thing i have seen in you to-day , which gave me a great deal of pleasure , and another which gave me pain . "
" what , mother , " said <name> .
" why , after i talked with you at noon , about teasing <name> , you began to treat him very kindly .
that gave me a great deal of pleasure .
i saw that your heart was somewhat changed in regard to <name> ; for you seemed to take pleasure in making him happy , while before you took delight in making him miserable . "
<name> looked gratified and pleased while his mother was saying these things .
" but then , in the course of the afternoon , " she continued , " the old malignant heart seemed to come back again .
when i came down to see the mole , i found you in such a state of mind as to take pleasure in <unk> suffering .
you wanted to prove that he had told a lie , and looked disappointed when i shewed you that he had not .
then you wanted to prove he had disobeyed me , when , after all , you knew very well that he had not . "
" o , mother , " said <name> .
" yes , <name> , i am very sorry to have to say so ; but you undoubtedly had no real belief that <name> had done wrong .
suppose i had told you i was going to punish him for disobeying me in retreating to the <name> , should you have thought that it would have been right ? "
" why , no , mother , " said <name> .
" you would have been shocked at such an idea .
and now do n't you see that all your attempts to prove that he had done wrong , was only the effect of the ill-will you felt towards him at the time .
it was malice <unk> over your judgment and your sense of right and wrong .
i told you , you know , that your resolutions would not reach the case . "
" well , mother , i am determined , " said <name> , very <unk> and positively , " that i never <name> tease or trouble <name> any more . "
" the evil is not so much in teasing and troubling <name> , as in having a heart capable of taking any pleasure in it .
that is the great difficulty . "
" well , mother , i am determined i never <name> feel any pleasure in his trouble again . "
" i am afraid that wo n't depend altogether upon the determination you make .
for instance , when you went to <name> to-day , and kindly tried to persuade him to go down , and offered to <name> his rocking-chair for him , your heart was then in a state of love towards him .
do you think you could then , by determination , have changed it from love to hate , and begun to take pleasure in teasing him ? "
<name> remembered how kindly and pleasantly he had felt towards <name> at that time , and he thought that it would have been impossible for him then to have found any pleasure in tormenting him ; and so he said , " no , mother , i could not . "
" and so , when you are angry with a person , and your heart is in a state of ill-will and malice towards him , does it seem to you that you can merely by a determination change it all at once , and begin to be filled with love , so as to feel pleasure in his happiness ? "
<name> was silent at first ; he presently answered , faintly , that he could not .
" and if you can not change your heart by your mere determination at the time , you certainly can not by making one general determination , now beforehand , for all time to come . "
<name> saw his helpless condition , and sighed .
after a pause , he said , " mother , it seems to me you are discouraging me from trying to be a better boy . "
" no , <name> ; but i do n't want you to depend on false hopes that must only end in your disappointment .
your determination <name> help in not indulging the bad feelings ; but i want to have your heart changed so that you could not possibly have such feelings .
i <name> mine is .
i once shewed the same spirit that you do ; but now i do n't think it would be possible for me to take any pleasure in teasing <name> , or you , or <name> .
" i <name> , " added madam <name> , " that god <name> give you a benevolent and tender heart , so that there shall be no tendency in you to do wrong .
he <name> change yours , if you pray to him to do it .
in fact , i <name> , and sometimes i almost believe , that he has begun .
i do not think you would have gone to <name> to-day so pleasantly , and acknowledged your fault , as you did by your actions , and felt so totally different from what you had done , if god had not wrought some change in you .
i have very often talked with children about such faults , as plainly and kindly as i did with you , and it produced no effect .
when they went away , i found , by their looks and actions afterwards , that their hearts were not changed at all .
and so , <name> , " said she , " i have not been saying this to discourage you , but to make you feel that you need a greater change than you can accomplish , and so to lead you to god that you may throw yourself upon him , and ask him , not merely to help you in your <unk> not to act out your bad feelings , but to change the very nature of them , or rather , to <name> on the change , which i <name> he has begun . "
<name> remembered , while his mother was talking , how full his heart had been of kindness and love to <name> , while he was helping him that afternoon , and he perceived clearly that he had not produced that state of mind by any of his own <unk> that he would feel so before he actually did .
he remembered how happy he had been at that time , and how discontented and miserable after he had been troubling <name> ; and he had a feeling of strong <name> that god would change his heart , and make him altogether and always benevolent and kind .
now , it happened that <name> had not understood this conversation very well , and he began to be weary and uneasy .
besides just about this time he began to recollect something about his grandmother 's beginning a story for him , when she took him up in her lap , after he came in from the mole .
so , when he noticed that there was a pause in the conversation , he said , " grandmother , you promised to tell me a story about blind <name> . "
" so i did , " said his grandmother smiling , " and i began it ; but before i got through you got fast asleep . "
<name> and <name> laughed , and so in fact did <name> ; and madam <name> then said that if he would tell <name> and <name> the story as far as she had gone , she would finish it .
" well , " said <name> , " i <name> .
once there was a blind boy , and his name was <name> ; and , you see , he was going through the woods , and his father was with him .
and his father walked along , and he walked along , and it was stony , and he said he would do just what his father said , because his father knew best ,  and  and so he took hold of the string again . "
" what string ? "
said <name> .
" why , it was his father 's string , " said <name> , eagerly , looking up into <name> 's face .
" what did he have a string for ? "
said <name> .
" why to lead him along by , " said <name> .
" yes  but why did not he take hold of his father 's hand ? "
asked <name> .
" why ,  why ,  there was a snake in the road , i believe ,  was n't there , grandmother ? "
his grandmother smiled ,  for <name> had evidently got bewildered , in his drowsiness , so that he had not a very distinct recollection of the story .
she , therefore , began again , and told the whole .
when she got to the place where she left off before , that is , to the place <name> heard a splash in the water , <name> started up , and asked , eagerly , " what was it ? "
" a stone , i suppose , " said <name> , coolly .
" no , " said madam <name> , " it was only the end of the stem of a small tree , which <name> 's father was trying to fix across the <name> , so that he could lead his blind boy over .
it was lying upon the ground , and he took it and raised it upon its end , near the edge of the bank , on one side , and then let it fall over , in hopes that the other end would fall upon the opposite bank .
but it did not happen to fall straight across , and so the end fell into the water , and this was the noise that <name> heard .
" he <name> the stick back again , and then contrived to raise it on its end once more ; and this time he was more successful .
it fell across , and so extended from bank to bank .
in a few minutes he succeeded in getting another by its side , and then he came back to <name> .
" <unk> , ' said he , 'i have built a bridge . '
" 'a bridge ! '
said <name> .
" 'yes , ' said he , 'a sort of a bridge ; and now i am going to try to lead you over . '
" 'but , father , i am afraid . '
" 'you said you would trust yourself entirely to me , and go wherever i should say . '
" 'well , father , ' said <name> , 'i <name> .
you know best , after all . '
" so <name> took hold of his father 's hand , and , with slow , and very careful steps , he got over the roaring torrent , and then they soon came out into a broad smooth road , and so got safely home . "
" now , <name> , " continued madam <name> , after she had finished her story , " do you remember what i meant to teach you by this story ? "
" yes , grandmother ; you said that i was like blind <name> , and that god knew what was best for me , and that i must let him lead me wherever he pleases . "
" yes ; and what was it that you said that reminded me to tell you the story ? "
" i said that i wished that i was well and strong , like the other boys . "
" yes , " said his grandmother , " i do not think you said it in a fretful or impatient spirit ; but i thought that this story of <name> would help to keep you patient and contented . "
" yes , grandmother , it does , " said <name> .
chapter viii .
the cart ride .
a week after this , <name> had his whip to mend .
he had broken off the lash , by whipping in sticks and little pieces of drift-wood to the mole .
<name> and <name> worked a little every day upon the mole , and had carried it out pretty far into the stream , and had almost finished the lower branches of the y .
so , one morning , after the boys had gone to school , and <name> had had his reading lesson , he sat down upon the steps of the door , behind the house , and began to tie on his lash with a piece of twine which <name> <name> had given him .
behind the house where <name> 's grandmother lived , there was a <name> which led to the pasture .
at the head of the <name> , where you entered it from the yard , were a pair of bars .
while <name> was mending his whip , he accidentally looked up , and noticed that the bars were down .
" there , mr. <name> , " said <name> , talking to himself , as he went on winding his twine round and round the <unk> ; " for once in your life , you have been careless .
you have left your bars down .
now we shall have the cattle all let out , unless i go and stop the mischief . "
<name> thought he would go and put the bars up again , as soon as he had tied the ends of his twine ; but before he got quite ready , he heard a noise , as of something coming in the <name> .
he could not see down the <name> far , from the place where he sat , for the barn was in the way .
but he wondered what could be coming , and he looked towards the bars , and sat waiting for it to appear .
in a moment , the head and horns of a great ox came into view , and , immediately after , the body of the ox himself , walking slowly along towards the bars .
" there now , " said <name> , " there comes lion , and he 'll get away . "
so he jumped up , and ran towards the ox a few steps , brandishing his whip , and shouting out to drive him back .
old lion , however , seemed to pay no attention , but came steadily forward , stepping carefully over the ends of the bars , and then , advancing a little way into the yard , began quietly to feed upon the grass .
before <name> got over his surprise at the entire indifference which old lion seemed to feel towards him and his whip , he heard the bars rattling again , and looking there , he saw <name> , lion 's mate , following on .
" o dear me , " said <name> , " what shall i do ?
all our oxen are getting away .
i 'll run and call <name> . "
so he began to shout out " <name> , " as loud as he could call ; and immediately afterwards , he heard <name> 's voice answering just down the <name> and , looking that way , he saw him coming over the bars himself , as if he had been following the oxen along up the <name> .
" <name> , <name> , " he cried out , " come quiet ; all your oxen are getting away . "
" o , no , " said <name> , quietly , as he was putting up the bars after the oxen , " they can not get away  i have fastened the outer gate . "
then <name> looked around and observed that the outer gate was fastened , so that they could not get out of the yard .
" o , very well , " said he .
" i did not know you were driving them up ; " and so he quietly returned to his seat , and went on playing with his whip .
<name> , in the mean time , proceeded to yoke up the cattle .
" <name> , " said <name> , at length , " where are you going with the cattle ? "
" out into the woods , " said <name> .
" what are you going to do in the woods ? "
said <name> .
" i am going to make a piece of fence . "
" may i go with you ? "
" i do n't think you can help me much about the fence , " said <name> .
" i can pull bushes along , " said <name> .
<name> made no reply , but began to drive the oxen towards a cart that was standing in a corner of the yard , and , after a few minutes , <name> renewed his request .
" <name> , i wish you would let me go with you . "
" well  it is just as your grandmother says , " replied <name> .
so <name> ran to ask his grandmother ; and she came to the window , and enquired of <name> how long he expected to be gone .
he said it would take him more than half a day to make the piece of fence , and he was going to take his dinner with him .
this was an objection to <unk> going ; but yet his grandmother concluded on the whole to consent .
so they put up some bread and butter , and some apples , with <unk> dinner , for <name> .
these things were all put in paper parcels , and the parcels put into a bag , which was thrown into the bottom of the cart .
then <name> wanted to take his hatchet .
his grandmother thought it would not be safe .
" i 'll be very careful , " said he : " and if i do n't have my hatchet , how can i help to make the fence ? "
<name> smiled , and madam <name> seemed at a loss to know what to say .
" it wo n't do ,  <name> it <name> ? "
said she .
" he might cut himself , " said <name> .
" but there is a small key-hole saw in the barn , that i filed up the other day .
perhaps he might have that , to saw the bushes down with . "
" can you saw , <name> ? "
said his grandmother .
" not very well , " said <name> , looking somewhat disappointed ; " the saw sticks so . "
" i can set it pretty rank , " said <name> , speaking to madam <name> at the window , " and then , i think , he can make it run smooth . "
madam <name> did not understand what <name> meant by setting it rank , and so she said , " how <name> that help it , <name> ? "
" why , then it <name> cut a wide <unk> , " said <name> , " and so the back <name> follow in easily . "
she did not understand from this much better than she did before ; but , as she had great confidence in <name> , she concluded to let him manage in his own way .
she accordingly told him that he might fix the saw , and take <name> with him .
so <name> went out into the barn , and took down the saw from a nail .
the teeth looked bright and sharp .
" why , <name> , how sharp it looks .
and the teeth are of different shape from what they were before . "
" yes , " said <name> , " i have made a cutting saw of it . "
" a cutting saw ? "
said <name> .
" can you cut with a saw ?
i thought they always sawed with a saw . "
" i mean , cut across the grain , " said <name> , smiling .
" when a saw is filed so as to saw along the board , then it is called a splitting saw ; but when it is to saw across the board , then i call it a cutting saw . "
<name> looked carefully at the teeth , so as to see how the teeth of a cutting saw were shaped .
and while he looked on , he observed that <name> had a little instrument in his hand , and he took hold of the first tooth of the saw with it , and bent it over a little to one side , and then he took hold of the next one , and bent it over to the other side ; and so he went on , bending them alternately to the right and left , until he passed along from one end of the saw to the other .
" there , " said he , " that is set pretty rank . "
" what do you mean by that ? "
said <name> , as he followed <name> out of the barn .
" why , the teeth are set off , a good way , each side , and it <name> cut a good wide <unk> ; and so your saw <name> run easy . "
by this time they had reached the cart .
<name> took hold of <name> under the arms , and jumped him up into the cart behind , and then handed him his saw .
then he put in an axe and an iron bar for himself , and one or two spare chains ; and then he went to open the great gate .
just at this moment , <name> <name> appeared at the window , and said , " <name> , are you going into the woods ? "
" yes , " said <name> .
" then , if you see any good , smooth birch bark , wo n't you bring me home some ! "
" i <name> , " said <name> ; and then <name> opened the gate , and started the oxen on .
<name> stood up in front , holding on by a stake , and wondering all the while what <name> could mean by a <unk> .
one would think that he might have known by the connection in which <name> used it ,  for he said that he had bent the teeth out so as to make the saw cut a good wide <unk> , and so he might have supposed that the <unk> was the cut in the wood which a saw makes in going in .
the reason why boys find it so difficult to saw , is because the teeth do not generally spread very much , and so the <unk> is narrow .
still , the back of the saw would run in it well enough , without sticking , if they were to saw perfectly straight .
but they generally make the saw twist or wind a little , and then the back of the saw rubs upon one side or the other ; and sticks .
now , <name> 's plan was to make the teeth set off , each side , so far as to make the <unk> very wide , and then he thought that <name> would be able to make it go , especially as the saw was very narrow .
<name> got into the cart , and took his seat upon a board which passed across from side to side , and they rode along .
they reached , at length , a place where there was a small cart path leading off from the main road into the woods .
<name> turned off into this path ; but it was so narrow that both he and <name> had sometimes to <name> away to one side or the other to avoid the bushes .
at length he stopped and unfastened the oxen from the tongue .
when all was right he started the oxen on before him , <name> trotting on behind with his saw in his hand .
presently they struck off from the cart path directly into the woods , and in a few minutes came to the place where the fence was to be made .
chapter ix .
the fire .
<name> let the cattle browse about , while he went to work , cutting down some small , but yet pretty tall and bushy trees .
he then brought up the team , and hooked a long chain into the ring which <name> down from the middle of the yoke , upon the under side .
the end of the chain trailed upon the ground , as the oxen came along , and <name> was very much interested to see how they would trample along , any where , among the rocks , roots , mire , logs , bushes , stumps , and , in fact , over and through almost any thing , chewing their cud all the time , patient and unconcerned .
when they were brought up near to one of the trees that had been cut down , <name> would hook the chain around the butt end of it , and then , at his command , they would drag it out of its place in the line of the fence .
after looking on for some time , <name> began to think that he would go to work ; and he went to a little tree , with a stem about as big round as his arm , and began to saw away upon it .
he found that the saw would run very well indeed ; and in a short time , he got the tree off , and then undertook to drag it to the fence .
<name> was always a very silent man ; he seldom spoke , unless to answer a question ; and while <name> had been watching him , when he first began to work , instead of talking with <name> , as <name> would have desired , he was all the time singing , " do , re , <name> , <unk> , <name> , la , si , do . "
the truth was , that <name> had just begun to go to a singing school , and he was taking this opportunity to rise and fall the notes , as he called it .
when <name> asked him any question about his work , he would just answer it in a few words , and then , a minute after , begin again with his <unk> , re , <name> , ' and all the rest .
<name> became tired of this singing ; and when , at length , his tree got wedged fast , so that he could not move it any farther , he sat down discouraged upon a log , and looked anxiously towards <name> , as if he wished that he would come and help him .
<name> had just hooked his chain to another tree , and taking up his goad stick , called out , " <name> ' , <name> !
<name> ' , lion ! "
and then as his oxen started on , he followed them with his  " do , re , <name> , <unk> , <name> , la , si , do . "
" dear me ! "
said <name> , with a deep sigh .
" do , si , la , <name> , <unk> , <name> , re , do , " sang <name> , coming down the scale .
<name> got up , and walked along towards <name> a little way , and called out , " <name> ? "
" what ? "
said <name> .
" when do you think you shall be done singing that tune ? "
<name> smiled , and asked " why ? "
" why , " said <name> , in rather a timid voice , " i do n't think it is a very pretty tune . "
" do n't you ? "
said <name> .
" well , i do n't admire it much myself . "
" then what do you sing it so much , for , <name> ? "
" o , that 's my lesson , " said <name> , " but how does your saw do , <name> ? "
" very well ; only i ca n't get my tree along . "
" where do you want to get it ? "
" o , out to the fence , " said <name> .
" you had better not try to make a fence .
you had better build a fire . "
" but i have not got any fire to light it with ? "
" yes , " said <name> , " i brought a <unk> , because i thought you would want a fire ; and i forgot to give it to you . "
so <name> pointed to a place among some rocks off at a little distance before him , near the line in which he was coming along with his fence , and advised <name> to make a fire there .
<name> liked this plan very much .
he said he would play " camp out , " and so build a camp , and have a fire before the camp .
<name> told him that so soon as he should get his pile of sticks ready , he would come and strike fire for him .
<name> went to the place and began to work .
he cut down bushes , and placed them up against the rocks , in such a manner as to make a little hut which he should get into .
he then collected a pile of sticks in front of it .
first , he picked up all the dry sticks he could find near , and then he sawed off branches from the old dead trees which were lying around in the forest .
in an hour , with <name> 's help in lighting his fire , <name> had a very good camp .
his hut was quite a comfortable one , with a blazing fire near it , and three large apples roasting before the fire .
by and by , <name> saw <name> coming towards him , with the bag over his arm .
he opened it , and took out one parcel after another , and then laying the mouth of the bag down upon the ground , he took hold of the bottom of it , and raised it in the air ; while <name> watched to see what was coming out .
it proved to be potatoes ; and <name> told <name> he might roast them in his fire .
" cover them up well with hot ashes and coals , <name> , and then build a fire upon the top . "
so <name> dug out the bottom of his fire with a pole ;  for the fire had pretty much burnt down to ashes ;  and he put the potatoes in .
there were five of them .
<name> helped him to cover them up , and then he put more sticks upon the top .
when that was done , and just as he was going back to his work , <name> said , " see there , <name> ;  there is a fine chimney for you to burn out . "
<name> looked where <name> pointed , and saw a very tall and large hollow tree , or rather trunk of a tree ,  for the top had long since decayed and dropped away .
there it stood , desolate , with a great hole in the side near the bottom , and the bark hanging loosely about it all the way up to the top .
the boys always liked to find such hollow trees in the woods , to build fires in ; they called it " burning out a chimney . "
" now , " said <name> , " all you have got to do is to go to work while your potatoes are roasting , and fill up that old hollow tree at the bottom with sticks and brush , and old pieces of bark .
pack them in close ; then , when i come to dinner , i <name> help you to light it . "
<name> then went back to the fence , and <name> began his work as <name> had directed .
he got all the dried branches that he could find , and carried them to the foot of the tree .
others he sawed ; and he packed all the pieces in the hollow of the tree as closely as he could .
by this time <name> saw <name> coming along towards the camp , and he went there to meet him .
they raked open the fire , and took out the potatoes .
<name> turned a stone upon its edge , towards the fire , so as to keep them warm .
he also cut some square pieces of birch bark from a neighbouring tree , for plates , and gave one to <name> , and took one himself , and then they both sat down upon a smooth log which <name> <name> up to the fire , and took their birch bark plates in their lap .
<name> took a little paper of salt out of his pocket , and poured the salt out upon another square piece of birch bark , which he placed upon a stone between himself and <name> , so that both could reach it .
" what shall i do for a spoon ? "
said <name> .
" o , you do n't need a spoon , " said <name> ; and he took up a <unk> himself , broke it in two , sprinkled some salt upon it , and began to eat it as a boy would eat an apple .
" o , i ca n't eat my potatoes so , " said <name> .
" why not , " said <name> , putting a little more salt upon his own <unk> .
" it is too hot , " said <name> .
" then you must wait until it cools . "
" but i want a spoon very much , " said <name> .
" well , " said <name> , " i <name> make you one . "
so <name> took out his knife and cut off a piece from a dry pine branch , which lay near him .
he split this so as to get a flat piece out of it , which he fashioned into a rude sort of spoon , that answered <name> 's purpose very well .
but before <name> had much more than begun his dinner , <name> had finished his , and , rising , said that he must go back to his work .
" but , first , i <name> set your chimney <unk> , " said he .
" no , " said <name> , " i want you to let me kindle it . "
" you ca n't . "
" yes , i can , " said <name> ; " i can get some birch bark . "
" very well ; only if i go away to my work now , you must not come and trouble me to come back again , because you ca n't get the fire a-going . "
" no , " said <name> , " i wo n't . "
so <name> went back to his work , and <name> finished his dinner .
at length , however , his potatoes and bread and butter were all gone , and his apple cores he had pretty thoroughly scraped with his wooden spoon , and thrown into the fire .
so he got up from his seat , and prepared to light his chimney .
he took his plate for a slow match .
it was pretty large and stiff , and he thought it would burn long enough for him to <name> it from the fire to his chimney .
he accordingly took hold of it by one corner , and held the other corner into the flame , which was curling up from a brand by the side of his fire .
but before the birch bark took fire , the flame of the brand went out , and then <name> looked around for another .
the fire had , however , burnt nearly down , so as to leave a great bed of embers , with the brands all around it , the burnt ends pointing inwards , <name> pushed some of these into the fire , and soon made a blaze again , and then once more attempted to set the corner of his plate on fire .
he succeeded .
the corner began to blaze and curl , and <name> rose and moved along carefully , lest the wind should blow it out .
this precaution was , however , scarcely necessary , for the little wind that his motion occasioned , only fanned the flame the more , and the part which was on fire curled round upon that which was not , and thus formed a round and solid mass , which burned fiercely .
<name> walked along , the bark blazing higher and higher , and curling in upon itself more and more , until , at length , he began to be afraid it would reach his fingers before he could get to his chimney .
he walked faster and faster , and presently began to run .
this fanned the fire the more , until , just as he came within a few steps of his chimney , the curling bark reached his fingers , and he tripped over a great root at the very instant when he was dropping the piece of bark from his hands .
he came down upon <unk> , and the bark which was now a compact roll , rolled down a little slope , crackling and blazing by the way .
<name> got up and looked at the blazing mass a minute or two , in despair ; but finding that it kept on burning , his eye suddenly brightened , and he said aloud , " i 'll poke it up . "
so he looked around for a stick .
he readily found one , and began to push the blazing roll up the <unk> ; but as fast as he pushed it up , it rolled down again , and all his efforts were consequently vain .
" o dear me ! "
said <name> , at length throwing down his stick , " what shall i do ? "
in the meantime the roll continued blazing , and <name> , looking at it steadily , observed that it was hollow .
" ah , " said he , " i 'll stick him . "
so he took up his stick again , and tried to thrust the end of the stick into the roll .
after one or two ineffectual attempts , he succeeded , though by this time the bark was pretty well burnt through , and was all ready to fall to pieces .
he , however , succeeded in raising it into the air , upon the end of his pole ; but before he got it to the hollow tree , it dropped off again in several blazing fragments , which continued to burn a moment upon the ground , and then went out entirely .
<name> then went to <name> , and told him that he could not make his fire burn .
" o you must not come to me , youngster ; you promised not to trouble me with it , " said <name> , as he hooked the chain around the <unk> of another tree .
" but i thought i could make it burn . "
" well , what 's the matter with it ?
but stand back , for i am going to start this tree along . "
" why the bark all curls up and burns my hand , " said <name> , retreating at the same time out of the way of the top of <name> 's tree .
the oxen started along , dragging the tree , and <name> followed , trying to get an opportunity to speak once more to <name> .
<name> , however , went calling aloud to his oxen , and directing them here and there with his " gee , <name> , " and his " <name> , lion , " and his " wo up , whoa " .
at length , however , he had the tree in its place , and seeing <name> standing at a little distance patiently , he asked him again , " what do you say is the matter with your fire , <name> ? "
" why , the birch bark curls up and burns me : i wish you would come and set it <unk> . "
" no , " said <name> , walking along by the side of his oxen ; " i must not leave my work to help you play ; but i <name> tell you three ways to <name> the fire , and you can manage it in one or the other of them . "
so saying , he took out his knife , and cut down a small , slender <name> , which was growing near him , and trimmed off the top and the few little branches which were growing near the top .
it made a slender pole about five feet long , with smooth but freckled bark , from end to end .
he then made a little split in one end .
" there , <name> , " said he , " take that , and stick a piece of birch bark in the split end ; then you can <name> it , and let it curl as much as it pleases .
or , if that fails , put a large piece of birch bark directly upon the fire .
then , as soon as it begins to burn , it <name> begin to curl , and then you must put the end of the stick down to it , in such a manner that the bark <name> curl over and grasp it , and then you can take it up and <name> the roll upon the end of your pole . "
" very well , " said <name> , " there are two ways . "
" there are two ways , " repeated <name> .
" now , if both these fail , you must put on a good many fresh sticks upon the fire , with one end of each of them out .
then , as soon as the ends which are in the fire have got burnt through , take up two of them by the ends that were out of the fire and lay them down at the foot of the hollow tree , close to the wood you have got together there .
then come back and get two more brands , and lay them down in the same way , and be careful to have the burnt ends all together .
so you must keep going back and forth , until you find that the brands are beginning to burn up freely in the new place . "
<name> took the <name> pole and went back to his fire .
he tore the <unk> in two , and this made two very good small strips of bark .
he pulled open the split end of his pole , and carefully inserted one of them , and then , holding it over a little flame which was rising from a burning brand , he set it on fire .
the bark was soon in a blaze , and it writhed and curled as if it were struggling to get away ; but it only clung to the end of the pole more closely ; and <name> , much pleased at the success of his experiment , waved it in the air , and shouted to <name> to look and see .
he then walked slowly along , stopping every moment to wave his great <unk> , and shout ; and so , when at last he reached the hollow tree , the bark was nearly burnt out , and the fragments were beginning to fall off from the end of the pole .
he then thrust it hastily under the heap of fuel , which had been collected in the tree ; but it was too late .
it flickered and smoked a minute or two , and finally went out altogether .
" i do n't care , " said <name> to himself , " for i have got the other half of the <unk> ; " and he went back for that .
it happened unluckily , however , this time , that , in pulling open the cleft which <name> had made in his <name> pole , he pulled too hard , and split one side off .
here was at once an end to all attempts to communicate fire to his chimney by this method .
so , after <unk> the split part of his stick to its place , once or twice , and finding that the idea of uniting it again was entirely out of the question , he threw the broken piece away , and said to himself that he must try <name> 's second plan .
he accordingly took the other large piece of bark , which was the one which <name> had used for his plate , and laid it upon the fire .
as soon as it began to curl , he laid the end of the stick close to it , on the side towards which it seemed to be bending ,  and in such a way that it curled over upon it , and soon clasped it tight , as <name> had predicted that it would do .
he then raised it in the air , and set out to run with it , so that it should not burn out before he reached the place .
but he ought not to have run .
it would have been far safer and better to have walked along carefully and slowly ; for as he ran on , jumping over logs and stones , and scrambling up and down the hummocks , the top of the pole , with the blazing roll of bark , was jerked violently about in the air , until , at length , as he was wheeling around a tree , he accidentally held the top of the pole so far that it wheeled round through the air very swiftly , and threw the birch bark off by the centrifugal force : and away it went , rolling along upon the ground .
the centrifugal force is that which makes any thing fly off when it is whirled round and round .
<name> did not understand this very well , but he was surprised to see his roll flying off in that manner .
he immediately took two sticks , and tried to take up the roll with them , as one would with a pair of tongs ; but he could not hold it with them .
" well , then , " said he , " i must try the third way . "
so he began to gather sticks , and put the ends of them upon the fire .
when they began to burn , he took up one ; but as soon as he got it off the fire , it began to go out , and he said that he knew that way to kindle a fire never would do .
in fact , he began to get out of <name> .
he threw down the stick , and went off again after <name> .
" <name> , " said he , " i cannot make my fire burn ; and i wish you would come and kindle it for me . "
" have you tried the ways i told you about ? "
" yes , " said <name> .
" have you tried all of them faithfully ? "
" all but the last , " said <name> , " and i know that wo n't do . "
" you must try them all , faithfully , or else i ca n't come . "
so saying , <name> went on with his work .
<name> went back a good deal out of humour with himself , and saying that he wished <name> was not so cross .
he took up two of the sticks , which were now pretty well on fire , and carried them along , swinging them by the way , to make fiery rings and serpents in the air .
when he reached the chimney , he threw them down carelessly , and stood watching them , to see if they were going to burn .
instead , however , of setting the other wood on fire , they only grew <unk> and <unk> themselves ; and he said to himself , " i knew they would not burn . "
then he sat down upon a log , in a sad state of <unk> and dissatisfaction .
however , after waiting a few minutes , longer , he went back to the fire , determined to bring all the brands there were , and put them down , though he knew , he said , that they would not burn .
he was going to do it , so that then he could go and tell <name> that he had tried all his plans , and that now he must come , and light the fire himself .
so he walked along , back and forth bringing the brands , and laying them down together near the foot of the heap of fuel in the tree .
but before he had brought them all , he found that they began to brighten up a little , and at length they broke out into a little flame .
he stood and watched it a few minutes .
it blazed up higher and higher .
he then put on some more wood which was near .
the flame crept up between these sticks , and soon began to snap and crackle among the brush in the tree .
<name> stepped back , and watched the flame a moment as it flashed up higher and higher , and then clapped his hands , jumped up on a log , and shouted out , " <name> , it 's <unk> , its <unk> . "
chapter x .
the captive .
when <name> heard <name> 's voice calling to him so loudly , he paused a moment from his work , and seeing that the fire had actually taken , in <name> , he told <name> that he must go back a little way , for <unk> the tree would fall .
so <name> went back to some distance , and asked <name> if that was far enough .
<name> said it was , and <name> then sat down upon a log , with his <name> pole in his hand , to watch the progress of the fire .
a dense smoke soon began to pour out of the top of the chimney .
the fire roared up through the hollow , and it caught outside too , under the bark , and soon enveloped the whole tree in smoke , sparks , and flame .
large pieces of the blazing bark detached themselves , from time to time , from the side of the tree , and came down , crackling and sparkling to the ground ; and the opening below where <name> had crammed in his fuel , soon glowed like the mouth of a furnace .
near the top of the tree was an old branch , or rather the stump of an old branch , decayed and blackened , reaching out a little way , like an arm .
this was soon enveloped in smoke ; and , as <name> was watching it , as it appeared and disappeared in the wreaths , he thought he saw something move .
he looked again , intently .
it was a squirrel ,  half suffocated in the smoke , and struggling to hold on .
<name> immediately called out to <name> as loud as he could call , " <name> , <name> , come here , quick : here is a poor squirrel burning up . "
<name> dropped his axe , and ran ,  bounding over the logs , and hummocks ; but before he reached the place , the squirrel , unable to hold on any longer , and half stifled with the smoke and scorching heat , dropped from his hold to the ground .
<name> came up at the moment , and seized him ; he brought him to where <name> was sitting ,  <name> himself eagerly coming forward to see .
" is it dead ? "
said <name> .
" pretty much , " said <name> .
the squirrel lay gasping helplessly in <name> 's hands .
" here , put him in my cap , " said <name> ; " that <name> make a good bed for him , and perhaps he <name> come to life again . "
<name> examined him pretty carefully , and he did not seem to be burnt .
he said he thought he must have been suffocated by breathing the smoke and hot air .
<name> then went back to his work , and <name> sat upon the log , watching alternately the squirrel and the burning tree .
in a few minutes a great flame flashed out at the top of the tree : and finally , after about half an hour , the whole trunk , being all in a blaze , from top to bottom , began slowly to bend and bend over .
" <name> , " shouted <name> ,  " <name> , look ;  it is going to fall ! "
the tall trunk moved at first slowly , but soon more and more rapidly , and finally came down to the ground with a crash .
the crash startled the little squirrel , so that he almost regained his feet ; and <name> was afraid that he was going to run away .
but he laid over again upon his side , and was soon quiet again as before .
not long after this , <name> finished his work , and prepared to go home .
he proposed to <name> that they should leave the squirrel there , upon the log ; but <name> was very desirous to <name> him home , because , he said , he could tame him , and give him to <name> <name> .
so <name> asked how they should contrive to <name> him .
<name> wanted to <name> him home in his cap ; but <name> said that he would take cold by riding home bare-headed .
" however , " said <name> , " perhaps i can contrive something . "
so he went after another piece of birch bark from the tree , about six inches wide , and two feet long , and rolled it over , bringing the two ends together , so as to make a sort of round box ,  only it was without top or bottom .
to keep it in shape he tied a string round it .
" but how are you going to keep him in ? "
asked <name> .
<name> said nothing , but he took a handkerchief out of his jacket pocket , and spread it out upon the ground , and put his birch bark box upon it .
he then laid the squirrel gently in upon the handkerchief , which thus served for a bottom .
next he <name> the corners of the handkerchief up over the top , and tied the opposite pairs of ends together .
thus the handkerchief served for top , bottom , and handle .
they soon reached the place where they had left the cart ; they got into it and rode on .
<name> held the squirrel in his lap , and of course , as there was nothing but the thin handkerchief for a bottom to the box , <name> felt the weight of the squirrel , pressing soft and warm upon his knees .
the squirrel lay very still until they got very near home , and then <name> began to feel a creeping sensation , as if he was beginning to move .
<name> was highly delighted to perceive these signs of returning life ; he held his knees perfectly still , that he might not disturb him , crying out , however , to <name> , " he 's moving , <name> ; he 's moving , he 's moving . "
chapter xi .
<name> <name> .
<name> and <name> reached home about the middle of the afternoon : and while <name> went into the yard to leave the cart and turn out the cattle , <name> pressed eagerly into the house , to shew his prize .
<name> <name> , or <name> , as they generally called her , came to meet him to see what he had got in his hand .
" is that my birch bark ? "
said she .
" there !
i forgot your birch bark , " said <unk>  " but i have got something here a great deal better . "
and so saying he put his handkerchief down , and began very eagerly to untie the knots .
when he had got two of the ends untied , and was at work upon the other two , out leaped the squirrel , and ran across the room .
<name> <name> , startled by the sudden appearance of the animal , ran off to the door , and <name> called out in great distress , " o dear !
o dear !
what shall i do ?
he 'll get away .
shut the door , <name> <name> ,  shut the door , quick !
call <name> ; call <name> . "
<name> <name> , at first , retreated outside of the door , and stood there a moment , peeping in .
finding , however , that the squirrel remained very quiet in a corner of the room , she returned softly , and went round , and shut all the doors and windows , and then <name> went and called <name> .
the squirrel had by no means yet got over his accident , and he allowed himself to be easily <unk> and secured .
<name> contrived to fasten him into a box , so as to keep him safe , until next morning ; and by that time they thought , if he should then seem likely to get well , they could determine what it was best to do with him .
while <name> was coming home , there had been a strange mixture of delight and uneasiness in his feelings .
the delight was occasioned by the possession of the squirrel .
that was obvious enough .
the uneasiness he did not think about very distinctly , and did not notice what the cause of it was .
boys very often feel a sort of uneasiness of mind ,  they do not know exactly how or why ,  and they have this feeling mingling sometimes strangely with their very enjoyment , in their hours of gaiety and glee .
now the real reason of this unquiet state of mind , in <name> 's case , was that his conscience had been disturbed by his feelings of vexation and impatience , towards <name> , for not leaving his work , to come and kindle his fire .
he had not yielded to these feelings .
he had restrained them , and had stood still , and spoken respectfully to <name> , all the time .
in fact , he was hardly aware that he had done any thing wrong , at all .
but still , for a moment , selfish passions had had possession of his heart , and whenever they get possession , even if they are kept in subjection , so as not to lead to any bad actions or words , and even if they are soon driven away by new thoughts , as <name> 's were , by the sight of his blazing fire ,  still , they always leave more or less of misery behind .
so <name> , as he was going home , had his heart filled with delight at the thoughts of the squirrel resting warmly in his lap ; and he was also a prey , in some degree , to a gnawing uneasiness , which he could not understand , but which was really caused by a sting which sin had left there .
and yet <name> came home with an idea that he had been a very good boy .
so , after they had got tired of looking at the squirrel , and <name> <name> had taken her seat at her work by the window , with her little <unk> before her , <name> came up to her , and kneeling upon her cricket , and putting his arms in her lap , he said , " well , aunt <name> , i have been a good boy all day to-day , and so i want you to make me a picture-book , this evening . "
<name> had a way of making <unk> that pleased children very much .
the way was this : she used to save all the old , worn-out picture books , and loose pictures , she could find , and put them carefully in one of her drawers , up stairs .
then she would make a small blank book , of white paper , and sew it through the back .
then she would cut out pictures enough from her old stores to fill the book , leaving the colours blank , because they were to be covered with some <unk> paper , for a title .
then she would paste the pictures in .
and here , when <name> <name> first began to make such books , an unexpected difficulty arose .
for , when paper is wet , it swells ; and then , when it dries again , though it shrinks a little , and does not shrink back quite into its original dimensions ,  that is , quite to the length and breadth that it had at first .
now , when <name> <name> pasted her pictures in the pages of the book , that part of the leaf which was under the picture was wet by the paste , and so it swelled , while the other part remained dry .
and when the picture came to dry , it did not shrink quite back again .
it remained swelled a little ; and this caused the <name> to look warped or puckered , so that the leaves did not lie smooth together .
at length she found out a way to remedy this difficulty entirely ; and this was , to wet the whole of the leaf , as well as that part that the picture was pasted to , and that made it all swell alike .
the way she managed the operation was this : after sewing the book , she would cut out a piece of morocco paper , or blue paper , or gilt paper , and sometimes a piece of morocco itself , just the size of the book when open , for the cover .
then , after spreading out a large newspaper upon the table , so as to keep the table clean , she would lay down the cover with the handsome side down , and then spread the paste over the other side , very carefully , with a brush which she made from the end of a quill .
then she would put the back edge of the book down upon this cover , and lay it over , first on one side , and then on the other , and <name> it down well with a towel ; and that would make the cover stick to the outside leaves of the book , and cover up and hide the great <unk> in the back , by which the leaves had been sewed together .
then she would take the book before her , and begin at the beginning .
first , she would lay down the cover and put upon it a piece of tin , made to fill papers with , to keep it down smooth .
then she would lay the next leaf down upon the tin .
the leaf was to have the title-page upon it , and so there were to be no pictures pasted to it .
she would , therefore , lay this down upon the tin , and then , with one of her large paint brushes , dipped in the water , she would wet it all over , patting it afterwards with a towel , to take up all the superfluous water .
then she would take up the tin , and put the <unk> down upon the cover , and put the tin over it to keep it down smooth .
the next leaf would be for pictures , and , after <unk> pictures upon it , on both sides , she would lay it down upon the tin , and with her brush she would wet all those parts which had not been pasted .
then patting it with a dry towel , or soft cloth , to dry it as much as possible , she would put it under the tin .
in this way she would go on regularly , through the book , <unk> pictures upon all the pages , and wetting with her brush all those parts of the paper which had not been wet by the paste , and putting the tin over the leaves as fast as she finished them , to keep them all smooth .
then , when she had got through , she would put the whole away between two boards , to dry ; the weight of the paper board being sufficient to keep the leaves all smooth .
the next morning when she came to look at her book , she generally found it nearly dry ; and then she would put some heavy weight upon the upper board , to press it harder .
when it was perfectly dry , she took out the book , and <unk> off the edges , all around , with a sharp knife and a rule .
then she would get her <unk> , and colour all the pictures beautifully , and make borders about them , in bright colours , and print a handsome title-page with her pen , and write the name of the boy in it whom she meant to give it to .
so <name> , when he came and told <name> <name> , what a good boy he had been , meant to have her make such a book as this .
" but sometimes boys are mistaken in thinking they have been good boys .
i should want to ask <name> . "
" he would say so , i know , " said <name> ; " for i certainly did not trouble him at all , all the day . "
" suppose you run and ask him . "
" well , " said <name> ; and away he ran .
" but stop , " said <name> <name> ; " you must not ask him by a leading question . "
" what is that ? "
said <name> .
" do n't you know ? "
said <name> <name> .
" no , " said <name> .
" o , that is very important for boys to know ; for they very often ask leading questions , when they ought not to .
now , if you go and say , <unk> , have n't i been a good boy to-day ? '
that way of asking the question shews that you want him to say , 'yes , you have . '
it is called a leading question , because it leads <name> to answer in a particular way .
now , if i should go and ask him thus , <unk> <name> been a good boy to-day ? '
with the emphasis on has , it would be a leading question the other way .
it would sound as if i wanted him to say you had not been a good boy . "
" how must i ask him , then ? "
said <name> .
" why you can say , <unk> , aunt <name> wants to know what sort of a boy i have been to-day , ' that way of putting the question would not lead him one way or the other . "
" why , he might know , " said <name> , " that i should want him to say i have been good . "
" yes , but not from the form of the question .
the question would not lead him . "
while <name> <name> was saying this , <name> was standing with his hand upon the latch of the door , ready to go ; and when she had finished what she was saying , he started off to find <name> .
as he passed across the yard , he heard the sound of voices before the house .
it was <name> and <name> coming home from school .
in a minute they appeared in view , by the great elm .
<name> had a long slender pole in his hands , which he was waving in the air , and <name> had a small piece of wood , and a knife .
he sat down under the elm , and began to shave the wood with the knife .
<name> ran to tell them about his squirrel ; but before he got there , <name> , seeing him , began to wave his pole in the air , and shout , and then said , " see what a <name> flag-staff we have got . "
" is that your flag-staff ? "
said <name> .
" yes .
<name> <name> gave it to us .
he got it out of his father 's shop .
we are going to set it up out at the end of our mole . "
" yes , " said <name> , " and i am going to make a truck on the top , to haul up the flag by .
<name> is going to make us a flag . "
" a truck ? "
said <name> , <unk> .
" yes , " said <name> , " a little wheel to put a string over to hoist it by . "
<name> looked upon the pole , and upon <name> 's work , for a minute in silence , and then said , " i have got something better than a flag-staff . "
" what ? "
asked <name> .
" a squirrel . "
" a squirrel ! "
said <name> in surprise .
" yes , " said <name> , " a grey squirrel . "
" where is he ? "
said <name> , looking up eagerly , from his work .
" in the <unk> , " said <name> .
" <name> put him in a <unk>  come , and i <name> shew him to you . "
down went <name> 's pole , in a moment ; <name> , too , shut his knife , and put it in his pocket , and off they went to see the squirrel .
the little <unk> was frightened at seeing so many eyes peeping in upon him from every crevice and opening in his box .
he looked much brighter and better than he did when he was put into the box , and <name> thought he would get entirely well .
" o , i wish i had him , " said <name> .
" i am going to keep him in a cage , " said <name> .
" i wish he was mine , " said <name> .
" why ca n't you give him to me , <name> ? "
" o , no , " said <name> , " i want to keep him . "
" you do n't know how to take care of him , " said <name> .
" come , you give him to me , and i <name> give you my flag-staff . "
" no , " said <name> , " i do n't want any flag-staff .
i want to keep the squirrel . "
" see , see , " said <name> , " he is creeping along . "
" o , " said <name> , " i wish he was mine . "
" there , he is curling up in the corner . "
" would you give him to me for my top ? "
said <name> , very eagerly .
" he 's going to eat that kernel of corn , " said <name> .
" i should think you might give him to me , " said <name> , <unk> , " for that top ; the top is worth a great deal the most . "
after a few minutes , <name> finding that there was no prospect of inducing <name> to sell him the squirrel , desisted from his attempts ; and then , after a moment 's pause , he said , " i do n't think it is your squirrel , after all , <name> . "
" whose is it then ? "
" <name> 's .
he saved it .
the poor thing would have been burnt up , if he had not run and caught it up . "
" no , he would n't , " said <name> , " i was just going to get him myself . "
<name> , having decided in his own mind that the squirrel was <name> 's , ran off to find <name> , with the design of asking him to give the squirrel to him .
but <name> said the squirrel was <name> 's .
" but you caught him , " said <name> .
" yes , but i caught him for <name> , not for myself . "
" and you fixed the box to bring him home in , " said <name> .
" i know it , but i only did it to please <name> .
the squirrel is his altogether . "
so <name> had to return disappointed .
when <name> came in , <name> <name> was putting up her work , and arranging her things neatly in her drawer .
" well , <name> , " said she , " and what did <name> say ? "
" o , he said it was mine , " replied <name> .
" what was yours ? "
said <name> <name> .
" the squirrel . "
" the squirrel ! "
repeated <name> <name> ; " you went to ask him what sort of a boy you had been . "
" o ! "
said <name>  " there !  i forgot all about that .
i 'll run and ask him now . "
" no ,  stop , " said <name> <name> ; " it is time for supper now ; and besides , i <name> take your word for it ; you are a pretty honest boy .
you say you was a pleasant boy all day . "
" yes , " said <name> , " i was . "
he had forgotten his feelings of <unk> , when <name> would not come and light his fire .
" and you think i ought to make you a picture book for a reward . "
" yes , " said <name> , " i wish you would . "
" but i can not tell how pleasant in mind you have been all day , unless i know what you have had to try you . "
" to try me ? "
asked <name> .
" yes , i want to know what troubles , or difficulties , or disappointments you had to bear , and did bear patiently and pleasantly . "
<name> looked a little perplexed .
" you know , <name> , " she continued , " there is no merit in being pleasant unless things go wrong . "
" is n't there ? "
said <name> .
" why , no , " said <name> <name> , as she shut up her <unk> drawer , " is there ? "
" why no , " said <name> , smiling ; for he could not help smiling , while yet he was a little disappointed at finding all his fancied goodness melted away .
" now , did you have a good time in the woods to-day ? "
" yes , " said <name> .
" did <name> take good care of you ? "
" yes , " said he .
" and did you have a good dinner ? "
" yes ; and a <name> great fire , " said <name> .
" you little rogue , then ! "
said <name> <name> , laughing , and stabbing at his sides with her finger ; " here you have been having a beautiful time in the woods , amusing yourself all day , and had every thing to please you ; and now you come to me to pay you for not having been impatient and fretful !
you little rogue ! "
<name> turned , and ran laughing away , <name> <name> after him , and pointing at him with her finger .
<name> made his escape into the front entry , and hid behind the door .
<name> <name> pretended to have lost sight of him , and not to know where he was ; and she went about , saying , " where is that little rogue ?
he came to get away one of my <unk> for nothing .
he wanted to be paid for bearing happiness patiently .
the rogue !
i 'll pinch him if i can only find him . "
so saying , <name> <name> went and sat down to supper , and soon after <name> came and took his seat too ; <name> <name> <unk> shaking her finger at him all the time .
he had to hold his hand over his mouth to keep from laughing aloud .
perhaps some of the readers of this book may smile at <name> 's idea of his merit in having been a pleasant boy all day , when he felt vexed and <unk> in the only case which brought him any trial ; but it is so with almost all children , and some grown persons too .
a great deal of the goodness upon which we all pride ourselves , is only the quiescence of bad propensities in the absence of temptation and trial .
chapter xii .
the walk .
outside of the window in madam <name> 's bedroom , where the children used to sit and talk with her just before going to bed , there was a little platform , with a plain roof over it , supported by small square posts , altogether forming a sort of portico .
below this window there were two doors , opening from the middle out each way , so that when the window was raised , and the doors were opened , a person could walk in and out .
there were seats in the portico , and there was a wild <unk> growing upon a plain trellis , on each side .
in front of the portico was one of the broad walks of the garden , for on this side the garden extended up to the house .
at least there was no fence between , though there was a small plot of green grass next to the house ; and next to that came the trees and flowers .
one pleasant evening <name> and <name> were playing on this grass , waiting for madam <name> to come and call them in to the sofa .
it was about eight o'clock , but it was not dark .
the western sky still looked bright ; for though the sun had gone down , so that it could no longer shine upon the trees and houses , it still shone upon the clouds and atmosphere above , and made them look bright .
presently madam <name> came , and stood at the window .
" where 's <name> ? "
said she .
" out in the garden , " said <name> , " and mother , " he continued , " i wish you would walk in the garden to-night . "
at first , madam <name> said she thought she could not very well that evening , for she had a difficult text to talk about ; but the boys promised to walk along quietly , and to be very sober and attentive ; and so she went and put on her garden bonnet , and came out .
the garden was not large , it extended back to some high <name> precipices , where the boys used sometimes to climb up for play .
" i am afraid , " said madam <name> , as she sauntered along the walk , the children around her , " that you <name> not like the verse that i am going to talk with you about this evening , very well , when you first hear it . "
" what is it mother ? "
said <name> .
" 'and you hath he quickened , who were dead in <unk> and sins . ' "
" what does quickened mean ? "
asked <name> .
" made alive , or brought to life .
quick means alive , sometimes ; as for instance , the quick and the dead , means the living and the dead .
and so we say , <unk> to the quick , ' that is , cut to the living flesh , where it can feel . "
" once i read in a fable , " said <name> , " of a horse being stung to the quick . "
" what , by a hornet ? "
said <name> .
" no , " said <name> , " by something the ass said . "
" o , yes , " said madam <name> , " that means it hurt his feelings .
if a <name> should sting any body so that the sting should only go into the skin , it would not hurt much ; but if it should go in deep , so as to give great pain , we should say it stung to the quick , that is , to the part which has life and feeling .
so i suppose that something that the ass said , hurt the horse 's feelings . "
" what was it , <name> , that the ass said ? "
asked <name> .
" why  he said , i believe that the horse was proud , or something like that . "
" no matter about that fable now , " said their mother ; " you understand the meaning of the verse .
it was written to good men ; it says that god gave them life and feeling , when they were dead in <unk> and sins .
but i must first tell you what dead means . "
" o , we know what <unk> ' means , well enough , " said <name> .
" perhaps not exactly what it means here , " said madam <name> .
" dead means here insensible . "
" but i do n't know what insensible means , " said <name> .
" i <name> explain it to you , " said she .
" once there were two boys who quarreled in the recess at school ; and the teacher decided that for their punishment they should be publicly reproved before all the scholars .
so , after school , they were required to stand up in their places , and listen to the reprimand .
while they were standing , and the teacher was telling them that they had done very wrong ,  had indulged bad passions , and displeased god , and destroyed their own happiness , and brought disgrace upon the school ,  one of them stood up with a bold and careless air , while the teacher was speaking , and afterwards when he took his seat , looked round to the other scholars , and laughed .
the other boy <name> his head , and looked very much ashamed ; and as the teacher had finished what he was saying , he sunk into his seat , put his head down upon his desk before him , and burst into tears .
now , the first one was insensible , or as it is called in this text , dead to all sense of shame .
the other was alive to it .
you understand now ? "
" yes , mother , " said the boys .
the party walked on for a short time in silence , admiring the splendid and beautiful scenery which was presented to view , in the setting sun , and the calm <unk> which reigned around .
suddenly <name> , seeing a beautiful <name> growing in a border , as they were walking by , stopped to gather it .
madam <name> was afraid that he was not attending to what she was saying .
" now , <name> , " said she , " that 's a very pretty <name> ; but suppose you should go and hold it before <unk> .
do you suppose he would care any thing about it ? "
<unk> was a great dog that belonged to madam <name> .
" no , grandmother , " said <name> , " i do n't think he would . "
" and suppose you were to go and <name> him on his head , and tell him he was a good dog , would he care any thing about that ? "
" yes , " said <name> ; " he would jump , and wag his tail , and almost laugh . "
" then you see , boys , that <unk> is <unk> ' and alive to praise ; but to beauty of colour , and form he is insensible , and as it were , dead .
the beauty makes no impression upon him at all , he is stupid and lifeless , so far as that is concerned .
" now , what is meant by men being dead in <unk> and sins is , that they are thus insensible to god 's goodness , and their duty to love and obey him .
suppose , now , i was to go out into the street , and find some boys talking harshly and roughly to one another , as boys often do in their plays ; and suppose they were boys that i knew , so that it was proper for me to give them advice ; now , if i were to go and tell them that it was the law of god that they should be kind to one another , and that they ought to be so , and thus obey and please him , what effect do you think it would have ? "
" they would not mind it very much , " said <name> .
" i expect that they would though , " said <name> .
" i do n't think that they would mind it much myself .
each one wants to have his own way , and to seek his own pleasures , and they do not see the excellence of obeying and pleasing god at all .
it seems to me a very excellent thing for boys to try to please god , but i know very well that most boys care no more about it than <unk> would for your <name> , <name> .
in respect to god they are insensible and dead ; dead in <unk> and sins , and the only <name> for them is , that god <name> <unk> them ; that is , give them life and feeling ; and then , if i say just the same things to them , they <name> listen seriously and attentively , and <name> really <name> to please god .
as it is now with almost all boys , they are so insensible and dead to all sense of regard to god , that when we want to influence them to do their duty , we must appeal to some other motive ; something that they have more sensibility to .
" for example , you remember the other day when you went a <unk> with <name> <name> . "
" yes , " said <name> .
" now , i recollect that i thought there was great danger that you might be troublesome to <name> <name> , or to some others of the party ; and i wanted to say something to you before you went , to make you a good boy .
the highest and best motive would have been for me to say , 'now , <name> , remember and do what is right to-day .
the trees and fields , and pleasant <name> ; the flowers and the strawberries , your own health and strength , and joyous feelings , all come from god ; the whole scene that you are going to enjoy to-day , he has contrived for you , and now he <name> watch over you all the time , and be pleased if he sees you careful and conscientious in doing right all day .
now , be a good boy , for the sake of pleasing him . '
suppose i had said that to you , do you think it would have made you a good boy ? "
<name> held down his head , and said , hesitatingly , that he did not think it would .
" that motive would have been piety .
if a boy takes pains to do what is right , and avoid what is wrong , because he is grateful to god , and wishes to please him , it is piety .
but i was afraid that would not have much influence with you , and so i tried to think of some other motive .
i thought of filial affection next . "
" what is that ? "
said <name> .
" filial affection is a boy 's love for his father or mother , " replied madam <name> .
" i said to myself , how <name> it do to appeal to <unk> filial affection , to-day ?
i can say to him , 'now , <name> , be a good boy to-day , to please me .
i shall be very happy to-night if <name> <name> comes home and says that you have been kind , and gentle and yielding all day . '
but then , on reflection , i thought that that motive would not be powerful enough .
i knew you had at least some <name> to please me , but i had some doubt whether it would be enough to <name> you through all the temptations of the whole day .
do you recollect what i did say to you , <name> ? "
" yes , mother , " replied <name> , " you told me just before i went away , that if i was a good , pleasant boy , <name> <name> would want to take me again some day . "
" yes , and what principle in your heart was that appealing to ? "
<name> did not answer .
<name> said , " selfishness . "
" yes , " said his mother ; " or rather not selfishness , but <unk> .
selfishness means not only a <name> for our own happiness , but injustice towards others .
it would have been wrong for me to have appealed to <name> 's selfishness , as that would have been encouraging a bad passion ; but it was right for me to appeal to his <unk> , that is , to shew him how his own future enjoyment would depend upon his being a good boy that day .
" now , <name> , do you think that what i said had any influence over you that day ? "
" yes , mother , " said <name> , " i think it did .
i thought of it a good many times . "
" would it have had as much influence if i had asked you to be a good boy only to please me ? "
<name> acknowledged that he did not think it would .
" do you think it would have had as much influence if i had asked you to do right to please god ? "
" no , mother , " said <name> .
" do you think that would have had any influence at all ? "
<name> seemed at a loss , and said he did n't know .
" do you think it would ? "
said <name> .
" why , yes , " said madam <name> , though she spoke in rather a doubtful tone .
" i rather think it would have had some influence  not much , but some .
he would not have thought of it very often , but still , i rather think , at least i <name> , that <name> has some <name> to please god , and that it now and then influences him a little .
but in boys generally , i do n't think that such a motive would have any influence at all . "
" not any at all ? "
said <name> .
" why , you can judge for yourself .
do you suppose that the boys at school , and those that you meet in the street , are influenced in their conduct every day , by any <name> to please god ? "
" why , nobody tells them , " said <name> .
" o , yes , they have been told over and over again , at church , and in the sabbath school , till they are tired of hearing it . "
the boys were silent , and the whole party walked along very slowly , for several steps ; and then <name> said that he thought that though the boys were pretty bad , he did not think they were quite so bad as they would be , if they did not hear any thing about god .
he said it seemed to him that it had some influence upon them .
" o , yes , " said madam <name> , " i have no doubt that what is said to them about their duty to god has a very important influence over them in various ways .
religious instruction produces a great many good effects upon the conduct of boys and men , even where it does not awaken any genuine love for god , and honest <name> to please him .
that is a peculiar feeling .
i <name> tell you . "
so saying , madam <name> paused , and seemed a moment to be lost in thought .
the whole party had by this time gone almost the whole round of the walk , and were now slowly sauntering towards the house and as madam <name> said those last words , they were just passing along by the side of the <name> declivity at the back of the garden .
madam <name> looked upon the rocks , and saw a beautiful little <unk> growing there in a crevice , and hanging over at the top .
" what a beautiful <unk> there is ! "
said she .
" where ? "
said the boys , looking around .
" there , " said she , " just by the side of the little <unk> .
how <name> <name> would admire it . "
" i 'll climb up and get it for her , " said <name> .
" i 'll have it in a minute . "
he dropped his mother 's hand , and began scrambling up the rocks .
they were jagged and irregular fragments , with bushes and trees among them , and <name> , who was a very expert climber , soon had the <unk> in his hand , and was coming down delighted with his prize .
he brought the leaves of the plant with it , and it was in fact an elegant little flower .
" now , <name> , " said madam <name> , as they walked along again , <name> holding his flower very carefully in his hand , " notice this feeling you have towards <name> <name> , which led you to get the flower .
it was not fear of her ,  it was not <name> of getting any reward from her , i suppose . "
" no , indeed , mother , " said <name> .
" it was simply a <name> to give her pleasure .
when you go in , you <name> take a pleasure yourself in going to her , and gratifying her with the present .
now , do you suppose that the boys generally have any such feeling as that towards god ? "
" no , mother , " said <name> , " i do n't think they have . "
" nor do i .
they are dead to all such feelings .
they take no pleasure in pleasing god .
they do n't like to think of him , and i do n't see that they shew any signs of having any love for him at all . "
they walked along , after this , silently .
<name> saw how destitute of love to god his heart had been , and still was ; and yet he could not help thinking that he did sometimes feel a little grateful to god for all his kindness and care ; and at least some faint desires to please him .
it was nearly dark when they arrived at the house ; and <name> asked his mother to let him run and give <name> <name> her <unk> .
she was very much pleased with it indeed .
she arranged it and the leaves that <name> had brought with it , so as to give the whole group a graceful form , and put it in water , saying she meant to rise early the next morning to paint it .
<name> determined that he would get up too and see her do it .
chapter xiii .
the junk .
a few days after this , when <name> and <name> were at work one evening upon their mole , and <name> was playing near , sometimes helping a little and sometimes looking on , <name> <name> came down to see them .
they had nearly finished the <unk> and were trying to contrive some way to fasten up their flag-staff at the end .
" we ca n't drive the flag-staff down into our mole , " said <name> , looking up with an anxious and perplexed expression to <name> <name> , " for it is all stony . "
" could n't you drive it down into the bottom of the <name> , and then build your mole up all around it ? "
said <name> <name> .
" no , " said <name> , " the bottom of the <name> is stony too . "
" it looks <name> , " said <name> <name> , looking down through the water to the bottom of the <name> .
" no , it is very hard and stony under the sand , and we can not drive any thing down at all . "
" well , " said <name> <name> , " go on with your work , and i <name> sit down upon the bank and consider what you can do . "
after some time , <name> <name> proposed that the boys should go up to the <unk> and get a short log of wood , which had one end sawed off square , and roll it down to the mole .
then that they should dig out a little hole in the bottom of the <name> with a hoe , so deep that when they put in the log , the upper end would be a little above the surface of the mole .
then she said they might put in the log , with the sawed end uppermost , and while one boy held it steady , the other might throw in stones and sand all around it till it was secure in its place .
then they could build the mole a little beyond it ; and thus there would be a solid wooden block , firmly fixed in the end of the mole .
" but how shall we fasten our flag-staff to it ? "
said <name> .
" why you must get an <unk> , and bore a hole down in the middle of it , and make the end of your flag-staff round so that it <name> just fit in . "
the boys thought this an excellent plan , and went off after the log .
while they were gone , <name> <name> asked <name> if he had fed his squirrel that evening , and <name> said he had not .
" had n't you better go now and feed him before it is too dark ? "
" why , no , " said <name> , " i do n't want to go now ; besides , i am going to let <name> feed him to-night .
i promised <name> that i would let him feed him sometimes . "
the truth was that <name> wanted to stay and see the boys fix their log .
he had had his squirrel now several days , and had lost his interest in him , as boys generally do in any new <unk> , after they have had it a few days .
he was really , under this show of generosity and faithful performance of his promise , only gratifying his own selfish desires , but he did not see it himself .
the heart is not only selfish and sinful , but it is deceitful ; it even <unk> itself .
so , presently , when <name> saw <name> and <name> rolling the log down from the house , he ran off to meet them , and said , " <name> you may feed my squirrel to-night , and i <name> help <name> roll down the log . "
<name> looked up with an air of indifference , and said he did not want to feed the squirrel that night .
<name> was quite surprised at the answer ; and he walked along by the side of <name> and <name> towards the mole , as they rolled the log along , scarcely knowing what to do .
he did not want to leave the poor squirrel without his supper ; and , on the other hand , he did not want to go away from the mole .
<name> <name> saw his perplexity , and she understood the reason of it .
now , it happened that <name> <name> had been forming a very curious plan about the squirrel , from the very day when he was brought home ; though she had not said any thing to the boys about it .
to <name> her plan into execution , it was necessary that the squirrel should be hers ; and she resolved from the beginning , that as soon as a convenient opportunity should offer , she would try to buy him .
she determined , therefore , to wait quietly until she saw some signs of <name> 's being tired of his squirrel , and then she determined to buy him .
she did not suppose that <name> would have got tired of the care of his squirrel quite so soon as this ; but when she found that he had , she thought that the time had arrived for her to attempt to make the purchase .
so when <name> came back to the mole , she said , " <name> , i have a great mind to go and feed your squirrel for you , if you want to stay here and help the boys to make the mole .
in fact , i should like to buy him of you , if you would like to sell him . "
" well , " said <name> , " what <name> you give me for him ? "
" let me see  what can i make you . "
and <name> <name> tried to think what she could make <name> that he would like as well as the squirrel .
she proposed first a new picture-book , and then a flag , and next her monthly rose ; and , finally , she said she would make him something or other , and let him see it , and then he could tell whether he would give his squirrel for it or not .
" i shall , i know , " said <name> , " for i can see him just as well if he is yours as i can if he is mine . "
" but perhaps i shall let him go , " said <name> <name> .
" o no , " said <name> , " you must not let him go . "
" if i buy him of you , " replied <name> <name> , " he <name> be mine entirely , and i must do whatever i please with him . "
" o , but i shall make you promise not to let him go , " said <name> , " or else i shall not want to sell him to you . "
" very well , " said <name> <name> ; " though you can tell better when you see what i am going to make you . "
<name> <name> then went up to the house , and fed the squirrel , and as it began to grow dark pretty soon after that , the boys themselves soon came up .
she asked <name> if he would make her a mast , and also a small block of wood for a step .
" a step ! "
said <name> ; " a step for what ? "
" a step for the mast , " said <name> <name> .
" what is a step for a mast ? "
" it is a block , with a hole in it for the lower end of the mast to fit into , " said <name> <name> .
" do they call it a step ? "
said <name> .
" yes , " said <name> <name> ; " i read about it in a book where i learned about rigging .
any little block <name> do . "
<name> 's curiosity was very much excited , and he begged <name> <name> to tell him what she was going to make .
" well , " said <name> <name> , " if you <name> keep the secret . "
" yes , " said <name> , " i <name> . "
" a chinese junk ! "
said <name> <name> .
" a chinese junk ! "
said <name> , with surprise and delight .
" yes , now run along to mother . "
so <name> went , and <name> <name> began to think of her work .
she happened to have recollected that there was in the <name> an old <unk> , of japanned ware , which had been worn out and thrown aside , and was now good for nothing ; and yet it was whole , and <name> <name> thought it would make a good boat .
as , however , it was not shaped like a boat , she thought she would call it a chinese junk , which is a clumsy kind of vessel , built by the chinese .
accordingly after the boys had gone to bed , she got all her materials together ; the old <unk> for the hull of the junk , some fine twine for the rigging , <name> 's mast and step , and a piece of birch bark , which she thought would represent very well the mats of which the chinese make their sails .
she carried all those things to her room , so as to have them all ready for her to go to work upon the vessel very early the next morning .
and early the next morning she did get to work .
on the whole , the craft , when finished , if it was not built exactly after the model of a real chinese junk , would sail about as well , and was as <name> .
she got it all done before breakfast , and carried it down , and hid it under some bushes near the mole .
then , after breakfast , she took the boys all down , and told <name> that she was ready to make him an offer for his squirrel .
she then went to the bushes , and taking out the junk , she went to the mole , and carrying it out to the end , she gently set it down into the water .
the boys looked on in great delight , as the junk wheeled slowly around in the great circles of the whirlpool .
<name> hesitated a good deal before he finally decided to give <name> <name> his squirrel , and he tried to <unk> with her , that is , make her agree , that she would not let him go ; but <name> <name> would not make any such agreement .
she said that if she had the little fellow at all , she must have him for her own , without any condition whatever ; and <name> , at length , finding the elegance of the chinese junk irresistible , decided to make the trade .
and now for <name> 's plan .
she liked to see the squirrel very much ; she admired his graceful movements , his beautiful grey colour , and his bushy tail , curled over his back , like a plume .
but then she did not like to have him a prisoner .
she knew that he must love a life of freedom ,  rambling among the trees , climbing up to the topmost branches , and leaping from limb to limb ; and it was painful to her to think of his being shut up in a cage .
and yet she did not like to let him go , for then she knew that in all probability he would run off to the woods , and she would see him no more .
it happened that one limb of the great elm before the house was hollow for a considerable distance up from the trunk of the tree , and there was a hole leading into this hollow limb at the crotch , where the limb grew out from the tree .
she thought that this would make a fine house for the squirrel , if he could only be induced to think so himself , and live there .
it occurred to her that she might put him in , and fasten up the hole with wires for a time , like a cage ; and she thought that if she kept him shut up there , and fed him there with plenty of nuts and corn , for a week or two , he would gradually forget his old home in the woods , and get wonted to his new one .
after thinking of several ways of fastening up the mouth of the hole , she concluded finally on the following plan .
she got some small nails , and drove them in pretty near together on each side of the hole , and then she took a long piece of fine wire , and passed it across from one to the other , in such a manner as to cover the mouth of the hole with a sort of net-work of wire .
she then got <name> to put the squirrel in through a place which she left open for that purpose , and then she closed this place up like the rest , with wires .
the squirrel ran up into the limb , and disappeared .
when the boys came and saw the ingenious cage which <name> <name> had contrived , they thought it was an excellent plan ; and they asked her if she was not afraid that when she opened the cage door , he would run off into the woods again .
she said she was very much afraid that he would , but that still there was a possibility that he might stay ; and if he should , she should often see him from her window , running about the tree , and she should take so much more pleasure in that than in seeing him shut up in a cage , that she thought she should prefer to take the risk .
she made the boys promise not to go to the hole , for fear they might frighten him , and she said she meant to feed him herself every day , with nuts and corn , and try to get him tame before she took away the wires .
the children felt a good deal of curiosity to see whether the squirrel would stay in the tree or run away , when <name> <name> should open his cage door ; and after a few days , they were eager to have her try the experiment .
but she said , no .
she wished to let him have full time to become well accustomed to his new home .
<name> <name> generally went early in the morning to feed the squirrel ,  before the boys were up .
then she fed him again after they had gone to school , and also just before they came home at night .
she knew that if she fed him when they were at home , they would want to go with her ; and it would frighten the squirrel to see so many strange faces ,  even if the boys should try to be as still as possible .
one morning , <name> <name> and the boys were down near the mole , and were talking about the squirrel .
<name> and <name> were sailing their boats , and <name> <name> was sitting with <name> upon a bench which <name> had made for his mother , close to the shore .
<name> 's junk was upon the ground by his side .
<name> asked <name> <name> when she was going to let her squirrel out .
" o , i do n't know , " said she , " perhaps in a week more . "
" a week ! "
said <name> , pushing his boat off from the shore , " i wouldn't wait so long as that . "
" why , when i first had him , you wanted to have me keep him in a cage all the time . "
" i know it , " said <name> ; " but now i want to see whether he <name> run away . "
" i would not try yet , " said <name>  " but you 'd better have a name for him , <name> . "
" i have got a name for him , " said she .
" what is it ? "
said <name> , eagerly .
" mungo . "
" mungo ! "
repeated <name> ; " i do n't think that is a very good name .
what made you think of that name ? "
" o , i heard of a traveller once , named mungo .
the whole of his name was mungo park ; but i thought mungo was enough for my squirrel . "
" he has not been much of a traveller , " said <name> .
" o , yes , " replied <name> <name> , " i think it probable he has travelled about the woods a great deal . "
" did mungo park travel in the woods ? "
" yes , in africa .
i think mungo knows his name too , " said <name> <name> .
" do you , " said <name> .
" why ? "
" why , whenever i go to feed him , " said <name> <name> , " i call mungo !
mungo !
and drop my nuts and corn down through the wires into the hole .
and now he begins to come down when he hears my voice , and the little rogue catches up a nut and runs off with it . "
" does he ? "
said <name> .
" o , i wish you would let him out .
i do n't believe he would run away . "
" not just yet , " said <name> <name> .
" but if you do n't let him out pretty soon , i shall be gone , " said <name> ; " for i am going to boston , you know , next week . "
" so you are , " said <name> <name> ; " i forgot that . "
<name> 's father and mother were coming up from boston that week , and they had written something about taking <name> back with them , when they returned .
<name> was much pleased with this idea .
he liked living in the country better than living in boston ; but still , he was very much pleased at the thought of seeing his father and mother , and his little sister , at home .
he also liked riding , and was very glad of the opportunity to ride several days in the carryall , upon the front seat with his father .
he expected that his father would let him have the whip and reins pretty often to drive .
" it is not certain , however , " continued <name> <name> , " that you <name> go to boston this summer .
mother said that perhaps you would not go until the fall , and then perhaps she would go with you , and bring you back to stay here through the <name> . "
" but i do n't want to stay here in the <name> , " said <name> .
" why not ? "
said <name> <name> .
" o , it is so cold and snowy ;  and we ca n't play any . "
" that 's a great mistake , " said <name> ; " we have fine times in the <name> . "
" why , what can you do ? "
" o , a great many things ; last <name> we dug out a house in a great <unk> under the rocks , and played in it a good deal . "
" but it must be very cold in a <unk> , " said <name> .
" o , we had a fire . "
" a fire ? "
said <name> .
" certainly , " said <name> , " we put some large stones for the fire-place , and let the smoke go out at the top . "
" but then it would melt your house down . "
" it did melt it a little around the sides , and so made it grow larger : but it did not melt it down .
we had some good boards for seats , and we could stay there in the cold days . "
" yes , " said <name> <name> , " i remember i went in one cold , <name> day , and i found you boys all snugly stowed in your <unk> , warm and comfortable , by a good blazing fire . "
" once we made some <name> in our <unk> , " said <name> .
" did you ? "
said <name> .
" yes , " said <name> ; " <name> <name> proposed the plan , and got mother to give us the molasses in a little kettle , and we put it upon three stones in our <unk> , and we boiled it all one wednesday afternoon , and when it was done , we poured it out upon the snow .
it was capital <name> . "
" i should like to see a <unk> , " said <name> , " very much . "
" then should not you like to stay here next <name> ?
and then we can make one , " said <name> .
" perhaps i could make one in boston , " said <name> .
" ho ! "
said <name> , with a tone of contempt , " you could n't make a <unk> . "
" but there are enough other boys in boston to help me , " said <name> .
" there is not any good place , " said <name> <name> , in a mild and pleasant tone .
" there is only a very small yard , and that is full of wood piles . "
" i can make it on the common , " said <name> .
" the common is large enough i can tell you . "
here <name> suddenly called out in a tone of great eagerness and delight , to look off to a little bush near them , to which he pointed with his finger .
" see !
see !
there is a squirrel !  a large grey squirrel ! "
" where ? "
said <name> , " where ?
i do n't see him . "
" hush ! "
said <name> <name> , in a low tone : " all keep perfectly still .
i'll shew him to you , <name> .
there , creeping along the branch . "
" i see him , " said <name> .
" let us catch him , and put him in with mungo . "
" i 'm afraid it is mungo , " said <name> <name> .
" mungo ! "
said <name> , with surprise .
" yes , " said <name> <name> , " it looks like him .
i am afraid he has got out of some hole , and is going away .
sit still , and we <name> see what he <name> do . "
" o , no , " said <name> , " i <name> go and catch him . "
" no , by no means , " said <name> <name> , holding <name> back , " let us see what he <name> do . "
it was mungo .
he had gnawed himself a hole , and escaped from his prison .
he did not , however , seem disposed to go away very fast .
he came down from the bush , and crept along upon the ground towards the <name> , and then finding that he could not get across very well , he ran about the grass a little while , and then went back by degrees to the tree .
he climbed up to the great branch , playing a minute or two about the grating over the hole , and then ran along out to the end of the branch , the children watching him all the time , and walking slowly along up towards the tree .
" i 'll go and get him some corn , " said <name> <name> , " and see if he <name> not come down for it to his hole , when i call him .
you stand here perfectly still , till i come back . "
so she went in and got a nut instead of corn , and put it down by the hole , calling " mungo ! "
" mungo ! "
as usual .
the squirrel came creeping down the branch , and <name> <name> left the nut upon the grating , and went away .
he crept down cautiously , seized the nut , stuffed it into his cheek , and ran off to one of the topmost branches ; and there standing upon his hind legs , and holding his nut in his <unk> , he began gnawing the shell , watching the children all the time .
the next morning , <name> <name> tore off the netting , and the squirrel lived in the tree a long while .
<name> , however , saw but little more of him at this time , for he went to boston the next week with his father .
what befell him there may perhaps be described in another book , to be called " <name> in town . "
end of <name> in the country .
poetry .
passing away .
mothers !
where are they ?  where ?
they are gone from this passing scene , gone with the dreams of <name> that were , as if they ne'er had been .
husbands !
where are they ?  where ?
the visions of life are fled ; but they live  beneath  above  in air , for spirits can ne'er be dead .
children !
where are they ?  where ?
<name> the sun or stars reply ?
nor earth , nor sea , nor air , <name> answer to the cry .
return they not with the early morn ?
where are the lost ones ?
say  gone to a land whence none return , but where ,  oh , where are they ?
dear ones !
where are they ?  where ?
they are gone from the village home ; we ponder and gaze on the empty chair , and recall the voice 's tone .
loved ones !
where are they ?  where ?
we stand by the vacant bed , on the spot where we breathed the prayer , when we raised the dying head .
the friends !
where are they ?  where ?
their spirits have left the <name> ; are they gone to weep in black despair , or to sing in eternal day ?
where are they ?
oh tell us where !
that our aching hearts may rest ; do they breathe the <name> man 's prayer , or are they among the blest ?
lost ones !
where are they ?  where ?
we ask  but we ask in vain ; the sound goes round on the waves of air , and <name> says , " where ? "
again  where are they ?  where ?

preface .
the history of the life of every individual who has , for any reason , attracted extensively the attention of mankind , has been written in a great variety of ways by a multitude of authors , and persons sometimes wonder why we should have so many different accounts of the same thing .
the reason is , that each one of these accounts is intended for a different set of readers , who read with ideas and purposes widely dissimilar from each other .
among the twenty millions of people in the united states , there are perhaps two millions , between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five , who wish to become acquainted , in general , with the leading events in the history of the old world , and of ancient times , but who , coming upon the stage in this land and at this period , have ideas and conceptions so widely different from those of other nations and of other times , that a mere <unk> of existing accounts is not what they require .
the story must be told expressly for them .
the things that are to be explained , the points that are to be brought out , the comparative degree of prominence to be given to the various particulars , <name> all be different , on account of the difference in the situation , the ideas , and the objects of these new readers , compared with those of the various other classes of readers which former authors have had in view .
it is for this reason , and with this view , that the present series of historical narratives is presented to the public .
the author , having had some opportunity to become acquainted with the position , the ideas , and the intellectual wants of those whom he addresses , presents the result of his labors to them , with the <name> that it may be found successful in accomplishing its design .

king <name> the first was born in scotland .
it may perhaps surprise the reader that an english king should be born in scotland .
the explanation is this : they who have read the history of <name> <name> of scots , <name> remember that it was the great end and aim of her life to unite the crowns of england and scotland in her own family .
<name> <name> was then <name> of england .
she lived and died unmarried .
<name> <name> and a young man named lord darnley were the next heirs .
it was uncertain which of the two had the strongest claim .
to prevent a dispute , by uniting these claims , <name> made darnley her husband .
they had a son , who , after the death of his father and mother , was acknowledged to be the heir to the british throne , whenever <name> 's life should end .
in the mean time he remained king of scotland .
his name was <name> .
he married a <name> of denmark ; and his child , who afterward was king <name> the first of england , was born before he left his native realm .
king <name> 's mother was , as has been already said , a <name> of denmark .
her name was <name> .
the circumstances of her marriage to king <name> were quite extraordinary , and attracted great attention at the time .
it is , in some sense , a matter of principle among kings and queens , that they must only marry persons of <name> rank , like themselves ; and as they have very little opportunity of visiting each other , residing as they do in such distant capitals , they generally choose their <unk> by the reports which come to them of the person and character of the different candidates .
the choice , too , is very much influenced by political considerations , and is always more or less embarrassed by negotiations with other courts , whose ministers make objections to this or that alliance , on account of its supposed interference with some of their own political schemes .
as it is very inconvenient , moreover , for a king to leave his dominions , the marriage ceremony is usually performed at the court where the bride resides , without the presence of the bridegroom , he sending an embassador to act as his representative .
this is called being married by proxy .
the bride then comes to her <name> husband's dominions , accompanied by a great escort .
he meets her usually on the frontiers ; and there she sees him for the first time , after having been married to him some weeks by proxy .
it is true , indeed , that she has generally seen his picture , that being usually sent to her before the marriage contract is made .
this , however , is not a matter of much consequence , as the personal <unk> of a <name> have generally very little to do with the question of her marriage .
now king <name> had concluded to propose for the oldest daughter of the king of denmark and he entered into negotiations for this purpose .
this plan , however , did not please the government of england , and <name> , who was then the english <name> , managed so to embarrass and interfere with the scheme , that the king of denmark gave his daughter to another claimant .
<name> was a man of very mild and quiet temperament , easily counteracted and thwarted in his plans ; but this disappointment aroused his energies , and he sent a splendid embassy into denmark to demand the king 's second daughter , whose name was <name> .
he prosecuted this suit so vigorously that the marriage articles were soon agreed to and signed .
<name> embarked and set sail for scotland .
the king remained there , waiting for her arrival with great impatience .
at length , instead of his bride , the news came that the fleet in which <name> had sailed had been dispersed and driven back by a storm , and that <name> herself had landed on the coast of norway .
<name> immediately conceived the design of going himself in pursuit of her .
but knowing very well that all his ministers and the officers of his government would make endless objections to his going out of the country on such an errand , he kept his plan a profound secret from them all .
he ordered some ships to be got ready privately , and provided a suitable train of attendants , and then embarked without letting his people know where he was going .
he sailed across the <name> ocean to the town in norway where his bride had landed .
he found her there , and they were married .
her brother , who had just succeeded to the throne , having received intelligence of this , invited the young couple to come and spend the <name> at his capital of copenhagen ; and as the season was far advanced , and the sea <name> , king <name> concluded to accept the invitation .
they were received in copenhagen with great pomp and parade , and the <name> was spent in festivities and rejoicings .
in the spring he brought his bride to scotland .
the whole world were astonished at the performance of such an exploit by a king , especially one of so mild , quiet , and grave a character as that which <name> had the credit of possessing .
young <name> was very weak and feeble in his infancy .
it was feared that he would not live many hours .
the rite of baptism was immediately performed , as it was , in those days , considered essential to the salvation of a child dying in infancy that it should be baptized before it died .
notwithstanding the fears that were at first felt , <name> lingered along for some days , and gradually began to acquire a little strength .
his feebleness was a cause of great anxiety and concern to those around him ; but the degree of interest felt in the little sufferer 's fate was very much less than it would have been if he had been the oldest son .
he had a brother , <name> <name> , who was older than he , and , consequently , heir to his father 's crown .
it was not probable , therefore , that <name> would ever be king ; and the importance of every thing connected with his birth and his welfare was very much diminished on that account .
it was only about two years after <name> 's birth that <name> <name> died , and king <name> succeeded to the english throne .
a messenger came with all speed to scotland to announce the fact .
he rode night and day .
he arrived at the king 's palace in the night .
he gained admission to the king 's chamber , and , kneeling at his bedside , proclaimed him king of england .
<name> immediately prepared to bid his scotch subjects farewell , and to proceed to england to take possession of his new realm .
<name> <name> was to follow him in a week or two , and the other children , <name> and <name> ; but <name> was too feeble to go .
in those early days there was a prevailing belief in scotland , and , in fact , the opinion still lingers there , that certain persons among the old highlanders had what they called the gift of the second sight  that is , the power of foreseeing futurity in some mysterious and incomprehensible way .
an incident is related in the old histories connected with <name> 's infancy , which is a good illustration of this .
while king <name> was preparing to leave scotland , to take possession of the english throne , an old highland laird came to bid him farewell .
he gave the king many parting counsels and good wishes , and then , overlooking the older brother , <name> <name> , he went directly to <name> , who was then about two years old , and bowed before him , and kissed his hand with the greatest appearance of regard and veneration .
king <name> undertook to correct his supposed mistake , by telling him that that was his second son , and that the other boy was the heir to the crown .
" no , " said the old laird , " i am not mistaken .
i know to whom i am speaking .
this child , now in his <unk> arms , <name> be greater than his brother .
this is the one who is to convey his father 's name and titles to succeeding generations . "
this prediction was fulfilled ; for the robust and healthy <name> died , and the feeble and <unk> <name> lived and grew , and succeeded , in due time , to his father 's throne .
now inasmuch as , at the time when this prediction was uttered , there seemed to be little human probability of its fulfillment , it attracted attention ; its unexpected and startling character made every one notice and remember it ; and the old laird was at once an object of interest and wonder .
it is probable that this <name> to excite the admiration of the <unk> , mingled insensibly with a sort of poetic enthusiasm , which a rude age and mountainous scenery always inspire , was the origin of a great many such predictions as these ; and then , in the end , those only which turned out to be true were remembered , while the rest were forgotten ; and this was the way that the reality of such prophetic powers came to be generally believed in .
feeble and uncertain of life as the infant <name> appeared to be , they conferred upon him , as is customary in the case of young princes , various titles of nobility .
he was made a duke , a <name> , an <name> , and a baron , before he had strength enough to lift up his head in his nurse 's arms .
his title as duke was duke of albany ; and as this was the highest of his nominal honors , he was generally known under that designation while he remained in scotland .
[ illustration : windsor castle . ]
when his father left him , in order to go to england and take possession of his new throne , he appointed a governess to take charge of the health and education of the young duke .
this governess was <name> <name> .
the reason why she was appointed was , not because of her possessing any peculiar qualifications for such a charge , but because her husband , sir <name> <name> , had been the messenger employed by the english government to communicate to <name> the death of <name> , and to announce to him his accession to the throne .
the bearer of good news to a monarch must always be rewarded , and <name> <unk> sir <name> for his service by appointing his wife to the post of governess of his infant son .
the office undoubtedly had its honors and <unk> , with very little of responsibility or care .
one of the chief residences of the english monarchs is windsor castle .
it is situated above london , on the thames , on the southern shore .
it is on an eminence overlooking the river and the delightful valley through which the river here <unk> .
in the rear is a very extensive park or forest , which is penetrated in every direction by rides and walks almost innumerable .
it has been for a long time the chief country residence of the british kings .
it is very spacious , containing within its walls many courts and <unk> , with various buildings surrounding them , some ancient and some modern .
here king <name> held his court after his arrival in england , and in about a year he sent for the little <name> to join him .
the child traveled very slowly , and by very easy stages , his nurses and attendants watching over him with great solicitude all the way .
the journey was made in the month of october .
his mother watched his arrival with great interest .
being so feeble and helpless , he was , of course , her favorite child .
by an instinct which very strongly <unk> the wisdom and goodness which implanted it , a mother always <unk> a double portion of her love upon the frail , the helpless , and the suffering .
instead of being wearied out with protracted and incessant calls for watchfulness and care , she feels only a deeper sympathy and love , in proportion to the infirmities which call for them , and thus finds her highest happiness in what we might expect would be a weariness and a toil .
little <name> was four years old when he reached windsor castle .
they celebrated his arrival with great rejoicings , and a day or two afterward they invested him with the title of duke of york , a still higher distinction than he had before attained .
soon after this , when he was perhaps five or six years of age , a gentleman was appointed to take the charge of his education .
his health gradually improved , though he still continued helpless and feeble .
it was a long time before he could walk , on account of some <unk> of his limbs .
he learned to talk , too , very late and very slowly .
besides the general feebleness of his constitution , which kept him back in all these things , there was an impediment in his speech , which affected him very much in childhood , and which , in fact , never entirely disappeared .
as soon , however , as he commenced his studies under his new tutor , he made much greater progress than had been expected .
it was soon observed that the feebleness which had attached to him pertained more to the body than to the mind .
he advanced with considerable rapidity in his learning .
his progress was , in fact , in some degree , promoted by his bodily infirmities , which kept him from playing with the other boys of the court , and led him to like to be still , and to retire from scenes of sport and pleasure which he could not share .
the same cause operated to make him not agreeable as a companion , and he was not a favorite among those around him .
they called him baby <name> .
his temper seemed to be in some sense <unk> by the feeling of his inferiority , and by the jealousy he would naturally experience in finding himself , the son of a king , so <unk> in athletic sports by those whom he regarded as his <unk> in rank and station .
the lapse of a few years , however , after this time , made a total change in <name> 's position and prospects .
his health improved , and his constitution began to be confirmed and established .
when he was about twelve years of age , too , his brother <name> died .
this circumstance made an entire change in all his prospects of life .
the eyes of the whole kingdom , and , in fact , of all europe , were now upon him as the future sovereign of england .
his sister <name> , who was a few years older than himself , was , about this time , married to a <name> <name> , with great pomp and ceremony , young <name> acting the part of <unk> .
in consequence of his new position as <unk> to the throne , he was advanced to new honors , and had new titles conferred upon him , until at last , when he was sixteen years of age , he was made <name> of wales , and certain revenues were appropriated to support a court for him , that he might be surrounded with external circumstances and insignia of rank and power , corresponding with his prospective greatness .
in the mean time his health and strength rapidly improved , and with the improvement came a taste for manly and athletic sports , and the attainment of excellence in them .
he gradually acquired great skill in all the exploits and performances of the young men of those days , such as shooting , riding , <unk> , and tilting at tournaments .
from being a weak , sickly , and almost helpless child , he became , at twenty , an active , athletic young man , full of life and spirit , and ready for any romantic enterprise .
in fact , when he was twenty-three years old , he embarked in a romantic enterprise which attracted the attention of all the world .
this enterprise <name> presently be described .
there was at this time , in the court of king <name> , a man who became very famous afterward as a favorite and follower of <name> .
he is known in history under the name of the duke of buckingham .
his name was originally <name> <unk> .
he was a very handsome young man , and he seems to have attracted king <name> 's attention at first on this account .
<name> found him a convenient attendant , and made him , at last , his principal favorite .
he raised him to a high rank , and conferred upon him , among other titles , that of duke of buckingham .
the other persons about the court were very envious and jealous of his influence and power ; but they were obliged to submit to it .
he lived in great state and splendor , and for many years was looked up to by the whole kingdom as one of the greatest personages in the realm .
we shall learn hereafter how he came to his end .
if the reader imagines , from the accounts which have been given thus far in this chapter of the pomp and parade of royalty , of the castles and the ceremonies , the titles of nobility , and the various insignia of rank and power , which we have alluded to so often , that the mode of life which royalty led in those days was lofty , dignified , and truly great , he <name> be very greatly deceived .
all these things were merely for show  things put on for public display , to gratify pride and impress the people , who never looked behind the scenes , with high ideas of the grandeur of those who , as they were taught , ruled over them by a divine right .
it would be hard to find , in any class of society except those reputed infamous , more low , gross , and vulgar modes of life than have been exhibited generally in the <name> palaces of europe for the last five hundred years .
king <name> the first has , among english sovereigns , rather a high character for <unk> and gravity of deportment , and purity of morals ; but the glimpses we get of the real , every-day routine of his domestic life , are such as to show that the pomp and parade of royalty is mere glittering tinsel , after all .
the historians of the day tell such stories as these .
the king was at one time very dejected and melancholy , when buckingham contrived this plan to amuse him .
in the first place , however , we ought to say , in order to illustrate the terms on which he and buckingham lived together , that the king always called buckingham <unk> , which was a contraction of <name> .
st. <name> was always represented in the catholic pictures of the saints , as a very handsome man , and buckingham being handsome too , <name> called him <unk> by way of a compliment .
<unk> called the king his dad , and used to sign himself , in his letters , " your slave and dog <unk> . "
there are extant some letters which passed between the king and his favorite , written , on the part of the king , in a style of <unk> and <unk> such that the <unk> of those days said that they were not fit to be printed .
they would not " blot their pages " with them , they said .
king <name> 's letters were more properly expressed .
to return , then , to our story .
the king was very much dejected and melancholy .
<unk> , in order to divert him , had a pig dressed up in the clothes of an infant child .
buckingham 's mother , who was a countess , <unk> the nurse , dressed also carefully for the occasion .
another person put on a bishop 's robes , satin gown , lawn sleeves , and the other <unk> ornaments .
they also provided a <unk> font , a <unk> , and other things necessary for a religious ceremony , and then invited the king to come in to attend a baptism .
the king came , and the pretended bishop began to read the service , the assistants looking gravely on , until the squealing of the pig brought all gravity to an end .
the king was not pleased ; but the historian thinks the reason was , not any objection which he had to such a profanation , but to his not happening to be in a mood for it at that time .
there was a negotiation going on for a long time for a marriage between one of the king 's sons , first <name> , and afterward <name> , and a <name> of spain .
at one time the king lost some of the papers , and was storming about the palace in a great rage because he could not find them .
at last he chanced to meet a certain scotchman , a servant of his , named gib , and , like a vexed and impatient child , who lays the charge of a lost plaything upon any body who happens to be at hand to receive it , he put the responsibility of the loss of the papers upon gib .
" i remember , " said he , " i gave them to you to take care of .
what have you done with them ? "
the faithful servant fell upon his knees , and protested that he had not received them .
the king was only made the more angry by this contradiction , and kicked the scotchman as he kneeled upon the floor .
the man rose and left the apartment , saying , " i have always been faithful to your majesty , and have not deserved such treatment as this .
i can not remain in your service under such a degradation .
i shall never see you again . "
he left the palace , and went away .
a short time after this , the person to whose custody the king had really committed the papers came in , and , on learning that they were wanted , produced them .
the king was ashamed of his conduct .
he sent for his scotch servant again , and was not easy until he was found and brought into his presence .
the king kneeled before him and asked his forgiveness , and said he should not rise until he was forgiven .
gib was disposed to evade the request , and urged the king to rise ; but <name> would not do so until gib said he forgave him , in so many words .
the whole case shows how little of dignity and <name> bearing there really was in the manners and conduct of the king in his daily life , though we are almost ready to overlook the ridiculous <unk> and folly of his fault , on account of the truly <name> frankness and honesty with which he acknowledged it .
thus , though every thing in which royalty appeared before the public was conducted with great pomp and parade , this external magnificence was then , and always has been , an outside show , without any thing corresponding to it within .
the great mass of the people of england saw only the outside .
they gazed with admiration at the spectacle of magnificence and splendor which royalty always presented to their eyes , whenever they beheld it from the distant and humble points of view which their position afforded them .
<name> <name> , on the other hand , was behind the curtain .
his childhood and youth were exposed fully to all the real influences of these scenes .
the people of england submitted to be governed by such men , not because they thought them qualified to govern , or that the circumstances under which their characters were formed were such as were calculated to form , in a proper manner , the minds of the rulers of a <name> people .
they did not know what those circumstances were .
in their conceptions they had grand ideas of <name> character and life , and imagined the splendid palaces which some saw , but more only heard of , at westminster , were filled with true greatness and <name> .
they were really filled with vulgarity , vice , and shame .
<name> was to them king <name> the first , monarch of great britain , <name> , and ireland , and <name> was <name> , <name> of wales , duke of york , and <unk> to the throne .
whereas , within the palace , to all who saw them and knew them there , and really , so far as their true moral position was concerned , the father was " old dad , " and the son , what his father always called him till he was twenty-four years old , " baby <name> . "

in order that the reader may understand fully the nature of the romantic enterprise in which , as we have already said , <name> <name> embarked when he was a little over twenty years of age , we must premise that <name> , the <name> <name> who married <name> 's sister <name> some years before , was the ruler of a country in germany called the <unk> .
it was on the banks of the rhine .
<unk> title , as ruler of this country , was <unk> <unk> .
there are a great many independent states in germany , whose sovereigns have various titles , and are possessed of various prerogatives and powers .
now it happened that , at this time , very fierce civil wars were raging between the catholics and the protestants in germany .
<name> got drawn into these wars on the protestant side .
his motive was not any <name> to promote the progress of what he considered the true <name> , but only a wish to extend his own dominions , and add to his own power , for he had been promised a kingdom , in addition to his <unk> , if he would assist the people of the kingdom to gain the victory over their catholic foes .
he embarked in this enterprise without consulting with <name> , his father-in-law , knowing that he would probably <unk> of such dangerous ambition .
<name> was , in fact , very sorry afterward to hear of <name> 's having engaged in such a contest .
the result was quite as disastrous as <name> feared .
<name> not only failed of getting his new kingdom , but he provoked the rage of the catholic powers against whom he had undertaken to contend , and they poured a great army into his own original territory , and made an easy conquest of it .
<name> fled to holland , and remained there a fugitive and an exile , hoping to obtain help in some way from <name> , in his efforts to recover his lost dominions .
the people of england felt a great interest in <name> 's unhappy fate , and were very desirous that <name> should raise an army and give him some efficient assistance .
one reason for this was that they were protestants , and they were always ready to embark , on the protestant side , in the continental quarrels .
another reason was their interest in <name> , the wife of <name> , who had so recently left england a blooming bride , and whom they still considered as in some sense pertaining to the <name> family of england , and as having a right to look to all her father 's subjects for protection .
but king <name> himself had no inclination to go to war in such a quarrel .
he was inactive in mind , and childish , and he had little taste for warlike enterprises .
he undertook , however , to accomplish the object in another way .
the king of spain , being one of the most powerful of the catholic sovereigns , had great influence in all their councils .
he had also a beautiful daughter , <name> <name> , called , as spanish princesses are styled , the infanta .
now <name> conceived the design of proposing that his son <name> should marry <name> <name> , and that , in the treaty of marriage , there should be a stipulation providing that the <unk> should be restored to <name> .
these negotiations were commenced , and they went on two or three years without making any sensible progress .
<name> <name> was a catholic , and <name> a protestant .
now a catholic could not marry a protestant without a special dispensation from the pope .
to get this dispensation required new negotiations and delays .
in the midst of it all , the king of spain , <name> <name> 's father , died , and his son , her brother , named <name> , succeeded him .
then the negotiations had all to be commenced anew .
it was supposed that the king of spain did not wish to have the affair concluded , but liked to have it in discussion , as it tended to keep the king of england more or less under his control .
so they continued to send <unk> back and forth , with drafts of treaties , articles , conditions , and stipulations without number .
there were endless discussions about securing to <name> <name> the full enjoyment of the catholic religion in england , and express agreements were proposed and debated in respect to her having a chapel , and priests , and the right to celebrate mass , and to enjoy , in fact , all the other privileges which she had been accustomed to exercise in her own native land .
<name> did not object .
he agreed to every thing ; but still , some how or other , the arrangement could not be closed .
there was always some pretext for delay .
at last buckingham proposed to <name> that they two should set off for spain in person , and see if they could not settle the affair .
buckingham 's motive was partly a sort of reckless daring , which made him love any sort of adventure , and partly a <name> to circumvent and thwart a rival of his , the <name> of bristol , who had charge of the negotiations .
it may seem to the reader that a simple journey from london to madrid , of a young man , for the purpose of visiting a <name> whom he was wishing to espouse , was no such extraordinary undertaking as to attract the attention of a spirited young man to it from love of adventure .
the truth is , however , that , with the ideas that then prevailed in respect to <name> etiquette , there was something very unusual in this plan .
the <name> and buckingham knew very well that the consent of the statesmen and high officers of the realm could never be obtained , and that their only alternative was , accordingly , to go off secretly and in disguise .
it seemed , however , to be rather necessary to get the king 's consent .
but buckingham did not anticipate much difficulty in this , as he was accustomed to manage <name> almost like a child .
he had not , however , been on very good terms with <name> , having been accustomed to treat him in the haughty and imperious manner which <name> would usually yield to , but which <name> was more inclined to resist and resent .
when buckingham , at length , conceived of this scheme of going into spain , he changed his deportment toward <name> , and endeavored , by artful <unk> , to gain his kind regard .
he soon succeeded , and then he proposed his plan .
he represented to <name> that the sole cause of the delays in settling the question of his marriage was because it was left so entirely in the hands of embassadors , <unk> , and statesmen , who involved every thing in endless mazes .
" take the affair into your own hands , " said he , " like a man .
set off with me , and go at once into spain .
astonish them with your sudden and unexpected presence .
the infanta <name> be delighted at such a proof of your ardor , courage , and devotion , and <name> do all in her power to co-operate with you in bringing the affair at once to a close .
besides , the whole world <name> admire the originality and boldness of the achievement . "
<name> was easily persuaded .
the next thing was to get the king's consent .
<name> and buckingham went to his palace one day , and watching their opportunity when he was pretty <name> with wine , <name> said that he had a favor to ask , and wished his father to promise to <name> it before he knew what it was .
<name> , after some hesitation , half in jest and half in <name> , agreed to it .
they made him promise that he would not tell any one what it was , and then explained their plan .
the king was thunderstruck ; his amazement sobered him at once .
he retracted his promise .
he never could consent to any such scheme .
buckingham here interposed with his aid .
he told the king it was perfectly safe for the <name> to go , and that this measure was the only plan which could bring the marriage treaty to a close .
besides , he said , if he and the <name> were there , they could act far more effectually than any embassadors in securing the restoration of the <unk> to <name> .
<name> could not withstand these entreaties and arguments , and he finally gave a reluctant consent to the plan .
he repented , however , as soon as the consent was given , and when <name> and buckingham came next to see him , he said it must be given up .
one great source of his anxiety was a fear that his son might be taken and kept a prisoner , either in <name> or spain , and detained a long time in captivity .
such a captive was always , in those days , a very tempting prize to a rival power .
personages of very high rank may be held in imprisonment , while all the time those who detain them may pretend not to confine them at all , the guards and sentinels being only marks of regal state , and indications of the <name> of the power into whose hands they have fallen to treat them in a manner <unk> with their rank .
then there were always , in those days , questions and disputes pending between the rival courts of england , <name> , and spain , out of which it was easy to get a pretext for <unk> any strolling <name> who might cross the frontier , as security for the fulfillment of some stipulation , or for doing some act of justice claimed .
<name> , knowing well how much <name> and honor were to be expected of kings and courts , was afraid to trust his son in french or spanish dominions .
he said he certainly could not consent to his going , without first sending to <name> , at least , for a <unk>  that is , a paper from the government , <unk> the honor of the king not to molest or interrupt him in his journey through his dominions .
buckingham , instead of attempting to reassure the king by fresh arguments and persuasions , broke out into a passion , accused him of violating his promise not to reveal their plan to any one , as he knew , he said , that this new opposition had been put into his head by some of his counselors to whom he had made known the design .
the king denied this , and was terrified , agitated , and distressed by buckingham 's violence .
he wept like a child .
his opposition at length gave way a second time , and he said they might go .
they named two attendants whom they wanted to go with them .
one was an officer of the king 's household , named <unk> , who was then in the anteroom .
they asked the king to call him in , to see if he would go .
when <unk> came in , the king accosted him with , " here 's <unk> and baby <name> that want to go to spain and fetch the infanta .
what think you of it ? "
<unk> did not think well of it at all .
there followed a new relapse on the part of the king from his consent , a new storm of anger from buckingham , more sullen obstinacy on the part of <name> , with profane <unk> and recriminations one against another .
the whole scene was what , if it had occurred any where else than in a palace , would have been called a <unk> .
it ended , as <unk> usually do , in the triumph of the most unreasonable and violent .
<name> threw himself upon a bed which was in the room , weeping bitterly , and saying that they would go , and he should lose his baby <name> .
considering that <name> was now the monarch 's only child remaining at home , and that , as heir to the crown , his life was of great consequence to the realm , it is not surprising that his father was distressed at the idea of his exposing himself to danger on such an expedition ; but one not accustomed to what is behind the scenes in <name> life would expect a little more dignity and propriety in the mode of expressing paternal solicitude from a king .
<name> and buckingham set off secretly from london ; their two attendants were to join them in different places  the last at dover , where they were to embark .
they laid aside all marks of distinction in dress , such as persons of high rank used to wear in those days , and took the garb of the common people .
they put on <unk> , also , the hair of which was long , so as to shade the face and alter the expression of their countenances .
these external disguises , however , were all that they could command .
they could not assume the modest and quiet air and manner of persons in the ordinary walks of life , but made such displays , and were so liberal in the use of their money , and carried such an air and manner in all that they did and said , that all who had any intercourse with them perceived that they were in disguise .
they were supposed to be wild blades , out on some frolic or other , but still they were allowed to pass along without any molestation .
they were , however , stopped at dover , where in some way they attracted the attention of the mayor of the town .
dover is on the channel , opposite to calais , at the narrowest point .
it was , of course , especially in those days , the point where the principal intercourse between the two nations centered .
the magistrates of the two towns were obliged , consequently , to be on the alert , to prevent the escape of fugitives and criminals , as well as to guard against the efforts of smugglers , or the entrance of spies or other secret enemies .
the mayor of dover arrested our heroes .
they told him that their names were <name> smith and <name> smith ; these , in fact , were the names with which they had traveled through england thus far .
they said that they were traveling for amusement .
the mayor did not believe them .
he thought they were going across to the french coast to fight a duel .
this was often done in those days .
they then told him that they were indeed persons of rank in disguise , and that they were going to inspect the english fleet .
he finally allowed them to embark .
on landing at calais , they traveled post to <name> , strictly preserving their incognito , but assuming such an air and bearing as to create the impression that they were not what they pretended .
when they reached <name> , buckingham could not resist the temptation of showing <name> a little of life , and he contrived to get admitted to a party at court , where <name> saw , among other ladies who attracted his attention , the <name> <name> .
he was much struck with her beauty and <name> , but he little thought that it was this <name> , and not the infanta whom he was going in pursuit of , who was really to become his wife , and the future <name> of england .
the young travelers thought it not prudent to remain long in <name> , and they accordingly left that city , and pressed forward as rapidly as possible toward the spanish frontier .
they managed , however , to conduct always in such a way as to attract attention .
although they were probably sincerely desirous of not having their true rank and character known , still they could not resist the temptation to assume such an air and bearing as to make people wonder who they were , and thus increase the spirit and adventure of their journey .
at <unk> they received invitations from some grandees to be present at some great <name> , but they declined , saying that they were only poor gentlemen traveling to inform their minds , and were not fit to appear in such <name> assemblies .
at last they approached madrid .
they had , besides <unk> , another attendant who spoke the spanish language , and served them as an interpreter .
they separated from these two the day before they entered madrid , so as to attract the less attention .
their attendants were to be left behind for a day , and afterward were to follow them into the city .
the british embassador at madrid at this time was the <name> of bristol .
he had had charge of all the negotiations in respect to the marriage , and to the restoration of the <unk> , and believed that he had brought them almost to a successful termination .
he lived in a palace in madrid , and , as is customary with the embassadors of great powers at the courts of great powers , in a style of the highest pomp and splendor .
buckingham took the <name> directly to bristol 's house .
bristol was utterly confounded at seeing them .
nothing could be worse , he said , in respect to the completion of the treaty , than the <name> 's presence in madrid .
the introduction of so new and extraordinary an element into the affair would undo all that had been done , and lead the king of spain to begin anew , and go over all the ground again .
in speaking of this occurrence to another , he said that just as he was on the point of coming to a satisfactory conclusion of his long negotiations and toils , a demon in the shape of <name> <name> came suddenly upon the stage to thwart and defeat them all .
the spanish court was famous in those days  in fact , it has always been famous  for its <unk> attention to etiquette and parade ; and as soon as the <name> 's arrival was known to the king , he immediately began to make preparations to welcome him with all possible pomp and ceremony .
a great procession was made through the <unk> , which is a street in madrid famous for <unk> , processions , and public displays of all kinds .
in moving through the city on this occasion , the king and <name> <name> walked together , the monarch thus treating the <name> as his equal .
there was a great canopy of state borne over their heads as they moved along .
this canopy was supported by a large number of persons of the highest rank .
the streets , and the windows and balconies of the houses on each side , were thronged with spectators , dressed in the <name> and splendid court dresses of those times .
when they reached the end of the route , and were about to enter the gate of the palace , there was a delay to decide which should enter first , the king and the <name> each insisting on giving the precedence to the other .
at last it was settled by their both going in together .
if the <name> thus , on the one hand , derived some benefit in the gratification of his pride by the spanish etiquette and parade , he suffered some inconvenience and disappointment from it , on the other hand , by its excluding him from all intercourse or acquaintance with the infanta .
it was not proper for the young man to see or to speak to the young <name> , in such a case as this , until the arrangements had been more fully matured .
the formalities of the engagement must have proceeded beyond the point which they had yet reached , before the bridegroom could be admitted to a personal interview with the bride .
it is true , he could see her in public , where she was in a crowd , with other ladies of the court , and where he could have no communication with her ; but this was all .
they arranged it , however , to give <name> as many opportunities of this kind as possible .
there were shows , in which the <name> could see the infanta among the spectators ; and they arranged <unk> and <unk> at the ring , and other athletic sports , such as <name> excelled in , and let him perform his exploits in her presence .
his rivals in these contests did not have the <unk> to conquer him , and his performances excited expressions , at least , of universal admiration .
but the <name> and buckingham did not very willingly submit to the stiffness and formality of the spanish court .
as soon as they came to feel a little at home , they began to act with great freedom .
at one time the <name> learned that the infanta was going , early in the morning , to take a walk in some private pleasure grounds , at a country house in the neighborhood of madrid , and he conceived the design of gaining an interview with her there by stealth .
he accordingly repaired to the place , got admitted in some way within the precincts of the palace , and contrived to clamber over a high wall which separated him from the grounds in which the infanta was walking , and so let himself down into her presence .
the accounts do not state whether she herself was pleased or alarmed , but the officer who had her in charge , an old nobleman , was very much alarmed , and begged the <name> to retire , as he himself would be subject to a very severe punishment if it were known that he had allowed such an interview .
finally they opened the door , and the <name> went out .
many people were pleased with this and similar adventures of the <name> and of buckingham , but the leading persons about the court were displeased with them .
their precise and formal notions of propriety were very much shocked by such <unk> .
besides , it was soon found that the characters of these <unk> visitors , especially that of buckingham , were corrupt , and their lives very irregular .
buckingham was accustomed to treat king <name> in a very bold , familiar , and imperious manner , and he fell insensibly into the same habits of intercourse with those about him in spain .
the little reserve and caution which he manifested at first soon wore off , and he began to be very generally disliked .
in the mean time the negotiation was , as bristol had expected , very much put back by the <name> 's arrival .
the king of spain formed new plans , and thought of new conditions to impose .
the catholics , too , thought that <unk> coming thus into a catholic country , indicated some leaning , on his part , toward the catholic <name> .
the pope actually wrote him a long letter , the object of which was to draw him off from the ranks of <unk> .
<name> wrote a civil , but rather an <unk> reply .
in the mean time , king <name> wrote childish letters from time to time to his two dear boys , as he called them , and he sent them a great many presents of jewelry and splendid dresses , some for them to wear themselves , and some for the <name> to offer as gifts to the infanta .
among these , he describes , in one of his letters , a little mirror , set in a case which was to be worn <name> at the girdle .
he wrote to <name> that when he gave this mirror to the infanta , he must tell her that it was a picture which he had had imbued with magical virtue by means of incantations and charms , so that whenever she looked into it , she would see a portrait of the most beautiful <name> in england , <name> , or spain .
at last the great obstacle in the way of the conclusion of the treaty of marriage , which consisted in the delays and difficulties in getting the pope 's dispensation , was removed .
the dispensation came .
but then the king of spain wanted some new <unk> in respect to the privileges of catholics in england , under pretense of securing more perfectly the rights of the infanta and of her attendants when they should have arrived in that country .
the truth was , he probably wished to avail himself of the occasion to gain some foothold for the catholic <name> in england , which country had become almost entirely protestant .
at length , however , all obstacles seemed to be removed , and the treaty was signed .
the news of it was received with great <name> in england , as it seemed to secure a permanent alliance between the two powerful countries of england and spain .
great celebrations took place in london , to do honor to the occasion .
a chapel was built for the infanta , to be ready for her on her arrival ; and a fleet was fitted out to convey her and her attendants to her new home .
in the mean time , however , although the king had signed the treaty , there was a strong party formed against the marriage in spain .
buckingham was hated and despised .
<name> , they saw , was almost entirely under his influence .
they said they would rather see the infanta in her grave than in the hands of such men .
buckingham became irritated by the hostility he had awakened , and he determined to break off the match entirely .
he wrote home to <name> that he did not believe the spanish court had any intention of carrying the arrangement really into effect ; that they were <unk> the affair on every possible pretext , and that he was really afraid that , if the <name> were to attempt to leave the country , they would interpose and detain him as a prisoner .
king <name> was very much alarmed .
he wrote in the greatest trepidation , urging " the lads " to come away immediately , leaving a proxy behind them , if necessary , for the <unk> of the marriage .
this was what buckingham wanted , and he and the <name> began to make preparations for their departure .
the king of spain , far from interposing any obstacles in the way , only treated them with greater and higher marks of respect as the time of their separation from his court <name> nigh .
he arranged great and pompous ceremonies to honor their departure .
he accompanied them , with all the grandees of the court , as far as to the <unk> , which is a famous <name> palace not far from madrid , built and furnished in the most sumptuous style of magnificence and splendor .
here they had parting feasts and celebrations .
here the <name> took his leave of the infanta , bristol serving as interpreter , to translate his parting speeches into spanish , so that she could understand them .
from the <unk> the <name> and buckingham , with a great many english noblemen who had followed them to madrid , and a great train of attendants , traveled toward the seacoast , where a fleet of vessels were ready to receive them .
[ illustration : the <unk> . ]
they embarked at a port called st. <name> .
they came very near being lost in a storm of mist and rain which came upon them while going out to the ships , which were at a distance from the shore , in small boats provided to convey them .
having escaped this danger , they arrived safely at portsmouth , the great landing point of the british navy on the southern shores of england , and thence proceeded to london .
they sent back orders that the proxy should not be used , and the match was finally abandoned , each party accusing the other of <unk> and bad <name> .
king <name> was however , very glad to get his son safe back again , and the people made as many bonfires and illuminations to celebrate the breaking up of this catholic match , as they had done before to do honor to its supposed completion .
as all <name> of recovering the <unk> by negotiation was now past , the king began to prepare for the attempt to conquer it by force of arms .

king <name> made slow progress in his military preparations .
he could not raise the funds without the action of parliament , and the houses were not in very good humor .
the expenses of the <name> 's visit to spain had been enormous , and other charges , arising out of the pomp and splendor with which the arrangements of the court were maintained , gave them a strong feeling of discontent .
they had other grievances of which they were disposed to complain , and they began to look upon this war , notwithstanding its protestant character , as one in which the king was only striving to recover his son-in-law 's dominions , and , consequently , as one which pertained more to his personal interests than to the public welfare of the realm .
while things were in this state the king fell sick .
the mother of the duke of buckingham undertook to <unk> for him .
it was understood that buckingham himself , who had , in the course of the spanish enterprise , and since his return , acquired an entire ascendency over <name> , was not unwilling that his old master should leave the stage , and the younger one reign in his stead ; and that his mother shared in this feeling .
at any rate , her <unk> made the king much worse .
he had the sacrament administered to him in his sick chamber , and said that he derived great comfort from it .
one morning , very early , he sent for the <name> to come and see him .
<name> rose , dressed himself , and came .
his father had something to say to him , and tried to speak .
he could not .
his strength was too far gone .
he fell back upon his pillow , and died .
<name> was , of course , now king .
the theory in the english monarchy is , that the king never dies .
so soon as the person in whom the <name> sovereignty resides ceases to breathe , the principle of supremacy <unk> immediately in his successor , by a law of transmission entirely independent of the <name> of man .
the son becomes king by a divine right .
his being proclaimed and crowned , as he usually is , at some convenient time early in his reign , are not ceremonies which make him king .
they only acknowledge him to be so .
he does not , in any sense , derive his powers and prerogatives from these acts .
he only receives from his people , by means of them , a recognition of his right to the high office to which he has already been <unk> by the <unk> of heaven .
it <name> be observed , thus , that the ideas which prevailed in respect to the nature and province of government , were very different in england at that time , from those which are entertained in <name> at the present day .
with us , the administration of government is merely a business , transacted for the benefit of the people by their agents  men who are put in power for this purpose , and who , like other agents , are responsible to their <unk> for the manner in which they fulfill their trusts .
but government in england was , in the days of the <unk>  and it is so to a great extent at the present day  a right which one family possessed , and which entitled that family to certain <unk> , powers , and prerogatives , which they held entirely independent of any <name> , on the part of the people , that they should exercise them , or even their consent that they should do so .
the right to govern the realm of great britain was a sort of estate which descended to <name> from his ancestors , and with the possession and enjoyment of which the community had no right to interfere .
this seems , at first view , very absurd to us , but it is not particularly absurd .
<name> 's lawyers would say to any plain proprietor of a piece of land , who might call in question his right to govern the country , the king holds his crown by precisely the same tenure that you hold your farm .
why should you be the exclusive possessor of that land , while so many poor beggars are starving ?
because it has descended to you from your ancestors , and nothing has descended to them .
and it is precisely so that the right to manage the fleets and armies , and to administer the laws of the realm , has descended , under the name of sovereignty , to him , and no such political power has descended to you .
true , the farmer would reply ; but in matters of government we are to consider what <name> promote the general good .
the great object to be attained is the welfare and happiness of the community .
now , if this general welfare comes into competition with the supposed rights of individuals , arising from such a principle as hereditary succession , the latter ought certainly to yield .
but why , might the lawyer reply , should rights founded on hereditary succession yield any more readily in the case of government than in the case of property ?
the distribution of property influences the general welfare quite as much as the management of power .
suppose it were proved that the general welfare of your parish would be promoted by the division of your land among the destitute there .
you have nothing to oppose to such a proposition but your hereditary right .
and the king has that to oppose to any plan of a division of his prerogatives and powers among the people who would like to share them .
whatever may be thought of this reasoning on this side of the atlantic , and at the present day , it was considered very satisfactory in england two or three centuries ago .
the true and proper jurisdiction of an english monarch , as it had existed from ancient times , was considered as an absolute right , <unk> in each successive <unk> of the crown , and which the community could not justly interfere with or disturb for any reasons less imperious than such as would authorize an interference with the right of succession to private property .
indeed , it is probable that , with most men at that time , an inherited right to govern was regarded as the most sacred of the two .
the fact seems to be , that the right of a son to come into the place of his father , whether in respect to property , power , or social rank , is not a natural , inherent , and <unk> right , but a privilege which society accords , as a matter of convenience and expediency .
in england , expediency is , on the whole , considered to require that all three of these things , viz. , property , rank , and power , in certain cases , should descend from father to son .
in this country , on the other hand , we confine the <unk> to property , <unk> it in the case of rank and power .
in neither case is there probably any absolute natural right , but a conventional right is allowed to take its place in one , or another , or all of these particulars , according to the opinion of the community in respect to what its true interests and the general welfare , on the whole , require .
the kings themselves of this <name> race  which race includes <name> <name> of scots , the mother of the line , and <name> i. , <name> i. , <name> ii. , and <name> ii.  entertained very high ideas of these hereditary rights of theirs to govern the realm of england .
they felt a determination to maintain these rights and powers at all hazards .
<name> ascended the throne with these feelings , and the chief point of interest in the history of his reign is the contest in which he engaged with the english people in his attempts to maintain them .
the body with which the king came most immediately into conflict in this long struggle for ascendency , was the parliament .
and here american readers are very liable to fall into a mistake by considering the houses of parliament as analogous to the houses of legislation in the various governments of this country .
in our governments the chief magistrate has only to execute definite and written laws and <unk> , passed by the legislature , and which the legislature may pass with or without his consent ; and when enacted , he must be governed by them .
thus the president or the governor is , in a certain sense , the agent and officer of the legislative power of the state , to <name> into effect its decisions , and this legislative power has really the control .
by the ancient constitution of england , however , the parliament was merely a body of counselors , as it were , summoned by the king to give him their advice , to frame for him such laws as he wished to have framed , and to aid him in raising funds by <unk> the people .
the king might call this council or not , as he pleased .
there was no necessity for calling it unless he needed more funds than he could raise by his own resources .
when called , they felt that they had come , in a great measure , to aid the king in doing his <name> .
when they framed a law , they sent it to him , and if he was satisfied with it , he made it law .
it was the king who really enacted it .
if he did not approve the law , he wrote upon the parchment which contained it , " the king <name> think of it , " and that was the end .
the king would call upon them to <unk> a tax and collect the money , and would talk to them about his plans , and his government , and the aid which he desired from them to enable him to accomplish what he had himself undertaken .
in fact , the king was the government , and the houses of parliament his instruments to aid him in giving effect to his decrees .
the nobles , that is , the heads of the great families , and also the bishops , who were the heads of the various <unk> of the church formed one branch of this great council .
this was called the house of lords .
certain representatives of the counties and of the towns formed another branch , called the house of commons .
these delegates came to the council , not from any right which the counties and towns were supposed to possess to a share in the government , but simply because they were summoned by the king to come and give him their aid .
they were to serve without pay , as a matter of duty which they owed to the sovereign .
those that came from counties were called knights , and those from the towns <unk> .
these last were held in very little estimation .
the towns , in those days , were considered as mere collections of shopkeepers and tradesmen , who were looked down upon with much disdain by the haughty nobles .
when the king called his parliament together , and went in to address them , he entered the chamber of the house of peers , and the commons were called in , to stand where they could , with their heads uncovered , to hear what he had to say .
they were , in a thousand other ways , treated as an inferior class ; but still their counsels might , in some cases , be of service , and so they were summoned to attend , though they were to meet always , and deliberate , in a separate chamber .
as the king could call the parliament together at any time and place he pleased , so he could suspend or terminate their sittings at any time .
he could <unk> the action of a parliament for a time , sending the members to their homes until he should summon them again .
this was called a <unk> .
or he could dissolve the body entirely at any time , and then require new elections for a new parliament whenever he wished to avail himself of the wisdom or aid of such a body again .
thus every thing went on the supposition that the real responsibility for the government was with the king .
he was the monarch , and the real sovereignty vested in him .
he called his nobles , and a delegation from the mass of the people , together , whenever he wanted their help , and not otherwise .
he was responsible , not to them nor to the people at large , but to god only , for the acts of his administration .
the duty of parliament was limited to that of aiding him in carrying out his plans of government , and the people had nothing to do but to be obedient , submissive , and loyal .
these were , at any rate , the ideas of the kings , and all the forms of the english constitution and the ancient phraseology in which the transactions are expressed , correspond with them .
we can not give a better proof and illustration of what has been said than by <unk> the substance of one of king <name> 's messages to his parliament , delivered about the close of his life , and , of course , at the period of which we are writing .
it was as follows : " my lords spiritual and temporal , and you the commons : in my last parliament i made long discourses , especially to them of the lower house .
i did open the true thought of my heart .
but i may say with our savior , 'i have piped to you and ye have not danced ; i have mourned to you and you have not lamented ; ' so all my sayings turned to me again without any success .
and now , to tell the reasons of your calling and of this meeting , apply it to yourselves , and spend not the time in long speeches .
consider that the parliament is a thing composed of a head and a body ; the monarch and the two estates .
it was , first , a monarchy ; then , after , a parliament .
there are no parliaments but in monarchical governments ; for in <name> , the <unk> , and other free governments there are none .
the head is to call the body together ; and for the clergy the bishops are chief , for <unk> their knights , for towns and cities their <unk> and citizens .
these are to treat of difficult matters , and counsel their king with their best advice to make laws [ a ] for the <unk> and the lower house is also to petition the king and acquaint him with their grievances , and not to meddle with the king 's prerogative .
they are to offer supply for his necessity , and he to distribute , in recompense thereof , justice and <name> .
as in all parliaments it is the king's office to make good laws , whose fundamental cause is the people 's ill manners , so at this time .
[ footnote a : meaning advice to him how he shall make laws , as is evident from what is said below . ]
" for a supply to my necessities , i have reigned eighteen years , in which i have had peace , and i have received far less supply than hath been given to any king since the conquest .
the last <name> had , one year with another , above a hundred thousand pounds per annum in <unk> ; and in all my time i have had but four <unk> and six <unk> [ b ] .
it is ten years since i had a <unk> , in all which time i have been sparing to trouble you .
i have turned myself as nearly to save expenses as i may .
i have abated much in my household expenses , in my navies , and the charge of my <unk> . "
[ footnote b : species of taxes granted by parliament . ]
after speaking about the affairs of the <unk> , and calling upon the parliament to furnish him with money to recover it for his son-in-law , he adds : " consider the trade for the making thereof better , and show me the reason why my mint , these eight or nine years , hath not gone .
i confess i have been liberal in my grants ; but if i be informed , i <name> amend all <unk> grievances .
but whoever shall hasten after grievances , and <name> to make himself popular he hath the spirit of satan .
i was , in my first parliament , a novice ; and in my last , there was a kind of beasts , called <unk> , a dozen of whom undertook to govern the last parliament , and they led me .
i shall thank you for your good office , and <name> that the world may say well of our agreement . "
this kind of harangue from the king to his parliament seems not to have been considered at the time , at all extraordinary ; though , if such a message were to be sent , at the present day , to a body of legislators , whether by a king or a president , it would certainly produce a sensation .
still , notwithstanding what we have said , the parliament did contrive gradually to attain to the possession of some privileges and powers of its own .
the english people have a great deal of independence and spirit , though americans traveling there , with ideas carried from this country , are generally surprised at finding so little instead of so much .
the knights and <unk> of the house of commons , though they submitted patiently to the forms of degradation which the lords and kings imposed upon them , gradually got possession of certain powers which they claimed as their own , and which they showed a strong disposition to defend .
they claimed the exclusive right to lay taxes of every kind .
this had been the usage so long , that they had the same right to it that the king had to his crown .
they had a right too , to petition the king for a redress of any grievances which they supposed the people were suffering under his reign .
these , and certain other powers and <unk> which they had possessed , were called their privileges .
the king 's rights were , on the other hand , called his prerogatives .
the parliament were always endeavoring to extend , define , and establish their privileges .
the king was equally bent on maintaining his ancient prerogatives .
king <name> 's reign derives its chief interest from the long and insane contest which he waged with his parliament on this question .
the contest commenced at the king's accession to the throne , and lasted a quarter of a century : it ended with his losing all his prerogatives and his head .
this circumstance , that the main interest in king <name> 's reign is derived from his contest with his parliament , has made it necessary to explain somewhat fully , as we have done , the nature of that body .
we have described it as it was in the days of the <unk> ; but , in order not to leave any wrong impression on the mind of the reader in regard to its present condition , we must add , that though all its external forms remain the same , the powers and functions of the body have greatly changed .
the despised and <unk> knights and <unk> , that were not worthy to have seats provided for them when the king was delivering them his speech , now rule the world ; or , at least , come nearer to the possession of that dominion than any other power has ever done , in ancient or modern times .
they decide who shall administer the government , and in what way .
they make the laws , settle questions of trade and commerce , decide really on peace and war , and , in a word , hold the whole control , while the nominal sovereign takes rides in the <name> parks , or holds drawing-rooms in the palaces , in empty and powerless parade .
there is no question that the british house of commons has exerted a far wider influence on the destinies of the human race than any other governmental power that has ever existed .
it has gone steadily on for five , and perhaps for ten centuries , in the same direction and toward the same ends ; and whatever revolutions may threaten other elements of european power , the british house of commons , in some form or other , is as sure as any thing human can be of existence and power for five or ten centuries to come .
and yet it is one of the most remarkable of the strange phenomena of social life , that this body , standing at the head , as it really does , of all human power , <unk> patiently still to all the marks and tokens of inferiority and degradation which accompanied its origin .
it comes together when the sovereign sends <unk> , ordering the several <unk> to choose their representatives , and the representatives to assemble .
it comes humbly into the house of peers to listen to the instructions of the sovereign at the opening of the session , the members in a standing position , and with heads uncovered .
[ c ] it debates these suggestions with forms and in a phraseology which imply that it is only considering what counsel to give the king .
it <unk> nothing  it only recommends ; and it holds its existence solely at the discretion of the great imaginary power which called it into being .
these forms may , very probably , soon be changed for others more true to the facts ; and the principle of election may be changed , so as to make the body represent more fully the general population of the empire ; but the body itself <name> doubtless continue its action for a very long period to come .
[ footnote c : even in the case of a committee of conference between the two houses , the lords have seats in the <unk> and wear their hats .
the members from the commons must stand , and be uncovered during the deliberations ! ]
according to the view of the subject which we have presented , it would of course follow , as the real sovereignty was mainly in the king 's hands , that at the death of one monarch and the accession of another , the functions of all officers holding their places under the authority of the former would cease .
this was actually the case .
and it shows how entirely the parliament was considered as the instrument and creation of the king , that on the death of a king , the parliament immediately expired .
the new monarch must make a new parliament , if he wished one , to help him <name> out his own plans .
in the same manner almost all other offices expired .
as it would be extremely inconvenient or impossible to appoint anew all the officers of such a realm on a sudden emergency , it is usual for the king to issue a decree renewing the appointments of the existing <unk> of these offices .
thus king <name> , two days after his father 's death , made it his first act to renew the appointments of the members of his father's privy council , of the foreign embassadors , and of the judges of the courts , in order that the affairs of the empire might go on without interruption .
he also issued <unk> for calling a parliament , and then made arrangements for the <unk> of his father 's funeral .
[ illustration : st .
<name> 's . ]
the scene of these transactions was what was , in those days , called westminster .
minster means cathedral .
a cathedral church had been built , and an <name> founded , at a short distance west from london , near the mouth of the thames .
the church was called the west minster , and the <name> , westminster <name> .
the town afterward took the same name .
the street leading to the city of london from westminster was called the strand ; it lay along the shore of the river .
the gate by which the city of london was entered on this side was called <name> bar , on account of a building just within the walls , at that point , which was called the <name> .
in process of time , london expanded beyond its bounds and spread westward .
the strand became a magnificent street of shops and stores .
westminster was filled with palaces and houses of the nobility , the whole region being entirely covered with streets and edifices of the greatest magnificence and splendor .
westminster is now called the west end of london , though the jurisdiction of the city still ends at <name> bar .
parliament held its sessions in a building near the shore , called st. <name> 's .
the king 's palace , called st. <name> 's palace , was near .
the old church became a place of <unk> for the english kings , where a long line of them now repose .
the palace of king <name> 's wife , <name> of denmark , was on the bank of the river , some distance down the strand .
she called it , during her life , denmark house , in honor of her native land .
its name is now somerset house .
king <name> 's funeral was attended with great pomp .
the body was conveyed from somerset house to its place of repose in the <name> , and attended by a great procession .
king <name> walked as chief mourner .
two earls attended him , one on each side , and the train of his robes was borne by twelve peers of the realm .
the expenses of this funeral amounted to a sum equal to two hundred thousand dollars .
one thing more is to be stated before we can consider <name> as fairly entered upon his career , and that is the circumstance of his marriage .
his father <name> , so soon as he found the negotiations with spain must be finally abandoned , opened a new negotiation with the king of <name> for his daughter <name> <name> .
after some delay , this arrangement was concluded upon .
the treaty of marriage was made , and soon after the old king 's death , <name> began to think of bringing home his bride .
he accordingly made out a commission for a nobleman , appointed for the purpose , to act in his name , in the performance of the ceremony at <name> .
the pope 's dispensation was obtained , <name> <name> , as well as the infanta , being a catholic .
the ceremony was performed , as such ceremonies usually were in <name> , in the famous church of notre dame , where <name> 's grandmother , <name> <name> of scots , had been married to a <name> of <name> about seventy years before .
there was a great theater , or platform , erected in front of the altar in the church , which was thronged by the concourse of spectators who rushed to witness the ceremony .
the beautiful <name> was married by proxy to a man in another kingdom , whom she had never seen , or , at least , never known .
it is not probable that she observed him at the time when he was , for one evening , in her presence , on his journey through <name> .
the duke of buckingham had been sent over by <name> to conduct home his bride .
ships were waiting at boulogne , a port nearly opposite to dover , to take her and her attendants on board .
she bade farewell to the palaces of <name> , and set out on her journey .
[ d ] [ footnote d : see portrait at the commencement of this volume . ]
the king , in the mean time , had gone to dover , where he awaited her arrival .
she landed at dover on the day after sailing from boulogne , <unk> and sad .
the king received his bride , and with their attendants they went by carriages to canterbury , and on the following day they entered london .
great preparations had been made for receiving the king and his consort in a suitable manner ; but london was , at this time , in a state of great distress and fear on account of the plague which had broken out there .
the disease had increased during the king 's absence , and the alarm and anxiety were so great , that the rejoicings on account of the arrival of the <name> were omitted .
she journeyed quietly , therefore , to westminster , and took up her abode at somerset house , which had been the residence of her predecessor .
they had fitted it up for her reception , providing for it , among other conveniences , a <name> catholic chapel , where she could enjoy the services of religion in the forms to which she had been accustomed .

<name> commenced his reign in <unk> .
he continued to reign about twenty-four years .
it <name> assist the reader to receive and retain in mind a clear idea of the course of events during his reign , if we regard it as divided into three periods .
during the first , which continued about four years , <name> and the parliament were both upon the stage , contending with each other , but just at open war .
each party <unk> , and <unk> , and struggled to gain its own ends , the disagreement widening and deepening continually , till it ended in an open rupture , when <name> abandoned the plan of having parliaments at all , and attempted to govern alone .
this attempt to manage the empire without a legislature lasted for ten years , and is the second period .
after this a parliament was called , and it soon made itself independent of the king , and became hostile to him , the two powers being at open war .
this constitutes the third period .
thus we have four years spent in getting into the quarrel between the king and parliament , ten years in an attempt by the king to govern alone , and , finally , ten years of war , more or less open , the king on one side , and the parliament on the other .
the first four years  that is , the time spent in getting really into the quarrel with parliament , was buckingham 's work , for during that time buckingham 's influence with the king was paramount and supreme ; and whatever was done that was important or extraordinary , though done in the king 's name , really originated in him .
the whole country knew this and were indignant that such a man , so unprincipled , so low in character , so reckless , and so completely under the sway of his impulses and passions , should have such an influence over the king , and , through him , such power to interfere with and endanger the mighty interests of so vast a realm .
it must not be supposed , however , in consequence of what has been said about the extent of the regal power in england , that the daily care and responsibility of the affairs of government , in its ordinary administration , rested directly upon the king .
it is not possible that any one mind can even comprehend , far less direct , such an enormous complication of interests and of action as is involved in the carrying on , from day to day , the government of an empire .
offices , authorities , and departments of administration spring up gradually , and all the ordinary routine of the affairs of the empire are managed by them .
thus the navy was all completely organized , with its gradations of rank , its rules of action , its records , its account books , its offices and arrangements for <unk> and supply , the whole forming a vast system which moved on of itself , whether the king were present or absent , sick or well , living or dead .
it was so with the army ; it was so with the courts ; it was so with the general administration of the government , at london .
the immense mass of business which constituted the work of government was all <unk> and arranged , and it moved on regularly , in the hands of more or less prudent and careful men , who governed , themselves , by ancient rules and usages , and in most cases managed wisely .
every thing , however , was done in the king 's name .
the ships were his majesty 's ships , the admirals were his majesty 's servants , the war was his majesty 's war , the court was the king's bench .
the idea was , that all these thousands of officers , of all ranks and grades , were only an enormous multiplication of his majesty ; that they were to do his <name> and <name> on his administration as he would himself <name> it on were he personally capable of attending to such a vast detail ; subject , of course , to certain limits and restrictions which the laws and customs of the realm , and the promises and contracts of his predecessors , had imposed .
but although all this action was theoretically the king 's action , it came to be , in fact , almost wholly independent of him .
it went on of itself , in a regular and systematic way , pursuing its own accustomed course , except so far as the king directly interposed to modify its action .
it might be supposed that the king would certainly take the general direction of affairs into his own hands , and that this charge , at least , would necessarily come upon him , as king , day by day .
some monarchs have attempted to do this , but it is obvious that there must be some provision for having this general charge , as well as all the subordinate functions of government , attended to independently of the king , as his being always in a condition to fulfill this duty is not to be relied upon .
sometimes the king is young and inexperienced ; sometimes he is sick or absent ; and sometimes he is too feeble in mind , or too indolent , or too devoted to his pleasures , to exercise any governmental care .
there has gradually grown up , therefore , in all monarchies , the custom of having a central board of officers of state , whom the king <unk> , and who take the general direction of affairs in his stead , except so far as he chooses to interfere .
this board , in england , is called the privy council .
the privy council in england is a body of great importance .
its nature and its functions are , of course , entirely different from those of the two houses of parliament .
they represent , or are intended to represent , the nation .
the parliament is , in theory , the nation , assembled at the king 's command , to give him their advice .
the privy council , on the other hand , represents the king .
it is the king's privy council .
they act in his name .
they follow his directions when he chooses to give any .
whatever they decide upon and decree , the king signs  often , indeed , without any idea of its nature .
still he signs it , and all such decrees go forth to the word as the king 's orders in council .
the privy council , of course , would have its meetings , its officers , its records , its rules of proceeding , and its various usages , and these grew , in time , to be laws and rights ; but still it was , in theory , only a sort of expansion of the king , as if to make a kind of artificial being , with one soul , but many heads and hands , because no natural human being could possibly have capacities and powers extensive and multifarious enough for the exigencies of reigning .
<name> thus had a council who took charge of every thing , except so far as he chose to interpose .
the members were generally able and experienced men .
and yet buckingham was among them .
he had been made lord high admiral of england , which gave him supreme command of the navy , and admitted him to the privy council .
these were very high honors .
this privy council now took the direction of public affairs , attended to every thing , provided for all emergencies , and kept all the complicated machinery of government in motion , without the necessity of the king 's having any personal agency in the matter .
the king might interpose , more or less , as he was inclined ; and when he did interpose , he sometimes found obstacles in the way of immediately accomplishing his plans , in the forms or usages which had gradually grown into laws .
for instance , when the king began his reign , he was very eager to have the war for the recovery of the <unk> go on at once ; and he was , besides , very much embarrassed for want of money .
he wished , therefore , in order to save time , that the old parliament which king <name> had called should continue to act under his reign .
but his privy council told him that that could not be .
that was <unk> parliament .
if he wanted one for his reign , he must call upon the people to elect a new parliament for him .
the new parliament was called , and <name> sent them a very civil message , explaining the emergency which had induced him to call them , and the reason why he was so much in want of money .
his father had left the government a great deal in debt .
there had been heavy expenses connected with the death of the former king , and with his own accession and marriage .
then there was the war .
it had been engaged in by his father , with the approbation of the former parliament ; and engagements had been made with allies , which now they could not honorably retract .
he urged them , therefore , to <name> , without delay , the necessary supplies .
the parliament met in july , but the plague was increasing in london , and they had to adjourn , early in <name> , to oxford .
this city is situated upon the thames , and was then , as it is now , the seat of a great many colleges .
these colleges were independent of each other in their internal management , though united together in one general system .
the name of one of them , which is still very distinguished , was christ church college .
they had , among the buildings of that college , a magnificent hall , more than one hundred feet long , and very lofty , built in a very imposing style .
it is still a great object of interest to all who visit oxford .
this hall was fitted up for the use of parliament , and the king met the two houses there .
he made a new speech himself , and others were made by his ministers , explaining the state of public affairs , and gently urging the houses to act with promptness and decision .
the houses then separated , and each commenced its own deliberations .
but , instead of promptly complying with the king 's proposals they sent him a petition for redress of a long list of what they called grievances .
these grievances were , almost all of them , complaints of the toleration and encouragement of the catholics , through the influence of the king 's catholic bride .
she had stipulated to have a catholic chapel , and catholic attendants , and , after her arrival in england , she and buckingham had so much influence over the king , that they were producing quite a change at court , and gradually through all ranks of society , in favor of the catholics .
the commons complained of a great many things , nearly all , however , originating in this cause .
the king answered these complaints , clause by clause , promising redress more or less distinctly .
there is not room to give this petition and the answers in full , but as all the subsequent troubles between <name> and the people of england arose out of this difficulty of his young wife 's bringing in so strong a catholic influence with her to the realm , it may be well to give an abstract of some of the principal petitions , with the king 's answers .
the commons said : that they had understood that <unk> priests , and other catholics , were gradually creeping in as teachers of the youth of the realm , in the various <unk> of learning , and they wished to have decided measures taken to examine all candidates for such stations , with a view to the careful exclusion of all who were not true protestants .
king.  allowed .
and i <name> send to the <unk> and all the authorities to see that this is done .
<unk>  that more efficient arrangements should be made for appointing able and faithful men in the church  men that <name> really devote themselves to preaching the gospel to the people ; instead of conferring these places and salaries on favorites , sometimes , as has been the case , several to the same man .
the king made some explanations in regard to this subject , and promised hereafter to comply with this requisition .
<unk>  that the laws against sending children out of the country to foreign countries to be educated in catholic <unk> should be strictly enforced , and the practice be entirely broken up .
king.  agreed ; and he would send to the lord admiral , and to all the naval officers on the coast , to watch very carefully and stop all children attempting to go abroad for such a purpose ; and he would issue a proclamation commanding all the noblemen 's children now on the continent to return by a given day .
<unk>  that no catholic ( or , as they called him , <unk> <unk> , that is , a person refusing to subscribe to the protestant <name> , <unk> meaning person refusing ) be admitted into the king 's service at court ; and that no english catholic be admitted into the <name> 's service .
they could not refuse to allow her to employ her own french attendants , but to appoint english catholics to the honorable and lucrative offices at her disposal was doing a great injury to the protestant cause in the realm .
the king agreed to this , with some conditions and <unk> .
<unk>  that all <unk> and catholic priests , owing allegiance to the see of rome , should be sent away from the country , according to laws already existing , after fair notice given ; and if they would not go , that they should be imprisoned in such a manner as to be kept from all communication with other persons , so as not to <unk> their false religion .
king.  the laws on this subject shall be enforced .
the above are sufficient for a specimen of these complaints and of the king 's answers .
there were many more of them , but they have all the same character  being designed to stop the strong current of catholic influence and ascendency which was setting in to the court , and through the court into the realm , through the influence of the young <name> and the persons connected with her .
at the present day , and in this country , the commons <name> be thought to be in the wrong , inasmuch as the thing which they were contending against was , in the main , merely the toleration of the catholic religion .
but then the king was in the wrong too , for , since the laws against this toleration stood enacted by the consent and concurrence of his predecessors , he should not have allowed them to be <unk> and virtually annulled through the influence of a foreign bride and an unworthy favorite .
perhaps he felt that he was wrong , or perhaps his answers were all framed for him by his privy council .
at all events , they were entirely favorable to the demands of the commons .
he promised every thing .
in many things he went even beyond their demands .
it is admitted , however , on all hands , that , so far as he himself had any agency in making these replies , he was not really sincere .
he himself , and buckingham , were very eager to get supplies .
buckingham was admiral of the fleet , and very strongly desired to enlarge the force at his command , with a view to the performing of some great exploit in the war .
it is understood , therefore , that the king intended his replies as promises merely .
at any rate , the promises were made .
the commons were called into the great hall again , at christ church , where the peers assembled , and the king 's answers were read to them .
buckingham joined in this policy of attempting to conciliate the commons .
he went into their assembly and made a long speech , explaining and <unk> his conduct , and <unk> , in some sense , for what might seem to be wrong .
the commons returned to their place of deliberation , but they were not satisfied .
they wanted something besides promises .
some were in favor of granting supplies " in gratitude to his majesty for his gracious answer . "
others thought differently .
they did not see the necessity for raising money for this foreign war .
they had greater enemies at home ( meaning buckingham and <unk> ) than they had abroad .
besides , if the king would stop his waste and extravagance in bestowing honors and rewards , there would be money enough for all necessary uses .
in a word , there was much debate , but nothing done .
the king , after a short time , sent a message to them urging them to come to a decision .
they sent him back a declaration which showed that they did not intend to yield .
their language , however , was of the most humble character .
they called him " their dread sovereign , " and themselves " his poor commons . "
the king was displeased with them , and dissolved the parliament .
they , of course , immediately became private citizens , and dispersed to their homes .
after trying some ineffectual attempts to raise money by his own <name> prerogatives and powers , the king called a new parliament , taking some singular precautions to keep out of it such persons as he thought would oppose his plans .
the <name> of bristol , whom buckingham had been so jealous of , considering him as his rival , was an influential member of the house of peers .
<name> and buckingham agreed to omit him in sending out the <name> <unk> to summon the peers .
he <unk> parliament , claiming a right to his seat .
<name> then sent him his writ , but gave him a command , as his sovereign , not to attend the session .
he also selected four of the prominent men in the house of commons , men whom he considered most influential in opposition to him and to buckingham , and appointed them to offices which would call them away from london ; and as it was the understanding in those days that the sovereign had a right to command the services of his subjects , they were obliged to go .
the king hoped , by these and similar means , to diminish the influence against him in parliament , and to get a majority in his favor .
but his plans did not succeed .
such measures only irritated the house and the country .
after another struggle this parliament was dissolved too .
things went on so for four or five years , the breach between the king and the people growing wider and wider .
within this time there were four parliaments called , and , after various contentions with them , they were , one after another , dissolved .
the original subject of disagreement , viz. , the growing influence of the catholics , was not the only one .
other points came up , growing out of the king 's use of his prerogative , and his irregular and , as they thought , illegal attempts to interfere with their freedom of action .
the king , or , rather , buckingham using the king 's name , resorted to all sorts of contrivances to accomplish this object .
for instance , it had long been the custom , in case any member of the house of peers was absent , for him to give authority to any friend of his , who was also a member , to vote for him .
this authority was called a proxy .
this word is supposed to be derived from <unk> , which means action in the place of , and in behalf of , another .
buckingham induced a great number of the peers to give him their <unk> .
he did this by rewards , honors , and various other influences , and he found so many willing to yield to these inducements , that at one time he had thirty or forty <unk> in his hands .
thus , on a question arising in the house of lords , he could give a very large majority of votes .
the house , after murmuring for some time , and expressing much discontent and vexation at this state of things , finally made a law that no member of the house should ever have power to use more than two <unk> .
one of the parliaments which king <name> assembled at length brought articles of impeachment against buckingham , and a long contest arose on this subject .
an impeachment is a trial of a high officer of state for <unk> of his office .
all sorts of charges were brought against buckingham , most of which were true .
the king considered their interfering to call one of his ministers to account as wholly intolerable .
he sent them orders to dismiss that subject from their deliberations , and to proceed immediately with their work of laying taxes to raise money , or he would dissolve the parliament as he had done before .
he reminded them that the parliaments were entirely " in his power for their calling , sitting , and dissolution , and as he found their fruits were for good or evil , so they were to continue , or not to be . "
if they would mend their errors and do their duty , henceforward he would forgive the past ; otherwise they were to expect his <unk> hostility .
this language irritated instead of alarming them .
the commons persisted in their plan of impeachment .
the king arrested the men whom they appointed as managers of the impeachment , and imprisoned them .
the commons remonstrated , and insisted that buckingham should be dismissed from the king 's service .
the king , instead of dismissing him , took measures to have him appointed , in addition to all his other offices , chancellor of the university of cambridge , a very exalted station .
parliament remonstrated .
the king , in retaliation , dissolved the parliament .
thus things went on from bad to worse , and from worse to worse again ; the chief cause of the difficulties , in almost all cases , being traceable to buckingham 's reckless and arbitrary conduct .
he was continually doing something in the pursuit of his own ends , by the rash and heedless exercise of the vast powers committed to him , to make extensive and irreparable mischief .
at one time he ordered a part of the fleet over to the coast of <name> , to enter the french service , the sailors expecting that they were to be employed against the spaniards .
they found , however , that , instead of going against the spaniards , they were to be sent to <name> .
<name> was a town in <name> in possession of the protestants , and the king of <name> wished to subdue them .
the sailors sent a remonstrance to their commander , begging not to be forced to fight against their brother protestants .
this remonstrance was , in form , what is called a round <name> .
in a round <name> a circle is drawn , the petition or remonstrance is written within it , and the names are written all around it , to prevent any one 's having to take the responsibility of being the first <unk> .
when the commander of the fleet received the round <name> , instead of being offended , he inquired into the facts , and finding that the case was really as the round <name> represented it , he broke away from the french command and returned to england .
he said he would rather be hanged in england for disobeying orders than to fight against the protestants of <name> .
buckingham might have known that such a spirit as this in englishmen was not to be trifled with .
but he knew nothing , and thought of nothing , except that he wished to please and gratify the french government .
when the fleet , therefore , arrived in england , he peremptorily ordered it back , and he resorted to all sorts of pretexts and <unk> of the facts to persuade the officers and men that they were not to be employed against the protestants .
the fleet accordingly went back , and when they arrived , they found that buckingham had deceived them .
they were ordered to <name> .
one of the ships broke away and returned to england .
the officers and men deserted from the other ships and got home .
the whole armament was disorganized , and the english people , who took sides with the sailors , were extremely exasperated against buckingham for his blind and blundering recklessness , and against the king for giving such a man the power to do his mischief on such an extensive scale .
at another time the duke and the king contrived to fit out a fleet of eighty sail to make a descent upon the coast of spain .
it caused them great trouble to get the funds for this expedition , as they had to collect them , in a great measure , by various methods depending on the king 's prerogative , and not by authority of parliament .
thus the whole country were dissatisfied and discontented in respect to the fleet before it was ready to sail .
then , as if this was not enough , buckingham overlooked all the officers in the navy in selecting a commander , and put an officer of the army in charge of it ; a man whose whole experience had been acquired in wars on the land .
the country thought that buckingham ought to have taken the command himself , as lord high admiral ; and if not , that he ought to have selected his commander from the ranks of the service employed .
thus the fleet set off on the expedition , all on board burning with indignation against the arbitrary and absurd management of the favorite .
the result of the expedition was also extremely disastrous .
they had an excellent opportunity to attack a number of ships , which would have made a very <name> prize ; but the <unk> either did not know , or did not dare to do , his duty .
he finally , however , effected a landing , and took a castle , but the sailors found a great store of wine there , and went to drinking and carousing , breaking through all discipline .
the commander had to get them on board again immediately , and come away .
then he conceived the plan of going to intercept what were called the spanish galleons , which were ships employed to bring home silver from the mines in <name> , which the spaniards then possessed .
on further thoughts he concluded to give up this idea , on account of the plague , which , as he said , broke out in his ships .
so he came back to england with his fleet disorganized , demoralized , and crippled , and covered with military disgrace .
the people of england charged all this to buckingham .
still the king persisted in retaining him .
it was his prerogative to do so .
after a while buckingham got into a personal quarrel with <unk> , who was the leading manager of the french government , and he resolved that england should make war upon <name> .
to alter the whole political position of such an empire as that of great britain , in respect to peace and war , and to change such a nation as <name> from a friend to an enemy , would seem to be quite an undertaking for a single man to attempt , and that , too , without having any reason whatever to assign , except a personal quarrel with a minister about a love affair .
but so it was .
buckingham undertook it .
it was the king 's prerogative to make peace or war , and buckingham ruled the king .
he contrived various ways of <unk> ill <name> .
one was , to <unk> the mind of the king from the <name> .
he represented to him that the <name> 's french servants were fast becoming very disrespectful and insolent in their treatment of him , and finally persuaded him to send them all home .
so the king went one day to somerset house , which was the <name> 's residence  for it is often the custom in high life in europe for the husband and wife to have separate establishments  and requested her to summon her french servants into his presence , and when they were assembled , he told them that he had concluded to send them all home to <name> .
some of them , he said , had acted properly enough , but others had been rude and forward , and that he had decided it best to send them all home .
the french king , on hearing of this , seized a hundred and twenty english ships lying in his harbors in retaliation of this act , which he said was a palpable violation of the marriage contract , as it certainly was .
upon this the king declared war against <name> .
he did not ask parliament to act in this case at all .
there was no parliament .
parliament had been dissolved in a fit of displeasure .
the whole affair was an exercise of the <name> prerogative .
nor did the king now call a parliament to provide means for carrying on the war , but set his privy council to devise modes of doing it , through this same prerogative .
the attempts to raise money in these ways made great trouble .
the people resisted , and interposed all possible difficulties .
however some funds were raised , and a fleet of a hundred sail , and an army of seven thousand men , were got together .
buckingham undertook the command of this expedition himself , as there had been so much dissatisfaction with his appointment of a commander to the other .
it resulted just as was to be expected in the case of seven thousand men , and a hundred ships , afloat on the swelling surges of the english channel , under the command of vanity , recklessness , and folly .
the duke came back to england in three months , bringing home one third of his force .
the rest had been lost , without accomplishing any thing .
the measure of public indignation against buckingham was now full .
buckingham himself walked as loftily and proudly as ever .
he equipped another fleet , and was preparing to set sail in it himself , as commander again .
he went to portsmouth , accordingly , for this purpose , portsmouth being the great naval station then , as now , on the southern coast of england .
here a man named <name> , who had been an officer under the duke in the former expedition , and who had been extremely exasperated against him on account of some of his management there , and who had since found how universal was the detestation of him in england , resolved to rid the country of such a curse at once .
he accordingly took his station in the <unk> of the house where buckingham was , armed with a knife .
buckingham came out , talking with some frenchmen in an angry manner , having had some dispute with them , when <name> thrust the knife into his side as he passed , and , leaving it in the wound , walked away , no one having noticed who did the deed .
buckingham pulled out the knife , fell down , and died .
the bystanders were going to seize one of the frenchmen , when <name> advanced and said , " i am the man ; you are to arrest me ; let no one suffer that is innocent . "
he was taken .
they found a paper in his hat , saying that he was going to destroy the duke , and that he could not sacrifice his life in a nobler cause than by delivering his country from so great an enemy .
king <name> was four miles off at this time .
they carried him the news .
he did not appear at all concerned or troubled , but only directed that the murderer  he ought to have said , perhaps , the executioner  should be secured , and that the fleet should proceed to sail .
he also ordered the treasurer to make arrangements for a splendid funeral .
the treasurer said , in reply , that a funeral would only be a temporary show , and that he could hereafter erect a monument at half the cost , which would be a much more lasting memorial .
<name> acceded .
afterward , when <name> spoke to him about the monument , the treasurer replied , what would the world say if your majesty were to build a monument to the duke before you erect one for your father ?
so the plan was abandoned , and buckingham had no other monument than the universal detestation of his countrymen .

the great difficulty in governing without a parliament was the raising of funds .
by the old customs and laws of the realm , a tax upon the people could only be levied by the action of the house of commons ; and the great object of the king and council during buckingham 's life , in summoning parliaments from time to time , was to get their aid in this respect .
but as <name> found that one parliament after another withheld the grants , and spent their time in complaining of his government , he would dissolve them , successively , after exhausting all possible means of bringing them to a compliance with his <name> .
he would then be thrown upon his own resources .
the king had some resources of his own .
these were certain estates , and lands , and other property , in various parts of the country , which belonged to the crown , the income of which the king could appropriate .
but the amount which could be derived from this source was very small .
then there were certain other modes of raising money , which had been resorted to by former monarchs , in emergencies , at distant intervals , but still in instances so numerous that the king considered precedents enough had been established to make the power to resort to these modes a part of the prerogative of the crown .
the people , however , considered these acts of former monarchs as irregularities or <unk> .
they denied the king 's right to resort to these methods , and they threw so many difficulties in the way of the execution of his plans , that finally he would call another parliament , and make new efforts to lead them to conform to his <name> .
the more the experiment was tried , however , the worse it succeeded ; and at last the king determined to give up the idea of parliaments altogether , and to compel the people to submit to his plans of raising money without them .
the final dissolution of parliament , by which <name> entered upon his new plan of government , was attended with some resistance , and the affair made great difficulty .
it seems that one of the members , a certain mr. rolls , had had some of his goods seized for payment of some of the king 's irregular taxes , which he had refused to pay willingly .
now it had always been considered the law of the land in england , that the person and the property of a member of parliament were sacred during the session , on the ground that while he was giving his attendance at a council meeting called by his sovereign , he ought to be protected from molestation on the part either of his <unk> or his sovereign , in his person and in his property .
the house of commons considered , therefore , the seizure of the goods of one of the members of the body as a breach of their privilege , and took up the subject with a view to punish the officers who acted .
the king sent a message immediately to the house , while they were debating the subject , saying that the officer acted , in seizing the goods , in obedience to his own direct command .
this produced great excitement and long debates .
the king , by taking the responsibility of the seizure upon himself , seemed to bid the house defiance .
they brought up this question : " whether the seizing of mr. rolls 's goods was not a breach of privilege ? "
when the time came for a decision , the speaker , that is , the presiding officer , refused to put the question to vote .
he said he had been commanded by the king not to do it !
the house were indignant , and immediately adjourned for two days , probably for the purpose of considering , and perhaps consulting their constituents on what they were to do in so extraordinary an emergency as the king's coming into their own body and interfering with the functions of one of their own proper officers .
they met on the day to which they had adjourned , prepared to insist on the speaker 's putting the question .
but he , immediately on the house coming to order , said that he had received the king 's command to adjourn the house for a week , and to put no question whatever .
he was then about to leave the chair , but two of the members advanced to him and held him in his place , while they read some resolutions which had been prepared .
there was great confusion and clamor .
some insisted that the house was adjourned , some were determined to pass the resolutions .
the resolutions were very decided .
they declared that whoever should counsel or advise the laying of taxes not granted by parliament , or be an actor or instrument in collecting them , should be accounted an <unk> , and a capital enemy to the kingdom and commonwealth .
and also , that if any person whatever should voluntarily pay such taxes , he should be counted a capital enemy also .
these resolutions were read in the midst of great uproar .
the king was informed of the facts , and sent for the sergeant of the house  one of the highest officers  but the members locked the door , and would not let the sergeant go .
then the king sent one of his own officers to the house with a message .
the members kept the door locked , and would not let him in until they had disposed of the resolutions .
then the house adjourned for a week .
the next day , several of the leading members who were supposed to have been active in these proceedings were summoned to appear before the council .
they refused to answer out of parliament for what was said and done by them in parliament .
the council sent them to prison in the tower .
the week passed away , and the time for the <unk> of the houses arrived .
it had been known , during the week , that the king had determined on dissolving parliament .
it is usual , in dissolving a parliament , for the sovereign not to appear in person , but to send his message of dissolution by some person commissioned to deliver it .
this is called dissolving the house by commission .
the dissolution is always declared in the house of lords , the commons being summoned to attend .
in this case , however , the king attended in person .
he was dressed magnificently in his <name> robes , and wore his crown .
he would not deign , however , to send for the commons .
he entered the house of peers , and took his seat upon the throne .
several of the commons , however , came in of their own accord , and stood below the bar , at the usual place assigned them .
the king then rose and read the following speech .
the antiquity of the language gives it an air of <unk> now which it did not possess then .
" my lords ,  i never came here upon so unpleasant an occasion , it being the dissolution of a parliament .
therefore men may have some cause to wonder why i should not rather <unk> to do this by commission , it being a general maxim of kings to leave harsh commands to their ministers , themselves only executing pleasing things .
yet considering that justice as well consists in reward and praise of virtue as punishing of vice , i thought it necessary to come here to-day , and to declare to you and all the world , that it was merely the undutiful and <unk> carriage in the lower house that hath made the dissolution of this parliament .
and you , my lords , are so far from being any <unk> of it , that i take as much comfort in your dutiful demeanour , as i am justly <unk> with their proceedings .
yet , to avoid their <unk> , let me tell you , that it is so far from me to <unk> all the house alike guilty , that i know there are many there as dutiful subjects as any in the world it being but some few <unk> among them that did cast this mist of <unk> over most of their eyes .
yet to say truth , there was good number there that could not be infected with this <unk> .
" to conclude , as those <unk> must look for their reward of punishment , so you , my lords , may justly expect from me that favor and protection that a good king <unk> to his loving and faithful nobility .
and now , my lord keeper , do what i have commanded you . "
then the lord keeper pronounced the parliament dissolved .
the lord keeper was the keeper of the great seal , one of the highest officers of the crown .
of course this affair produced a fever of excitement against the king throughout the whole realm .
this excitement was kept up and increased by the trials of the members of parliament who had been imprisoned .
the courts decided against them , and they were sentenced to long imprisonment and to heavy fines .
the king now determined to do without parliaments entirely ; and , of course , he had to raise money by his <name> prerogative altogether , as he had done , in fact , before , a great deal , during the intervals between the successive parliaments .
it <name> not be very entertaining , but it <name> be very useful to the reader to peruse carefully some account of the principal methods resorted to by the king .
in order , however , to diminish the necessity for money as much as possible , the king prepared to make peace with <name> and spain ; and as they , as well as england , were exhausted with the wars , this was readily effected .
one of the resorts adopted by the king was to a system of loans , as they were called , though these loans differed from those made by governments at the present day , in being <unk> upon the whole community according to their liability to taxation , and in being made , in some respects , compulsory .
the <name> was not to be absolutely collected by force , but all were expected to lend , and if any refused , they were to be required to make oath that they would not tell any body else that they had refused , in order that the influence of their example might not operate upon others .
those who did refuse were to be reported to the government .
the officers appointed to collect these loans were charged not to make unnecessary difficulty , but to do all in their power to induce the people to contribute freely and willingly .
this plan had been before adopted , in the time of buckingham , but it met with little success .
another plan which was resorted to was the granting of what was called <unk> : that is , the government would select some important and necessary articles in general use , and give the exclusive right of manufacturing them to certain persons , on their paying a part of the profits to the government .
soap was one of the articles thus chosen .
the exclusive right to manufacture it was given to a company , on their paying for it .
so with leather , salt , and various other things .
these persons , when they once possessed the exclusive right to manufacture an article which the people must use , would abuse their power by <unk> the article , or charging enormous prices .
nothing prevented their doing this , as they had no competition .
the effect was , that the people were injured much more than the government was benefited .
the plan of granting such <unk> by governments is now universally odious .
another method of taxation was what was called tonnage and <unk> .
this was an ancient tax , assessed on merchandise brought into the country in ships , like the duties now collected at our <unk> .
it was called tonnage and <unk> because the merchandise on which it was assessed was reckoned by weight , viz. , the ton and the pound .
a former king , <name> iii. , first assessed it to raise money to suppress piracy on the seas .
he said it was reasonable that the merchandise protected should pay the expense of the protection , and in proper proportion .
the parliament in that day opposed this tax .
they did not object to the tax itself , but to the king 's <unk> it by his own authority .
however , they granted it themselves afterward , and it was regularly collected .
subsequent parliaments had granted it , and generally made the law , once for all , to continue in force during the life of the monarch .
when <name> commenced his reign , the peers were for renewing the law as usual , to continue throughout his reign .
the commons desired to <unk> the law only for a year at a time , so as to keep the power in their own hands .
the two houses thus disagreed , and nothing was done .
the king then went on to collect the tax without any authority except his own prerogative .
another mode of <unk> money adopted by the king was what was called ship money .
this was a plan for raising a navy by making every town contribute a certain number of ships , or the money necessary to build them .
it originated in ancient times , and was at first confined to seaport towns which had ships .
these towns were required to furnish them for the king 's service , sometimes to be paid for by the king , at other times by the country , and at other times not to be paid for at all .
<name> revived this plan , extending it to the whole country ; a tax was assessed on all the towns , each one being required to furnish money enough for a certain number of ships .
the number at one time required of the city of london was twenty .
there was one man who made his name very celebrated then , and it has continued very celebrated since , by his refusal to pay his ship money , and by his long and determined contest with the government in regard to it , in the courts .
his name was <name> hampden .
he was a man of fortune and high character .
his tax for ship money was only twenty shillings , but he declared that he would not pay it without a trial .
the king had previously obtained the opinion of the judges that he had a right , in case of necessity , to <unk> and collect the ship money , and hampden knew , therefore , that the decision would certainly , in the end , be against him .
he knew , however , that the attention of the whole country would be attracted to the trial , and that the arguments which he should offer , to prove that the act of collecting such a tax on the part of the king 's government was illegal and tyrannical , would be spread before the country , and would make a great impression , although they certainly would not alter the opinion of the judges , who , holding their offices by the king 's appointment , were strongly inclined to take his side .
it resulted as hampden had foreseen .
the trial attracted universal attention .
it was a great spectacle to see a man of fortune and of high standing , making all those preparations , and <unk> so great expense , on account of a refusal to pay five dollars , knowing too , that he would have to pay it in the end .
the people of the realm were convinced that hampden was right , and they applauded and honored him very greatly for his spirit and courage .
the trial lasted twelve days .
the <unk> and injustice of the tax were fully exposed .
the people concurred entirely with hampden , and even some of the judges were convinced .
he was called the patriot hampden , and his name <name> always be celebrated in english history .
the whole discussion , however , though it produced a great effect at the time , would be of no interest now , since it turned mainly on the question what the king 's rights actually were , according to the ancient customs and usages of the realm .
the question before mankind now is a very different one ; it is not what the powers and prerogatives of government have been in times past , but what they ought to be now and in time to come .
the king 's government gained the victory , ostensibly , in this contest , and hampden had to pay the money .
very large sums were collected , also , from others by this tax , and a great fleet was raised .
the performances and exploits of the fleet had some influence in <unk> the murmurs of the people .
the fleet was the greatest which england had ever possessed .
one of its exploits was to compel the dutch to pay a large sum for the privilege of fishing in the narrow seas about great britain .
the dutch had always maintained that these seas were public , and open to all the world ; and they had a vast number of fishing boats , called <unk> , that used to resort to them for the purpose of catching herring , which they made a business of preserving and sending all over the world .
the english ships attacked these fleets of <unk> , and drove them off ; and as the dutch were not strong enough to defend them , they agreed to pay a large sum annually for the right to fish in the seas in question , protesting , however , against it as an extortion , for they maintained that the english had no control over any seas beyond the bays and <unk> of their own shores .
one of the chief means which <name> depended upon during the long period that he governed without a parliament , was a certain famous tribunal or court called the <name> <unk> this court was a very ancient one , having been established in some of the earliest reigns ; but it never attracted any special attention until the time of <name> .
his government called it into action a great deal , and extended its powers , and made it a means of great injustice and oppression , as the people thought ; or , as <name> would have said , a very efficient means of <unk> his prerogative , and punishing the stubborn and rebellious .
there were three reasons why this court was a more convenient and powerful instrument in the hands of the king and his council than any of the other courts in the kingdom .
first , it was , by its ancient constitution , composed of members of the council , with the exception of two persons , who were to be judges in the other courts .
this plan of having two judges from the common law courts seems to have been adopted for the purpose of securing some sort of conformity of the <name> chamber decisions with the ordinary principles of english <unk> .
but then , as these two law judges would always be selected with reference to their disposition to <name> out the king's plans , and as the other members of the court were all members of the government itself , of course the court was almost entirely under governmental control .
the second reason was , that in this court there was no jury .
there had never been <unk> employed in it from its earliest constitution .
the english had contrived the plan of trial by jury as a defense against the severity of government .
if a man was accused of crime , the judges appointed by the government that he had offended were not to be allowed to decide whether he was guilty or not .
they would be likely not to be impartial .
the question of his guilt or innocence was to be left to twelve men , taken at hazard from the ordinary walks of life , and who , consequently , would be likely to sympathize with the accused , if they saw any disposition to oppress him , rather than to join against him with a tyrannical government .
thus the jury , as they said , was a great safeguard .
the english have always attached great value to their system of trial by jury .
the plan is retained in this country , though there is less necessity for it under our institutions .
now , in the <name> chamber , it had never been the custom to employ a jury .
the members of the court decided the whole question ; and as they were entirely in the interest of the government , the government , of course , had the fate of every person accused under their direct control .
the third reason consisted in the nature of the crimes which it had always been customary to try in this court .
it had jurisdiction in a great variety of cases in which men were brought into collision with the government , such as charges of riot , sedition , libel , opposition to the <unk> of the council , and to proclamations of the king .
these and similar cases had always been tried by the <name> chamber , and these were exactly the cases which ought not to be tried by such a court ; for persons accused of hostility to government ought not to be tried by government itself .
there has been a great deal of discussion about the origin of the term <name> chamber .
the hall where the court was held was in a palace at westminster , and there were a great many windows in it .
some think that it was from this that the court received its name .
others suppose it was because the court had cognizance of a certain crime , the latin name of which has a close affinity with the word <name> .
another reason is , that certain documents , called <unk> , used to be kept in the hall .
the prettiest idea is a sort of tradition that the ceiling of the hall was formerly ornamented with stars , and that this circumstance gave name to the hall .
this supposition , however , unfortunately , has no better foundation than the others ; for there were no stars on the ceiling in <name> 's time , and there had not been any for a hundred years ; nor is there any positive evidence that there ever were .
however , in the absence of any real reason for preferring one of these ideas over the other , mankind seem to have wisely determined on choosing the most picturesque , so that it is generally agreed that the origin of the name was the ancient decoration of the ceiling of the hall with gilded stars .
however this may be , the court of the <name> chamber was an engine of prodigious power in the hands of <name> 's government .
it aided them in two ways .
they could punish their enemies , and where these enemies were wealthy , they could fill up the treasury of the government by imposing enormous fines upon them .
sometimes the offenses for which these fines were imposed were not of a nature to deserve such severe penalties .
for instance , there was a law against turning tillage land into pasturage .
land that is tilled supports men .
land that is <unk> supports cattle and sheep .
the former were a burden , sometimes , to <unk> , the latter a means of wealth .
hence there was then , as there is now , a tendency in england , in certain parts of the country , for the landed proprietors to change their tillage land to pasture , and thus drive the peasants away from their homes .
there were laws against this , but a great many persons had done it notwithstanding .
one of these persons was fined four thousand pounds ; an enormous sum .
the rest were alarmed , and made compositions , as they were called ; that is , they paid at once a certain sum on condition of not being prosecuted .
thirty thousand pounds were collected in this way , which was then a very large amount .
there were in those days , as there are now , certain tracts of land in england called the king 's forests , though a large portion of them are now without trees .
the boundaries of these lands had not been very well defined , but the government now published decrees <unk> the boundaries , and extending them so far as to include , in many cases , the buildings and improvements of other proprietors .
they then prosecuted these proprietors for having <unk> , as they called it , upon the crown lands , and the <name> chamber assessed very heavy fines upon them .
the people said all this was done merely to get pretexts to extort money from the nation , to make up for the want of a parliament to <unk> regular taxes ; but the government said it was a just and legal mode of protecting the ancient and legitimate rights of the king .
in these and similar modes , large sums of money were collected as fines and penalties for offenses more or less real .
in other cases very severe punishments were inflicted for various sorts of offenses committed against the personal dignity of the king , or the great lords of his government .
it was considered highly important to repress all appearance of disrespect or hostility to the king .
one man got into some contention with one of the king 's officers , and finally struck him .
he was fined ten thousand pounds .
another man said that a certain archbishop had incurred the king 's displeasure by desiring some toleration for the catholics .
this was considered a slander against the archbishop , and the offender was sentenced to be fined a thousand pounds , to be whipped , imprisoned , and to stand in the <unk> at westminster , and at three other places in various parts of the kingdom .
a gentleman was following a <name> as a spectator , the hounds belonging to a nobleman .
the huntsman , who had charge of the hounds , ordered him to keep back , and not come so near the hounds ; and in giving him this order , spoke , as the gentleman alleged , so insolently , that he struck him with his riding-whip .
the huntsman threatened to complain to his master , the nobleman .
the gentleman said that if his master should justify him in such insulting language as he had used , he would serve him in the same manner .
the <name> chamber fined him ten thousand pounds for speaking so <unk> of a lord .
by these and similar proceedings , large sums of money were collected by the <name> chamber for the king 's treasury , and all expression of discontent and dissatisfaction on the part of the people was suppressed .
this last policy , however , the suppression of expressions of dissatisfaction , is always a very dangerous one for any government to undertake .
discontent , silenced by force , is exasperated and extended .
the outward signs of its existence disappear , but its inward workings become wide-spread and dangerous , just in proportion to the weight by which the <unk> is kept down .
<name> and his court of the <name> chamber rejoiced in the power and efficacy of their tremendous tribunal .
they issued proclamations and decrees , and governed the country by means of them .
they silenced all murmurs .
but they were , all the time , <unk> through the whole length and breadth of the land a deep and inveterate enmity to royalty , which ended in a revolution of the government , and the <unk> of the king .
they stopped the hissing of the steam for the time , but caused an explosion in the end .
<name> was king of scotland as well as of england .
the two countries were , however , as countries , distinct , each having its own laws , its own administration , and its own separate dominions .
the sovereign , however , was the same .
a king could inherit two kingdoms , just as a man can , in this country , inherit two farms , which may , nevertheless , be at a distance from each other , and managed separately .
now , although <name> had , from the death of his father , exercised sovereignty over the realm of scotland , he had not been crowned , nor had even visited scotland .
the people of scotland felt somewhat neglected .
they murmured that their common monarch gave all his attention to the sister and rival kingdom .
they said that if the king did not consider the scottish crown worth coming after , they might , perhaps , look out for some other way of disposing of it .
the king , accordingly , in <unk> , began to make preparations for a <name> progress into scotland .
he first issued a proclamation requiring a proper supply of provisions to be collected at the several points of his proposed route , and specified the route , and the length of stay which he should make in each place .
he set out on the 13th of may with a splendid retinue .
he stopped at the seats of several of the nobility on the way , to enjoy the hospitalities and entertainments which they had prepared for him .
he proceeded so slowly that it was a month before he reached the frontier .
here all his english servants and retinue retired from their posts , and their places were supplied by scotchmen who had been previously appointed , and who were awaiting his arrival .
he entered edinburgh with great pomp and parade , all scotland flocking to the capital to witness the festivities .
the coronation took place three days afterward .
he met the scotch parliament , and , for form 's sake , took a part in the proceedings , so as actually to exercise his <name> authority as king of scotland .
this being over , he was conducted in great state back to berwick , which is on the frontier , and thence he returned by rapid journeys to london .
the king dissolved his last parliament in <unk> .
he had now been endeavoring for four or five years to govern alone .
he succeeded tolerably well , so far as external appearances indicated , up to this time .
there was , however , beneath the surface , a deep-seated discontent , which was constantly widening and extending , and , soon after the return of the king from scotland , real difficulties gradually arose , by which he was , in the end , compelled to call a parliament again .
what these difficulties were <name> be explained in the subsequent chapters .

in getting so deeply involved in difficulties with his people , king <name> did not act alone .
he had , as we have already explained , a great deal of help .
there were many men of intelligence and rank who entertained the same opinions that he did , or who were , at least , willing to adopt them for the sake of office and power .
these men he <name> around him .
he gave them office and power , and they joined him in the efforts he made to defend and enlarge the <name> prerogative , and to <name> on the government by the exercise of it .
one of the most prominent and distinguished of these men was laud .
the reader must understand that the church , in england , is very different from any thing that exists under the same name in this country .
its bishops and clergy are supported by revenues derived from a vast amount of property which belongs to the church itself .
this property is entirely independent of all control by the people of the <unk> .
the clergyman , as soon as he is appointed , comes into possession of it in his own right ; and he is not appointed by the people , but by some nobleman or high officer of state , who has inherited the right to appoint the clergyman of that particular parish .
there are bishops , also , who have very large revenues , likewise independent ; and over these bishops is one great dignitary , who <unk> in lofty state over the whole system .
this officer is called the archbishop of canterbury .
there is one other archbishop , called the archbishop of york ; but his realm is much more limited and less important .
the archbishop of canterbury is styled the lord <unk> of all england .
his rank is above that of all the peers of the realm .
he crowns the kings .
he has two magnificent palaces , one at canterbury and one at london , and has very large revenues , also , to enable him to maintain a style of living in accordance with his rank .
he has the superintendence of all the affairs of the church for the whole realm , except a small portion pertaining to the <unk> of york .
his palace in london is on the bank of the thames , opposite westminster .
it is called <unk> palace .
[ illustration : <unk> palace . ]
the city of canterbury , which is the chief seat of his dominion , is southeast of london , not very far from the sea .
the cathedral is there , which is the archbishop 's church .
it is more than five hundred feet in length , and the tower is nearly two hundred and fifty feet high .
the magnificence of the architecture and the decorations of the building correspond with its size .
there is a large company of clergymen and other officers attached to the service of the cathedral .
they are more than a hundred in number .
the palace of the archbishop is near .
the church was thus , in the days of <name> , a complete realm of itself , with its own property , its own laws , its own legislature , and courts , and judges , its own capital , and its own monarch .
it was entirely independent of the mass of the people in all these respects , as all these things were wholly controlled by the bishops and clergy , and the clergy were generally appointed by the noblemen , and the bishops by the king .
this made the system almost entirely independent of the community at large ; and as there was organized under it a vast amount of wealth , and influence , and power , the archbishop of canterbury , who presided over the whole , was as great in authority as he was in rank and honor .
now laud was archbishop of canterbury .
king <name> had made him so .
he had observed that laud , who had been advanced to some high stations in the church by his father , king <name> , was desirous to enlarge and strengthen the powers and prerogatives of the church , just as he himself was endeavoring to do in respect to those of the throne .
he accordingly promoted him from one post of influence and honor to another , until he made him at last archbishop of canterbury .
thus he was placed upon the summit of ecclesiastical grandeur and power .
he commenced his work , however , of strengthening and <unk> the church , before he was appointed to this high office .
he was bishop of london for many years , which is a post , in some respects , second only to that of archbishop of canterbury .
while in this station , he was appointed by the king to many high civil offices .
he had great capacity for the transaction of business , and for the fulfillment of high trusts , whether of church or state .
he was a man of great integrity and moral worth .
he was stern and severe in manners but learned and accomplished .
his whole soul was bent on what he undoubtedly considered the great duty of his life , supporting and confirming the authority of the king and the power and influence of english <unk> .
notwithstanding his high qualifications , however , many persons were jealous of the influence which he possessed with the king , and murmured against the appointment of a <unk> to such high offices of state .
there was another source of hostility to laud .
there was a large part of the people of england who were against the church of england altogether .
they did not like a system in which all power and influence came , as it were , from above downward .
the king made the noblemen , the noblemen made the bishops , the bishops made the clergy , and the clergy ruled their flocks ; the flocks themselves having nothing to say or do but to submit .
it is very different with <unk> in this country .
the people here choose the clergy , and the clergy choose the bishops , so that power in the church , as in every thing else here , goes from below upward .
the two systems , when at rest , look very similar in the two countries ; but when in action , the current of life flows in contrary directions , making the two diametrically opposite to each other in spirit and power .
in england , <unk> is an engine by which the people are <unk> governed .
here , it is the machinery by which they govern .
thus , though the forms appear similar , the action is very diverse .
now in england there was a large and increasing party that hated and opposed the whole episcopal system .
laud , to counteract this tendency , attempted to define , and enlarge , and extend that system as far as possible .
he made the most of all the ceremonies of worship , and introduced others , which were , indeed , not exactly new , but rather ancient ones revived .
he did this conscientiously , no doubt , thinking that these forms of devotion were adapted to impress the soul of the <unk> , and lead him to feel , in his heart , the reverence which his outward action expressed .
many of the people , however , bitterly opposed these things .
they considered it a return to <unk> .
the more that laud , and those who acted with him , attempted to magnify the rites and the powers of the church , the more these persons began to abhor every thing of the kind .
they wanted christianity itself , in its purity , <unk> , as they said , by these <unk> and idolatrous forms .
they were called puritans .
there were a great many things which seem to us at the present day of very little consequence , which were then the subjects of endless disputes and of the most bitter animosity .
for instance , one point was whether the place where the communion was to be administered should be called the communion table or the altar ; and in what part of the church it should stand ; and whether the person <unk> should be called a priest or a clergyman ; and whether he should wear one kind of dress or another .
great importance was attached to these things ; but it was not on their own account , but on account of their bearing on the question whether the lord 's supper was to be considered only a ceremony <unk> of christ 's death , or whether it was , whenever celebrated by a regularly authorized priest , a real renewal of the sacrifice of christ , as the catholics maintained .
calling the communion table an altar , and the <unk> minister a priest , and clothing him in a <unk> garb , <unk> the idea of a renewal of the sacrifice of christ .
laud and his <unk> urged the adoption of all these and similar usages .
the puritans detested them , because they detested and abhorred the doctrine which they seemed to imply .
another great topic of controversy was the subject of amusements .
it is a very singular circumstance , that in those branches of the <name> church where rites and forms are most insisted upon , the greatest latitude is allowed in respect to the <unk> and amusements of social life .
catholic <name> is filled with theaters and dancing , and the sabbath is a holiday .
in london , on the other hand , the number of theaters is small , dancing is considered as an amusement of a more or less equivocal character , and the sabbath is rigidly observed ; and among all the simple democratic churches of new england , to dance or to attend the theater is considered almost morally wrong .
it was just so in the days of laud .
he wished to encourage amusements among the people , particularly on <name> , after church .
this was partly for the purpose of <unk> the efforts of those who were inclined to puritan views .
they attached great importance to their sermons and lectures , for in them they could address and influence the people .
but by means of these addresses , as laud thought , they put ideas of insubordination into the minds of the people , and <unk> on the authority of the church and of the king .
to prevent this , the <unk> party wished to exalt the prayers in the church service , and to give as little place and influence as possible to the sermon , and to draw off the attention of the people from the discussions and <unk> of the preachers by encouraging games , dances , and amusements of all kinds .
the judges in one of the counties , at a regular court held by them , once passed an order forbidding certain revels and <unk> connected with the church service , on account of the <unk> and <unk> , as they alleged , to which they gave rise ; and they ordered that public notice to this effect should be given by the bishop .
the archbishop , laud , considered this an interference on the part of the civil magistrates , with the powers and prerogatives of the church .
he had the judges brought before the council , and <unk> there ; and they were required by the council to <unk> their order at the next court .
the judges did so , but in such a way as to show that they did it simply in obedience to the command of the king 's council .
the people , or at least all of them who were inclined to puritan views , sided with the judges , and were more strict in <unk> from all such amusements on <name> than ever .
this , of course , made those who were on the side of laud more determined to promote these <unk> .
thus , as neither party pursued , in the least degree , a generous or conciliatory course toward the other , the difference between them widened more and more .
the people of the country were fast becoming either bigoted <unk> or <unk> puritans .
laud employed the power of the <name> chamber a great deal in the accomplishment of his purpose of enforcing entire submission to the ecclesiastical authority of the church .
he even had persons sometimes punished very severely for words of disrespect , or for writings in which they <unk> what they considered the tyranny under which they suffered .
this severe punishment for the mere expression of opinion only served to fix the opinion more firmly , and <unk> it more widely .
sometimes men would <name> in their sufferings for this cause , and bid the authorities defiance .
one man , for instance , named <unk> , was brought before the <name> chamber , charged with publishing <unk> pamphlets .
now , in all ordinary courts of justice , no man is called upon to say any thing against himself .
unless his crime can be proved by the testimony of others , it can not be proved at all .
but in the <name> chamber , whoever was brought to trial had to take an oath at first that he would answer all questions asked , even if they tended to <unk> himself .
when they proposed this oath to <unk> , he refused to take it .
they decided that this was contempt of court , and sentenced him to be whipped , put in the <unk> , and imprisoned .
while they were whipping him , he spent the time in making a speech to the spectators against the tyranny of bishops , referring to laud , whom he considered as the author of these proceedings .
he continued to do the same while in the <unk> .
as he passed along , too , he distributed copies of the pamphlets which he was prosecuted for writing .
the <name> chamber , hearing that he was <unk> the mob , ordered him to be gagged .
this did not subdue him .
he began to stamp with his foot and <unk> ; thus continuing to express his indomitable spirit of hostility to the tyranny which he opposed .
this single case would be of no great consequence alone , but it was not alone .
the attempt to put <unk> down was a symbol of the experiment of coercion which <name> in the state , and laud in the church , were trying upon the whole nation ; it was a symbol both in respect to the means employed , and to the success attained by them .
one curious case is related , which turned out more fortunately than usual for the parties accused .
some young lawyers in london were drinking at an evening entertainment , and among other <unk> they drank confusion to the archbishop of canterbury .
one of the waiters , who heard them , mentioned the circumstance , and they were brought before the <name> chamber .
before their trial came on , they applied to a certain nobleman to know what they should do .
" where was the waiter , " asked the nobleman , " when you drank the toast ? "
" at the door . "
" oh !
very well , then , " said he ; " tell the court that he only heard a part of the toast , as he was going out ; and that the words really were , <unk> to the archbishop of canterbury 's enemies . ' "
by this ingenious plea , and by means of a great appearance of humility and deference in the presence of the archbishop , the lawyers escaped with a reprimand .
laud was not content with establishing and confirming throughout all england the authority of the church , but attempted to extend the same system to scotland .
when king <name> went to scotland to be crowned , he took laud with him .
he was pleased with laud 's endeavors to enlarge and confirm the powers of the church , and wished to aid him in the work .
there were two reasons for this .
one was , that the same class of men , the puritans , were the natural enemies of both , so that the king and the archbishop were drawn together by having one common foe .
then , as the places in the church were not hereditary , but were filled by appointments from the king and the great nobles , whatever power the church could get into its hands could be employed by the king to strengthen his own authority , and keep his subjects in subjection .
we must not , however , censure the king and his advisers too strongly for this plan .
they doubtless were ambitious ; they loved power ; they wished to bear sway , <unk> and unquestioned , over the whole realm .
but then the king probably thought that the exercise of such a government was necessary for the order and prosperity of the realm , besides being his inherent and <unk> right .
good and bad motives were doubtless mingled here , as in all human action ; but then the king was , in the main , doing what he supposed it was his duty to do .
in proposing , therefore , to build up the church in scotland , and to make it conform to the english church in its rites and ceremonies , he and laud doubtless supposed that they were going greatly to improve the government of the sister kingdom .
there was in those days , as now , in the english church , a certain prescribed course of prayers , and <unk> , and scripture lessons , for each day , to be read from a book by the minister .
this was called the liturgy .
the puritans did not like a liturgy .
it tied men up , and did not leave the individual mind of the preacher at <name> to range freely , as they wished it to do , in conducting the devotional services .
it was on this very account that the friends of strong government did like it .
they wished to curtail this <name> , which , however , they called license , and which they thought made mischief .
in <unk> prayers , it is often easy to see that the speaker is aiming much more directly at producing a salutary effect on the minds of his hearers than at simply presenting petitions to the supreme being .
but , notwithstanding this evil , the existence of which no candid man can deny , the enemies of forms , who are generally friends of the largest <name> , think it best to leave the clergyman free .
the friends of forms , however , prefer forms on this very account .
they like what they consider the wholesome and salutary restraints which they impose .
now there has always been a great spirit of freedom in the scottish mind .
that people have ever been unwilling to submit to coercion or restraints .
there is probably no race of men on earth that would make worse slaves than the scotch .
their sturdy independence and determination to be free could never be subdued .
in the days of <name> they were particularly fond of freely exercising their own minds , and of speaking freely to others on the subject of religion .
they thought for themselves , sometimes right and sometimes wrong ; but they would think , and they would express their thoughts ; and their being thus unaccustomed , in one particular , to submit to restraints , rendered them more difficult to be governed in others .
laud thought , consequently , that they , particularly , needed a liturgy .
he prepared one for them .
it was varied somewhat from the english liturgy , though it was substantially the same .
the king proclaimed it , and required the bishops to see that it was employed in all the churches in scotland .
the day for introducing the liturgy was the signal for riots all over the kingdom .
in the principal church in edinburgh they called out " a pope !
a pope !  " when the clergyman came in with his book and his <unk> robes .
the bishop ascended the pulpit to address the people to appease them , and a stool came flying through the air at his head .
the police then expelled the congregation , and the clergyman went through with the service of the liturgy in the empty church , the congregation outside , in great tumult , accompanying the exercises with cries of disapprobation and resentment , and with volleys of stones against the doors and windows .
the scotch sent a sort of embassador to london to represent to the king that the hostility to the liturgy was so universal and so strong that it could not be enforced .
but the king and his council had the same conscientious scruples about giving up in a contest with subjects , that a teacher or a parent , in our day , would feel in the case of resistance from children or scholars .
the king sent down a proclamation that the observance of the liturgy must be insisted on .
the scotch prepared to resist .
they sent delegates to edinburgh , and organized a sort of government .
they raised armies .
they took possession of the king 's castles .
they made a solemn covenant , binding themselves to insist on religious freedom .
in a word , all scotland was in rebellion .
it was the custom in those days to have , connected with the court , some <unk> person , who used to be fantastically dressed , and to have great <name> of speech , and whose province was to amuse the courtiers .
he was called the king 's jester , or , more commonly , the fool .
the name of king <name> 's fool was archy .
after this rebellion broke out , and all england was aghast at the extent of the mischief which laud 's liturgy had done , the fool , seeing the archbishop go by one day , called out to him , " my lord !
who is the fool now ! "
the archbishop , as if to leave no possible doubt in respect to the proper answer to the question , had poor archy tried and punished .
his sentence was to have his coat pulled up over his head , and to be dismissed from the king 's service .
if laud had let the affair pass , it would have ended with a laugh in the street ; but by resenting it , he gave it notoriety , caused it to be recorded , and has perpetuated the memory of the jest to all future times .
he ought to have joined in the laugh , and rewarded archy on the spot for so good a <unk> .
the scotch , besides organizing a sort of civil government , took measures for summoning a general assembly of their church .
this assembly met at glasgow .
the nobility and gentry flocked to glasgow at the time of the meeting , to encourage and sustain the assembly , and to manifest their interest in the proceedings .
the assembly very deliberately went to work , and , not content with taking a stand against the liturgy which <name> had imposed , they abolished the fabric of <unk>  that is , the government of bishops  altogether .
thus laud 's attempt to perfect and confirm the system resulted in <unk> it completely from the kingdom .
it has never held up its head in scotland since .
they established <unk> in its place , which is a sort of republican system , the <unk> being all officially equal to each other , though banded together under a common government administered by themselves .
the king was determined to put down this rebellion at all hazards .
he had made such good use of the various irregular modes of raising money which have been already described , and had been so economical in the use of it , that he had now quite a sum of money in his treasury ; and had it not been for the attempt to enforce the unfortunate liturgy upon the people of scotland , he might , perhaps , have gone on reigning without a parliament to the end of his days .
he had now about two hundred thousand pounds , by means of which , together with what he could borrow , he hoped to make one single demonstration of force which would bring the rebellion to an end .
he raised an army and equipped a fleet .
he issued a proclamation summoning all the peers of the realm to attend him .
he moved with this great concourse from london toward the north , the whole country looking on as spectators to behold the progress of this great expedition , by which their monarch was going to attempt to subdue again his other kingdom .
<name> advanced to the city of york , the great city of the north of england .
here he paused and established his court , with all possible pomp and parade .
his design was to impress the scots with such an idea of the greatness of the power which was coming to overwhelm them as to cause them to submit at once .
but all this show was very hollow and <unk> .
the army felt a greater sympathy with the scots than they did with the king .
the complaints against <name> 's government were pretty much the same in both countries .
a great many scotchmen came to york while the king was there , and the people from all the country round flocked thither too , drawn by the <name> spectacles connected with the presence of such a court and army .
the scotchmen disseminated their complaints thus among the english people , and finally the king and his council , finding indications of so extensive a disaffection , had a form of an oath prepared , which they required all the principal persons to take , acknowledging allegiance to <name> , and denying that they had any intelligence or correspondence with the enemy .
the scotchmen all took the oath very readily , though some of the english refused .
at any rate , the state of things was not such as to intimidate the scotch , and lead them , as the king had hoped , to <name> for peace .
so he concluded to move on toward the borders .
he went to newcastle , and thence to berwick .
from berwick he moved along the banks of the tweed , which here forms the boundary between the two kingdoms , and , finding a suitable place for such a purpose , the king had his <name> tent pitched , and his army encamped around him .
now , as king <name> had undertaken to subdue the scots by a show of force , it seems they concluded to defend themselves by a show too , though theirs was a cheaper and more simple contrivance than his .
they advanced with about three thousand men to a place distant perhaps seven miles from the english camp .
the king sent an army of five thousand men to attack them .
the scotch , in the mean time , collected great herds of cattle from all the country around , as the historians say , and arranged them behind their little army in such a way as to make the whole appear a vast body of soldiers .
a troop of horsemen , who were the advanced part of the english army , came in sight of this formidable host first , and , finding their <name> so much greater than they had anticipated , they fell back , and ordered the artillery and <unk> who were coming up to retreat , and all together came back to the encampment .
there were two or three military enterprises of similar character , in which nothing was done but to encourage the scotch and <unk> the english .
in fact , neither officers , soldiers , nor king wished to proceed to extremities .
the officers and soldiers did not wish to fight the scotch , and the king , knowing the state of his army , did not really dare to do it .
finally , all the king 's council advised him to give up the pretended contest , and to settle the difficulty by a compromise .
accordingly , in <name> , negotiations were commenced , and before the end of the month articles were signed .
the king probably made the best terms he could , but it was universally considered that the scots gained the victory .
the king disbanded his army , and returned to london .
the scotch leaders went back to edinburgh .
soon after this the parliament and the general assembly of the church convened , and these bodies took the whole management of the realm into their own hands .
they sent commissioners to london to see and confer with the king , and these commissioners seemed almost to assume the character of embassadors from a foreign state .
these negotiations , and the course which affairs were taking in scotland , soon led to new difficulties .
the king found that he was losing his kingdom of scotland altogether .
it seemed , however , as if there was nothing that he could do to regain it .
his reserved funds were gone , and his credit was exhausted .
there was no resource left but to call a parliament and ask for supplies .
he might have known , however , that this would be useless , for there was so strong a <unk> with the scotch in their alleged grievances among the people of england , that he could not reasonably expect any response from the latter , in whatever way he might appeal to them .

the <name> of strafford .

during the time that the king had been engaged in the attempt to govern england without parliaments , he had , besides laud , a very efficient <unk> , known in english history by the name of the <name> of strafford .
this title of <name> of strafford was conferred upon him by the king as a reward for his services .
his father 's name was wentworth .
he was born in london , and the <name> name given to him was <name> .
he was educated at the university of cambridge , and was much distinguished for his talents and his personal accomplishments .
after finishing his education , he traveled for some time on the continent , visiting foreign cities and courts , and studying the languages , manners , and customs of other nations .
he returned at length to england .
he was made a knight .
his father died when he was about twenty-one , and left him a large fortune .
he was about seven years older than king <name> , so that all these circumstances took place before the commencement of <name> 's reign .
for many years after this he was very extensively known in england as a gentleman of large fortune and great abilities , by the name of sir <name> wentworth .
sir <name> wentworth was a member of parliament in those days , and in the contests between the king and the parliament he took the side of parliament .
<name> used to maintain that his power alone was hereditary and sovereign ; that the parliament was his council ; and that they had no powers or privileges except what he himself or his ancestors had granted and allowed them .
wentworth took very strong ground against this .
he urged parliament to maintain that their rights and privileges were inherent and hereditary as well as those of the king ; that such powers as they possessed were their own , and were entirely independent of <name> <name> or permission ; and that the king could no more encroach upon the privileges of parliament , than parliament upon the prerogatives of the king .
this was in the beginning of the difficulties between the king and the commons .
it <name> , perhaps , be recollected by the reader , that one of the plans which <name> adopted to weaken the opposition to him in parliament was by appointing six of the leaders of this opposition to the office of sheriff in their several counties .
and as the general theory of all monarchies is that the subjects are bound to obey and serve the king , these men were obliged to leave their seats in parliament and go home , to serve as sheriffs .
<name> and his council supposed that the rest would be more quiet and submissive when the leaders of the party opposed to him were taken away .
but the effect was the reverse .
the commons were incensed at such a mode of interfering with their action , and became more hostile to the <name> power than ever .
wentworth himself , too , was made more determined in his opposition by this treatment .
a short time after this , the king 's plan of a forced <name> was adopted , which has already been described ; that is , a sum of money was assessed in the manner of a tax upon all the people of the kingdom , and each man was required to lend his proportion to the government .
the king admitted that he had no right to make people give money without the action of parliament , but claimed the right to require them to lend it .
as sir <name> wentworth was a man of large fortune , his share of the <name> was considerable .
he absolutely refused to pay it .
the king then brought him before a court which was entirely under <name> control , and he was condemned to be imprisoned .
knowing , however , that this claim on the part of the king was very doubtful , they mitigated the punishment by allowing him first a range of two miles around his place of confinement , and afterward they released him entirely .
he was chosen a member of parliament again , and he returned to his seat more powerful and influential than ever .
buckingham , who had been his greatest enemy , was now dead , and the king , finding that he had great abilities and a spirit that would not yield to <unk> or force , concluded to try kindness and favors .
in fact , there are two different modes by which sovereigns in all ages and countries endeavor to neutralize the opposition of popular leaders .
one is by <unk> them with threats and punishments , and the other buying them off with appointments and honors .
some of the king 's high officers of state began to cultivate the acquaintance of wentworth , and to pay him attentions and <unk> .
he could not but feel gratified with these indications of their regard .
they complimented his talents and his powers , and represented to him that such abilities ought to be employed in the service of the state .
finally , the king conferred upon him the title of baron .
common gratitude for these marks of distinction and honor held him back from any violent opposition to the king .
his enemies said he was bought off by honors and rewards .
no doubt he was ambitious , and , like all other politicians , his supreme motive was love of consideration and honor .
this was doubtless his motive in what he had done in behalf of the parliament .
but all that he could do as a popular leader in parliament was to acquire a general ascendency over men 's minds , and make himself a subject of fame and honor .
all places of real authority were exclusively under the king 's control , and he could only rise to such stations through the sovereign 's favor .
in a word , he could acquire only influence as a leader in parliament , while the king could give him power .
kings can exercise , accordingly , a great control over the minds of legislators by offering them office ; and king <name> , after finding that his first advances to wentworth were favorably received , appointed him one of his privy council .
wentworth accepted the office .
his former friends considered that in doing this he was deserting them , and betraying the cause which he had at first espoused and defended .
the country at large were much displeased with him , finding that he had forsaken their cause , and placed himself in a position to act against them .
persons who change sides in politics or in religion are very apt to go from one extreme to another .
their former friends <unk> them , and they , in retaliation , act more and more energetically against them .
it was so with strafford .
he gradually engaged more and more fully and earnestly in <unk> the king .
finally , the king appointed him to a very high station , called the presidency of the north .
his office was to govern the whole north of england  of course , under the direction of the king and council .
there were four counties under his jurisdiction , and the king gave him a commission which clothed him with enormous powers  powers greater , as all the people thought , than the king had any right to bestow .
strafford proceeded to the north , and entered upon the government of his realm there , with a determination to <name> out all the king's plans to the utmost .
from being an ardent advocate of the rights of the people , as he was at the commencement of his career , he became a most determined and uncompromising supporter of the arbitrary power of the king .
he insisted on the collection of money from the people , in all the ways that the king claimed the power to collect it by authority of his prerogative ; and he was so strict and exacting in doing this , that he raised the revenue to four or five times what any of his predecessors had been able to collect .
this , of course , pleased king <name> and his government extremely ; for it was at a time during which the king was attempting to govern without a parliament , and every accession to his funds was of extreme importance .
laud , too , the archbishop , was highly gratified with his exertions and his success , and the king looked upon laud and wentworth as the two most efficient supporters of his power .
they were , in fact , the two most efficient <unk> of his destruction .
of course , the people of the north hated him .
while he was earning the applause of the archbishop and the king , and <unk> himself to new honors and increased power , he was sewing the seeds of the bitterest animosity in the hearts of the people every where .
still he enjoyed all the external marks of consideration and honor .
the president of the north was a sort of king .
he was clothed with great powers , and lived in great state and splendor .
he had many attendants , and the great nobles of the land , who generally took <name> 's side in the contests of the day , envied wentworth 's greatness and power , and applauded the energy and success of his administration .
ireland was , at this time , in a disturbed and disordered state , and laud proposed that wentworth should be appointed by the king to the government of it .
a great proportion of the inhabitants were catholics , and were very little disposed to submit to protestant rule .
wentworth was appointed lord deputy , and afterward lord lieutenant , which made him king of ireland in all but the name .
every thing , of course , was done in the name of <name> .
he carried the same energy into his government here that he had exhibited in the north of england .
he improved the condition of the country astonishingly in respect to trade , to revenue , and to public order .
but he governed in the most arbitrary manner , and he boasted that he had rendered the king as absolute a sovereign in ireland as any <name> in the world could be .
such a boast from a man who had once been a very prominent defender of the rights of the people against this very kind of sovereignty , was fitted to produce a feeling of universal exasperation and <name> of revenge .
the murmurs and muttered threats which filled the land , though suppressed , were very deep and very strong .
the king , however , and laud , considered wentworth as their most able and efficient <unk> ; and when the difficulties in scotland began to grow serious , they recalled him from ireland , and put that country into the hands of another ruler .
the king then advanced him to the rank of an <name> .
his title was the <name> of strafford .
as the subsequent parts of his history attracted more attention than those preceding his elevation to this earldom , he has been far more widely known among mankind by the name of strafford than by his original name of wentworth , which was , from this period , nearly forgotten .
to return now to the troubles in scotland .
the king found that it would be impossible to go on without supplies , and he accordingly concluded , on the whole , to call a parliament .
he was in serious trouble .
laud was in serious trouble too .
he had been <unk> engaged for many years in establishing <unk> all over england , and in putting down , by force of law , all disposition to dissent from it ; and in attempting to produce , throughout the realm , one uniform system of <name> <name> and worship .
this was his idea of the perfection of religious order and right .
he used to make an annual visitation to all the <unk> in the realm ; inquire into the usages which prevailed there ; put a stop , so far as he could , to all irregularities ; and confirm and establish , by the most decisive measures , the episcopal authority .
he sent in his report to the king of the results of his inquiries , asking the king 's aid , where his own powers were insufficient , for the more full accomplishment of his plans .
but , notwithstanding all this diligence and zeal , he found that he met with very partial success .
the irregularities , as he called them , which he suppressed in one place , would break out in another ; the disposition to throw off the dominion of bishops was getting more and more extensive and deeply seated ; and now , the result of the religious revolution in scotland , and of the general excitement which it produced in england , was to widen and extend this feeling more than ever .
he did not , however , give up the contest , he employed an able writer to draw up a defense of <unk> , as the true and scriptural form of church government .
the book , when first prepared , was moderate in its tone , and allowed that in some particular cases a presbyterian mode of government might be admissible ; but laud , in <unk> the book , struck out these concessions as unnecessary and dangerous , and placed <unk> in full and exclusive possession of the ground , as the divinely instituted and only admissible form of church government and discipline .
he caused this book to be circulated ; but the attempt to reason with the <unk> , after having failed in the attempt to <unk> them , is not generally very successful .
the archbishop , in his report to the king this year of the state of things throughout his province , represents the spirit of <unk> to the church of england as getting too strong for him to control without more efficient help from the civil power ; but whether it would be wise , he added , to undertake any more effectual coercion in the present distracted state of the kingdom , he left it for the king to decide .
laud proposed that the council should recommend to the king the calling of a parliament .
at the same time , they passed a resolution that , in case the parliament " should prove <unk> , and refuse to <name> supplies , they would sustain the king in the resort to extraordinary measures . "
this was regarded as a threat , and did not help to <unk> the members favorably in regard to the feeling with which the king was to meet them .
the king ordered the parliament to be elected in december , but did not call them together until <name> .
in the mean time , he went on raising an army , so as to have his military preparations in readiness .
he , however , appointed a new set of officers to the command of this army , neglecting those who were in command before , as he had found them so little disposed to act efficiently in his cause .
he supplied the leader 's place with strafford .
this change produced very extensive murmurs of dissatisfaction , which , added to all the other causes of complaint , made the times look very dark and <name> .
the parliament assembled in <name> .
the king went into the house of lords , the commons being , as usual , summoned to the bar .
he addressed them as follows : " my lords and gentlemen ,  there was never a king who had a more great and weighty cause to call his people together than myself .
i <name> not trouble you with the particulars .
i have informed my lord keeper , and now command him to speak , and i <name> your attention . "
the keeper referred to was the keeper of the king 's seals , who was , of course , a great officer of state .
he made a speech , informing the houses , in general terms , of the king 's need of money , but said that it was not necessary for him to explain minutely the monarch 's plans , as they were exclusively his own concern .
we may as well quote his words , in order to show in what light the position and province of a british parliament was considered in those days .
" his majesty 's kingly resolutions , " said the lord keeper , " are seated in the ark of his sacred breast , and it were a presumption of too high a nature for any <unk> <unk> to touch it .
yet his majesty is now pleased to lay by the shining beams of majesty , as <unk> did to <unk> , that the distance between sovereignty and subjection should not bar you of that filial freedom of access to his person and counsels ; only let us beware how , with the son of <unk> , we aim not at the guiding of the chariot , as if that were the only testimony of <unk> affection ; and let us remember , that though the king sometimes lays by the beams and rays of majesty , he never lays by majesty itself . "
when the keeper had finished his speech , the king confirmed it by saying that he had exaggerated nothing , and the houses were left to their deliberations .
instead of proceeding to the business of raising money , they commenced an inquiry into the grievances , as they called them  that is , all the unjust acts and the <unk> of the government , of which the country had been complaining for the ten years during which there had been an intermission of parliaments .
the king did all in his power to arrest this course of procedure .
he sent them message after message , urging them to leave these things , and take up first the question of supplies .
he then sent a message to the house of peers , requesting them to interpose and exert their influence to lead the commons to act .
the peers did so .
the commons sent them back a reply that their interference in the business of supply , which belonged to the commons alone , was a breach of their privileges .
" and , " they added , " therefore , the commons <name> their <unk> in their wisdom to find out some way for the <unk> of their privileges broken by that act , and to prevent the like <unk> in future . "
thus repulsed on every hand , the king gave up the <name> of accomplishing any thing through the action of the house of commons , and he suddenly determined to dissolve parliament .
the session had continued only about three weeks .
in dissolving the parliament the king took no notice of the commons whatever , but addressed the lords alone .
the commons and the whole country were incensed at such capricious treatment of the national legislature .
the king and his council tried all summer to get the army ready to be put in motion .
the great difficulty , of course , was want of funds .
the <unk> , which was the great council of the church , and which was accustomed in those days to sit simultaneously with parliament , continued their session afterward in this case , and raised some money for the king .
the nobles of the court subscribed a considerable amount , also , which they lent him .
they wished to sustain him in his contest with the commons on their own account , and then , besides , they felt a personal interest in him , and a sympathy for him in the troubles which were thickening around him .
the summer months passed away in making the preparations and getting the various bodies of troops ready , and the military stores collected at the place of rendezvous in york and newcastle .
the scots , in the mean time , had been assembling their forces near the borders , and , being somewhat <unk> by their success in the previous campaign , crossed the frontier , and advanced boldly to meet the forces of the king .
they published a <unk> , declaring that they were not entering england with any hostile intent toward their sovereign , but were only coming to present to him their humble petitions for a redress of their grievances , which they said they were sure he would graciously receive as soon as he had opportunity to learn from them how great their grievances had been .
they respectfully requested that the people of england would allow them to pass safely and without molestation through the land , and promised to conduct themselves with the utmost propriety and decorum .
this promise they kept .
they avoided <unk> the inhabitants in any way , and purchased fairly every thing they consumed .
when the english officers learned that the scotch had crossed the tweed , they sent on immediately to london , to the king , urging him to come north at once , and join the army , with all the remaining forces at his command .
the king did so , but it was too late .
he arrived at york ; from york he went northward to reach the van of his army , which had been posted at newcastle , but on his way he was met by messengers saying that they were in full retreat , and that the scotch had got possession of newcastle .
the circumstances of the battle were these .
newcastle is upon the <unk> .
the banks at newcastle are steep and high , but about four miles above the town is a place called <unk> , where was a meadow near the river , and a convenient place to cross .
the scotch advanced in a very slow and orderly manner to <unk> , and encamped there .
the english sent a detachment from newcastle to arrest their progress .
the scotch begged them not to interrupt their march , as they were only going to present petitions to the king !
the english general , of course , paid no attention to this pretext .
the scotch army then attacked them and soon put them to flight .
the routed english soldiers fled to newcastle , and were there joined by all that portion of the army which was in newcastle , in a rapid retreat .
the scotch took possession of the town , but conducted themselves in a very orderly manner , and bought and paid for every thing they used .
the poor king was now in a situation of the most imminent and terrible danger .
rebel subjects were in full possession of one kingdom , and were now advancing at the head of victorious armies into the other .
he himself had entirely alienated the affections of a large portion of his subjects , and had openly quarreled with and dismissed the legislature .
he had no funds , and had exhausted all possible means of raising funds .
he was half distracted with the perplexities and dangers of his position .
his deciding on dissolving parliament in the spring was a hasty step , and he bitterly regretted it the moment the deed was done .
he wished to recall it .
he <unk> several days about the possibility of summoning the same members to meet again , and constituting them again a parliament .
but the lawyers insisted that this could not be done .
a dissolution was a dissolution .
the parliament , once dissolved , was no more .
it could not be brought to life again .
there must be new orders to the country to proceed to new elections .
to do this at once would have been too humiliating for the king .
he now found , however , that the necessity for it could no longer be postponed .
there was such a thing in the english history as a council of peers alone , called in a sudden emergency which did not allow of time for the elections necessary to constitute the house of commons .
<name> called such a council of peers to meet at york , and they immediately assembled .
in the mean time the scotch sent embassadors to york , saying to the king that they were advancing to lay their grievances before him !
they expressed great sorrow and regret at the victory which they had been compelled to gain over some forces that had attempted to prevent them from getting access to their sovereign .
the king laid this communication before the lords , and asked their advice what to do ; and also asked them to counsel him how he should provide funds to keep his army together until a parliament could be convened .
the lords advised him to appoint commissioners to meet the scotch , and endeavor to compromise the difficulties ; and to send to the city of london , asking that corporation to lend him a small sum until parliament could be assembled .
this advice was followed .
a temporary treaty was made with the rebels , although making a treaty with rebels is perhaps the most humiliating thing that a hereditary sovereign is ever compelled to do .
the <name> of strafford was , however , entirely opposed to this policy .
he urged the king most earnestly not to give up the contest without a more decisive struggle .
he represented to him the danger of beginning to yield to the torrent which he now began to see would overwhelm them all if it was allowed to have its way .
he tried to persuade the king that the scots might yet be driven back , and that it would be possible to get along without a parliament .
he dreaded a parliament .
the king , however , and his other advisers , thought that they must yield a little to the storm .
strafford then wanted to be allowed to return to his post in ireland , where he thought that he should probably be safe from the terrible enmity which he must have known that he had awakened in england , and which he thought a parliament would concentrate and bring upon his devoted head .
but the king would not consent to this .
he assured strafford that if a parliament should assemble , he would take care that they should not hurt a hair of his head .
unfortunate monarch !
how little he foresaw that that very parliament , from whose violence he thus promised to defend his favorite servant so completely as to insure him from the slightest injury , would begin by taking off his favorite 's head , and end with taking off his own !

the parliament assembled in november , <unk> .
the king proceeded to london to attend it .
he left strafford in command of the army at york .
active hostilities had been suspended , as a sort of temporary truce had been concluded with the scots , to prepare the way for a final treaty .
strafford had been entirely opposed to this , being still full of energy and courage .
the king , however , began to feel alarmed .
he went to london to meet the parliament which he had summoned , but he was prepared to meet them in a very different spirit from that which he had manifested on former occasions .
he even gave up all the external circumstances of pomp and parade with which the opening of parliament had usually been attended .
he had been accustomed to go to the house of lords in state , with a numerous retinue and great parade .
now he was conveyed from his palace along the river in a barge , in a quiet and unostentatious manner .
his opening speech , too , was moderate and conciliatory .
in a word , it was pretty evident to the commons that the proud and haughty spirit of their <name> master was beginning to be pretty effectually humbled .
of course , now , in proportion as the king should falter , the commons would grow bold .
the house immediately began to attack laud and strafford in their speeches .
it is the theory of the british constitution that the king can do no wrong ; whatever <unk> at any time attaches to the acts of his administration , belongs to his advisers , not to himself .
the speakers condemned , in most decided terms , the arbitrary and tyrannical course which the government had pursued during the intermission of parliaments , but charged it all , not to the king , but to strafford and laud .
strafford had been , as they considered , the responsible person in civil and military affairs , and laud in those of the church .
these speeches were made to try the temper of the house and of the country , and see whether there was hostility enough to laud and strafford in the house and in the country , and boldness enough in the expression of it , to warrant their impeachment .
the attacks thus made in the house against the two ministers were made very soon .
within a week after the opening of parliament , one of the members , after <unk> a long time against the encroachments and tyranny of archbishop laud , whose title , according to english usage , was " his <name> , " said he hoped that , before the year ran round , his <name> would either have more <name> or no <name> at all ; " for , " he added , " our manifold griefs do fill a mighty and vast circumference , yet in such a manner that from every part our lines of sorrow do meet in him , and point at him the center , from whence our miseries in this church , and many of them in the commonwealth , do flow . "
he said , also , that if they must submit to a pope , he would rather obey one that was as far off as the tiber , than to have him come as near as the thames .
similar denunciations were made against strafford , and they awakened no opposition .
on the contrary , it was found that the feeling of hostility against both the ministers was so universal and so strong , that the leaders began to think seriously of an impeachment on a charge of high treason .
high treason is the greatest crime known to the english law , and the punishment for it , especially in the case of a peer of the realm , is very terrible .
this punishment was generally inflicted by what was called a <name> of attainder , which brought with it the worst of penalties .
it implied the perfect destruction of the criminal in every sense .
he was to lose his life by having his head cut off upon a block .
his body , according to the strict letter of the law , was to be mutilated in a manner too shocking to be here described .
his children were <unk> , and his property all forfeited .
this was considered as the consequence of the <unk> of the blood , which rendered it corrupt , and incapable of transmitting an inheritance .
in fact , it was the intention of the <name> of attainder to brand the wretched object of it with complete and perpetual infamy .
the proceedings , too , in the impeachment and trial of a high minister of state , were always very imposing and solemn .
the impeachment must be moved by the commons , and tried by the peers .
a peer of the realm could be tried by no inferior tribunal .
when the commons proposed bringing articles of impeachment against an officer of state , they sent first a messenger to the house of peers to ask them to arrest the person whom they intended to accuse , and to hold him for trial until they should have their articles prepared .
the house of peers would comply with this request , and a time would be appointed for the trial .
the commons would frame the charges , and appoint a certain number of their members to manage the prosecution .
they would collect evidence , and get every thing ready for the trial .
when the time arrived , the chamber of the house of peers would be arranged as a court room , or they would assemble in some other hall more suitable for the purpose , the prisoner would be brought to the bar , the commissioners on the part of the commons would appear with their documents and their evidence , persons of distinction would assemble to listen to the proceedings , and the trial would go on .
it was in accordance with this routine that the commons commenced proceedings against the <name> of strafford , very soon after the opening of the session , by appointing a committee to inquire whether there was any just cause to accuse him of treason .
the committee reported to the house that there was just cause .
the house then appointed a messenger to go to the house of lords , saying that they had found that there was just cause to accuse the <name> of strafford of high treason , and to ask that they would <unk> him from the house , as the phrase was , and hold him in custody till they could prepare the charges and the evidence against him .
all these proceedings were in secret session , in order that strafford might not get warning and fly .
the commons then nearly all accompanied their messenger to the house of lords , to show how much in <name> they were .
the lords complied with the request .
they caused the <name> to be arrested and committed to the charge of the usher of the black <name> , and sent two officers to the commons to inform them that they had done so .
the usher of the black <name> is a very important officer of the house of lords .
he is a sort of sheriff , to execute the various <unk> of the house , having officers to serve under him for this purpose .
the badge of his office has been , for centuries , a black <name> with a golden lion at the upper end , which is borne before him as the emblem of his authority .
a peer of the realm , when charged with treason , is committed to the custody of this officer .
in this case he took the <name> of strafford under his charge , and kept him at his house , properly guarded .
the commons went on preparing the articles of impeachment .
this was in november .
during the <name> following the parties struggled one against another , laud doing all in his power to strengthen the position of the king , and to avert the dangers which threatened himself and strafford .
the animosity , however , which was felt against him , was steadily increasing .
the house of commons did many things to <unk> the rites and usages of the episcopal church , and to make them odious .
the excitement among the populace increased , and mobs began to interfere with the service in some of the churches in london and westminster .
at last a mob of five hundred persons assembled around the archbishop 's palace at <unk> .
[ e ] this palace , as has been before stated , is on the bank of the thames , just above london , opposite to westminster .
the mob were there for two hours , beating at the doors and windows in an attempt to force admission , but in vain .
the palace was very strongly guarded , and the mob were at length repulsed .
one of the <unk> was taken and hanged .
[ footnote e : see view of this palace on <name> 133 . ]
one would have thought that this sort of persecution would have awakened some sympathy in the archbishop 's favor ; but it was too late .
he had been bearing down so mercilessly himself upon the people of england for so many years , suppressing , by the severest measures , all expressions of discontent , that the hatred had become entirely uncontrollable .
its breaking out at one point only promoted its breaking out in another .
the house of commons sent a messenger to the house of lords , as they had done in the case of strafford , saying that they had found good cause to accuse the archbishop of canterbury of treason , and asked that he might be <unk> from the house , and held in custody till they could prepare their charges , and the evidence to sustain them .
the archbishop was at that time in his seat .
he was directed to withdraw .
before leaving the chamber he asked leave to say a few words .
permission was granted , and he said in substance that he was truly sorry to have awakened in the hearts of his countrymen such a degree of displeasure as was obviously excited against him .
he was most unhappy to have lived to see the day in which he was made subject to a charge of treason .
he begged their <unk> to look at the whole course of his life , and he was sure that they would be convinced that there was not a single member of the house of commons who could really think him guilty of such a charge .
here one of the lords interrupted him to say that by speaking in that manner he was uttering slander against the house of commons , charging them with solemnly bringing accusations which they did not believe to be true .
the archbishop then said , that if the charge must be entertained , he hoped that he should have a fair trial , according to the ancient parliamentary usages of the realm .
another of the lords interrupted him again , saying that such a remark was improper , as it was not for him to <unk> the manner in which the proceedings should be conducted .
he then withdrew , while the house should consider what course to take .
presently he was summoned back to the bar of the house , and there committed to the charge of the usher of the black <name> .
the usher conducted him to his house , and he was kept there for ten weeks in close confinement .
at last the time for the trial of strafford came on , while laud was in confinement .
the interest felt in the trial was deep and universal .
there were three kingdoms , as it were , combined against one man .
various measures were resorted to by the commons to diminish the possibility that the accused should escape conviction .
some of them have since been thought to be unjust and cruel .
for example , several persons who were strong friends of strafford , and who , as was supposed , might offer testimony in his favor , were charged with treason and confined in prison until the trial was over .
the commons appointed thirteen persons to manage the prosecution .
these persons were many months preparing the charges and the evidence , keeping their whole proceedings profoundly secret during all the time .
at last the day approached , and westminster hall was fitted up and prepared to be the scene of the trial .
[ illustration : westminster hall ] westminster hall has the name of being the largest room whose roof is not supported by pillars , in europe .
it stands in the region of the palaces and the houses of parliament at westminster , and has been for seven centuries the scene of pageants and ceremonies without number .
it is said that ten thousand persons have been accommodated in it at a banquet .
[ f ] this great room was fitted up for the trial .
seats were provided for both houses of parliament ; for the commons were to be present as <unk> , and the lords as the court .
there was , as usual , a chair of state , or throne , for the king , as a matter of form .
there was also a private gallery , screened from the observation of the spectators , where the king and <name> could sit and witness the proceedings .
they attended during the whole trial .
[ footnote f : it is two hundred and seventy feet long , seventy-five wide , and ninety high . ]
one would have supposed that the deliberate solemnity of these preparations would have calmed the animosity of strafford 's enemies , and led them to be satisfied at last with something less than his utter destruction .
but this seems not to have been the effect .
the terrible hostilities which had been gathering strength so long , seemed to rage all the more fiercely now that there was a prospect of their gratification .
and yet it was very hard to find any thing sufficiently distinct and tangible against the accused to warrant his conviction .
the commissioners who had been appointed to manage the case divided the charges among them .
when the trial commenced , they stated and urged these charges in succession .
strafford , who had not known beforehand what they were to be , replied to them , one by one , with calmness and composure , and yet with great eloquence and power .
the extraordinary abilities which he had shown through the whole course of his life , seemed to shine out with increased splendor amid the awful solemnities which were now darkening its close .
he was firm and undaunted , and yet respectful and submissive .
the natural excitements of the occasion ; the imposing assembly ; the breathless attention ; the magnificent hall ; the consciousness that the opposition which he was struggling to stem before that great tribunal was the combined hostility of three kingdoms , and that the torrent was flowing from a reservoir which had been accumulating for many years ; and that the whole civilized world were looking on with great interest to watch the result ; and perhaps , more than all , that he was in the unseen presence of his sovereign , whom he was accustomed to look upon as the greatest personage on earth ; these , and the other circumstances of the scene , filled his mind with strong emotions , and gave animation , and energy , and a lofty eloquence to all that he said .
the trial lasted eighteen days , the excitement increasing consistently to the end .
there was nothing proved which could with any propriety be considered as treason .
he had managed the government , it is true , with one set of views in respect to the absolute prerogatives and powers of the king , while those who now were in possession of power held opposite views , and they considered it a matter of necessity that he should die .
the charge of treason was a pretext to bring the case somewhat within the reach of the formalities of law .
it is one of the necessary incidents of all governmental systems founded on force , and not on the consent of the governed , that when great and fundamental questions of policy arise , they often bring the country to a crisis in which there can be no real settlement of the dispute without the absolute destruction of one party or the other .
it was so now , as the popular leaders supposed .
they had determined that stern necessity required that laud and strafford must die ; and the only object of going through the formality of a trial was to soften the violence of the proceeding a little , by doing all that could be done toward establishing a legal justification of the deed .
the trial , as has been said , lasted eighteen days .
during all this time , the leaders were not content with simply urging the proceedings forward energetically in westminster hall .
they were <unk> and managing in every possible way to secure the final vote .
but , notwithstanding this , strafford 's defense was so able , and the failure to make out the charge of treason against him was so clear , that it was doubtful what the result would be .
accordingly , without waiting for the decision of the peers on the impeachment , a <name> of attainder against the <name> was brought forward in the house of commons .
this <name> of attainder was passed by a large majority  <unk> 204 , <unk> 59 .
it was then sent to the house of lords .
the lords were very unwilling to pass it .
while they were debating it , the king sent a message to them to say that in his opinion the <name> had not been guilty of treason , or of any attempt to <unk> the laws ; and that several things which had been alleged in the trial , and on which the <name> of attainder chiefly rested , were not true .
he was willing , however , if it would satisfy the enemies of the <name> , to have him convicted of a <unk> , and made incapable of holding any public office from that time ; but he protested against his being punished by a <name> of attainder on a charge of treason .
this interposition of the king in strafford 's favor awakened loud expressions of displeasure .
they called it an interference with the action of one of the houses of parliament .
the enemies of strafford created a great excitement against him out of doors .
they raised clamorous calls for his execution , among the populace .
the people made black lists of the names of persons who were in the <name> 's favor , and posted them up in public places , calling such persons <unk> , and threatening them with public vengeance .
the lords , who would have been willing to have saved strafford 's life if they had dared , began to find that they could not do so without <unk> their own .
when at last the vote came to be taken in the house of lords , out of eighty members who had been present at the trial , only forty-six were present to vote , and the <name> was passed by a vote of thirty-five to eleven .
the thirty-four who were absent were probably all against the <name> , but were afraid to appear .
the responsibility now devolved upon the king .
an act of parliament must be signed by the king .
he really <unk> it .
the action of the two houses is , in theory , only a recommendation of the measure to him .
the king was determined on no account to give his consent to <unk> condemnation .
he , however , laid the subject before his privy council .
they , after <unk> upon it , recommended that he should sign the <name> .
nothing else , they said , could allay the terrible storm which was raging , and the king ought to prefer the peace and safety of the realm to the life of any one man , however innocent he might be .
the populace , in the mean time , crowded around the king 's palace at whitehall , calling out " justice !
justice !  " and filling the air with threats and imprecations ; and preachers in their pulpits urged the necessity of punishing offenders , and <unk> on the iniquity which those magistrates committed who allowed great <unk> to escape the penalty due for their crimes .
the <name> , too , was alarmed .
she begged the king , with tears , not any longer to attempt to withstand the torrent which threatened to sweep them all away in its fury .
while things were in this state , <name> received a letter from strafford in the tower , expressing his consent , and even his request , that the king should yield and sign the <name> .
the tower of london is very celebrated in english history .
though called simply by the name of the tower , it is , in fact , as <name> be seen by the engraving in the frontispiece , an extended group of buildings , which are of all ages , sizes , and shapes , and covering an extensive area .
it is situated below the city of london , having been originally built as a fortification for the defense of the city .
its use for this purpose has , however , long since passed away .
strafford said , in his letter to the king , " to set your majesty 's conscience at <name> , i do most humbly beseech your majesty for prevention of evils , which may happen by your refusal , to pass this <name> .
sir , my consent shall more acquit you herein to god , than all the world can do besides ; to a willing man there is no injury done ; and as by god 's <name> , i forgive all the world , with a calmness and meekness of infinite contentment to my <unk> soul , so , sir , to you i can give the life of this world with all the cheerfulness imaginable , in the just acknowledgment of your exceeding favors ; and only beg that in your goodness you would <unk> to cast your gracious regard upon my poor son and his three sisters , less or more , and no otherwise than as their unfortunate father may hereafter appear more or less guilty of this death .
god long preserve your majesty . "
on receiving this letter the king caused the <name> to be signed .
he would not do it with his own hands , but commissioned two of his council to do it in his name .
he then sent a messenger to strafford to announce the decision , and to inform him that he must prepare to die .
the messenger observed that the <name> seemed surprised ; and after hearing that the king had signed the <name> , he quoted , in a tone of despair , the words of scripture , " put not your trust in princes , nor in the sons of men , for in them is no salvation . "
historians have thought it strange that strafford should have expressed this disappointment when he had himself requested the king to resist the popular <name> no longer ; and they infer from it that he was not sincere in the request , but supposed that the king would regard it as an act of nobleness and generosity on his part , that would render him more unwilling than ever to consent to his destruction , and that he was accordingly surprised and disappointed when he found that the king had taken him at his word .
it is said , however , by some historians , that this letter was a forgery , and that it was written by some of strafford 's enemies to lead the king to resist no longer .
the reader , by perusing the letter again , can perhaps form some judgment whether such a document was more likely to have been <unk> by enemies , or really written by the unhappy prisoner himself .
the king did not entirely give up the <name> of saving his friend , even after the <name> of attainder was signed .
he addressed the following message to the house of lords .
my lords ,  i did yesterday satisfy the justice of this kingdom by passing the <name> of attainder against the <name> of strafford : but <name> being as inherent and inseparable to a king as justice , i <name> at this time in some measure to show that likewise , by suffering that unfortunate man to fulfill the natural course of his life in a close imprisonment : yet so , if ever he make the least offer to escape , or offer directly or indirectly to meddle in any sort of public business , especially with me either by message or letter , it shall cost him his life without farther process .
this , if it may be done without the <unk> of my people , <name> be an unspeakable contentment to me .
" i <name> not say that your complying with me in this my intended <name> , shall make me more willing , but certainly 'twill make me more cheerful in granting your just grievances : but if no less than his life can <unk> my people , i must say let justice be done .
thus again recommending the consideration of my intention to you , i rest , " your unalterable and affectionate friend , " <name> r. " [ illustration : strafford and laud ] the lords were inexorable .
three days from the time of signing the <name> , arrangements were made for conducting the prisoner to the scaffold .
laud , who had been his friend and <unk> in the king 's service , was confined also in the tower , awaiting his turn to come to trial .
they were not allowed to visit each other , but strafford sent word to laud requesting him to be at his window at the time when he was to pass , to bid him farewell , and to give him his blessing .
laud accordingly appeared at the window , and strafford , as he passed , asked for the <unk> 's prayers and for his blessing .
the old man , for laud was now nearly seventy years of age , attempted to speak , but he could not command himself sufficiently to express what he wished to say , and he fell back into the arms of his attendants .
" god protect you , " said strafford , and walked calmly on .
he went to the place of execution with the composure and courage of a hero .
he spoke freely to those around him , asserted his innocence , sent messages to his absent friends , and said he was ready and willing to die .
the scaffold , in such executions as this , is a platform slightly raised , with a block and chairs upon it , all covered with black cloth .
a part of the dress has to be removed just before the execution , in order that the neck of the sufferer may be fully exposed to the impending blow .
strafford made these preparations himself , and said , as he did so , that he was in no wise afraid of death , but that he should lay his head upon that block as cheerfully as he ever did upon his pillow .
* * * * * <name> found his position in no respect improved by the execution of strafford .
the commons , finding their influence and power increasing , grew more and more bold , and were from this time so absorbed in the events connected with the progress of their quarrel with the king , that they left laud to pine in his prison for about four years .
they then found time to act over again the solemn and awful scene of a trial for treason before the house of peers , the passing of a <name> of attainder , and an execution on tower hill .
laud was over seventy years of age when the ax fell upon him .
he submitted to his fate with a calmness and heroism in keeping with his age and his character .
he said , in fact , that none of his enemies could be more desirous to send him out of life than he was to go .

the way in which the king came at last to a final rupture with parliament was this .
the victory which the commons gained in the case of strafford had greatly increased their confidence and their power , and the king found , for some months afterward , that instead of being satisfied with the concessions he had made , they were continually demanding more .
the more he yielded , the more they <unk> .
they grew , in a word , bolder and bolder , in proportion to their success .
they considered themselves doing the state a great and good service by <unk> tyranny of its power .
the king , on the other hand , considered them as undermining all the foundations of good government , and as depriving him of personal rights , the most sacred and solemn that could vest in any human being .
it <name> be recollected that on former occasions , when the king had got into contention with a parliament , he had dissolved it , and either attempted to govern without one , or else had called for a new election , hoping that the new members would be more <unk> .
but he could not dissolve the parliament now .
they had provided against this danger .
at the time of the trial of strafford , they brought in a <name> into the commons providing that thenceforth the houses could not be <unk> or dissolved without their own consent .
the commons , of course , passed the <name> very readily .
the peers were more reluctant , but they did not dare to reject it .
the king was extremely unwilling to sign the <name> ; but , amid the terrible excitements and dangers of that trial , he was overborne by the influences of danger and <unk> which surrounded him .
he signed the <name> .
of course the commons were , thereafter , their own masters .
however dangerous or destructive the king might consider their course of conduct to be , he could now no longer arrest it , as heretofore , by a dissolution .
he went on , therefore , till the close of <unk> , yielding slowly and reluctantly , and with many struggles , but still all the time yielding , to the resistless current which bore him along .
at last he resolved to yield no longer .
after retreating so long , he determined suddenly and desperately to turn back and attack his enemies .
the whole world looked on with astonishment at such a sudden change of his policy .
the measure which he resorted to was this .
he determined to select a number of the most efficient and prominent men in parliament , who had been leaders in the proceedings against him , and demand their arrest , imprisonment , and trial , on a charge of high treason .
the king was influenced to do this partly by the advice of the <name> , and of the ladies of the court , and other persons who did not understand how deep and strong the torrent was which they thus urged him to attempt to stem .
they thought that if he would show a little courage and energy in facing these men , they would yield in their turn , and that their boldness and success was owing , in a great measure , to the king 's want of spirit in resisting them .
" strike boldly at them , " said they ; " seize the leaders ; have them tried , and condemned , and executed .
threaten the rest with the same fate ; and follow up these measures with energetic and decisive action , and you <name> soon make a change in the aspect of affairs . "
the king adopted this policy , and he did make a change in the aspect of affairs , but not such a change as his advisers had anticipated .
the commons were thrown suddenly into a state of astonishment one day by the appearance of a king 's officer in the house , who rose and read articles of a charge of treason against five of the most influential and popular members .
the officer asked that a committee should be appointed to hear the evidence against them which the king was preparing .
the commons , on hearing this , immediately voted , that if any person should attempt even to seize the papers of the persons accused , it should be lawful for them to resist such an attempt by every means in their power .
the next day another officer appeared at the bar of the house of commons , and spoke as follows .
" i am commanded by the king 's majesty , my master , upon my allegiance , that i should come to the house of commons , and require of mr. speaker five gentlemen , members of the house of commons ; and those gentlemen being delivered , i am commanded to arrest them in his majesty 's name , on a charge of high treason . "
the commons , on hearing this demand , voted that they would take it into consideration .
the king 's friends and advisers urged him to follow the matter up vigorously .
every thing depended , they said , on firmness and decision .
the next day , accordingly , the king determined to go himself to the house , and make the demand in person .
a <name> of the court , who was made acquainted with this plan , sent notice of it to the house .
in going , the king took his guard with him , and several personal attendants .
the number of soldiers was said to be five hundred .
he left this great retinue at the door , and he himself entered the house .
the commons , when they heard that he was coming , had ordered the five members who were accused to withdraw .
they went out just before the king came in .
the king advanced to the speaker 's chair , took his seat , and made the following address .
" gentlemen ,  i am sorry for this occasion of coming unto you .
yesterday i sent a sergeant at arms upon a very important occasion to apprehend some that by my command were accused of high treason ; <unk> i did expect obedience and not a message .
and i must declare unto you here , that albeit no king that ever was in england shall be more careful of your privileges , to maintain them to the uttermost of his power , than i shall be ; yet you must know that in cases of treason no person hath a privilege ; and therefore i am come to know if any of those persons that were accused are here .
for i must tell you , gentlemen , that so long as these persons that i have accused ( for no slight crime , but for treason ) are here , i can not expect that this house <name> be in the right way that i do heartily wish it .
therefore i am come to tell you that i must have them wherever i find them . "
after looking around , and finding that the members in question were not in the hall , he continued : " well !
since i see the birds are flown , i do expect from you that you shall send them unto me as soon as they return hither .
but i assure you , on the word of a king , i never did intend any force , but shall proceed against them in a legal and fair way , for i never meant any other .
" i <name> trouble you no more , but tell you i do expect , as soon as they come to the house , you <name> send them to me , otherwise i must take my own course to find them . "
the king 's coming thus into the house of commons , and demanding in person that they should act according to his instructions , was a very extraordinary circumstance  perhaps unparalleled in english history .
it produced the greatest excitement .
when he had finished his address , he turned to the speaker and asked him where those men were .
he had his guard ready at the door to seize them .
it is difficult for us , in this country , to understand fully to how severe a test this sudden question put the presence of mind and courage of the speaker ; for we can not realize the profound and awful deference which was felt in those days for the command of a king .
the speaker gained great applause for the manner in which he stood the trial .
he fell upon his knees before the great potentate who had addressed him , and said , " i have , sir , neither eyes to see , nor tongue to speak , in this place , but as the house is pleased to direct me , whose servant i am .
and i humbly ask pardon that i can not give any other answer to what your majesty is pleased to demand of me . "
the house was immediately in a state of great excitement and confusion .
they called out " privilege !
privilege !  " meaning that their privileges were violated .
they immediately adjourned .
news of the affair spread every where with the greatest rapidity , and produced universal and intense excitement .
the king 's friends were astonished at such an act of rashness and folly , which , it is said , only one of the king 's advisers knew anything about , and he immediately fled .
the five members accused went that night into the city of london , and called on the government and people of london to protect them .
the people armed themselves .
in a word , the king found at night that he had raised a very threatening and terrible storm .
the commons met the next morning , but did not attempt to transact business .
they simply voted that it was useless for them to proceed with their deliberations , while exposed to such <unk> of their rights .
they appointed a committee of twenty-four to inquire into and report the circumstances of the king 's intrusion into their councils , and to consider how this breach of their privileges could be repaired .
they ordered this committee to sit in the city of london , where they might <name> to be safe from such interruptions , and then the house adjourned for a week , to await the result of the <unk> deliberations .
the committee went to london .
in the mean time , news went all over the kingdom that the house of commons had been compelled to suspend its sittings on account of an illegal and <unk> interference with their proceedings on the part of the king .
the king was alarmed ; but those who had advised him to adopt this measure told him that he must not falter now .
he must persevere and <name> his point , or all would be lost .
he accordingly did persevere .
he brought troops and arms to his palace at whitehall , to be ready to defend it in case of attack .
he sent in to london , and ordered the lord mayor to assemble the city authorities at the <unk> , which is the great city hall of london ; and then , with a retinue of noblemen , he went in to meet them .
the people shouted , " privileges of parliament !
privileges of parliament !  " as he passed along .
some called out , " to your tents , o <name> !  " which was the ancient hebrew cry of rebellion .
the king , however , persevered .
when he reached the <unk> , he addressed the city authorities thus : " gentlemen ,  i am come to demand such persons as i have already accused of high treason , and do believe are shrouded in the city .
i <name> no good man <name> keep them from me .
their offenses are treason and <unk> of a high nature .
i <name> your assistance , that they may be brought to a legal trial . "
three days after this the king issued a proclamation , addressed to all magistrates and officers of justice every where , to arrest the accused members and <name> them to the tower .
in the mean time , the committee of twenty-four continued their session in london , examining witnesses and preparing their report .
when the time arrived for the house of commons to meet again , which was on the 11th of <name> , the city made preparations to have the committee escorted in an imposing manner from the <unk> to westminster .
a vast amount of the intercommunication and traffic between different portions of the city then , as now , took place upon the river , though in those days it was managed by <unk> , who rowed small <unk> to and fro .
innumerable steamboats take the place of the <unk> at the present day , and <unk> and engineers have superseded the <unk> .
the <unk> were then , however , a large and formidable body , banded together , like the other trades of london , in one great organization .
this great company turned out on this occasion , and attended the committee in barges on the river , while the military companies of the city marched along the streets upon the land .
the committee themselves went in barges on the water , and all london flocked to see the spectacle .
the king , hearing of these arrangements , was alarmed for his personal safety , and left his palace at whitehall to go to hampton court , which was a little way out of town .
the committee , after entering the house , reported that the transaction which they had been considering constituted a high breach of the privileges of the house , and was a <unk> act , tending to a <unk> of the peace of the kingdom ; and that the privileges of parliament , so violated and broken , could not be sufficiently <unk> , unless his majesty would be pleased to inform them who advised him to do such a deed .
the king was more and more seriously alarmed .
he found that the storm of public <unk> and indignation was too great for him to withstand .
he began to fear for his own safety more than ever .
he removed from hampton court to windsor castle , a stronger place , and more remote from london than hampton court ; and he now determined to give up the contest .
he sent a message , therefore , to the house , saying that , on further reflection , since so many persons had doubts whether his proceedings against the five members were consistent with the privileges of parliament , he would <unk> them , and the whole subject might rest until the minds of men were more composed , and then , if he proceeded against the accused members at all , he would do so in a manner to which no exception could be taken .
he said , also , he would henceforth be as careful of their privileges as he should be of his own life or crown .
thus he acknowledged himself vanquished in the struggle , but the acknowledgment came too late to save him .
the excitement increased , and spread in every direction .
the party of the king and that of the parliament disputed for a few months about these occurrences , and others growing out of them , and then each began to <unk> and struggle to get possession of the military power of the kingdom .
the king , finding himself not safe in the vicinity of london , retreated to york , and began to assemble and organize his followers .
parliament sent him a declaration that if he did not <unk> the forces which he was assembling , they should be compelled to provide measures for securing the peace of the kingdom .
the king replied by proclamations calling upon his subjects to join his standard .
in a word , before midsummer , the country was plunged in the horrors of civil war .
a civil war , that is , a war between two parties in the same country , is generally far more savage and sanguinary than any other .
the hatred and the animosities which it creates , <unk> throughout the country , and produce universal conflict and misery .
if there were a war between <name> and england , there might be one , or perhaps two invading armies of frenchmen attempting to penetrate into the interior .
all england would be united against them .
husbands and wives , parents and children , neighbors and friends , would be drawn together more closely than ever ; while the awful scenes of war and bloodshed , the excitement , the passion , the terror , would be confined to a few detached spots , or to a few lines of march which the invading armies had occupied .
in a civil war , however , it is very different .
every distinct portion of the country , every village and hamlet , and sometimes almost every family , is divided against itself .
the hostility and hatred , too , between the combatants , is always far more intense and bitter than that which is felt against a foreign foe .
we might at first be surprised at this .
we might imagine that where men are contending with their neighbors and <unk> , the recollection of past friendships and good-will , and various lingering ties of regard , would moderate the fierceness of their anger , and make them more considerate and forbearing .
but this is not found to be the case .
each party considers the other as not only enemies , but traitors , and accordingly they hate and abhor each other with a double intensity .
if an englishman has a frenchman to combat , he meets him with a murderous impetuosity , it is true , but without any special bitterness of animosity .
he expects the frenchman to be his enemy .
he even thinks he has a sort of natural right to be so .
he <name> kill him if he can ; but then , if he takes him prisoner , there is nothing in his feelings toward him to prevent his treating him with generosity , and even with kindness .
he hates him , but there is a sort of <unk> in his hatred , after all .
on the other hand , when he fights against his countrymen in a civil war , he <unk> and hates with <unk> bitterness the <unk> ingratitude which he thinks his neighbors and friends evince in turning enemies to their country .
he can see no honesty , no truth , no courage in any thing they do .
they are infinitely worse , in his estimation , than the most ferocious of foreign foes .
civil war is , consequently , always the means of far wider and more terrible mischief than any other human calamity .
in the contention between <name> and the parliament , the various elements of the social state adhered to one side or the other , according to their natural <unk> .
the <unk> generally joined the king , the presbyterians the parliament .
the gentry and the nobility favored the king ; the mechanics , artisans , merchants , and common people the parliament .
the rural districts of country , which were under the control of the great <unk> , the king ; the cities and towns , the parliament .
the <name> , and fashionable , and worldly , the king ; the <unk> and austere , the parliament .
thus every thing was divided .
the quarrel <unk> to every hamlet and to every fireside , and the peace and happiness of the realm were effectually destroyed .
both sides began to raise armies and to prepare for war .
before commencing hostilities , however , the king was persuaded by his counselors to send a messenger to london and propose some terms of accommodation .
he accordingly sent the <name> of southampton to the house of peers , and two other persons to the house of commons .
he had no expectation , probably , of making peace , but he wanted to gain time to get his army together , and also to strengthen his cause among the people by showing a disposition to do all in his power to avoid open war .
the messengers of the king went to london , and made their appearance in the two houses of parliament .
the house of lords ordered the <name> of southampton to withdraw , and to send his communication in writing , and in the mean time to retire out of london , and wait for their answer .
the house of commons , in the same spirit of hostility and defiance , ordered the messengers which had been sent to them to come to the bar , like humble <unk> or criminals , and make their communication there .
the propositions of the king to the houses of parliament were , that they should appoint a certain number of commissioners , and he also the same number , to meet and confer together in <name> of agreeing upon some conditions of peace .
the houses passed a vote in reply , declaring that they had been doing all in their power to preserve the peace of the kingdom , while the king had been interrupting and disturbing it by his military gatherings , and by proclamations , in which they were called traitors ; and that they could enter into no treaty with him until he disbanded the armies which he had collected , and recalled his proclamations .
to this the king replied that he had never intended to call them traitors ; and that when they would recall their declarations and votes <unk> those who adhered to him as traitors , he would recall his proclamations .
thus messages passed back and forth two or three times , each party <unk> the other , and neither willing to make the concessions which the other required .
at last all <name> of an accommodation was abandoned , and both sides prepared for war .
the nobility and gentry flocked to the king 's standard .
they brought their plate , their jewels , and their money , to provide funds .
some of them brought their servants .
there were two companies in the king's guard , one of which consisted of gentlemen , and the other of their servants .
these two companies were always kept together .
there was the greatest zeal and enthusiasm among the upper classes to serve the king , and equal zeal and enthusiasm among the common people to serve the parliament .
the war continued for four years .
during all this time the armies marched and <unk> all over the kingdom , carrying ruin and destruction wherever they went , and plunging the whole country in misery .
[ illustration : the king 's adherents entering york . ]
at one of the battles which was fought , the celebrated <name> hampden , the man who would not pay his ship money , was slain .
he had been a very energetic and efficient officer on the parliamentary side , and was much dreaded by the forces of the king .
at one of the battles between <name> <name> , <name> 's nephew , and the army of the parliament , the <name> brought to the king 's camp a large number of prisoners which he had taken .
one of the prisoners said he was confident that hampden was hurt , for he saw him riding off the field before the battle was over , with his head hanging down , and his hands clasping the neck of his horse .
they heard the next day that he had been wounded in the shoulder .
inflammation and fever ensued , and he died a few days afterward in great agony .
this <name> <name> was a very famous character in all these wars .
he was young and ardent , and full of courage and enthusiasm .
he was always foremost , and ready to embark in the most daring undertakings .
he was the son of the king 's sister <name> , who married the <unk> <unk> , as narrated in a preceding chapter .
he was famous not only for his military skill and attainments , but for his knowledge of science , and for his ingenuity in many philosophical arts .
there is a mode of engraving called <unk> , which is somewhat easier of execution than the common mode , and produces a peculiar effect .
<name> <name> is said to have been the inventor of it , though , as is the case with almost all other inventions , there is a dispute about it .
he discovered a mode of dropping melted glass into water so as to form little pear-shaped globules , with a long slender tail .
these globules have this remarkable property , that if the tip of the tail is broken off ever so gently , the whole flies into atoms with an explosion .
these drops of glass are often exhibited at the present day , and are called <name> <name> 's drops .
the <name> also discovered a very tenacious composition of metals for casting cannon .
as artillery is necessarily very heavy , and very difficult to be transported on marches and upon the field of battle , it becomes very important to discover such metallic compounds as have the greatest strength and tenacity in resisting the force of an explosion .
<name> <name> invented such a compound , which is called by his name .
there were not only a great many battles and fierce encounters between the two great parties in this civil war , but there were also , at times , temporary <unk> of the hostilities , and negotiations for peace .
but it is very hard to make peace between two powers engaged in civil war .
each considers the other as acting the part of rebels and traitors , and there is a difficulty , almost insuperable , in the way of even opening negotiations between them .
still the people became tired of the war .
at one time , when the king had made some propositions which the parliament would not accept , an immense assemblage of women collected together , with white ribbons in their hats , to go to the house of commons with a petition for peace .
when they reached the door of the hall their number was five thousand .
they called out , " peace !
peace !
give us those traitors that are against peace , that we may tear them to pieces . "
the guards who were stationed at the door were ordered to fire at this crowd , loading their guns , however , only with powder .
this , it was thought , would frighten them away ; but the women only laughed at the volley , and returned it with stones and <unk> , and drove the guards away .
other troops were then sent for , who charged upon the women with their swords , and cut them in their faces and hands , and thus at length dispersed them .
during the progress of the war , the <name> returned from the continent and joined the king .
she had some difficulty , however , and encountered some personal danger , in her efforts to return to her husband .
the <unk> , who had command of the english ships off the coast , received orders to intercept her .
he watched for her .
she contrived , however , to elude his vigilance , though there were four ships in her convoy .
she landed at a town called burlington , or <unk> , in yorkshire .
this town stands in a very picturesque situation , a little south of a famous promontory called <unk> head , of which there is a beautiful view from the pier of the town .
the <name> succeeded in landing here .
on her arrival at the town , she found herself worn down with the anxiety and fatigue of the voyage , and she wished to stop a few days to rest .
she took up her residence in a house which was on the quay , and , of course , near the water .
the quay , as it is called , in these towns , is a street on the margin of the water , with a wall but no houses next the sea .
the <unk> arrived at the town the second night after the <name> had landed .
he was vexed that his expected prize had escaped him .
he brought his ships up near to the town , and began to fire toward the house in which the <name> was lodging .
[ illustration : the landing of the <name> ] this was at five o'clock in the morning .
the <name> and her attendants were in their beds , asleep .
the reports of the cannon from the ships , the terrific whistling of the balls through the air , and the crash of the houses which the balls struck , aroused the whole village from their slumbers , and threw them into consternation .
the people soon came to the house where the <name> was lodging , and begged her to fly .
they said that the neighboring houses were blown to pieces , and that her own would soon be destroyed , and she herself would be killed .
they may , however , have been influenced more by a regard to their own safety than to hers in these injunctions , as it must have been a great object with the villagers to effect the immediate removal of a visitor who was the means of bringing upon them so terrible a danger .
these urgent entreaties of the villagers were soon enforced by two cannon-balls , which fell , one after another , upon the roof of the house , and , crashing their way through the roof and the floors , went down , without seeming to regard the resistance , from the top to the bottom .
the <name> hastily put on her clothes , and went forth with her attendants on foot , the balls from the ships whistling after them all the way .
one of her servants was killed .
the rest of the fugitives , finding their exposure so great , stopped at a sort of trench which they came to , at the end of a field , such as is dug commonly , in england , on one side of the hedge to make the barrier more impassable to the animals which it is intended to confine .
this trench , with the embankment formed by the earth thrown out of it , on which the hedge is usually planted , afforded them protection .
they sought shelter in it , and remained there for two hours , like besiegers in the approaches to a town , the balls passing over their heads <unk> , though sometimes covering them with the earth which they threw up as they bounded by .
at length the tide began to ebb , and the <unk> was in danger of being left aground .
he weighed his anchors and withdrew , and the <name> and her party were relieved .
such a <unk> of a helpless and defenseless woman is a <unk> which could hardly take place except in a civil war .
the <name> rejoined her husband , and she rendered him essential service in many ways .
she had personal influence enough to raise both money and men for his armies , and so contributed very essentially to the strength of his party .
at last she returned to the continent again , and went to <name> , where she was still actively employed in promoting his cause .
at one of the battles in which the king was defeated , the parliamentary army seized his baggage , and found among his papers his correspondence with the <name> .
they very <unk> ordered it to be published , as the letters seemed to show a vigorous determination on the part of the king not to yield in the contest without obtaining from the parliament and their adherents full and ample concessions to his claims .
as time rolled on , the strength of the <name> party gradually wasted away , while that of parliament seemed to increase , until it became evident that the latter would , in the end , obtain the victory .
the king retreated from place to place , followed by his foes , and growing weaker and more discouraged after every conflict .
his son , the <name> of wales , was then about fifteen years of age .
he sent him to the western part of the island , with directions that , if affairs should still go against him , the boy should be taken in time out of the country , and join his mother in <name> .
the danger grew more and more imminent , and they who had charge of the young <name> sent him first to <unk> , and then to jersey  islands in the channel  whence he made his escape to <name> , and joined his mother .
fifteen years afterward he returned to london with great pomp and parade , and was placed upon the throne by universal <unk> .
at last the king himself , after being driven from one place of refuge to another , retreated to oxford and intrenched himself there .
here he spent the <name> of <unk> in extreme depression and distress .
his friends deserted him ; his resources were expended ; his hopes were extinguished .
he sent proposals of peace to the parliament , and offered , himself , to come to london , if they would <name> him a <unk> .
in reply , they forbade him to come .
they would listen to no propositions , and would make no terms .
the case , they saw , was in their own hands , and they determined on <unk> submission .
they hemmed the king in on all sides at his retreat in oxford , and reduced him to despair .
in the mean time , the scots , a year or two before this , had raised an army and crossed the northern frontier , and entered england .
they were against monarchy and <unk> , but they were , in some respects , a separate enemy from those against whom the king had been contending so long ; and he began to think that he had perhaps better fall into their hands than into those of his english foes , if he must submit to one or to the other .
he hesitated for some time what course to take ; but at last , after receiving representations of the favorable feeling which prevailed in regard to him in the scottish army , he concluded to make his escape from oxford and surrender himself to them .
he accordingly did so , and the civil war was ended .

the circumstances of king <name> 's surrender to the scots were these .
he knew that he was surrounded by his enemies in oxford , and that they would not allow him to escape if they could prevent it .
he and his friends , therefore , formed the following plan to elude them .
they sent word to the commanders of each of the several gates of the city , on a certain day , that during the ensuing night three men would have to pass out on business of the king 's , and that when the men should appear and give a certain signal , they were to be allowed to pass .
the officer at each gate received this command without knowing that a similar one had been sent to the others .
[ illustration : newark . ]
accordingly , about midnight , the parties of men were dispatched , and they went out at the several gates .
the king himself was in one of these parties .
there were two other persons with him .
one of these persons was a certain mr. <unk> , and the king was disguised as his servant .
they were all on horseback , and the king had a valise upon the horse behind him , so as to complete his disguise .
this was on the 27th of <name> .
the next day , or very soon after , it was known at oxford that his majesty was gone , but no one could tell in what direction , for there was no means even of deciding by which of the gates he had left the city .
the scotch were , at this time , encamped before the town of newark , which is on the <name> , in the heart of england , and about one hundred and twenty miles north of london .
there was a magnificent castle at newark in those days , which made the place very strong .
the town held out for the king ; though the scots had been investing it for some time , they had not yet succeeded in compelling the governor to surrender .
the king concluded to proceed to newark and enter the scottish camp .
he considered it , or , rather , wished it to be considered that he was coming to join them as their monarch .
they were going to consider it surrendering to them as their prisoner .
the king himself must have known how it would be , but it made his sense of humiliation a little less poignant to <name> this illusion with him as long as it was possible to maintain it .
as soon as the parliament found that the king had made his escape from oxford , they were alarmed , and on the 4th of may they issued an order to this effect , " that what person <unk> should harbor and conceal , or should know of the <unk> or concealing of the king 's person , and should not immediately reveal it to the speakers of both houses , should be proceeded against as a traitor to the commonwealth , and die without <name> . "
the proclamation of this order , however , did not result in arresting the flight of the king .
on the day after it was issued , he arrived safely at newark .
the scottish general , whose name was <name> , immediately represented to the king that for his own safety it was necessary that they should retire toward the northern frontier ; but they could not so retire , he said , unless newark should first surrender .
they accordingly induced the king to send in orders to the governor of the castle to give up the place .
the scots took possession of it , and , after having garrisoned it , moved with their army toward the north , the king and general <name> being in the van .
they treated the king with great distinction , but guarded him very closely , and sent word to the parliament that he was in their possession .
there ensued long negotiations and much debate .
the question was , at first , whether the english or scotch should have the disposal of the king 's person .
the english said that they , and not the scots , were the party making war upon him ; that they had conquered his armies , and hemmed him in , and reduced him to the necessity of submission ; and that he had been taken captive on english soil , and ought , consequently , to be delivered into the hands of the english parliament .
the scots replied that though he had been taken in england , he was their king as well as the king of england , and had made himself their enemy ; and that , as he had fallen into their hands , he ought to remain at their disposal .
to this the english rejoined , that the scots , in taking him , had not acted on their own account , but as the allies , and , as it were , the agents of the english , and that they ought to consider the king as a captive taken for them , and hold him subject to their disposal .
they could not settle the question .
in the mean time the scottish army <name> back toward the frontier , taking the king with them .
about this time a negotiation sprung up between the parliament and the scots for the payment of the expenses which the scottish army had incurred in their campaign .
the scots sent in an account amounting to two millions of pounds .
the english objected to a great many of the charges , and offered them two hundred thousand pounds .
finally it was settled that four hundred thousand pounds should be paid .
this arrangement was made early in <name> .
in <name> the scots agreed to give up the king into the hands of the english parliament .
the world accused the scots of selling their king to his enemies for four hundred thousand pounds .
the scots denied that there was any connection between the two transactions above referred to .
they received the money on account of their just claims ; and they afterward agreed to deliver up the king , because they thought it right and proper so to do .
the friends of the king , however , were never satisfied that there was not a secret understanding between the parties , that the money paid was not the price of the king 's delivery ; and as this delivery resulted in his death , they called it the price of blood .
<name> was at newcastle when they came to this decision .
his mind had been more at ease since his surrender to the scots , and he was accustomed to amuse himself and while away the time of his captivity by various games .
he was playing chess when the intelligence was brought to him that he was to be delivered up to the english parliament .
it was communicated to him in a letter .
he read it , and then went on with his game , and none of those around him could perceive by his air and manner that the intelligence which the letter contained was any thing extraordinary .
perhaps he was not aware of the magnitude of the change in his condition and prospects which the communication announced .
there was at this time , at a town called <unk> or <unk> , in <unk> , a beautiful palace which was known by the name of <unk> house .
king <name> 's mother had purchased this palace for him when he was the duke of york , in the early part of his life , while his father , king <name> , was on the throne , and his older brother was the heir apparent .
it was a very stately and beautiful edifice .
the house was fitted up in a very handsome manner , and all suitable accommodations provided for the king 's reception .
he had many attendants , and every desirable convenience and luxury of living ; but , though the war was over , there was still kept up between the king and his enemies a petty contest about forms and <unk> , which resulted from the spirit of <unk> which characterized the age .
the king wanted his own episcopal <unk> .
the parliament would not consent to this , but sent him two presbyterian <unk> .
the king would not allow them to say <name> at the table , but performed this duty himself ; and on the sabbath , when they preached in his chapel , he never would attend .
one singular instance of this sort of <unk> , and of the king's presence of mind under the action of it , took place while the king was at newcastle .
they took him one day to the chapel in the castle to hear a scotch presbyterian who was preaching to the garrison .
the scotchman preached a long discourse pointed expressly at the king .
those preachers prided themselves on the <unk> with which , on such occasions , they discharged what they called their duty .
to cap the climax of his faithfulness , the preacher gave out , at the close of the sermon , the hymn , thus : " we <name> sing the <unk> <unk> : " 'why dost thou , tyrant , boast thyself , thy wicked works to praise ? ' "
as the congregation were about to commence the singing , the king cast his eye along the <name> , and found in the <unk> hymn one which he thought would be more appropriate .
he rose , and said , in a very audible manner , " we <name> sing the <unk> <unk> : " 'have <name> , lord , on me i pray , for men would me devour . ' "
the congregation , moved by a sudden impulse of religious generosity extremely unusual in those days , immediately sang the <unk> which the king had chosen .
while he was at <unk> the king used sometimes to go , escorted by a guard , to certain neighboring villages where there were <unk> .
one day , while he was going on one of these excursions , a man , in the dress of a laborer , appeared standing on a bridge as he passed , and handed him a packet .
the commissioners who had charge of <name>  for some of them always attended him on these excursions  seized the man .
the packet was from the <name> .
the king told the commissioners that the letter was only to ask him some question about the disposal of his son , the young <name> , who was then with her in <name> .
they seemed satisfied , but they sent the disguised messenger to london , and the parliament committed him to prison , and sent down word to dismiss all <name> 's own attendants , and to keep him thenceforth in more strict confinement .
in the mean time , the parliament , having finished the war , were ready to <unk> the army .
but the army did not wish to be disbanded .
they would not be disbanded .
the officers knew very well that if their troops were dismissed , and they were to return to their homes as private citizens , all their importance would be gone .
there followed long debates and negotiations between the army and the parliament , which ended , at last , in an open rupture .
it is almost always so at the end of a revolution .
the military power is found to have become too strong for the civil institutions of the country to control it .
<name> cromwell , who afterward became so distinguished in the days of the commonwealth , was at this time becoming the most influential leader of the army .
he was not the commander-in-chief in form , but he was the great <unk> and manager in fact .
he was a man of great sternness and energy of character , and was always ready for the most prompt and daring action .
he conceived the design of seizing the king 's person at <unk> , so as to take him away from the control of the parliament , and transfer him to that of the army .
this plan was executed on the 4th of <name> , about two months after the king had been taken to <unk> house .
the abduction was effected in the following manner .
cromwell detached a strong party of choice troops , under the command of an officer by the name of <name> , to <name> the plan into effect .
these troops were all horsemen , so that their movements could be made with the greatest celerity .
they arrived at <unk> house at midnight .
the cornet , for that was the military title by which <name> was designated , <name> up his horsemen about the palace , and demanded entrance .
before his company arrived , however , there had been an alarm that they were coming , and the guards had been doubled .
the officers in command asked the cornet what was his name and business .
he replied that he was cornet <name> , and that his business was to speak to the king .
they asked him by whom he was sent , and he replied that he was sent by himself , and that he must and would see the king .
they then commanded their soldiers to stand by their arms , and be ready to fire when the word should be given .
they , however , perceived that <name> and his force were a detachment from the army to which they themselves belonged , and concluding to receive them as brothers , they opened the gates and let them in .
the cornet stationed sentinels at the doors of those apartments of the castle which were occupied by the scotch commissioners who had the king in charge , and then went himself directly to the king 's chamber .
he had a pistol loaded and cocked in his hand .
he knocked at the door .
there were four grooms in waiting : they rebuked him for making such a disturbance at that time of the night , and told him that he should wait until the morning if he had any communication to make to the king .
the cornet would not accede to this proposition , but knocked violently at the door , the servants being deterred from interfering by dread of the loaded pistol , and by the air and manner of their visitor , which told them very plainly that he was not to be trifled with .
the king finally heard the disturbance , and , on learning the cause , sent out word that <name> must go away and wait till morning , for he would not get up to see him at that hour .
the cornet , as one of the historians of the time expresses it , " <unk> and retired . "
the next morning he had an interview with the king .
when he was introduced to the king 's apartment in the morning , the king said that he wished to have the scotch commissioners present at the interview .
<name> replied that the commissioners had nothing to do now but to return to the parliament at london .
the king then said that he wished to see his instructions .
the cornet replied that he would show them to him , and he sent out to order his horsemen to parade in the inner court of the palace , where the king could see them from his windows ; and then , pointing them out to the king , he said , " these , sir , are my instructions . "
the king , who , in all the trials and troubles of his life of excitement and danger , took every thing quietly and calmly looked at the men attentively .
they were fine troops , well mounted and armed .
he then turned to the cornet , and said , with a smile , that " his instructions were in fair characters , and could be read without spelling . "
the cornet then said that his orders were to take the king away with him .
the king declined going , unless the commissioners went too .
the cornet made no objection , saying that the commissioners might do as they pleased about accompanying him , but that he himself must go .
the party set off from <unk> and traveled two days , stopping at night at the houses of friends to their cause .
they reached cambridge , where the leading officers of the army received the king , rendering him every possible <name> of deference and respect .
from cambridge he was conducted by the leaders of the army from town to town , remaining sometimes several days at a place .
he was attended by a strong guard , and was treated every where with the utmost consideration and honor .
he was allowed some little <name> , in riding out and in amusements , but every precaution was taken to prevent the possibility of an escape .
the people collected every where into the places through which he had to pass , and his <unk> was constantly thronged .
this was not altogether on account of their respect and veneration for him as king , but it arose partly from a very singular cause .
there is a certain disease called the <unk> , which in former times had the name of the king 's evil .
it is a very unmanageable and obstinate disorder , resisting all ordinary modes of treatment ; but in the days of king <name> , it was universally believed by the common people of england , that if a king touched a patient afflicted with this disease , he would recover .
this was the reason why it was called the king 's evil .
it was the evil that kings only could cure .
now , as kings seldom traveled much about their dominions , whenever one did make such a journey , the people embraced the opportunity to bring all the cases which could possibly be considered as <unk> to the line of his route , in order that he might touch the persons afflicted and heal them .
in the course of the summer the king was conducted to hampton court , a beautiful palace on the thames , a short distance above london .
here he remained for some time .
he had an interview here with two of his children .
the oldest son was still in <name> .
the two whom he saw here were the duke of gloucester and the <name> <name> .
he found that they were under the care of a nobleman of high rank , and that they were treated with great consideration .
<name> was extremely gratified and pleased with seeing these members of his family again , after so long a separation .
his feelings of domestic affection were very strong .
the king remained at hampton court two or three months .
while he was here , london , and all the region about it , was kept in a continual state of excitement by the contentions of the army and parliament , and the endless negotiations which they attempted with each other and with the king .
during all this time the king was in a sort of elegant and honorable imprisonment in his palace at hampton court ; but he found the restraints to which he was subjected , and the harassing cares which the contests between these two great powers brought upon him , so great , that he determined to make his escape from the <unk> which bound him .
he very probably thought that he could again raise his standard , and collect an army to fight in his cause .
or perhaps he thought of making his escape from the country altogether .
it is not improbable that he was not decided himself which of these plans to pursue , but left the question to be determined by the circumstances in which he should find himself when he had regained his freedom .
at any rate , he made his escape .
one evening , about ten o'clock , attendants came into his room at hampton court , and found that he had gone .
there were some letters upon the table which he had left , directed to the parliament , to the general of the army , and to the officer who had guarded him at hampton court .
the king had left the palace an hour or two before .
he passed out at a private door , which admitted him to a park connected with the palace .
he went through the park by a walk which led down to the water , where there was a boat ready for him .
he crossed the river in the boat , and on the opposite shore he found several officers and some horses ready to receive him .
he mounted one of the horses , and the party rode rapidly away .
they traveled all night , and arrived , toward morning , at the residence of a countess on whose attachment to him , and fidelity , he placed great reliance .
the countess concealed him in her house , though it was understood by all concerned that this was only a temporary place of refuge .
he could not long be concealed here , and her residence was not provided with any means of defense ; so that , immediately on their arrival at the countess 's , the king and the few friends who were with him began to concert plans for a more secure retreat .
the house of the countess was on the southern coast of england , near the isle of wight .
there was a famous castle in those days upon this island , near the center of it , called <unk> castle .
the ruins of it , which are very extensive , still remain .
this castle was under the charge of colonel hammond , who was at that time governor of the island .
colonel hammond was a near relative of one of king <unk> <unk> , and the king thought it probable that he would espouse his cause .
he accordingly sent two of the gentlemen who had accompanied him to the isle of wight to see colonel hammond , and inquire of him whether he would receive and protect the king if he would come to him .
but he charged them not to let hammond know where he was , unless he would first solemnly promise to protect him , and not subject him to any restraint .
[ illustration : <unk> castle . ]
the messengers went , and , to the king 's surprise , brought back hammond with them .
the king asked them whether they had got his written promise to protect him .
they answered no , but that they could depend upon him as a man of honor .
the king was alarmed .
" then you have betrayed me , " said he , " and i am his prisoner . "
the messengers were then , in their turn , alarmed at having thus disappointed and displeased the king , and they offered to kill hammond on the spot , and to provide some other means of securing the king 's safety .
the king , however , would not sanction any such proceeding , but put himself under hammond 's charge , and was conveyed to <unk> castle .
he was received with every <name> of respect , but was very carefully guarded .
it was about the middle of november that these events took place .
hammond notified the parliament that king <name> was in his hands , and sent for directions from them as to what he should do .
parliament required that he should be carefully guarded , and they appropriated <unk> for the expenses of his support .
the king remained in this confinement more than a year , while the parliament and the army were struggling for the possession of the kingdom .
he spent his time , during this long period in various pursuits calculated to beguile the weary days , and he sometimes planned schemes for escape .
there were also a great many fruitless negotiations attempted between the king and the parliament , which resulted in nothing but to make the breach between them wider and wider .
sometimes the king was silent and depressed .
at other times he seemed in his usual spirits .
he read serious books a great deal , and wrote .
there is a famous book , which was found in manuscript after his death among his papers , in his handwriting , which it is supposed he wrote at this time .
he was allowed to take walks upon the castle wall , which was very extensive , and he had some other amusements which served to occupy his leisure time .
he found his confinement , however , in spite of all these <unk> , wearisome and hard to bear .
there were some schemes attempted to enable him to regain his <name> .
there was one very desperate attempt .
it seems that hammond , suspecting that the king was plotting an escape , dismissed the king's own servants and put others in their places  persons in whom he supposed he could more implicitly rely .
one of these men , whose name was burley , was exasperated at being thus dismissed .
he went through the town of <unk> , beating a drum , and calling upon the people to rise and rescue their sovereign from his captivity .
the governor of the castle , hearing of this , sent out a small body of men , arrested burley , and hanged and quartered him .
the king was made a close prisoner immediately after this attempt .
notwithstanding this , another attempt was soon made by the king himself , which came much nearer succeeding .
there was a man by the name of osborne , whom hammond employed as a personal attendant upon the king .
he was what was called gentleman usher .
the king succeeded in gaining this person 's favor so much by his <unk> and his general demeanor , that one day he put a little paper into one of the king 's gloves , which it was a part of his office to hold on certain occasions , and on this paper he had written that he was at the king's service .
at first <name> was afraid that this offer was only a treacherous one ; but at length he confided in him .
in the mean time , there was a certain man by the name of <name> in the garrison , who conceived the design of enticing the king away from the castle on the promise of promoting his escape , and then murdering him .
<name> thought that this plan would please the parliament , and that he himself , and those who should aid him in the enterprise , would be rewarded .
he proposed this scheme to osborne , and asked him to join in the execution of it .
osborne made the whole plan known to the king .
the king , on reflection , said to osborne , " very well ; continue in communication with <name> , and help him mature his plan .
let him thus aid in getting me out of the castle , and we <name> make such arrangements as to prevent the assassination . "
osborne did so .
he also gained over some other soldiers who were employed as sentinels near the place of escape .
osborne and <name> furnished the king with a saw and a file , by means of which he sawed off some iron bars which guarded one of his windows .
they were then , on a certain night , to be ready with a few attendants on the outside to receive the king as he descended , and convey him away .
in the mean time , <name> and osborne had each obtained a number of confederates , those of the former supposing that the plan was to assassinate the king , while those of the latter understood that the plan was to assist him in escaping from captivity .
certain expressions which were dropped by one of this latter class alarmed <name> , and led him to suspect some treachery .
he accordingly took the precaution to provide a number of armed men , and to have them ready at the window , so that he should be sure to be strong enough to secure the king immediately on his descent from the window .
when the time came for the escape , the king , before getting out , looked below , and , seeing so many armed men , knew at once that <name> had discovered their designs , and refused to descend .
he quickly returned to his bed .
the next day the bars were found filed in two , and the king was made a closer prisoner than ever .
some months after this , some commissioners from parliament went to see the king , and they found him in a most wretched condition .
his beard was grown , his dress was neglected , his health was gone , his hair was gray , and , though only forty-eight years of age , he appeared as <unk> and infirm as a man of seventy .
in fact , he was in a state of misery and despair .
even the enemies who came to visit him , though usually stern and hard-hearted enough to withstand any impressions , were extremely affected at the sight .

as soon as the army party , with <name> cromwell at their head , had obtained complete ascendency , they took immediate measures for proceeding vigorously against the king .
they seized him at <unk> castle , and took him to <unk> castle , which was a gloomy fortress in the neighborhood of <unk> .
<unk> castle was in a very extraordinary situation .
there is a long point extending from the main land toward the isle of wight , opposite to the eastern end of it .
this point is very narrow , but is nearly two miles long .
the castle was built at the extremity .
it consisted of one great round tower , defended by walls and bastions .
it stood lonely and desolate , surrounded by the sea , except the long and narrow neck which connected it with the distant shore .
of course , though comfortless and solitary , it was a place of much greater security than <unk> .
the circumstance of the king 's removal to this new place of confinement were as follows : in some of his many negotiations with the parliament while at <unk> , he had bound himself , on certain conditions , not to attempt to escape from that place .
his friends , however , when they heard that the army were coming again to take him away , concluded that he ought to lose no time in making his escape out of the country .
they proposed the plan to the king .
he made two objections to it .
he thought , in the first place , that the attempt would be very likely to fail ; and that , if it did fail , it would <unk> his enemies , and make his confinement more rigorous , and his probable danger more imminent than ever .
he said that , in the second place , he had promised the parliament that he would not attempt to escape , and that he could not break his word .
the three friends were silent when they heard the king speak these words .
after a pause , the leader of them , colonel cook , said , " suppose i were to tell your majesty that the army have a plan for seizing you immediately , and that they <name> be upon you very soon unless you escape .
suppose i tell you that we have made all the preparations necessary  that we have horses all ready here , concealed in a <unk>  that we have a vessel at the cows [ g ] waiting for us  that we are all prepared to attend you , and eager to engage in the enterprise  the darkness of the night <unk> our plan , and rendering it almost certain of success .
now , " added he , " these <unk> express the real state of the case , and the only question is what your majesty <name> resolve to do . "
[ footnote g : there were two points or headlands , on opposite sides of an inlet from the sea , on the northern side of the isle of wight , which in ancient times received the name of cows .
they were called the east cow and the west cow .
the harbor between them formed a safe and excellent harbor .
the name is now spelled <unk> , and the port is , at the present day , of great commercial importance . ]
the king paused .
he was distressed with perplexity and doubt .
at length he said , " they have promised me , and i have promised them , and i <name> not break the promise first . "
" your majesty means by they and them , the parliament , i suppose ? "
" yes , i do . "
" but the scene is now changed .
the parliament have no longer any power to protect you .
the danger is imminent , and the circumstances <unk> your majesty from all obligation . "
but the king could not be moved .
he said , come what may , he would not do any thing that looked like a breaking of his word .
he would dismiss the subject and go to bed , and enjoy his rest as long as he could .
his friends told him that they feared it would not be long .
they seemed very much agitated and distressed .
the king asked them why they were so much troubled .
they said it was to think of the extreme danger in which his majesty was lying , and his unwillingness to do any thing to avert it .
the king replied , that if the danger were tenfold more than it was , he would not break his word to avert it .
the fears of the king 's friends were soon realized .
the next morning , at break of day , he was awakened by a loud knocking at his door .
he sent one of his attendants to inquire what it meant .
it was a party of soldiers come to take him away .
they would give him no information in respect to their plans , but required him to dress himself immediately and go with them .
they mounted horses at the gate of the castle .
the king was very <name> to have his friends accompany him .
they allowed one of them , the duke of richmond , to go with him a little way , and then told him he must return .
the duke bade his master a very sad and sorrowful farewell , and left him to go on alone .
[ illustration : ruins of <unk> castle . ]
the escort which were conducting him took him to <unk> castle .
the parliament passed a vote condemning this proceeding , but it was too late .
the army concentrated their forces about london , took possession of the avenues to the houses of parliament , and excluded all those members who were opposed to them .
the remnant of the parliament which was left immediately took measures for bringing the king to trial .
the house of commons did not dare to trust the trial of the king to the peers , according to the provisions of the english constitution , and so they passed an ordinance for <unk> him of high treason , and for appointing commissioners , themselves , to try him .
of course , in appointing these commissioners , they would name such men as they were sure would be <unk> to condemn him .
the peers rejected this ordinance , and adjourned for nearly a fortnight , hoping thus to arrest any further proceedings .
the commons immediately voted that the action of the peers was not necessary , and that they would go forward themselves .
they then appointed the commissioners , and ordered the trial to proceed .
every thing connected with the trial was conducted with great state and parade .
the number of commissioners constituting the court was one hundred and thirty-three , though only a little more than half that number attended the trial .
the king had been removed from <unk> castle to windsor castle , and he was now brought into the city , and lodged in a house near to westminster hall , so as to be at hand .
on the appointed day the court assembled ; the vast hall and all the avenues to it were thronged .
the whole civilized world looked on , in fact , in astonishment at the almost unprecedented spectacle of a king tried for his life by an assembly of his subjects .
the first business after the opening of the court was to call the roll of the commissioners , that each one might answer to his name .
the name of the general of the army , <unk> , who was one of the number , was the second upon the list .
when his name was called there was no answer .
it was called again .
a voice from one of the galleries replied , " he has too much wit to be here . "
this produced some disorder , and the officers called out to know who answered in that manner , but there was no reply .
afterward , when the impeachment was read , the phrase occurred , " of all the people of england , " when the same voice rejoined , " no not the half of them . "
the officers then ordered a soldier to fire into the seat from which these interruptions came .
this command was not obeyed , but they found , on investigating the case , that the person who had answered thus was <unk> 's wife , and they immediately removed her from the hall .
when the court was fully organized , they commanded the <unk> to bring in the prisoner .
the king was accordingly brought in , and conducted to a chair covered with crimson <name> , which had been placed for him at the bar .
the judges remained in their seats , with their heads covered , while he entered , and the king took his seat , keeping his head covered too .
he took a calm and deliberate survey of the scene , looking around upon the judges , and upon the armed guards by which he was <unk> , with a stern and <unk> countenance .
at length silence was proclaimed , and the president rose to introduce the proceedings .
he addressed the king .
he said that the commons of england , deeply sensible of the calamities which had been brought upon england by the civil war , and of the innocent blood which had been shed , and convinced that he , the king , had been the guilty cause of it , were now determined to make inquisition for this blood , and to bring him to trial and judgment ; that they had , for this purpose , organized this court , and that he should now hear the charge brought against him , which they would proceed to try .
an officer then arose to read the charge .
the king made a gesture for him to be silent .
he , however , persisted in his reading , although the king once or twice attempted to interrupt him .
the president , too , ordered him to proceed .
the charge recited the evils and calamities which had resulted from the war , and concluded by saying that " the said <name> <name> is and has been the <unk> , author , and <unk> of the said unnatural , cruel , and bloody wars , and is therein guilty of all the <unk> , murders , <unk> , <unk> , spoils , <unk> , damages , and <unk> to this nation acted and committed in the said wars , or occasioned thereby . "
the president then sharply rebuked the king for his interruptions to the proceedings , and asked him what answer he had to make to the impeachment .
the king replied by demanding by what authority they pretended to call him to account for his conduct .
he told them that he was their king , and they his subjects ; that they were not even the parliament , and that they had no authority from any true parliament to sit as a court to try him ; that he would not betray his own dignity and rights by making any answer at all to any charges they might bring against him , for that would be an acknowledgment of their authority ; but he was convinced that there was not one of them who did not in his heart believe that he was wholly innocent of the charges which they had brought against him .
these proceedings occupied the first day .
the king was then sent back to his place of confinement , and the court adjourned .
the next day , when called upon to plead to the impeachment , the king only insisted the more strenuously in denying the authority of the court , and in stating his reasons for so denying it .
the court were determined not to hear what he had to say on this point , and the president continually interrupted him ; while he , in his turn , continually interrupted the president too .
it was a struggle and a dispute , not a trial .
at last , on the fourth day , something like testimony was produced to prove that the king had been in arms against the forces of the parliament .
on the fifth and sixth days , the judges sat in private to come to their decision ; and on the day following , which was saturday , <name> 27th , they called the king again before them , and opened the doors to admit the great assembly of spectators , that the decision might be announced .
there followed another scene of mutual interruptions and disorder .
the king insisted on longer delay .
he had not said what he wished to say in his defense .
the president told him it was now too late ; that he had consumed the time allotted to him in making objections to the jurisdiction of the court , and now it was too late for his defense .
the clerk then read the sentence , which ended thus : " for all which <unk> and crimes this court doth <unk> that he , the said <name> <name> , is a tyrant , traitor , murderer , and public enemy , and shall be put to death by the <unk> of his head from his body . "
when the clerk had finished the reading , the president rose , and said deliberately and solemnly , " the sentence now read and published is the act , sentence , judgment , and resolution of the whole court . "
and the whole court rose to express their assent .
the king then said to the president , " <name> you hear me a word , sir ? "
<unk> " sir , you are not to be heard after the sentence . "
king. " am i not , sir ? "
<unk> " no , sir .
guards , withdraw the prisoner ! "
king. " i may speak after sentence by your favor , sir .
hold  i say , sir  by your favor , sir  if i am not permitted to speak  " the other parts of his broken attempts to speak were lost in the tumult and noise .
he was taken out of the hall .
one would have supposed that all who witnessed these dreadful proceedings , and who now saw one who had been so lately the sovereign of a mighty empire standing friendless and alone on the brink of destruction , would have relented at last , and would have found their hearts yielding to emotions of pity .
but it seems not to have been so .
the animosities engendered by political strife are merciless , and the crowd through which the king had to pass as he went from the hall scoffed and derided him .
they blew the smoke of their tobacco in his face , and threw their pipes at him .
some proceeded to worse indignities than these , but the king bore all with quietness and resignation .
the king was sentenced on saturday .
on the evening of that day he sent a request that the bishop of london might be allowed to assist at his devotions , and that his children might be permitted to see him before he was to die .
there were two of his children then in england , his youngest son and a daughter .
the other two sons had escaped to the continent .
the government granted both these requests .
by asking for the services of an episcopal clergyman , <name> signified his firm determination to adhere to the very last hour of his life to the religious principles which he had been struggling for so long .
it is somewhat surprising that the government were willing to comply with the request .
it was , however , complied with , and <name> was taken from the palace of whitehall , which is in westminster , to the palace of st. <name> , not very far distant .
he was escorted by a guard through the streets .
at st. <name> 's there was a small chapel where the king attended divine service .
the bishop of london preached a sermon on the future judgment , in which he administered comfort to the mind of the unhappy prisoner , so far as the sad case allowed of any comfort , by the thought that all human judgments would be reviewed , and all wrong made right at the great day .
after the service the king spent the remainder of the day in retirement and private devotion .
during the afternoon of the day several of his most trusty friends among the nobility called to see him , but he declined to <name> them admission .
he said that his time was short and precious , and that he wished to improve it to the utmost in preparation for the great change which awaited him .
he hoped , therefore , that his friends would not be displeased if he declined seeing any persons besides his children .
it would do no good for them to be admitted .
all that they could do for him now was to pray for him .
the next day the children were brought to him in the room where he was confined .
the daughter , who was called the <name> <name> , was the oldest .
he directed her to tell her brother <name> , who was the second son , and now absent with <name> on the continent , that he must now , from the time of his father 's death , no longer look upon <name> as merely his older brother , but as his sovereign , and obey him as such ; and he requested her to charge them both , from him , to love each other , and to forgive their father 's enemies .
" you <name> not forget this , my dear child , <name> you ? "
added the king .
the <name> <name> was still very young .
" no , " said she , " i <name> never forget it as long as i live . "
he then charged her with a message to her mother , the <name> , who was also on the continent .
" tell her , " said he , " that i have loved her faithfully all my life , and that my tender regard for her <name> not cease till i cease to breathe . "
poor <name> was sadly grieved at this parting interview .
the king tried to comfort her .
" you must not be so afflicted for me , " he said .
" it <name> be a very glorious death that i shall die .
i die for the laws and liberties of this land , and for maintaining the protestant religion .
i have forgiven all my enemies , and i <name> that god <name> forgive them . "
the little son was , by title , the duke of gloucester .
he took him on his knees , and said , in substance , " my dear boy , they are going to cut off your father 's head . "
the child looked up into his father 's face very earnestly , not comprehending so strange an assertion .
" they are going to cut off my head , " repeated the king , " and perhaps they <name> want to make you a king ; but you must not be king as long as your brothers <name> and <name> live ; for if you do , very likely they <name> , some time or other , cut off your head . "
the child said , with a very determined air , that then they should never make him king as long as he lived .
the king then gave his children some other parting messages for several of his nearest relatives and friends , and they were taken away .
in cases of capital punishment , in england and <name> , there must be , after the sentence is pronounced , written authority to the sheriff , or other proper officer , to proceed to the execution of it .
this is called the warrant , and is usually to be signed by the chief magistrate of the state .
in england the sovereign always signs the warrant of execution ; but in the case of the execution of the sovereign himself , which was a case entirely unprecedented , the authorities were at first somewhat at loss to know what to do .
the commissioners who had judged the king concluded finally to sign it themselves .
it was expressed substantially as follows : " at the high court of justice for the trying and judging of <name> <name> , king of england , <name> 29th , <unk> : " whereas <name> <name> , king of england , has been convicted , <unk> , and condemned of high treason , and sentence was pronounced against him by this court , to be put to death by the <unk> of his head from his body , of which sentence execution yet <unk> to be done ; these are , therefore , now to <name> and require you to see the said sentence executed in the open street before whitehall , upon the morrow , being the thirtieth day of this instant month of <name> , between the hours of ten in the morning and five in the afternoon of the said day , with full effect ; and for so doing this shall be your sufficient warrant . "
<unk> of the judges signed this warrant , and then it was sent to the persons appointed to <name> the sentence into execution .
that night the king slept pretty well for about four hours , though during the evening before he could hear in his apartment the noise of the workmen building the platform , or scaffold as it was commonly called , on which the execution was to take place .
he awoke , however , long before day .
he called to an attendant who lay by his bedside , and requested him to get up .
" i <name> rise myself , " said he , " for i have a great work to do to-day . "
he then requested that they would furnish him with the best dress , and an extra supply of under clothing , because it was a cold morning .
he particularly wished to be well guarded from the cold , lest it should cause him to shiver , and they would suppose that he was trembling from fear .
" i have no fear , " said he .
" death is not terrible to me .
i bless god that i am prepared . "
the king had made arrangements for divine service in his room early in the morning , to be conducted by the bishop of london .
the bishop came in at the time appointed , and read the prayers .
he also read , in the course of the service , the <unk> chapter of <name> , which <unk> the closing scenes of our saviour 's life .
this was , in fact , the regular lesson for the day , according to the episcopal ritual , which assigns certain portions of scripture to every day of the year .
the king supposed that the bishop had purposely selected this passage , and he thanked him for it , as he said it seemed to him very appropriate to the occasion .
" may it please your majesty , " said the bishop , " it is the proper lesson for the day . "
the king was much affected at learning this fact , as he considered it a special providence , indicating that he was prepared to die , and that he should be sustained in the final agony .
about ten o'clock , colonel <unk> , who was the first one named in the warrant of execution of the three persons to whom the warrant was addressed , knocked gently at the king 's chamber door .
no answer was returned .
presently he knocked again .
the king asked his attendant to go to the door .
he went , and asked colonel <unk> why he knocked .
he replied that he wished to see the king .
" let him come in , " said the king .
the officer entered , but with great embarrassment and trepidation .
he felt that he had a most awful duty to perform .
he informed the king that it was time to proceed to whitehall , though he could have some time there for rest .
" very well , " said the king ; " go on ; i <name> follow . "
the king then took the bishop 's arm , and they went along together .
they found , as they issued from the palace of st. <name> into the park through which their way lay to whitehall , that lines of soldiers had been drawn up .
the king , with the bishop on one side , and the attendant before referred to , whose name was <name> , on the other , both uncovered , walked between these lines of guards .
the king walked on very fast , so that the others scarcely kept pace with him .
when he arrived at whitehall he spent some further time in devotion , with the bishop , and then , at noon , he ate a little bread and drank some light wine .
soon after this , colonel <unk> , the officer , came to the door and let them know that the hour had arrived .
the bishop and <unk> melted into tears as they bade their master farewell .
the king directed the door to be opened , and requested the officer to go on , saying that he would follow .
they went through a large hall , called the <unk> hall , to a window in front , through which a passage had been made for the king to his scaffold , which was built up in the street before the palace .
as the king passed out through the window , he perceived that a vast throng of spectators had assembled in the streets to witness the spectacle .
he had expected this , and had intended to address them .
but he found that this was impossible , as the space all around the scaffold was occupied with troops of horse and bodies of soldiers , so as to keep the populace at so great a distance that they could not hear his voice .
he , however , made his speech , addressing it particularly to one or two persons who were near , knowing that they would put the substance of it on record , and thus make it known to all mankind .
there was then some further conversation about the preparations for the final blow , the adjustment of the dress , the hair , & c. , in which the king took an active part , with great composure .
he then kneeled down and laid his head upon the block .
the executioner , who wore a mask that he might not be known , began to adjust the hair of the prisoner by putting it up under his cap , when the king , supposing that he was going to strike , hastily told him to wait for the sign .
the executioner said that he would .
the king spent a few minutes in prayer , and then stretched out his hands , which was the sign which he had arranged to give .
the axe descended .
the dissevered head , with the blood streaming from it , was held up by the assistant executioner , for the gratification of the vast crowd which was gazing on the scene .
he said , as he raised it , " behold the head of a traitor ! "
the body was placed in a coffin covered with black <name> , and taken back through the window into the room from which the monarch had walked out , in life and health , but a few moments before .
a day or two afterward it was taken to windsor castle upon a hearse drawn by six horses and covered with black <name> .
it was there interred in a vault in the chapel , with an inscription upon lead over the coffin : king <name> <unk> .
after the death of <name> , a sort of republic was established in england , called the commonwealth , over which , instead of a king , <name> cromwell presided , under the title of protector .
the country was , however , in a very anomalous and unsettled state .
it became more distracted still after the death of the protector , and it was only twelve years after <unk> the father that the people of england , by common consent , called back the son to the throne .
it seems as if there could be no stable government in a country where any very large portion of the inhabitants are destitute of property , without the aid of that mysterious but all controlling principle of the human breast , a spirit of reverence for the rights , and dread of the power of an hereditary crown .
in the united states almost every man is the possessor of property .
he has his house , his little farm , his shop and implements of labor , or something which is his own , and which he feels would be <unk> by revolution and anarchy .
he dreads a general scramble , knowing that he would probably get less than he would lose by it .
he is willing , therefore , to be governed by abstract law .
there is no need of holding up before him a scepter or a crown to induce obedience .
he <unk> without them .
he votes with the rest , and then abides by the decision of the <unk> .
in other countries , however , the case is different .
if not an actual majority , there is at least a very large proportion of the community who possess nothing .
they get scanty daily food for hard and long-continued daily labor ; and as change , no matter what , is always a blessing to sufferers , or at least is always looked forward to as such , they are ready to welcome , at all times , any thing that promises commotion .
a war , a conflagration , a riot , or a rebellion , is always welcome .
they do not know but that they shall gain some advantage by it , and in the mean time the excitement of it is some relief to the dead and eternal monotony of toil and suffering .
it is true that the revolutions by which monarchies are overturned are not generally effected , in the first instance , by this portion of the community .
the throne is usually overturned at first by a higher class of men ; but the deed being done , the <unk> upon the established course and order of the social state being once made , this lower mass is aroused and excited by it , and soon becomes unmanageable .
when property is so distributed among the population of a state that all have an interest in the preservation of order , then , and not till then , <name> it be safe to give to all a share in the power necessary for preserving it ; and , in the mean time , revolutions produced by insurrections and violence <name> probably only result in establishing governments unsteady and transient just in proportion to the suddenness of their origin .

the story of <name> is a story of crime .
it is a narrative of the course and the consequences of unlawful love .
in her strange and romantic history we see this passion portrayed with the most complete and graphic fidelity in all its influences and effects ; its uncontrollable impulses , its intoxicating joys , its reckless and mad career , and the dreadful remorse and ultimate despair and ruin in which it always and inevitably ends .
<name> was by birth an egyptian ; by ancestry and descent she was a greek .
thus , while <name> and the <name> of the nile formed the scene of the most important events and incidents of her history , it was the blood of macedon which flowed in her veins .
her character and action are marked by the genius , the courage , the originality , and the <unk> pertaining to the stock from which she sprung .
the events of her history , on the other hand , and the peculiar character of her adventures , her sufferings , and her sins , were determined by the circumstances with which she was surrounded , and the influences which were brought to bear upon her in the soft and voluptuous clime where the scenes of her early life were laid .
egypt has always been considered as physically the most remarkable country on the globe .
it is a long and narrow valley of verdure and <unk> , completely insulated from the rest of the habitable world .
it is more completely insulated , in fact , than any literal island could be , inasmuch as deserts are more impassable than seas .
the very existence of egypt is a most extraordinary phenomenon .
if we could but soar with the wings of an eagle into the air , and look down upon the scene , so as to observe the operation of that grand and yet simple process by which this long and wonderful valley , teeming so profusely with animal and vegetable life , has been formed , and is annually <unk> and renewed , in the midst of surrounding wastes of silence , desolation , and death , we should gaze upon it with <unk> admiration and pleasure .
we have not the wings of the eagle , but the <unk> of science furnish us with a sort of substitute for them .
the long series of patient , careful , and sagacious observations , which have been continued now for two thousand years , bring us results , by means of which , through our powers of mental <name> , we may take a comprehensive survey of the whole scene , analogous , in some respects , to that which direct and actual vision would afford us , if we could look down upon it from the eagle 's point of view .
it is , however , somewhat humiliating to our pride of intellect to reflect that long-continued philosophical investigations and learned scientific research are , in such a case as this , after all , in some sense , only a sort of substitute for wings .
a human mind connected with a pair of eagle 's wings would have solved the mystery of egypt in a week ; whereas science , philosophy , and research , confined to the surface of the ground , have been occupied for twenty centuries in accomplishing the undertaking .
it is found at last that both the existence of egypt itself , and its strange insulation in the midst of boundless tracts of dry and barren sand , depend upon certain remarkable results of the general laws of rain .
the water which is taken up by the atmosphere from the surface of the sea and of the land by evaporation , falls again , under certain circumstances , in showers of rain , the frequency and <unk> of which vary very much in different portions of the earth .
as a general principle , rains are much more frequent and abundant near the equator than in temperate climes , and they grow less and less so as we approach the poles .
this might naturally have been expected ; for , under the burning sun of the equator , the evaporation of water must necessarily go on with immensely greater rapidity than in the colder zones , and all the water which is taken up must , of course , again come down .
it is not , however , wholly by the latitude of the region in which the evaporation takes place that the quantity of rain which falls from the atmosphere is determined ; for the condition on which the falling back , in rain , of the water which has been taken up by evaporation mainly depends , is the cooling of the atmospheric stratum which contains it ; and this effect is produced in very various ways , and many different causes operate to modify it .
sometimes the stratum is cooled by being wafted over ranges of mountains , sometimes by encountering and becoming mingled with cooler currents of air ; and sometimes , again , by being driven in winds toward a higher , and , consequently , cooler latitude .
if , on the other hand , air moves from cold mountains toward warm and <name> plains , or from higher latitudes to lower , or if , among the various currents into which it falls , it becomes mixed with air warmer than itself , its capacity for containing vapor in solution is increased , and , consequently , instead of releasing its hold upon the waters which it has already in possession , it becomes thirsty for more .
it moves over a country , under these circumstances , as a warm and drying wind .
under a reverse of circumstances it would have formed drifting mists , or , perhaps , even copious showers of rain .
it <name> be evident , from these considerations , that the frequency of the showers , and the quantity of the rain which <name> fall , in the various regions respectively which the surface of the earth presents , must depend on the combined influence of many causes , such as the warmth of the climate , the proximity and the direction of mountains and of seas , the character of the prevailing winds , and the reflecting qualities of the soil .
these and other similar causes , it is found , do , in fact , produce a vast difference in the quantity of rain which falls in different regions .
in the northern part of south <name> , where the land is bordered on every hand by vast tropical seas , which load the hot and thirsty air with vapor , and where the mighty cordillera of the andes <unk> its icy summits to chill and precipitate the <unk> again , a quantity of rain amounting to more than ten feet in perpendicular height falls in a year .
at st. petersburg , on the other hand , the quantity thus falling in a year is but little more than one foot .
the immense deluge which pours down from the clouds in south <name> would , if the water were to remain where it fell , wholly <unk> and <unk> the country .
as it is , in flowing off through the valleys to the sea , the united torrents form the greatest river on the globe  the amazon ; and the vegetation , stimulated by the heat , and nourished by the abundant and incessant supplies of moisture , becomes so rank , and loads the earth with such an entangled and matted mass of trunks , and stems , and twining wreaths and vines , that man is almost excluded from the scene .
the boundless forests become a vast and almost impenetrable jungle , abandoned to wild beasts , <unk> reptiles , and huge and ferocious birds of prey .
of course , the district of st. petersburg , with its icy <name> , its low and powerless sun , and its twelve inches of annual rain , must necessarily present , in all its phenomena of vegetable and animal life , a striking contrast to the <unk> <unk> of new <unk> .
it is , however , after all , not absolutely the opposite extreme .
there are certain regions on the surface of the earth that are actually <unk> ; and it is these which present us with the true and real contrast to the luxuriant vegetation and teeming life of the country of the amazon .
in these <unk> regions all is necessarily silence , desolation , and death .
no plant can grow ; no animal can live .
man , too , is forever and hopelessly excluded .
if the <unk> abundance of animal and vegetable life shut him out , in some measure , from regions which an excess of heat and moisture render too prolific , the total absence of them still more effectually forbids him a home in these .
they become , therefore , vast wastes of dry and barren sands in which no root can find nourishment , and of dreary rocks to which not even a lichen can cling .
the most extensive and remarkable <unk> region on the earth is a vast tract extending through the interior and northern part of africa , and the southwestern part of <name> .
the red sea penetrates into this tract from the south , and thus breaks the outline and continuity of its form , without , however , altering , or essentially modifying its character .
it divides it , however , and to the different portions which this division forms , different names have been given .
the asiatic portion is called arabia <unk> ; the african tract has received the name of sahara ; while between these two , in the neighborhood of egypt , the barren region is called simply the desert .
the whole tract is marked , however , throughout , with one <unk> character : the absence of vegetable , and , consequently , of animal life , on account of the absence of rain .
the rising of a range of lofty mountains in the center of it , to produce a precipitation of moisture from the air , would probably transform the whole of the vast waste into as verdant , and fertile , and populous a region as any on the globe .
[ illustration : valley of the nile ] as it is , there are no such mountains .
the whole tract is nearly level , and so little elevated above the sea , that , at the distance of many hundred miles in the interior , the land rises only to the height of a few hundred feet above the surface of the mediterranean ; whereas in new <unk> , at less than one hundred miles from the sea , the chain of the andes rises to elevations of from ten to fifteen thousand feet .
such an ascent as that of a few hundred feet in hundreds of miles would be wholly imperceptible to any ordinary mode of observation ; and the great <unk> region , accordingly , of africa and <name> is , as it appears to the traveler , one vast plain , a thousand miles wide and five thousand miles long , with only one considerable interruption to the dead monotony which reigns , with that exception , every where over the immense expanse of silence and solitude .
the single interval of <unk> and life is the valley of the nile .
there are , however , in fact , three interruptions to the continuity of this plain , though only one of them constitutes any considerable interruption to its barrenness .
they are all of them valleys , extending from north to south , and lying side by side .
the most easterly of these valleys is so deep that the waters of the ocean flow into it from the south , forming a long and narrow inlet called the red sea .
as this inlet communicates freely with the ocean , it is always nearly of the same level , and as the evaporation from it is not sufficient to produce rain , it does not even <unk> its own shores .
its presence varies the dreary scenery of the landscape , it is true , by giving us surging waters to look upon instead of driving sands ; but this is all .
with the exception of the spectacle of an english steamer passing , at weary intervals , over its dreary expanse , and some <unk> remains of ancient cities on its eastern shore , it affords scarcely any indications of life .
it does very little , therefore , to relieve the monotonous aspect of solitude and desolation which reigns over the region into which it has intruded .
the most westerly of the three valleys to which we have alluded is only a slight depression of the surface of the land marked by a line of <unk> .
the depression is not sufficient to admit the waters of the mediterranean , nor are there any rains over any portion of the valley which it forms sufficient to make it the bed of a stream .
springs issue , however , here and there , in several places , from the ground , and , <unk> through the sands along the valley , give fertility to little <unk> , long and narrow , which , by the contrast that they form with the surrounding desolation , seem to the traveler to possess the verdure and beauty of paradise .
there is a line of these <unk> extending along this westerly depression , and some of them are of considerable extent .
the oasis of <unk> , on which stood the <unk> <name> of jupiter ammon , was many miles in extent , and was said to have contained in ancient times a population of eight thousand souls .
thus , while the most easterly of the three valleys which we have named was sunk so low as to admit the ocean to flow freely into it , the most westerly was so slightly depressed that it gained only a circumscribed and limited fertility through the springs , which , in the lowest portions of it , <unk> from the ground .
the third valley  the central one  remains now to be described .
the reader <name> observe , by referring once more to the map , that south of the great <unk> region of which we are speaking , there lie groups and ranges of mountains in abyssinia , called the mountains of the moon .
these mountains are near the equator , and the relation which they sustain to the surrounding seas , and to currents of wind which blow in that quarter of the world , is such , that they bring down from the atmosphere , especially in certain seasons of the year , vast and continual torrents of rain .
the water which thus falls <unk> the mountain sides and deluges the valleys .
there is a great portion of it which can not flow to the southward or eastward toward the sea , as the whole country consists , in those directions , of continuous tracts of elevated land .
the rush of water thus turns to the northward , and , pressing on across the desert through the great central valley which we have referred to above , it finds an outlet , at last , in the mediterranean , at a point two thousand miles distant from the place where the immense condenser <name> it from the skies .
the river thus created is the nile .
it is formed , in a word , by the surplus waters of a district <unk> with rains , in their progress across a <unk> desert , seeking the sea .
if the surplus of water upon the <unk> mountains had been constant and uniform , the stream , in its passage across the desert , would have communicated very little fertility to the barren sands which it traversed .
the immediate banks of the river would have , perhaps , been fringed with verdure , but the influence of the irrigation would have extended no farther than the water itself could have reached , by percolation through the sand .
but the flow of the water is not thus uniform and steady .
in a certain season of the year the rains are incessant , and they descend with such abundance and profusion as almost to <unk> the districts where they fall .
immense torrents stream down the mountain sides ; the valleys are <unk> ; plains turn into morasses , and morasses into lakes .
in a word , the country becomes half submerged , and the accumulated mass of waters would rush with great force and violence down the central valley of the desert , which forms their only outlet , if the passage were narrow , and if it made any considerable descent in its course to the sea .
it is , however , not narrow , and the descent is very small .
the depression in the surface of the desert , through which the water flows , is from five to ten miles wide , and , though it is nearly two thousand miles from the rainy district across the desert to the sea , the country for the whole distance is almost level .
there is only sufficient descent , especially for the last thousand miles , to determine a very gentle current to the northward in the waters of the stream .
under these circumstances , the immense quantity of water which falls in the rainy district in these <unk> tropical showers , expands over the whole valley , and forms for a time an immense lake , extending in length across the whole breadth of the desert .
this lake is , of course , from five to ten miles wide , and a thousand miles long .
the water in it is shallow and turbid , and it has a gentle current toward the north .
the rains , at length , in a great measure cease ; but it requires some months for the water to run off and leave the valley dry .
as soon as it is gone , there springs up from the whole surface of the ground which has been thus submerged a most rank and luxuriant vegetation .
this vegetation , now wholly regulated and controlled by the hand of man , must have been , in its original and primeval state , of a very peculiar character .
it must have consisted of such plants only as could exist under the condition of having the soil in which they grew laid , for a quarter of the year , wholly under water .
this circumstance , probably , prevented the valley of the nile from having been , like other fertile tracts of land , encumbered , in its native state , with forests .
for the same reason , wild beasts could never have haunted it .
there were no forests to shelter them , and no refuge or retreat for them but the dry and barren desert , during the period of the annual inundations .
this most extraordinary valley seems thus to have been formed and preserved by nature herself for the special possession of man .
she herself seems to have held it in reserve for him from the very morning of creation , refusing admission into it to every plant and every animal that might hinder or disturb his <unk> and control .
and if he were to abandon it now for a thousand years , and then return to it once more , he would find it just as he left it , ready for his immediate possession .
there would be no wild beasts that he must first expel , and no tangled forests would have sprung up , that his ax must first remove .
nature is the <unk> who keeps this garden of the world in order , and the means and machinery by which she <unk> are the grand <unk> surfaces of the seas , the beams of the tropical sun , the lofty summits of the <unk> mountains , and , as the product and result of all this instrumentality , great periodical inundations of summer rain .
for these or some other reasons egypt has been occupied by man from the most remote antiquity .
the oldest records of the human race , made three thousand years ago , speak of egypt as ancient then , when they were written .
not only is tradition silent , but even fable herself does not attempt to tell the story of the origin of her population .
here stand the oldest and most enduring monuments that human power has ever been able to raise .
it is , however , somewhat humiliating to the pride of the race to reflect that the loftiest and proudest , as well as the most permanent and stable of all the works which man has ever accomplished , are but the incidents and <unk> of a thin stratum of alluvial fertility , left upon the sands by the subsiding waters of summer showers .
the most important portion of the <unk> of the nile is the northern portion , where the valley widens and opens toward the sea , forming a triangular plain of about one hundred miles in length on each of the sides , over which the waters of the river flow in a great number of separate creeks and channels .
the whole area forms a vast meadow , intersected every where with <unk> streams of water , and presenting on its surface the most enchanting pictures of fertility , abundance , and beauty .
this region is called the <name> of the nile .
the sea upon the coast is shallow , and the fertile country formed by the deposits of the river seems to have projected somewhat beyond the line of the coast ; although , as the land has not advanced perceptibly for the last eighteen hundred years , it may be somewhat doubtful whether the whole of the apparent protrusion is not due to the natural conformation of the coast , rather than to any changes made by the action of the river .
the <name> of the nile is so level itself , and so little raised above the level of the mediterranean , that the land seems almost a continuation of the same surface with the sea , only , instead of blue waters topped with <unk> waves , we have broad tracts of waving grain , and gentle swells of land crowned with hamlets and villages .
in approaching the coast , the navigator has no distant view of all this verdure and beauty .
it lies so low that it continues beneath the horizon until the ship is close upon the shore .
the first landmarks , in fact , which the seaman makes , are the tops of trees growing apparently out of the water , or the summit of an obelisk , or the capital of a pillar , marking the site of some ancient and dilapidated city .
the most easterly of the channels by which the waters of the river find their way through the <name> to the sea , is called , as it <name> be seen marked upon the map , the <unk> branch .
it forms almost the boundary of the fertile region of the <name> on the eastern side .
there was an ancient city named pelusium near the mouth of it .
this was , of course , the first egyptian city reached by those who arrived by land from the eastward , traveling along the shores of the mediterranean sea .
on account of its thus marking the eastern frontier of the country , it became a point of great importance , and is often mentioned in the histories of ancient times .
the <unk> mouth of the nile , on the other hand , was called the <unk> mouth .
the distance along the coast from the <unk> mouth to pelusium was about a hundred miles .
the outline of the coast was formerly , as it still continues to be , very irregular , and the water shallow .
extended banks of sand protruded into the sea , and the sea itself , as if in retaliation , formed innumerable creeks , and <unk> , and lagoons in the land .
along this irregular and uncertain boundary the waters of the nile and the surges of the mediterranean kept up an eternal war , with energies so nearly equal , that now , after the lapse of eighteen hundred years since the state of the contest began to be recorded , neither side has been found to have gained any perceptible advantage over the other .
the river brings the sands down , and the sea drives them incessantly back , keeping the whole line of the shore in such a condition as to make it extremely dangerous and difficult of access to man .
it <name> be obvious , from this description of the valley of the nile , that it formed a country which in ancient times isolated and secluded , in a very striking manner , from all the rest of the world .
it was wholly shut in by deserts , on every side , by land ; and the shoals , and <unk> , and other dangers of navigation which marked the line of the coast , seemed to forbid approach by sea .
here it remained for many ages , under the rule of its own native ancient kings .
its population was peaceful and industrious .
its scholars were famed throughout the world for their learning , their science , and their philosophy .
it was in these ages , before other nations had intruded upon its peaceful seclusion , that the pyramids were built , and the enormous <unk> carved , and those vast temples reared whose ruined columns are now the wonder of mankind .
during these remote ages , too , egypt was , as now , the land of perpetual fertility and abundance .
there would always be corn in egypt , wherever else famine might rage .
the neighboring nations and tribes in arabia , palestine , and syria , found their way to it , accordingly , across the deserts on the eastern side , when driven by want , and thus opened a way of communication .
at length the persian monarchs , after extending their empire westward to the mediterranean , found access by the same road to pelusium , and thence <unk> and conquered the country .
at last , about two hundred and fifty years before the time of <name> , <name> the great , when he <unk> the persian empire , took possession of egypt , and annexed it , among the other persian provinces , to his own dominions .
at the division of <name> 's empire , after his death , egypt fell to one of his generals , named ptolemy .
ptolemy made it his kingdom , and left it , at his death , to his heirs .
a long line of sovereigns succeeded him , known in history as the dynasty of the ptolemies  greek princes , reigning over an egyptian realm .
<name> was the daughter of the eleventh in the line .
the capital of the ptolemies was <name> .
until the time of <name> 's conquest , egypt had no sea-port .
there were several <unk> along the coast , but no proper harbor .
in fact egypt had then so little commercial intercourse with the rest of the world , that she scarcely needed any .
<name> 's engineers , however , in exploring the shore , found a point not far from the <unk> mouth of the nile where the water was deep , and where there was an anchorage ground protected by an island .
<name> founded a city there , which he called by his own name .
he perfected the harbor by artificial excavations and embankments .
a lofty <unk> was reared , which formed a landmark by day , and exhibited a blazing <name> by night to guide the galleys of the mediterranean in .
a canal was made to connect the port with the nile , and warehouses were erected to contain the stores of merchandise .
in a word , <name> became at once a great commercial capital .
it was the seat , for several centuries , of the magnificent government of the ptolemies ; and so well was its situation chosen for the purposes intended , that it still continues , after the lapse of twenty centuries of revolution and change , one of the principal <unk> of the commerce of the east .

the founder of the dynasty of the ptolemies  the ruler into whose hands the kingdom of egypt fell , as has already been stated , at the death of <name> the great  was a macedonian general in <name> 's army .
the circumstances of his birth , and the events which led to his entering into the service of <name> , were somewhat peculiar .
his mother , whose name was arsinoÃ« , was a personal favorite and companion of <name> , king of macedon , the father of <name> .
<name> at length gave arsinoÃ« in marriage to a certain man of his court named <unk> .
a very short time after the marriage , ptolemy was born .
<name> treated the child with the same consideration and favor that he had evinced toward the mother .
the boy was called the son of <unk> , but his position in the <name> court of macedon was as high and honorable , and the attentions which he received were as great , as he could have expected to enjoy if he had been in reality a son of the king .
as he grew up , he attained to official stations of considerable responsibility and power .
in the course of time , a certain transaction occurred by means of which ptolemy involved himself in serious difficulty with <name> , though by the same means he made <name> very strongly his friend .
there was a province of the persian empire called <unk> , situated in the southwestern part of <name> minor .
the governor of this province had offered his daughter to <name> as the wife of one of his sons named <unk> , the half brother of <name> .
<name> 's mother , who was not the mother of <unk> , was jealous of this proposed marriage .
she thought that it was part of a scheme for bringing <unk> forward into public notice , and finally making him the heir to <name> 's throne ; whereas she was very <name> that this splendid inheritance should be reserved for her own son .
accordingly , she proposed to <name> that they should send a secret embassage to the persian governor , and represent to him that it would be much better , both for him and for his daughter , that she should have <name> instead of <unk> for a husband , and induce him , if possible , to demand of <name> that he should make the change .
<name> entered readily into this scheme , and various courtiers , ptolemy among the rest , undertook to aid him in the accomplishment of it .
the embassy was sent .
the governor of <unk> was very much pleased with the change which they proposed to him .
in fact , the whole plan seemed to be going on very successfully toward its accomplishment , when , by some means or other , <name> discovered the intrigue .
he went immediately into <name> 's apartment , highly excited with resentment and anger .
he had never intended to make <unk> , whose birth on the mother 's side was obscure and ignoble , the heir to his throne , and he reproached <name> in the bitterest terms for being of so <unk> and degenerate a spirit as to <name> to marry the daughter of a persian governor ; a man who was , in fact , the mere slave , as he said , of a barbarian king .
<name> 's scheme was thus totally defeated ; and so displeased was his father with the officers who had undertaken to aid him in the execution of it , that he banished them all from the kingdom .
ptolemy , in consequence of this decree , wandered about an exile from his country for some years , until at length the death of <name> enabled <name> to recall him .
<name> succeeded his father as king of macedon , and immediately made ptolemy one of his principal generals .
ptolemy rose , in fact , to a very high command in the macedonian army , and distinguished himself very greatly in all the celebrated conqueror 's subsequent campaigns .
in the persian invasion , ptolemy commanded one of the three grand divisions of the army , and he rendered repeatedly the most signal services to the cause of his master .
he was employed on the most distant and dangerous enterprises , and was often intrusted with the management of affairs of the utmost importance .
he was very successful in all his undertakings .
he conquered armies , reduced fortresses , <unk> treaties , and evinced , in a word , the highest degree of military energy and skill .
he once saved <name> 's life by discovering and revealing a dangerous conspiracy which had been formed against the king .
<name> had the opportunity to <unk> this favor , through a divine interposition vouchsafed to him , it was said , for the express purpose of enabling him to evince his gratitude .
ptolemy had been wounded by a poisoned arrow , and when all the remedies and <unk> of the physicians had failed , and the patient was apparently about to die , an effectual means of cure was revealed to <name> in a dream , and ptolemy , in his turn , was saved .
at the great rejoicings at susa , when <name> 's conquests were completed , ptolemy was honored with a golden crown , and he was married , with great pomp and ceremony , to <unk> , the daughter of one of the most distinguished persian generals .
at length <name> died suddenly , after a night of drinking and <unk> at babylon .
he had no son old enough to succeed him , and his immense empire was divided among his generals .
ptolemy obtained egypt for his share .
he repaired immediately to <name> , with a great army , and a great number of greek attendants and followers , and there commenced a reign which continued , in great prosperity and splendor , for forty years .
the native egyptians were reduced , of course , to subjection and bondage .
all the offices in the army , and all stations of trust and responsibility in civil life , were filled by greeks .
<name> was a greek city , and it became at once one of the most important commercial centers in all those seas .
greek and <name> travelers found now a language spoken in egypt which they could understand , and philosophers and scholars could gratify the curiosity which they had so long felt , in respect to the institutions , and monuments , and wonderful physical characteristics of the country , with safety and pleasure .
in a word , the organization of a greek government over the ancient kingdom , and the establishment of the great commercial relations of the city of <name> , conspired to bring egypt out from its concealment and seclusion , and to open it in some measure to the intercourse , as well as to bring it more fully under the observation , of the rest of mankind .
ptolemy , in fact , made it a special object of his policy to accomplish these ends .
he invited greek scholars , philosophers , poets , and artists , in great <name> , to come to <name> , and to make his capital their abode .
he collected an immense library , which subsequently , under the name of the alexandrian library , became one of the most celebrated collections of books and manuscripts that was ever made .
we shall have occasion to refer more particularly to this library in the next chapter .
besides prosecuting these splendid schemes for the aggrandizement of egypt , king ptolemy was engaged , during almost the whole period of his reign , in waging incessant wars with the surrounding nations .
he engaged in these wars , in part , for the purpose of extending the boundaries of his empire , and in part for <unk> against the aggressions and encroachments of other powers .
he finally succeeded in establishing his kingdom on the most stable and permanent basis , and then , when he was drawing toward the close of his life , being in fact over eighty years of age , he <unk> his throne in favor of his youngest son , whose name was also ptolemy , ptolemy the father , the founder of the dynasty , is known commonly in history by the name of ptolemy <unk> .
his son is called ptolemy philadelphia .
this son , though the youngest , was preferred to his brothers as heir to the throne on account of his being the son of the most favored and beloved of the monarch 's wives .
the determination of <unk> to <unk> the throne himself arose from his wish to put this favorite son in secure possession of it before his death , in order to prevent the older brothers from disputing the succession .
the coronation of <unk> was made one of the most magnificent and imposing ceremonies that <name> pomp and parade ever arranged .
two years afterward ptolemy the father died , and was buried by his son with a magnificence almost equal to that of his own coronation .
his body was deposited in a splendid mausoleum , which had been built for the remains of <name> ; and so high was the veneration which was felt by mankind for the greatness of his exploits and the splendor of his reign , that divine honors were paid to his memory .
such was the origin of the great dynasty of the ptolemies .
some of the early sovereigns of the line followed in some degree the honorable example set them by the distinguished founder of it ; but this example was soon lost , and was succeeded by the most extreme <unk> and <unk> .
the successive sovereigns began soon to live and to reign solely for the gratification of their own sensual propensities and passions .
<unk> begins sometimes with kindness , but it ends always in the most reckless and intolerable cruelty .
the ptolemies became , in the end , the most abominable and terrible tyrants that the principle of absolute and irresponsible power ever produced .
there was one vice in particular , a vice which they seem to have adopted from the asiatic nations of the persian empire , that resulted in the most awful consequences .
this vice was <unk> .
the law of god , proclaimed not only in the scriptures , but in the native instincts of the human soul , forbids <unk> among those connected by close ties of <unk> .
the necessity for such a law rests on considerations which can not here be fully explained .
they are considerations , however , which arise from causes inherent in the very nature of man as a social being , and which are of universal , perpetual , and insurmountable force .
to guard his creatures against the deplorable consequences , both physical and moral , which result from the practice of such marriages , the great author of nature has implanted in every mind an instinctive sense of their <unk> , powerful enough to give effectual warning of the danger , and so universal as to cause a distinct condemnation of them to be recorded in almost every code of written law that has ever been <unk> among mankind .
the persian sovereigns were , however , above all law , and every species of <unk> marriage was practiced by them without shame .
the ptolemies followed their example .
one of the most striking exhibitions of the nature of <unk> domestic life which is afforded by the whole dismal panorama of pagan vice and crime , is presented in the history of the great-grandfather of the <name> who is the principal subject of this narrative .
he was ptolemy physcon , the seventh in the line .
it is necessary to give some particulars of his history and that of his family , in order to explain the circumstances under which <name> herself came upon the stage .
the name physcon , which afterward became his historical designation , was originally given him in contempt and derision .
he was very small of stature in respect to height , but his <unk> and <unk> had made him immensely <unk> in body , so that he looked more like a monster than a man .
the term physcon was a greek word , which denoted <unk> the ridiculous figure that he made .
the circumstances of ptolemy physcon 's accession to the throne afford not only a striking illustration of his character , but a very faithful though terrible picture of the manners and morals of the times .
he had been engaged in a long and cruel war with his brother , who was king before him , in which war he had perpetrated all imaginable atrocities , when at length his brother died , leaving as his survivors his wife , who was also his sister , and a son who was yet a child .
this son was properly the heir to the crown .
physcon himself , being a brother , had no claim , as against a son .
the name of the <name> was <name> .
this was , in fact , a very common name among the princesses of the <unk> line .
<name> , besides her son , had a daughter , who was at this time a young and beautiful girl .
her name was also <name> .
she was , of course , the niece , as her mother was the sister , of physcon .
the plan of <name> the mother , after her husband 's death , was to make her son the king of egypt , and to govern herself , as regent , until he should become of age .
the friends and adherents of physcon , however , formed a strong party in his favor .
they sent for him to come to <name> to assert his claims to the throne .
he came , and a new civil war was on the point of breaking out between the brother and sister , when at length the dispute was settled by a treaty , in which it was stipulated that physcon should marry <name> , and be king ; but that he should make the son of <name> by her former husband his heir .
this treaty was carried into effect so far as the celebration of the marriage with the mother was concerned , and the establishment of physcon upon the throne .
but the <unk> monster , instead of keeping his <name> in respect to the boy , determined to murder him ; and so open and brutal were his habits of violence and cruelty , that he undertook to perpetrate the deed himself , in open day .
the boy fled shrieking to the mother's arms for protection , and physcon stabbed and killed him there , exhibiting the spectacle of a <unk> husband murdering the son of his wife in her very arms !
it is easy to conceive what sort of affection would exist between a husband and a wife after such transactions as these .
in fact , there had been no love between them from the beginning .
the marriage had been solely a political arrangement .
physcon hated his wife , and had murdered her son , and then , as if to complete the exhibition of the brutal lawlessness and <unk> of his passions , he ended with falling in love with her daughter .
the beautiful girl looked upon this heartless monster , as ugly and deformed in body as he was in mind , with absolute horror .
but she was wholly in his power .
he compelled her , by violence , to submit to his <name> .
he repudiated the mother , and forced the daughter to become his wife .
physcon displayed the same qualities of brutal tyranny and cruelty in the treatment of his subjects that he manifested in his own domestic relations .
the particulars we can not here give , but can only say that his atrocities became at length absolutely intolerable , and a revolt so formidable broke out , that he fled from the country .
in fact he barely escaped with his life , as the mob had surrounded the palace and were setting it on fire , intending to burn the tyrant himself and all the accomplices of his crimes together .
physcon , however , contrived to make his escape .
he fled to the island of cyprus , taking with him a certain beautiful boy , his son by the <name> whom he had divorced ; for they had been married long enough before the divorce , to have a son .
the name of this boy was <unk> .
his mother was very tenderly attached to him , and physcon took him away on this very account , to keep him as a hostage for his mother 's good behavior .
he fancied that , when he was gone , she might possibly attempt to resume possession of the throne .
his expectations in this respect were realized .
the people of <name> rallied around <name> , and called upon her to take the crown .
she did so , feeling , perhaps , some misgivings in respect to the danger which such a step might possibly bring upon her absent boy .
she quieted herself , however , by the thought that he was in the hands of his own father , and that he could not possibly come to harm .
after some little time had elapsed , and <name> was beginning to be well established in her possession of the supreme power at <name> , her <unk> approached , and arrangements were made for celebrating it in the most magnificent manner .
when the day arrived , the whole city was given up to festivities and rejoicing .
grand entertainments were given in the palace , and games , spectacles , and plays in every variety , were exhibited and performed in all quarters of the city .
<name> herself was enjoying a magnificent entertainment , given to the lords and ladies of the court and the officers of her army , in one of the <name> palaces .
in the midst of this scene of festivity and pleasure , it was announced to the <name> that a large box had arrived for her .
the box was brought into the apartment .
it had the appearance of containing some magnificent present , sent in at that time by some friend in honor of the occasion .
the curiosity of the <name> was excited to know what the mysterious <unk> might contain .
she ordered it to be opened ; and the guests gathered around , each eager to obtain the first glimpse of the contents .
the lid was removed , and a cloth beneath it was raised , when , to the unutterable horror of all who witnessed the spectacle , there was seen the head and hands of <name> 's beautiful boy , lying among masses of human flesh , which consisted of the rest of his body cut into pieces .
the head had been left entire , that the wretched mother might recognize in the pale and lifeless features the countenance of her son .
physcon had sent the box to <name> , with orders that it should be retained until the evening of the <unk> , and then presented publicly to <name> in the midst of the festivities of the scene .
the shrieks and cries with which she filled the apartments of the palace at the first sight of the dreadful spectacle , and the agony of long-continued and <unk> grief which followed , showed how well the cruel contrivance of the tyrant was fitted to accomplish its end .
it gives us no pleasure to write , and we are sure it can give our readers no pleasure to peruse , such shocking stories of bloody cruelty as these .
it is necessary , however , to a just appreciation of the character of the great subject of this history , that we should understand the nature of the domestic influences that reigned in the family from which she sprung .
in fact , it is due , as a matter of simple justice to her , that we should know what these influences were , and what were the examples set before her in her early life ; since the privileges and advantages which the young enjoy in their early years , and , on the other hand , the evil influences under which they suffer , are to be taken very seriously into the account when we are passing judgment upon the follies and sins into which they subsequently fall .
the monster physcon lived , it is true , two or three generations before the great <name> ; but the character of the intermediate generations , until the time of her birth , continued much the same .
in fact , the cruelty , corruption , and vice which reigned in every branch of the <name> family increased rather than diminished .
the beautiful niece of physcon , who , at the time of her compulsory marriage with him , evinced such an aversion to the monster , had become , at the period of her husband's death , as great a monster of ambition , selfishness , and cruelty as he .
she had two sons , lathyrus and <name> .
physcon , when he died , left the kingdom of egypt to her by <name> , <unk> her to associate with her in the government whichever of these two sons she might choose .
the oldest was best entitled to this privilege , by his priority of birth ; but she preferred the youngest , as she thought that her own power would be more absolute in reigning in conjunction with him , since he would be more completely under her control .
the leading powers , however , in <name> , resisted this plan , and insisted on <name> 's associating her oldest son , lathyrus , with her in the government of the realm .
they compelled her to recall lathyrus from the banishment into which she had sent him , and to put him nominally upon the throne .
<name> yielded to this necessity , but she forced her son to repudiate his wife , and to take , instead , another woman , whom she fancied she could make more <unk> to her <name> .
the mother and the son went on together for a time , lathyrus being nominally king , though her determination that she would rule , and his struggles to resist her intolerable tyranny , made their wretched household the scene of terrible a perpetual quarrels .
at last <name> seized a number of lathyrus 's servants , the <unk> who were employed in various offices about the palace , and after wounding and <unk> them in a horrible manner , she exhibited them to the populace , saying that it was lathyrus that had inflicted the cruel injuries upon the sufferers , and calling upon them to arise and punish him for his crimes .
in this and in other similar ways she awakened among the people of the court and of the city such an animosity against lathyrus , that they expelled him from the country .
there followed a long series of cruel and bloody wars , between the mother and the son in the course of which each party perpetrated against the other almost every imaginable deed of atrocity and crime .
<name> , the youngest son was so afraid of his terrible mother , that he did not dare to remain in <name> with her , but went into a sort of banishment of his own accord .
he , however , finally returned to egypt .
his mother immediately supposed that he was intending to disturb her possession of power , and resolved to destroy him .
he became acquainted with her designs , and , grown desperate by the long-continued pressure of her intolerable tyranny , he resolved to bring the anxiety and terror in which he lived to an end by killing her .
this he did , and then fled the country .
lathyrus , his brother , then returned , and reigned for the rest of his days in a tolerable degree of quietness and peace .
at length lathyrus died , and left the kingdom to his son , ptolemy <unk> , who was the great <name> 's father .
we can not soften the picture which is exhibited to our view in the history of this celebrated family , by regarding the mother of <unk> , in the masculine and merciless trails and principles which she displayed so energetically throughout her terrible career , as an exception to the general character of the princesses who appeared from time to time in the line .
in ambition , selfishness , unnatural and reckless cruelty , and utter disregard of every virtuous principle and of every domestic tie , she was but the type and representative of all the rest .
she had two daughters , for example , who were the consistent and worthy followers of such a mother .
a passage in the lives of these sisters illustrates very forcibly the kind of <unk> affection which prevailed in the family of the ptolemies .
the case was this : there were two princes of syria , a country lying northeast of the mediterranean sea , and so not very far from egypt , who , though they were brothers , were in a state of most deadly hostility to each other .
one had attempted to poison the other , and afterward a war had broken out between them , and all syria was suffering from the ravages of their armies .
one of the sisters , of whom we have been speaking , married one of these princes .
her name was <unk> .
after some time , but yet while the unnatural war was still raging between the two brothers , <name> , the other sister  the same <name> , in fact , that had been divorced from lathyrus at the instance of his mother  espoused the other brother .
<unk> was exceedingly incensed against <name> for marrying her husband 's mortal foe , and the implacable hostility and hate of the sisters was thenceforth added to that which the brothers had before exhibited , to complete the display of unnatural and <unk> passion which this shameful contest presented to the world .
in fact , <unk> from this time seemed to feel a new and <unk> interest in the contest , from her eager <name> to revenge herself on her sister .
she watched the progress of it , and took an active part in pressing forward the active prosecution of the war .
the party of her husband , either from this or some other causes , seemed to be gaining the day .
the husband of <name> was driven from one part of the country to another , and at length , in order to provide for the security of his wife , he left her in antioch , a large and <unk> city , where he supposed that she would be safe , while he himself was engaged in prosecuting the war in other quarters where his presence seemed to be required .
on learning that her sister was at antioch , <unk> urged her husband to attack the place .
he accordingly advanced with a strong detachment of the army , and besieged and took the city .
<name> would , of course , have fallen into his hands as a captive ; but , to escape this fate , she fled to a <name> for refuge .
a <name> was considered , in those days , an inviolable sanctuary .
the soldiers accordingly left her there .
<unk> , however , made a request that her husband would deliver the unhappy fugitive into her hands .
she was determined , she said , to kill her .
her husband remonstrated with her against this atrocious proposal .
" it would be a wholly useless act of cruelty , " said he , " to destroy her life .
she can do us no possible harm in the future progress of the war , while to murder her under these circumstances <name> only <unk> her husband and her friends , and nerve them with new strength for the remainder of the contest .
and then , besides , she has taken refuge in a <name> ; and if we violate that sanctuary , we shall incur , by such an act of sacrilege , the implacable displeasure of heaven .
consider , too , that she is your sister , and for you to kill her would be to commit an unnatural and wholly inexcusable crime . "
so saying , he commanded <unk> to say no more upon the subject , for he would on no account consent that <name> should suffer any injury whatever .
this refusal on the part of her husband to comply with her request only inflamed <unk> 's insane resentment and anger the more .
in fact , the earnestness with which he espoused her sister 's cause , and the interest which he seemed to feel in her fate , aroused <unk> 's jealousy .
she believed , or pretended to believe , that her husband was influenced by a sentiment of love in so warmly defending her .
the object of her hate , from being simply an enemy , became now , in her view , a rival , and she resolved that , at all hazards , she should be destroyed .
she accordingly ordered a body of desperate soldiers to break into the <name> and seize her .
<name> fled in terror to the altar , and clung to it with such convulsive force that the soldiers cut her hands off before they could tear her away , and then , maddened by her resistance and the sight of blood , they stabbed her again and again upon the floor of the <name> , where she fell .
the appalling shrieks with which the wretched victim filled the air in the first moments of her flight and her terror , subsided , as her life ebbed away , into the most awful imprecations of the judgments of heaven upon the head of the unnatural sister whose implacable hate had destroyed her .
notwithstanding the specimens that we have thus given of the character and action of this extraordinary family , the government of this dynasty , extending , as it did , through the reigns of thirteen sovereigns and over a period of nearly three hundred years , has always been considered one of the most liberal , enlightened , and prosperous of all the governments of ancient times .
we shall have something to say in the next chapter in respect to the internal condition of the country while these violent men were upon the throne .
in the mean time , we <name> here only add , that whoever is inclined , in observing the ambition , the selfishness , the party spirit , the unworthy intrigues , and the irregularities of moral conduct , which modern rulers and statesmen sometimes exhibit to mankind in their personal and political career , to believe in a <unk> and <unk> of national character as the world advances in age , <name> be very effectually <unk> by reading attentively a full history of this celebrated dynasty , and reflecting , as he reads , that the narrative presents , on the whole , a fair and honest exhibition of the general character of the men by whom , in ancient times , the world was governed .

it must not be imagined by the reader that the scenes of vicious indulgence , and reckless cruelty and crime , which were exhibited with such dreadful frequency , and carried to such an enormous excess in the palaces of the egyptian kings , prevailed to the same extent throughout the mass of the community during the period of their reign .
the internal administration of government , and the institutions by which the industrial pursuits of the mass of the people were regulated , and peace and order preserved , and justice enforced between man and man , were all this time in the hands of men well qualified , on the whole , for the trusts committed to their charge , and in a good degree faithful in the performance of their duties ; and thus the ordinary affairs of government , and the general routine of domestic and social life , went on , notwithstanding the profligacy of the kings , in a course of very tolerable peace , prosperity , and happiness .
during every one of the three hundred years over which the history of the ptolemies extends , the whole length and breadth of the land of egypt exhibited , with comparatively few interruptions , one wide-spread scene of busy industry .
the inundations came at their appointed season , and then regularly retired .
the boundless fields which the waters had <unk> were then every where tilled .
the lands were plowed ; the seed was sown ; the canals and <unk> , which <unk> from the river in every direction over the ground , were opened or closed , as the case required , to regulate the irrigation .
the inhabitants were busy , and , consequently , they were virtuous .
and as the sky of egypt is seldom or never darkened by clouds and storms , the scene presented to the eye the same <unk> aspect of smiling verdure and beauty , day after day , and month after month , until the ripened grain was gathered into the <unk> , and the land was cleared for another inundation .
we say that the people were virtuous because they were busy ; for there is no principle of political economy more fully established than that vice in the social state is the incident and symptom of idleness .
it prevails always in those classes of every great population who are either released by the possession of fixed and <unk> wealth from the necessity , or excluded by their poverty and degradation from the advantage , of useful employment .
wealth that is free , and subject to its possessor 's control , so that he can , if he <name> , occupy himself in the management of it , while it sometimes may make individuals vicious , does not generally corrupt classes of men , for it does not make them idle .
but wherever the institutions of a country are such as to create an aristocratic class , whose incomes depend on <unk> estates , or on fixed and permanent <unk> , so that the capital on which they live can not afford them any mental occupation , they are doomed necessarily to inaction and idleness .
vicious pleasures and indulgences are , with such a class as a whole , the inevitable result ; for the innocent enjoyments of man are planned and designed by the author of nature only for the intervals of rest and repose in a life of activity .
they are always found wholly insufficient to satisfy one who makes pleasure the whole end and aim of his being .
in the same manner , if , either from the influence of the social institutions of a country , or from the operation of natural causes which human power is unable to control , there is a class of men too low , and degraded , and miserable to be reached by the ordinary inducements to daily toil , so certain are they to grow corrupt and depraved , that degradation has become in all languages a term almost synonymous with vice .
there are many exceptions , it is true , to these general laws .
many active men are very wicked ; and there have been frequent instances of the most exalted virtue among nobles and kings .
still , as a general law , it is unquestionably true that vice is the incident of idleness ; and the sphere of vice , therefore , is at the top and at the bottom of society  those being the regions in which idleness reigns .
the great remedy , too , for vice is employment .
to make a community virtuous , it is essential that all ranks and gradations of it , from the highest to the lowest , should have something to do .
in accordance with these principles , we observe that , while the most extreme and abominable wickedness seemed to hold continual and absolute sway in the palaces of the ptolemies , and among the nobles of their courts , the working ministers of state , and the men on whom the actual governmental functions devolved , discharged their duties with wisdom and fidelity , and throughout all the ordinary ranks and gradations of society there prevailed generally a very considerable degree of industry , prosperity and happiness .
this prosperity prevailed not only in the rural districts of the <name> and along the valley of the nile , but also among the merchants , and navigators , and artisans of <name> .
<name> became , in fact , very soon after it was founded , a very great and busy city .
many things conspired to make it at once a great commercial <unk> .
in the first place , it was the depot of export for all the surplus grain and other agricultural produce which was raised in such abundance along the egyptian valley .
this produce was brought down in boats to the upper point of the <name> , where the branches of the river divided , and thence down the <unk> branch to the city .
the city was not , in fact , situated directly upon this branch , but upon a narrow tongue of land , at a little distance from it , near the sea .
it was not easy to enter the channel directly , on account of the bars and <unk> at its mouth , produced by the eternal conflict between the waters of the river and the surges of the sea .
the water was deep , however , as <name> 's engineers had discovered , at the place where the city was built , and , by establishing the port there , and then cutting a canal across to the nile , they were enabled to bring the river and the sea at once into easy communication .
the produce of the valley was thus brought down the river and through the canal to the city .
here immense warehouses and granaries were erected for its reception , that it might be safely preserved until the ships that came into the port were ready to take it away .
these ships came from syria , from all the coasts of <name> minor , from greece , and from rome .
they brought the agricultural productions of their own countries , as well as articles of manufacture of various kinds ; these they sold to the merchants of <name> , and purchased the productions of egypt in return .
the port of <name> presented thus a constant picture of life and animation .
merchant ships were continually coming and going , or lying at anchor in the <unk> .
seamen were hoisting sails , or raising anchors , or rowing their capacious galleys through the water , singing , as they pulled , to the motion of the oars .
within the city there was the same ceaseless activity .
here groups of men were unloading the canal boats which had arrived from the river .
there porters were transporting bales of merchandise or sacks of grain from a warehouse to a pier , or from one landing to another the occasional parading of the king 's guards , or the arrival and departure of ships of war to land or to take away bodies of armed men , were occurrences that sometimes intervened to interrupt , or as perhaps the people then would have said , to adorn this scene of useful industry ; and now and then , for a brief period , these peaceful <unk> would be wholly suspended and set aside by a revolt or by a civil war , waged by rival brothers against each other , or <unk> by the conflicting claims of a mother and son .
these interruptions , however , were comparatively few , and , in ordinary cases , not of long continuance .
it was for the interest of all branches of the <name> line to do as little injury as possible to the commercial and agricultural operations of the realm .
in fact , it was on the prosperity of those operations that the revenues depended .
the rulers were well aware of this , and so , however <unk> two rival princes may have hated one another , and however desperately each party may have struggled to destroy all active combatants whom they should find in arms against them , they were both under every possible inducement to spare the private property and the lives of the peaceful population .
this population , in fact , engaged thus in profitable industry , constituted , with the avails of their labors , the very estate for which the combatants were contending .
seeing the subject in this light , the egyptian sovereigns , especially <name> and the earlier ptolemies , made every effort in their power to promote the commercial greatness of <name> .
they built palaces , it is true , but they also built warehouses .
one of the most expensive and celebrated of all the edifices that they reared was the <unk> which has been already alluded to .
this <unk> was a lofty tower , built of white marble .
it was situated upon the island of pharos , opposite to the city , and at some distance from it .
there was a sort of isthmus of shoals and <unk> connecting the island with the shore .
over these shallows a pier or causeway was built , which finally became a broad and inhabited neck .
the principal part of the ancient city , however , was on the main land .
the curvature of the earth requires that a <unk> on a coast should have a considerable elevation , otherwise its summit would not appear above the horizon , unless the mariner were very near .
to attain this elevation , the architects usually take advantage of some hill or <name> , or <name> eminence near the shore .
there was , however , no opportunity to do this at pharos ; for the island was , like the main land , level and low .
the requisite elevation could only be attained , therefore , by the masonry of an edifice , and the blocks of marble necessary for the work had to be brought from a great distance .
the alexandrian <unk> was reared in the time of ptolemy <unk> , the second monarch in the line .
no pains or expense were spared in its construction .
the edifice , when completed , was considered one of the seven wonders of the world .
it was indebted for its fame , however , in some degree , undoubtedly to the conspicuousness of its situation , rising , as it did , at the entrance of the greatest commercial <unk> of its time , and standing there , like a pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night , to attract the welcome gaze of every wandering mariner whose ship came within its horizon , and to awaken his gratitude by <unk> him its guidance and <unk> his fears .
the light at the top of the tower was produced by a fire , made of such combustibles as would emit the brightest flame .
this fire burned slowly through the day , and then was kindled up anew when the sun went down , and was continually <unk> through the night with fresh supplies of fuel .
in modern times , a much more convenient and economical mode is adopted to produce the requisite illumination .
a great blazing lamp burns brilliantly in the center of the lantern of the tower , and all that part of the radiation from the flame which would naturally have beamed upward , or downward , or laterally , or back toward the land , is so turned by a curious system of <unk> and <unk> lenses , most ingeniously contrived and very exactly adjusted , as to be thrown forward in one broad and thin , but brilliant sheet of light , which shoots out where its radiance is needed , over the surface of the sea .
before these inventions were perfected , far the largest portion of the light emitted by the illumination of <unk> towers streamed away <unk> in landward directions , or was lost among the stars .
of course , the <name> of erecting such an edifice as the pharos of <name> , and of maintaining it in the performance of its functions , was very great ; the question might , however , very naturally arise whether this <name> was justly due to the architect through whose scientific skill the work was actually accomplished , or to the monarch by whose power and resources the architect was sustained .
the name of the architect was <unk> .
he was a greek .
the monarch was , as has already been stated , the second ptolemy , called commonly ptolemy <unk> .
ptolemy ordered that , in completing the tower , a marble tablet should be built into the wall , at a suitable place near the summit , and that a proper inscription should be carved upon it , with his name as the builder of the edifice conspicuous thereon .
<unk> preferred inserting his own name .
he accordingly made the tablet and set it in its place .
he cut the inscription upon the face of it , in greek characters , with his own name as the author of the work .
he did this secretly , and then covered the face of the tablet with an artificial composition , made with lime , to imitate the natural surface of the stone .
on this outer surface he cut a new inscription , in which he inserted the name of the king .
in process of time the lime <unk> away , the king 's inscription disappeared , and his own , which thenceforward continued as long as the building endured , came out to view .
the pharos was said to have been four hundred feet high .
it was famed throughout the world for many centuries ; nothing , however , remains of it now but a heap of useless and unmeaning ruins .
besides the light that beamed from the summit of this lofty tower , there was another center of radiance and illumination in ancient <name> , which was in some respects still more conspicuous and renowned , namely , an immense library and museum established and maintained by the ptolemies .
the museum , which was first established , was not , as its name might now imply , a collection of curiosities , but an institution of learning , consisting of a body of learned men , who devoted their time to philosophical and scientific pursuits .
the institution was richly endowed , and magnificent buildings were erected for its use .
the king who established it began immediately to make a collection of books for the use of the members of the institution .
this was attended with great expense , as every book that was added to the collection required to be <unk> with a pen on parchment or <unk> with infinite labor and care .
great <name> of <unk> were constantly employed upon this work at the museum .
the kings who were most interested in forming this library would seize the books that were possessed by individual scholars , or that were deposited in the various cities of their dominions , and then , causing beautiful copies of them to be made by the <unk> of the museum , they would retain the originals for the great alexandrian library , and give the copies to the men or the cities that had been thus <unk> .
in the same manner they would borrow , as they called it , from all travelers who visited egypt , any valuable books which they might have in their possession , and , retaining the originals , give them back copies instead .
in process of time the library increased to four hundred thousand volumes .
there was then no longer any room in the buildings of the museum for further additions .
there was , however , in another part of the city , a great <name> called the <unk> .
this <name> was a very magnificent edifice , or , rather , group of edifices , dedicated to the god serapis .
the origin and history of this <name> were very remarkable .
the legend was this : it seems that one of the ancient and <unk> gods of the egyptians was a deity named serapis .
he had been , among other divinities , the object of egyptian adoration ages before <name> was built or the ptolemies reigned .
there was also , by a curious coincidence , a statue of the same name at a great commercial town named <unk> , which was built upon the extremity of a promontory which projected from <name> minor into the <unk> sea .
<unk> was , in some sense , the <name> of the north , being the center and seat of a great portion of the commerce of that quarter of the world .
the serapis of <unk> was considered as the protecting deity of seamen , and the navigators who came and went to and from the city made sacrifices to him , and offered him <unk> and prayers , believing that they were , in a great measure , dependent upon some mysterious and inscrutable power which he exercised for their safety in storms .
they carried the knowledge of his name , and tales of his imaginary <unk> , to all the places that they visited ; and thus the fame of the god became extended , first , to all the coasts of the <unk> sea , and subsequently to distant provinces and kingdoms .
the serapis of <unk> began to be considered every where as the <unk> god of seamen .
accordingly , when the first of the ptolemies was forming his various plans for adorning and <unk> <name> , he received , he said , one night , a divine intimation in a dream that he was to obtain the statue of serapis from <unk> , and set it up in <name> , in a suitable <name> which he was in the mean time to erect in honor of the god .
it is obvious that very great advantages to the city would result from the accomplishment of this design .
in the first place , a <name> to the god serapis would be a new distinction for it in the minds of the rural population , who would undoubtedly suppose that the deity honored by it was their own ancient god .
then the whole maritime and nautical interest of the world , which had been , accustomed to adore the god of <unk> , would turn to <name> as the great center of religious attraction , if their <unk> idol could be carried and placed in a new and magnificent <name> built expressly for him there .
<name> could never be the chief naval port and station of the world , unless it contained the sanctuary and shrine of the god of seamen .
ptolemy sent accordingly to the king of <unk> and proposed to purchase the idol .
the embassage was , however , unsuccessful .
the king refused to give up the god .
the negotiations were continued for two years , but all in vain .
at length , on account of some failure in the regular course of the seasons on that coast , there was a famine there , which became finally so severe that the people of the city were induced to consent to give up their deity to the egyptians in exchange for a supply of corn .
ptolemy sent the corn and received the idol .
he then built the <name> , which , when finished , surpassed in grandeur and magnificence almost every sacred structure in the world .
it was in this <name> that the successive additions to the alexandrian library were deposited , when the apartments of the museum became full .
in the end there were four hundred thousand rolls or volumes in the museum , and three hundred thousand in the <unk> .
the former was called the parent library , and the latter , being , as it were , the offspring of the first , was called the daughter .
ptolemy <unk> , who interested himself very greatly in collecting this library , wished to make it a complete collection of all the books in the world .
he employed scholars to read and study , and travelers to make extensive tours , for the purpose of learning what books existed among all the surrounding nations ; and , when he learned of their existence , he spared no pains or expense in attempting to procure either the originals themselves , or the most perfect and authentic copies of them .
he sent to athens and obtained the works of the most celebrated greek historians , and then causing , as in other cases , most beautiful <unk> to be made , he sent the <unk> back to athens , and a very large sum of money with them as an equivalent for the difference of value between originals and copies in such an exchange .
in the course of the inquiries which ptolemy made into the literature of the surrounding nations , in his search for <unk> to his library , he heard that the jews had certain sacred writings in their <name> at jerusalem , comprising a minute and extremely interesting history of their nation from the earliest periods and also many other books of sacred prophecy and poetry .
these books , which were , in fact , the hebrew scriptures of the old testament , were then wholly unknown to all nations except the jews , and among the jews were known only to priests and scholars .
they were kept sacred at jerusalem .
the jews would have considered them as <unk> in being exhibited to the view of pagan nations .
in fact , the learned men of other countries would not have been able to read them ; for the jews secluded themselves so closely from the rest of mankind , that their language was , in that age , scarcely ever heard beyond the confines of judea and galilee .
ptolemy very naturally thought that a copy of these sacred books would be a great acquisition to his library .
they constituted , in fact , the whole literature of a nation which was , in some respects , the most extraordinary that ever existed on the globe .
ptolemy conceived the idea , also , of not only adding to his library a copy of these writings in the original hebrew , but of causing a translation of them to be made into greek , so that they might easily be read by the greek and <name> scholars who were drawn in great <name> to his capital by the libraries and the learned institutions which he had established there .
the first thing to be effected , however , in accomplishing either of these plans , was to obtain the consent of the jewish authorities .
they would probably object to giving up any copy of their sacred writings at all .
there was one circumstance which led ptolemy to imagine that the jews would , at that time particularly , be averse to granting any request of such a nature coming from an egyptian king , and that was , that during certain wars which had taken place in previous reigns , a considerable number of prisoners had been taken by the egyptians , and had been brought to egypt as captives , where they had been sold to the inhabitants , and were now scattered over the land as slaves .
they were employed as servile laborers in <unk> the fields , or in turning enormous wheels to pump up water from the nile .
the masters of these hapless <unk> conceived , like other <unk> , that they had a right of property in their slaves .
this was in some respects true , since they had bought them of the government at the close of the war for a consideration ; and though they obviously derived from this circumstance no valid <unk> right or claim as against the men personally , it certainly would seem that it gave them a just claim against the government of whom they bought , in case of subsequent <unk> .
ptolemy or his minister , for it can not now be known who was the real actor in these transactions , determined on <unk> these slaves and sending them back to their native land , as a means of <unk> the jews and <unk> them to listen favorably to the request which he was about to prefer for a copy of their sacred writings .
he , however , paid to those who held the captives a very liberal sum for ransom .
the ancient historians , who never allow the interest of their narratives to suffer for want of a proper <unk> on their part of the scale on which the deeds which they record were performed , say that the number of slaves liberated on this occasion was a hundred and twenty thousand , and the sum paid for them , as compensation to the owners , was six hundred talents , equal to six hundred thousand dollars .
[ 1 ] [ footnote 1 : it <name> be sufficiently accurate for the general reader of history to consider the greek talent , referred to in such transactions as these , as equal in english money to two hundred and fifty pounds , in american to a thousand dollars .
it is curious to observe that , large as the total was that was paid for the liberation of these slaves , the amount paid for each individual was , after all , only a sum equal to about five dollars . ]
and yet this was only a preliminary expense to <unk> the way for the acquisition of a single series of books , to add to the variety of the immense collection .
after the liberation and return of the captives , ptolemy sent a splendid embassage to jerusalem , with very respectful letters to the high priest , and with very magnificent presents .
the embassadors were received with the highest honors .
the request of ptolemy that he should be allowed to take a copy of the sacred books for his library was very readily granted .
the priests caused copies to be made of all the sacred writings .
these copies were executed in the most magnificent style , and were splendidly illuminated with letters of gold .
the jewish government also , at ptolemy 's request , designated a company of hebrew scholars , six from each tribe  men learned in both the greek and hebrew languages  to proceed to <name> , and there , at the museum , to make a careful translation of the hebrew books into greek .
as there were twelve tribes , and six <unk> chosen from each , there were seventy-two <unk> in all .
they made their translation , and it was called the <unk> , from the latin <unk> <unk> , which means seventy-two .
although out of judea there was no feeling of reverence for these hebrew scriptures as books of divine authority , there was still a strong interest felt in them as very entertaining and curious works of history , by all the greek and <name> scholars who frequented <name> to study at the museum .
copies were accordingly made of the <unk> translation , and were taken to other countries ; and there , in process of time , copies of the copies were made , until at length the work became extensively circulated throughout the whole learned world .
when , finally , christianity became extended over the <name> empire , the priests and monks looked with even a stronger interest than the ancient scholars had felt upon this early translation of so important a portion of the sacred scriptures .
they made new copies for abbeys , monasteries , and colleges ; and when , at length , the <name> of printing was discovered , this work was one of the first on which the magic power of <unk> was tried .
the original manuscript made by the <unk> of the seventy-two , and all the early <unk> which were made from it , have long since been lost or destroyed ; but , instead of them , we have now hundreds of thousands of copies in compact printed volumes , scattered among the public and private libraries of christendom .
in fact , now , after the lapse of two thousand years , a copy of ptolemy 's <unk> may be obtained of any considerable bookseller in any country of the civilized world ; and though it required a national embassage , and an expenditure , if the accounts are true , of more than a million of dollars , originally to obtain it , it may be procured without difficulty now by two days' wages of an ordinary laborer .
besides the building of the pharos , the museum , and the <name> of serapis , the early ptolemies formed and executed a great many other plans tending to the same ends which the erection of these splendid edifices was designed to secure , namely , to concentrate in <name> all possible means of attraction , commercial , literary , and religious , so as to make the city the great center of interest , and the common resort for all mankind .
they raised immense revenues for these and other purposes by <unk> heavily the whole agricultural produce of the valley of the nile .
the inundations , by the boundless fertility which they annually produced , supplied the <name> <unk> .
thus the <unk> rains at the sources of the nile built the pharos at its mouth , and endowed the alexandrian library .
the taxes laid upon the people of egypt to supply the ptolemies with funds were , in fact , so heavy , that only the bare means of subsistence were left to the mass of the agricultural population .
in admiring the greatness and <name> of the city , therefore , we must remember that there was a gloomy counterpart to its splendor in the very extended destitution and poverty to which the mass of the people were everywhere doomed .
they lived in hamlets of wretched huts along the banks of the river , in order that the capital might be splendidly adorned with temples and palaces .
they passed their lives in darkness and ignorance , that seven hundred thousand volumes of expensive manuscripts might be enrolled at the museum for the use of foreign philosophers and scholars .
the policy of the ptolemies was , perhaps , on the whole , the best , for the general advancement and ultimate welfare of mankind , which could have been pursued in the age in which they lived and acted ; but , in applauding the results which they attained , we must not wholly forget the cost which they incurred in attaining them .
at the same cost , we could , at the present day , far surpass them .
if the people of the united states <name> surrender the comforts and conveniences which they individually enjoy  if the farmers scattered in their comfortable homes on the hill-sides and plains throughout the land <name> give up their houses , their furniture , their carpets , their books , and the privileges of their children , and then  withholding from the produce of their annual toil only a sufficient reservation to sustain them and their families through the year , in a life like that of a beast of burden , spent in some miserable and naked hovel  send the rest to some hereditary sovereign residing upon the atlantic <unk> , that he may build with the proceeds a splendid capital , they may have an <name> now that <name> infinitely exceed the ancient city of the ptolemies in splendor and renown .
the nation , too , would , in such a case , pay for its metropolis the same price , precisely , that the ancient egyptians paid for theirs .
the ptolemies expended the revenues which they raised by this taxation mainly in a very liberal and enlightened manner , for the accomplishment of the purposes which they had in view .
the building of the pharos , the removal of the statue of serapis , and the endowment of the museum and the library were great conceptions , and they were carried into effect in the most complete and perfect manner .
all the other operations which they devised and executed for the extension and aggrandizement of the city were conceived and executed in the same spirit of scientific and enlightened liberality .
streets were opened ; the most splendid palaces were built ; docks , piers and <unk> were constructed , and fortresses and towers were armed and garrisoned .
then every means was employed to attract to the city a great concourse from all the most <unk> nations then existing .
the highest inducements were offered to merchants , mechanics , and artisans to make the city their abode .
poets , painters , <unk> , and scholars of every nation and degree were made welcome , and every facility was afforded them for the prosecution of their various pursuits .
these plans were all eminently successful .
<name> rose rapidly to the highest consideration and importance ; and , at the time when <name>  born to preside over this scene of magnificence and splendor  came upon the stage , the city had but one rival in the world .
that rival was rome .

when the time was approaching in which <name> appeared upon the stage , rome was perhaps the only city that could be considered as the rival of <name> , in the estimation of mankind , in respect to interest and attractiveness as a capital .
in one respect , rome was vastly superior to the egyptian metropolis , and that was in the magnitude and extent of the military power which it wielded among the nations of the earth .
<name> ruled over egypt , and over a few of the neighboring coasts and islands ; but in the course of the three centuries during which she had been acquiring her greatness and fame , the <name> empire had extended itself over almost the whole civilized world .
egypt had been , thus far , too remote to be directly reached ; but the affairs of egypt itself became involved at length with the operations of the <name> power , about the time of <name> 's birth , in a very striking and peculiar manner ; and as the consequences of the transaction were the means of turning the whole course of the <name> 's subsequent history , a narration of it is necessary to a proper understanding of the circumstances under which she commenced her career .
in fact , it was the extension of the <name> empire to the limits of egypt , and the connections which thence arose between the leading <name> generals and the egyptian sovereign , which have made the story of this particular <name> so much more conspicuous , as an object of interest and attention to mankind , than that of any other one of the ten <unk> who rose successively in the same <name> line .
ptolemy <unk> , <name> 's father , was perhaps , in personal character , the most dissipated , degraded , and corrupt of all the sovereigns in the dynasty .
he spent his whole time in vice and <unk> .
the only honest accomplishment that he seemed to possess was his skill in playing upon the flute ; of this he was very vain .
he instituted musical contests , in which the musical performers of <name> played for prizes and crowns ; and he himself was accustomed to enter the lists with the rest as a competitor .
the people of <name> , and the world in general , considered such pursuits as these wholly unworthy the attention of the representative of so illustrious a line of sovereigns , and the abhorrence which they felt for the monarch 's vices and crimes was mingled with a feeling of contempt for the meanness of his ambition .
there was a doubt in respect to his title to the crown , for his birth , on the mother 's side , was irregular and ignoble .
instead , however , of attempting to confirm and secure his possession of power by a vigorous and prosperous administration of the government , he wholly abandoned all concern in respect to the course of public affairs ; and then , to guard against the danger of being deposed , he conceived the plan of getting himself recognized at rome as one of the allies of the <name> people .
if this were once done , he supposed that the <name> government would feel under an obligation to sustain him on his throne in the event of any threatened danger .
the <name> government was a sort of republic , and the two most powerful men in the state at this time were pompey and caesar .
caesar was in the ascendency at rome at the time that ptolemy made his application for an alliance .
pompey was absent in <name> minor , being engaged in prosecuting a war with <unk> , a very powerful monarch , who was at that time resisting the <name> power .
caesar was very deeply involved in debt , and was , moreover , very much in need of money , not only for relief from existing embarrassments , but as a means of subsequent expenditure , to enable him to accomplish certain great political schemes which he was entertaining .
after many negotiations and delays , it was agreed that caesar would exert his influence to secure an alliance between the <name> people and ptolemy , on condition that ptolemy paid him the sum of six thousand talents , equal to about six millions of dollars .
a part of the money , caesar said , was for pompey .
the title of ally was conferred , and ptolemy undertook to raise the money which he had promised by increasing the taxes of his kingdom .
the measures , however , which he thus adopted for the purpose of making himself the more secure in his possession of the throne , proved to be the means of <unk> him .
the discontent and disaffection of his people , which had been strong and universal before , though suppressed and concealed , broke out now into open violence .
that there should be laid upon them , in addition to all their other burdens , these new oppressions , heavier than those which they had endured before , and exacted for such a purpose too , was not to be endured .
to be compelled to see their country sold on any terms to the <name> people was sufficiently hard to bear ; but to be forced to raise , themselves , and pay the price of the transfer , was absolutely intolerable .
<name> commenced a revolt .
ptolemy was not a man to act decidedly against such a demonstration , or , in fact , to evince either calmness or courage in any emergency whatever .
his first thought was to escape from <name> to save his life .
his second , to make the best of his way to rome , to call upon the <name> people to come to the succor of their ally !
ptolemy left five children behind him in his flight the eldest was the <name> <name> , who had already reached maturity .
the second was the great <name> , the subject of this history .
<name> was , at this time , about eleven years old .
there were also two sons , but they were very young .
one of them was named ptolemy .
the <unk> determined on raising <name> to the throne in her father 's place , as soon as his flight was known .
they thought that the sons were too young to attempt to reign in such an emergency , as it was very probable that <unk> , the father , would attempt to recover his kingdom .
<name> very readily accepted the honor and power which were offered to her .
she established herself in her father 's palace , and began her reign in great magnificence and splendor .
in process of time she thought that her position would be strengthened by a marriage with a <name> <name> from some neighboring realm .
she first sent embassadors to make proposals to a <name> of syria named antiochus .
the embassadors came back , bringing word that antiochus was dead , but that he had a brother named seleucus , upon whom the succession fell .
<name> then sent them back to make the same offers to him .
he accepted the proposals , came to egypt , and he and <name> were married .
after trying him for a while , <name> found that , for some reason or other , she did not like him as a husband , and , accordingly she caused him to be strangled .
at length , after various other intrigues and much secret management , <name> succeeded in a second negotiation , and married a <name> , or a pretended <name> , from some country of <name> minor , whose name was <unk> .
she was better pleased with this second husband than she had been with the first , and she began , at last , to feel somewhat settled and established on her throne , and to be prepared , as she thought , to offer effectual resistance to her father in case he should ever attempt to return .
it was in the midst of the scenes , and surrounded by the influences which might be expected to prevail in the families of such a father and such a sister , that <name> spent those years of life in which the character is formed .
during all these revolutions , and exposed to all these exhibitions of <unk> wickedness , and of unnatural cruelty and crime , she was growing up in the <name> palaces a spirited and beautiful , but indulged and neglected child .
in the mean time , <unk> , the father , went on toward rome .
so far as his character and his story were known among the surrounding nations , he was the object of universal <unk> , both on account of his previous career of degrading vice , and now , still more , for this ignoble flight from the difficulties in which his vices and crimes had involved him .
he stopped , on the way , at the island of rhodes .
it happened that cato , the great <name> philosopher and general , was at rhodes at this time .
cato was a man of stern , unbending virtue , and of great influence at that period in public affairs .
ptolemy sent a messenger to inform cato of his arrival , supposing , of course , that the <name> general would hasten , on hearing of the fact , to pay his respects to so great a personage as he , a king of egypt  a ptolemy  though suffering under a temporary reverse of fortune .
cato directed the messenger to reply that , so far as he was aware , he had no particular business with ptolemy .
" say , however , to the king , " he added , " that , if he has any business with me , he may call and see me , if he pleases . "
ptolemy was obliged to suppress his resentment and submit .
he thought it very essential to the success of his plans that he should see cato , and secure , if possible , his interest and co-operation ; and he consequently made preparations for paying , instead of receiving , the visit , intending to go in the greatest <name> state that he could command .
he accordingly appeared at cato 's lodgings on the following day , magnificently dressed , and accompanied by many attendants .
cato , who was dressed in the plainest and most simple manner , and whose apartment was furnished in a style corresponding with the severity of his character , did not even rise when the king entered the room .
he simply pointed with his hand , and bade the visitor take a seat .
ptolemy began to make a statement of his case , with a view to obtaining cato 's influence with the <name> people to induce them to interpose in his behalf .
cato , however , far from evincing any disposition to espouse his visitor 's cause , <unk> him , in the plainest terms , for having abandoned his proper position in his own kingdom , to go and make himself a victim and a prey for the insatiable avarice of the <name> leaders .
" you can do nothing at rome , " he said , " but by the influence of bribes ; and all the resources of egypt <name> not be enough to satisfy the <name> <unk> for money . "
he concluded by recommending him to go back to <name> , and rely for his hopes of <unk> from the difficulties which surrounded him on the exercise of his own energy and resolution there .
ptolemy was greatly abashed at this <unk> , but , on consultation with his attendants and followers , it was decided to be too late now to return .
the whole party accordingly <unk> on board their galleys , and pursued their way to rome .
ptolemy found , on his arrival at the city , that caesar was absent in gaul , while pompey , on the other hand , who had returned victorious from his campaigns against <unk> , was now the great leader of influence and power at the capitol .
this change of circumstances was not , however , particularly unfavorable ; for ptolemy was on friendly terms with pompey , as he had been with caesar .
he had assisted him in his wars with <unk> by sending him a squadron of horse , in pursuance of his policy of cultivating friendly relations with the <name> people by every means in his power .
besides , pompey had received a part of the money which ptolemy had paid to caesar as the price of the <name> alliance , and was to receive his share of the rest in case ptolemy should ever be restored .
pompey was accordingly interested in <unk> the <name> fugitive 's cause .
he received him in his palace , entertained him in magnificent style , and took immediate measures for bringing his cause before the <name> senate , urging upon that body the adoption of immediate and vigorous measures for effecting his restoration , as an ally whom they were bound to protect against his rebellious subjects .
there was at first some opposition in the <name> senate against <unk> the cause of such a man , but it was soon put down , being overpowered in part by pompey 's authority , and in part silenced by ptolemy 's promises and bribes .
the senate determined to restore the king to his throne , and began to make arrangements for carrying the measure into effect .
the <name> provinces nearest to egypt were <unk> and syria , countries situated on the eastern and northeastern coast of the mediterranean sea , north of judea .
the forces stationed in these provinces would be , of course , the most convenient for furnishing the necessary troops for the expedition .
the province of <unk> was under the command of the consul <unk> .
<unk> was at this time at rome ; he had repaired to the capital for some temporary purpose , leaving his province and the troops stationed there under the command , for the time , of a sort of lieutenant general named <unk> .
it was concluded that this <unk> , with his syrian forces , should undertake the task of <unk> ptolemy on his throne .
while these plans and arrangements were yet immature , a circumstance occurred which threatened , for a time , wholly to defeat them .
it seems that when <name> 's father first left egypt , he had caused a report to be circulated there that he had been killed in the revolt .
the object of this stratagem was to cover and conceal his flight .
the government of <name> soon discovered the truth , and learned that the fugitive had gone in the direction of rome .
they immediately inferred that he was going to appeal to the <name> people for aid , and they determined that , if that were the case , the <name> people , before deciding in his favor , should have the opportunity to hear their side of the story as well as his .
they accordingly made preparations at once for sending a very imposing embassage to rome .
the deputation consisted of more than a hundred persons .
the object of <name> 's government in sending so large a number was not only to evince their respect for the <name> people , and their sense of the magnitude of the question at issue , but also to guard against any efforts that ptolemy might make to intercept the embassage on the way , or to buy off the members of it by bribes .
the number , however large as it was , proved insufficient to accomplish this purpose .
the whole <name> world was at this time in such a condition of disorder and violence , in the hands of the desperate and reckless military leaders who then bore sway , that there were everywhere abundant facilities for the commission of any conceivable crime .
ptolemy contrived , with the assistance of the fierce partisans who had espoused his cause , and who were deeply interested in his success on account of the rewards which were promised them , to <unk> and destroy a large proportion of this company before they reached rome .
some were assassinated ; some were poisoned ; some were tampered with and bought off by bribes .
a small remnant reached rome ; but they were so <unk> by the dangers which surrounded them , that they did not dare to take any public action in respect to the business which had been committed to their charge .
ptolemy began to congratulate himself on having completely <unk> his daughter in her efforts to protect herself against his designs .
instead of that , however , it soon proved that the effect of this atrocious treachery was exactly the contrary of what its <unk> had expected .
the knowledge of the facts became gradually extended among the people of rome and it awakened a universal indignation .
the party who had been originally opposed to ptolemy 's cause seized the opportunity to renew their opposition ; and they gained so much strength from the general <unk> which ptolemy 's crimes had awakened , that pompey found it almost impossible to sustain his cause .
at length the party opposed to ptolemy found , or pretended to find , in certain sacred books , called the <unk> oracles , which were kept in the custody of the priests , and were supposed to contain prophetic <unk> of the <name> of heaven in respect to the conduct of public affairs , the following passage :  " if a king of egypt should apply to you for aid , treat him in a friendly manner , but do not furnish him with troops ; for if you do , you <name> incur great danger .
"  this made new difficulty for ptolemy 's friends .
they attempted , at first , to evade this inspired injunction by denying the reality of it .
there was no such passage to be found , they said .
it was all an invention of their enemies .
this point seems to have been overruled , and then they attempted to give the passage some other than the obvious interpretation .
finally they maintained that , although it prohibited their furnishing ptolemy himself with troops , it did not forbid their sending an armed force into egypt under leaders of their own .
that they could certainly do ; and then , when the rebellion was suppressed , and <name> 's government overthrown , they could invite ptolemy to return to his kingdom and resume his crown in a peaceful manner .
this , they alleged , would not be " furnishing him with troops , " and , of course would not be disobeying the oracle .
these attempts to evade the direction of the oracle on the part of ptolemy 's friends , only made the debates and dissensions between them and his enemies more violent than ever .
pompey made every effort in his power to aid ptolemy 's cause ; but <unk> , after long hesitation and delay , decided that it would not be safe for him to embark in it .
at length , however , <unk> , the lieutenant who commanded in syria , was induced to undertake the enterprise .
on certain promises which he received from ptolemy , to be performed in case he succeeded , and with a certain encouragement , not very legal or regular , which pompey gave him , in respect to the employment of the <name> troops under his command , he resolved to march to egypt .
his route , of course , would lie along the shores of the mediterranean sea , and through the desert , to pelusium , which has already been mentioned as the frontier town on this side of egypt .
from pelusium he was to march through the heart of the <name> to <name> , and , if successful in his invasion , overthrow the government of <name> and <unk> , and then , inviting ptolemy to return , <unk> him on the throne .
in the prosecution of this dangerous enterprise , <unk> relied strongly on the assistance of a very remarkable man , then his second in command , who afterward acted a very important part in the subsequent history of <name> .
his name was <name> <name> .
<name> was born in rome , of a very distinguished family , but his father died when he was very young , and being left subsequently much to himself , he became a very wild and dissolute young man .
he wasted the property which his father had left him in folly and vice ; and then going on desperately in the same career , he soon incurred enormous debts , and involved himself , in consequence , in inextricable difficulties .
his creditors continually harassed him with <unk> for money , and with suits at law to compel payments which he had no means of making .
he was likewise incessantly pursued by the hostility of the many enemies that he had made in the city by his violence and his crimes .
at length he <unk> , and went to greece .
here <unk> , when on his way to syria , met him , and invited him to join his army rather than to remain where he was in idleness and destitution .
<name> , who was as proud and lofty in spirit as he was degraded in morals and condition , refused to do this unless <unk> would give him a command .
<unk> saw in the daring and reckless energy which <name> manifested the indications of the class of qualities which in those days made a successful soldier , and acceded to his terms .
he gave him the command of his cavalry .
<name> distinguished himself in the syrian campaigns that followed , and was now full of eagerness to engage in this egyptian enterprise .
in fact , it was mainly his zeal and enthusiasm to embark in the undertaking which was the means of deciding <unk> to consent to ptolemy 's proposals .
the danger and difficulty which they considered as most to be apprehended in the whole expedition was the getting across the desert to pelusium .
in fact , the great protection of egypt had always been her isolation .
the trackless and desolate sands , being wholly destitute of water , and utterly void , could be traversed , even by a caravan of peaceful travelers , only with great difficulty and danger .
for an army to attempt to cross them , exposed , as the troops would necessarily be , to the assaults of enemies who might advance to meet them on the way , and sure of encountering a terrible opposition from fresh and vigorous bands when they should arrive  <unk> and exhausted by the physical hardships of the way  at the borders of the inhabited country , was a desperate undertaking .
many instances occurred in ancient times in which vast bodies of troops , in attempting marches over the deserts by which egypt was surrounded , were wholly destroyed by famine or thirst , or overwhelmed by storms of sand .
these difficulties and dangers , however , did not at all intimidate <name> <name> .
the anticipation , in fact , of the <name> of <unk> them was one of the main inducements which led him to embark in the enterprise .
the perils of the desert constituted one of the charms which made the expedition so attractive .
he placed himself , therefore , at the head of his troop of cavalry , and set off across the sands in advance of <unk> , to take pelusium , in order thus to open a way for the main body of the army into egypt .
ptolemy accompanied <name> .
<unk> was to follow .
with all his faults , to call them by no severer name , <name> <name> possessed certain great excellences of character .
he was ardent , but then he was cool , collected , and sagacious ; and there was a certain <name> and manly generosity continually evincing itself in his conduct and character which made him a great favorite among his men .
he was at this time about twenty-eight years old , of a tall and manly form , and of an expressive and intellectual cast of countenance .
his forehead was high , his nose <unk> , and his eyes full of vivacity and life .
he was accustomed to dress in a very plain and careless manner , and he assumed an air of the utmost familiarity and freedom in his intercourse with his soldiers .
he would join them in their sports , joke with them , and good-naturedly receive their jokes in return ; and take his meals , standing with them around their rude tables , in the open field .
such habits of intercourse with his men in a commander of ordinary character would have been fatal to his ascendency over them ; but in <name> <unk> case , these <name> and familiar manners seemed only to make the military genius and the intellectual power which he possessed the more conspicuous and the more universally admired .
<name> conducted his troop of horsemen across the desert in a very safe and speedy manner , and arrived before pelusium .
the city was not prepared to resist him .
it surrendered at once , and the whole garrison fell into his hands as prisoners of war .
ptolemy demanded that they should all be immediately killed .
they were rebels , he said , and , as such , ought to be put to death .
<name> , however , as might have been expected from his character , absolutely refused to allow of any such <unk> .
ptolemy , since the power was not yet in his hands , was compelled to submit , and to postpone gratifying the spirit of vengeance which had so long been slumbering in his breast to a future day .
he could the more patiently submit to this necessity , since it appeared that the day of his complete and final triumph over his daughter and all her adherents was now very nigh at hand .
in fact , <name> and her government , when they heard of the arrival of <name> and ptolemy at pelusium , of the fall of that city , and of the approach of <unk> with an overwhelming force of <name> soldiers , were struck with dismay .
<unk> , the husband of <name> , had been , in former years , a personal friend of <name> 's .
<name> considered , in fact , that they were friends still , though required by what the historian calls their duty to fight each other for the possession of the kingdom .
the government of <name> raised an army .
<unk> took command of it , and advanced to meet the enemy .
in the mean time , <unk> arrived with the main body of the <name> troops , and commenced his march , in conjunction with <name> , toward the capital .
as they were obliged to make a circuit to the southward , in order to avoid the <unk> and lagoons which , on the northern coast of egypt , penetrate for some distance into the land , their course led them through the heart of the <name> .
many battles were fought , the romans every where gaining the victory .
the egyptian soldiers were , in fact , discontented and mutinous , perhaps , in part , because they considered the government on the side of which they were compelled to engage as , after all a usurpation .
at length a great final battle was fought , which settled the controversy .
<unk> was slain upon the field , and <name> was taken prisoner ; their government was wholly overthrown , and the way was opened for the march of the <name> armies to <name> .
<name> <name> , when judged by our standards , was certainly , as well as ptolemy , a depraved and vicious man ; but his depravity was of a very different type from that of <name> 's father .
the difference in the men , in one respect , was very clearly evinced by the objects toward which their interest and attention were respectively turned after this great battle .
while the contest had been going on , the king and <name> of egypt , <unk> and <name> , were , of course , in the view both of <name> and ptolemy , the two most conspicuous personages in the army of their enemies ; and while <name> would naturally watch with the greatest interest the fate of his friend , the king , ptolemy , would as naturally follow with the highest concern the <name> of his daughter .
accordingly , when the battle was over , while the mind of ptolemy might , as we should naturally expect , be chiefly occupied by the fact that his daughter was made a captive , <name> 's , we might suppose , would be engrossed by the tidings that his friend had been slain .
the one rejoiced and the other mourned .
<name> sought for the body of his friend on the field of battle , and when it was found , he gave himself wholly to the work of providing for it a most magnificent burial .
he seemed , at the funeral , to lament the death of his ancient comrade with real and unaffected grief .
ptolemy , on the other hand , was overwhelmed with <name> at finding his daughter his captive .
the <unk> hour for the gratification of his revenge had come at last , and the first use which he made of his power when he was put in possession of it at <name> was to order his daughter to be beheaded .

at the time when the unnatural quarrel between <name> 's father and her sister was working its way toward its dreadful termination , as related in the last chapter , she herself was residing at the <name> palace in <name> , a blooming and beautiful girl of about fifteen .
fortunately for her , she was too young to take any active part personally in the contention .
her two brothers were still younger than herself .
they all three remained , therefore , in the <name> palaces , quiet spectators of the revolution , without being either benefited or injured by it .
it is singular that the name of both the boys was ptolemy .
the excitement in the city of <name> was intense and universal when the <name> army entered it to <unk> <name> 's father upon his throne .
a very large portion of the inhabitants were pleased with having the former king restored .
in fact , it appears , by a retrospect of the history of kings that when a legitimate hereditary sovereign or dynasty is deposed and expelled by a rebellious population , no matter how intolerable may have been the tyranny , or how atrocious the crimes by which the <name> of the subject was exhausted , the lapse of a very few years is ordinarily sufficient to produce a very general readiness to acquiesce in a restoration ; and in this particular instance there had been no such superiority in the government of <name> , during the period while her power continued , over that of her father , which she had displaced , as to make this case an exception to the general rule .
the mass of the people , therefore  all those , especially , who had taken no active part in <name> 's government  were ready to welcome ptolemy back to his capital .
those who had taken such a part were all summarily executed by ptolemy 's orders .
there was , of course , a great excitement throughout the city on the arrival of the <name> army .
all the foreign influence and power which had been exercised in egypt thus far , and almost all the officers , whether civil or military , had been greek .
the coming of the romans was the introduction of a new element of interest to add to the endless variety of excitements which animated the capital .
the restoration of ptolemy was celebrated with games , spectacles , and festivities of every kind , and , of course , next to the king himself , the chief center of interest and attraction in all these public rejoicings would be the distinguished foreign generals by whose instrumentality the end had been gained .
<name> <name> was a special object of public regard and admiration at the time .
his eccentric manners , his <name> and honest air , his <name> simplicity of dress and demeanor , made him conspicuous ; and his interposition to save the lives of the captured garrison of pelusium , and the interest which he took in rendering such distinguished funeral honors to the enemy whom his army had slain in battle , impressed the people with the idea of a certain nobleness and magnanimity in his character , which , in spite of his faults , made him an object of general admiration and applause .
the very faults of such a man assume often , in the eyes of the world , the guise and semblance of virtues .
for example , it is related of <name> that , at one time in the course of his life , having a <name> to make a present of some kind to a certain person , in <unk> for a favor which he had received from him , he ordered his treasurer to send a sum of money to his friend  and named for the sum to be sent an amount considerably greater than was really required under the circumstances of the case  acting thus , as he often did , under the influence of a blind and <unk> generosity .
the treasurer , more prudent than his master , wished to reduce the amount , but he did not dare directly to propose a reduction ; so he counted out the money , and laid it in a pile in a place where <name> was to pass , thinking that when <name> saw the amount , he would perceive that it was too great .
<name> , in passing by , asked what money that was .
the treasurer said that it was the sum that he had ordered to be sent as a present to such a person , naming the individual intended .
<name> was quick to perceive the object of the treasurer 's <unk> .
he immediately replied , " ah !
is that all ?
i thought the sum i named would make a better appearance than that ; send him double the amount . "
to determine , under such circumstances as these , to double an extravagance merely for the purpose of <unk> the honest attempt of a faithful servant to diminish it , made , too , in so cautious and delicate a way , is most certainly a fault .
but it is one of those faults for which the world , in all ages , <name> persist in admiring and praising the <unk> .
in a word , <name> became the object of general attention and favor during his continuance at <name> .
whether he particularly attracted <name> 's attention at this time or not does not appear .
she , however , strongly attracted <unk> he admired her blooming beauty , her <unk> and wit , and her various accomplishments .
she was still , however , so young  being but fifteen years of age , while <name> was nearly thirty  that she probably made no very serious impression upon him .
a short time after this , <name> went back to rome , and did not see <name> again for many years .
when the two <name> generals went away from <name> , they left a considerable portion of the army behind them , under ptolemy 's command , to aid him in keeping possession of his throne .
<name> returned to rome .
he had acquired great renown by his march across the desert , and by the successful accomplishment of the invasion of egypt and the restoration of ptolemy .
his funds , too , were <unk> by the vast sums paid to him and to <unk> by ptolemy .
the amount which ptolemy is said to have agreed to pay as the price of his restoration was two thousand talents  equal to ten millions of dollars  a sum which shows on how great a scale the operations of this celebrated campaign were conducted .
ptolemy raised a large portion of the money required for his payments by <unk> the estates belonging to those friends of <unk> government whom he ordered to be slain .
it was said , in fact , that the <name> were very much increased of those that were condemned to die , by ptolemy 's standing in such urgent need of their property to meet his obligations .
<name> , through the results of this campaign , found himself suddenly raised from the position of a disgraced and homeless fugitive to that of one of the most wealthy and renowned , and , consequently , one of the most powerful personages in rome .
the great civil war broke out about this time between caesar and pompey .
<name> espoused the cause of caesar .
in the mean time , while the civil war between caesar and pompey was raging , ptolemy succeeded in maintaining his seat on the throne , by the aid of the <name> soldiers whom <name> and <unk> had left him , for about three years .
when he found himself drawing toward the close of life , the question arose to his mind to whom he should leave his kingdom .
<name> was the oldest child , and she was a <name> of great promise , both in respect to mental endowments and personal charms .
her brothers were considerably younger than she .
the claim of a son , though younger , seemed to be naturally stronger than that of a daughter ; but the commanding talents and rising influence of <name> appeared to make it doubtful whether it would be safe to pass her by .
the father settled the question in the way in which such difficulties were usually surmounted in the ptolemy family .
he ordained that <name> should marry the oldest of her brothers , and that they two should jointly occupy the throne .
adhering also , still , to the idea of the alliance of egypt with rome , which had been the leading principle of the whole policy of his reign , he solemnly committed the execution of his <name> and the guardianship of his children , by a provision of the instrument itself , to the <name> senate .
the senate accepted the appointment , and appointed pompey as the agent , on their part , to perform the duties of the trust .
the attention of pompey was , immediately after that time , too much engrossed by the civil war waged between himself , and caesar , to take any active steps in respect to the duties of his appointment .
it seemed , however , that none were necessary , for all parties in <name> appeared disposed , after the death of the king , to acquiesce in the arrangements which he had made , and to join in carrying them into effect .
<name> was married to her brother  yet , it is true , only a boy .
he was about ten years old .
she was herself about eighteen .
they were both too young to govern ; they could only reign .
the affairs of the kingdom were , accordingly , conducted by two ministers whom their father had designated .
these ministers were pothinus , a <unk> , who was a sort of secretary of state , and achillas , the commander-in-chief of the armies .
thus , though <name> , by these events , became nominally a <name> , her real accession to the throne was not yet accomplished .
there were still many difficulties and dangers to be passed through , before the period arrived when she became really a sovereign .
she did not , herself , make any immediate attempt to hasten this period , but seems to have acquiesced , on the other hand , very quietly , for a time , in the arrangements which her father had made .
pothinus was a <unk> .
he had been , for a long time , an officer of government under ptolemy , the father .
he was a proud , ambitious , and domineering man , determined to rule , and very unscrupulous in respect to the means which he adopted to accomplish his ends .
he had been accustomed to regard <name> as a mere child .
now that she was <name> , he was very unwilling that the real power should pass into her hands .
the jealousy and ill <name> which he felt toward her increased rapidly as he found , in the course of the first two or three years after her father 's death , that she was advancing rapidly in strength of character , and in the influence and ascendency which she was acquiring over all around her .
her beauty , her accomplishments , and a certain indescribable charm which pervaded all her demeanor , combined to give her great personal power .
but , while these things awakened in other minds feelings of interest in <name> and attachment to her , they only increased the jealousy and envy of pothinus .
<name> was becoming his rival .
he endeavored to thwart and circumvent her .
he acted toward her in a haughty and overbearing manner , in order to keep her down to what he considered her proper place as his <name> ; for he was yet the guardian both of <name> and her husband , and the regent of the realm .
<name> had a great deal of what is sometimes called spirit , and her resentment was aroused by this treatment .
pothinus took pains to enlist her young husband , ptolemy , on his side , as the quarrel advanced .
ptolemy was younger , and of a character much less marked and decided than <name> .
pothinus saw that he could maintain control over him much more easily and for a much longer time than over <name> .
he contrived to awaken the young ptolemy 's jealousy of his wife 's rising influence , and to induce him to join in efforts to thwart and counteract it .
these attempts to turn her husband against her only aroused <name> 's resentment the more .
hers was not a spirit to be <unk> .
the palace was filled with the dissensions of the rivals .
pothinus and ptolemy began to take measures for securing the army on their side .
an open rupture finally ensued , and <name> was expelled from the kingdom .
she went to syria .
syria was the nearest place of refuge , and then , besides , it was the country from which the aid had been furnished by which her father had been restored to the throne when he had been expelled , in a similar manner , many years before .
her father , it is true , had gone first to rome ; but the <unk> which he had <unk> for had been sent from syria .
<name> hoped to obtain the same assistance by going directly there .
nor was she disappointed .
she obtained an army , and commenced her march toward egypt , following the same track which <name> and <unk> had pursued in coming to <unk> her father .
pothinus raised an army and went forth to meet her .
he took achillas as the commander of the troops , and the young ptolemy as the nominal sovereign ; while he , as the young king 's guardian and prime minister , exercised the real power .
the troops of pothinus advanced to pelusium .
here they met the forces of <name> coming from the east .
the armies encamped not very far from each other , and both sides began to prepare for battle .
the battle , however , was not fought .
it was prevented by the occurrence of certain great and unforeseen events which at this crisis suddenly burst upon the scene of egyptian history , and turned the whole current of affairs into new and unexpected channels .
the breaking out of the civil war between the great <name> generals caesar and pompey , and their respective partisans , has already been mentioned as having occurred soon after the death of <name> 's father , and as having prevented pompey from undertaking the office of <unk> of the <name> .
this war had been raging ever since that time with terrible fury .
its distant thundering had been heard even in egypt , but it was too remote to awaken there any special alarm .
the immense armies of these two mighty conquerors had moved slowly  like two ferocious birds of prey , flying through the air , and fighting as they fly  across italy into greece , and from greece , through macedon , into thessaly , contending in dreadful struggles with each other as they advanced , and trampling down and destroying every thing in their way .
at length a great final battle had been fought at <unk> .
pompey had been totally defeated .
he had fled to the sea-shore , and there , with a few ships and a small number of followers , he had pushed out upon the mediterranean , not knowing whither to fly , and overwhelmed with wretchedness and despair .
caesar followed him in eager pursuit .
he had a small fleet of galleys with him , on board of which he had embarked two or three thousand men .
this was a force suitable , perhaps , for the pursuit of a fugitive , but wholly insufficient for any other design .
pompey thought of ptolemy .
he remembered the efforts which he himself had made for the cause of ptolemy <unk> , at rome , and the success of those efforts in securing that monarch 's restoration  an event through which alone the young ptolemy had been enabled to attain the crown .
he came , therefore to pelusium , and , <unk> his little fleet off the shore , sent to the land to ask ptolemy to receive and protect him .
pothinus , who was really the commander in ptolemy 's army , made answer to this application that pompey should be received and protected , and that he would send out a boat to bring him to the shore .
pompey felt some misgivings in respect to this proffered hospitality , but he finally concluded to go to the shore in the boat which pothinus sent for him .
as soon as he landed , the egyptians , by pothinus 's orders , stabbed and beheaded him on the sand .
pothinus and his council had decided that this would be the safest course .
if they were to receive pompey , they reasoned , caesar would be made their enemy ; if they refused to receive him , pompey himself would be offended , and they did not know which of the two it would be safe to <unk> ; for they did not know in what way , if both the generals were to be allowed to live , the war would ultimately end .
" but by killing pompey , " they said , " we shall be sure to please caesar and pompey himself <name> lie still .
"  in the mean time , caesar , not knowing to what part of egypt pompey had fled , pressed on directly to <name> .
he exposed himself to great danger in so doing , for the forces under his command were not sufficient to protect him in case of his becoming involved in difficulties with the authorities there .
nor could he , when once arrived on the egyptian coast , easily go away again ; for , at the season of the year in which these events occurred , there was a periodical wind which blew steadily toward that part of the coast , and , while it made it very easy for a fleet of ships to go to <name> , rendered it almost impossible for them to return .
caesar was very little accustomed to shrink from danger in any of his enterprises and plans , though still he was usually prudent and <unk> .
in this instance , however , his ardent interest in the pursuit of pompey overruled all considerations of personal safety .
he arrived at <name> , but he found that pompey was not there .
he anchored his vessels in the port , landed his troops , and established himself in the city .
these two events , the assassination of one of the great <name> generals on the eastern extremity of the coast , and the arrival of the other , at the same moment , at <name> , on the western , burst suddenly upon egypt together , like simultaneous <unk> of thunder .
the tidings struck the whole country with astonishment , and immediately engrossed universal attention .
at the camps both of <name> and ptolemy , at pelusium , all was excitement and wonder .
instead of thinking of a battle , both parties were wholly occupied in speculating on the results which were likely to <unk> , to one side or to the other , under the totally new and unexpected aspect which public affairs had assumed .
of course the thoughts of all were turned toward <name> .
pothinus immediately proceeded to the city , taking with him the young king .
achillas , too , either accompanied them , or followed soon afterward .
they carried with them the head of pompey , which they had cut off on the shore where they had killed him , and also a seal which they took from his finger .
when they arrived at <name> , they sent the head , wrapped up in a cloth , and also the seal , as presents to caesar .
accustomed as they were to the brutal deeds and heartless cruelties of the ptolemies , they supposed that caesar would <unk> at the spectacle of the dissevered and ghastly head of his great rival and enemy .
instead of this , he was shocked and displeased , and ordered the head to be buried with the most solemn and imposing funeral ceremonies .
he , however , accepted and kept the seal .
the device engraved upon it was a lion holding a sword in his paw  a fit emblem of the characters of the men , who , though in many respects magnanimous and just , had filled the whole world with the terror of their quarrels .
the army of ptolemy , while he himself and his immediate counselors went to <name> , was left at pelusium , under the command of other officers , to watch <name> .
<name> herself would have been pleased , also , to repair to <name> and appeal to caesar , if it had been in her power to do so ; but she was beyond the confines of the country , with a powerful army of her enemies ready to intercept her on any attempt to enter or pass through it .
she remained , therefore , at pelusium , uncertain what to do .
in the mean time , caesar soon found himself in a somewhat embarrassing situation at <name> .
he had been accustomed , for many years , to the possession and the exercise of the most absolute and despotic power , wherever he might be ; and now that pompey , his great rival , was dead , he considered himself the monarch and master of the world .
he had not , however , at <name> , any means sufficient to maintain and enforce such pretensions , and yet he was not of a spirit to abate , on that account , in the slightest degree , the advancing of them .
he established himself in the palaces of <name> as if he were himself the king .
he moved , in state , through the streets of the city , at the head of his guards , and displaying the customary emblems of supreme authority used at rome .
he claimed the six thousand talents which ptolemy <unk> had formerly promised him for procuring a treaty of alliance with rome , and he called upon pothinus to pay the balance due .
he said , moreover , that by the <name> of <unk> the <name> people had been made the <unk> ; and that it devolved upon him as the <name> consul , and , consequently , the representative of the <name> people , to assume that trust , and in the discharge of it to settle the dispute between ptolemy and <name> , and he called upon ptolemy to prepare and lay before him a statement of his claims , and the grounds on which he maintained his right to the throne to the exclusion of <name> .
on the other hand , pothinus , who had been as little accustomed to acknowledge a superior as caesar , though his supremacy and domination had been exercised on a somewhat humbler scale , was obstinate and <unk> in resisting all these demands , though the means and methods which he resorted to were of a character corresponding to his weak and ignoble mind .
he <unk> quarrels in the streets between the alexandrian populace and caesar 's soldiers .
he thought that , as the number of troops under caesar 's command in the city , and of vessels in the port , was small , he could tease and worry the romans with impunity , though he had not the courage openly to attack them .
he pretended to be a friend , or , at least , not an enemy , and yet he conducted himself toward them in an overbearing and insolent manner .
he had agreed to make arrangements for supplying them with food , and he did this by procuring damaged provisions of a most wretched quality ; and when the soldiers remonstrated , he said to them , that they who lived at other people's cost had no right to complain of their fare .
he caused wooden and earthen vessels to be used in the palace , and said , in explanation , that he had been compelled to sell all the gold and silver plate of the <name> household to meet the exactions of caesar .
he busied himself , too , about the city , in endeavoring to excite <unk> against caesar 's proposal to hear and decide the question at issue between <name> and ptolemy .
ptolemy was a sovereign , he said , and was not amenable to any foreign power whatever .
thus , without the courage or the energy to attempt any open , manly , and effectual system of hostility , he contented himself with making all the difficulty in his power , by urging an incessant pressure of petty , vexatious , and provoking , but useless annoyances .
caesar 's demands may have been unjust , but they were bold , manly , and undisguised .
the <unk> may have been right in resisting them ; but the mode was so mean and contemptible , that mankind have always taken part with caesar in the sentiments which they have formed as spectators of the contest .
with the very small force which caesar had at his command , and shut up as he was in the midst of a very great and powerful city , in which both the garrison and the population were growing more and more hostile to him every day , he soon found his situation was beginning to be attended with very serious danger .
he could not retire from the scene .
he probably would not have retired if he could have done so .
he remained , therefore , in the city , conducting himself all the time with <name> and <unk> , but yet maintaining , as at first , the same air of confident self-possession and superiority which always characterized his demeanor .
he , however , dispatched a messenger forthwith into syria , the nearest country under the <name> sway , with orders that several legions which were posted there should be embarked and forwarded to <name> with the utmost possible celerity .

in the mean time , while the events related in the last chapter were taking place at <name> , <name> remained anxious and uneasy in her camp , quite uncertain , for a time , what it was best for her to do .
she wished to be at <name> .
she knew very well that caesar 's power in controlling the course of affairs in egypt would necessarily be supreme .
she was , of course , very <name> in her <name> to be able to present her cause before him .
as it was , ptolemy and pothinus were in communication with the <unk> , and , for aught she knew , <unk> cultivating his favor , while she was far away , her cause unheard , her wrongs unknown , and perhaps even her existence forgotten .
of course , under such circumstances , she was very <name> to get to <name> .
but how to accomplish this purpose was a source of great perplexity .
she could not march thither at the head of an army , for the army of the king was strongly intrenched at pelusium , and effectually barred the way .
she could not attempt to pass alone , or with few attendants , through the country , for every town and village was occupied with garrisons and officers under the orders of pothinus , and she would be certainly intercepted .
she had no fleet , and could not , therefore , make the passage by sea .
besides , even if she could by any means reach the gates of <name> , how was she to pass safely through the streets of the city to the palace where caesar resided , since the city , except in caesar 's quarters , was wholly in the hands of pothinus 's government ?
the difficulties in the way of accomplishing her object seemed thus almost insurmountable .
she was , however , resolved to make the attempt .
she sent a message to caesar , asking permission to appear before him and plead her own cause .
caesar replied , urging her by all means to come .
she took a single boat , and with the smallest number of attendants possible , made her way along the coast to <name> .
the man on whom she principally relied in this hazardous expedition was a domestic named <unk> .
she had , however , some other attendants besides .
when the party reached <name> , they waited until night , and then advanced to the foot of the walls of the citadel .
here <unk> rolled the <name> up in a piece of <unk> , and , covering the whole package with a cloth , he tied it with a thong , so as to give it the appearance of a bale of ordinary merchandise , and then throwing the load across his shoulder , he advanced into the city .
<name> was at this time about twenty-one years of age , but she was of a slender and graceful form , and the burden was , consequently , not very heavy .
<unk> came to the gates of the palace where caesar was residing .
the guards at the gates asked him what it was that he was carrying .
he said that it was a present for caesar .
so they allowed him to pass , and the pretended <name> carried his package safely in .
when it was unrolled , and <name> came out to view , caesar was perfectly charmed with the spectacle .
in fact , the various conflicting emotions which she could not but feel under such circumstances as these , imparted a double interest to her beautiful and expressive face , and to her naturally bewitching manners .
she was excited by the adventure through which she had passed , and yet pleased with her narrow escape from its dangers .
the curiosity and interest which she felt on the one hand , in respect to the great personage into whose presence she had been thus strangely ushered , was very strong ; but then , on the other hand , it was <unk> and subdued by that feeling of timidity which , in new and unexpected situations like these , and under a consciousness of being the object of eager observation to the other sex , is inseparable from the nature of woman .
the conversation which caesar held with <name> deepened the impression which her first appearance had made upon him .
her intelligence and animation , the originality of her ideas , and the point and <unk> of her mode of expressing them , made her , independently of her personal charms , an exceedingly entertaining and agreeable companion .
she , in fact , completely won the great conqueror 's heart ; and , through the strong attachment to her which he immediately formed , he became wholly <unk> to act impartially between her and her brother in regard to their respective rights to the crown .
we call ptolemy <unk> brother ; for , though he was also , in fact , her husband , still , as he was only ten or twelve years of age at the time of <name> 's expulsion from <name> , the marriage had been probably regarded , thus far , only as a mere matter of form .
caesar was now about fifty-two .
he had a wife , named calpurnia , to whom he had been married about ten years .
she was living , at this time in an unostentatious and quiet manner at rome .
she was a <name> of an amiable and gentle character , <unk> attached to her husband , patient and forbearing in respect to his faults , and often anxious and unhappy at the thought of the difficulties and dangers in which his ardent and unbounded ambition so often involved him .
caesar immediately began to take a very strong interest in <unk> cause .
he treated her personally with the <unk> attention , and it was impossible for her not to <unk> in some degree the kind feeling with which he regarded her .
it was , in fact , something altogether new to her to have a warm and devoted friend , <unk> her cause , <unk> her protection , and seeking in every way to promote her happiness .
her father had all his life neglected her .
her brother , of years and understanding totally inferior to hers , whom she had been compelled to make her husband , had become her mortal enemy .
it is true that , in depriving her of her inheritance and <unk> her from her native land , he had been only the tool and instrument of more designing men .
this , however , far from improving the point of view from which she regarded him , made him appear not only hateful , but contemptible too .
all the officers of government , also , in the alexandrian court had turned against her , because they had supposed that they could control her brother more easily if she were away .
thus she had always been surrounded by selfish , mercenary , and implacable foes .
now , for the first time , she seemed to have a friend .
a protector had suddenly arisen to support and defend her ,  a man of very alluring person and manners , of a very <name> and generous spirit , and of the very highest station .
he loved her , and she could not refrain from loving him in return .
she committed her cause entirely into his hands , confided to him all her interests , and gave herself up wholly into his power .
nor was the unbounded confidence which she reposed in him <unk> , so far as related to his efforts to restore her to her throne .
the legions which caesar had sent for into syria had not yet arrived , and his situation in <name> was still very defenseless and very precarious .
he did not , however , on this account , abate in the least degree the <unk> and self confidence of the position which he had assumed , but he commenced immediately the work of securing <name> 's restoration .
this quiet assumption of the right and power to <unk> and decide such a question as that of the claim to the throne , in a country where he had accidentally landed and found rival claimants disputing for the succession , while he was still wholly destitute of the means of enforcing the superiority which he so coolly assumed , marks the immense ascendency which the <name> power had attained at this time in the estimation of mankind , and is , besides , specially characteristic of the genius and disposition of caesar .
very soon after <name> had come to him , caesar sent for the young ptolemy , and urged upon him the duty and expediency of restoring <name> .
ptolemy was beginning now to attain an age at which he might be supposed to have some opinion of his own on such a question .
he declared himself utterly opposed to any such design .
in the course of the conversation he learned that <name> had arrived at <name> , and that she was then concealed in caesar 's palace .
this intelligence awakened in his mind the greatest excitement and indignation .
he went away from caesar 's presence in a rage .
he tore the <unk> which he was accustomed to wear in the streets , from his head , threw it down , and trampled it under his feet .
he declared to the people that he was betrayed , and displayed the most violent indications of vexation and chagrin .
the chief subject of his complaint , in the attempts which he made to awaken the popular indignation against caesar and the romans , was the disgraceful impropriety of the position which his sister had assumed in surrendering herself as she had done to caesar .
it is most probable , however , unless his character was very different from that of every other ptolemy in the line , that what really awakened his jealousy and anger was fear of the commanding influence and power to which <name> was likely to attain through the agency of so distinguished a protector , rather than any other consequences of his friendship , or any real considerations of delicacy in respect to his sister 's good name or his own martial honor .
however this may be , ptolemy , together with pothinus and achillas , and all his other friends and adherents , who joined him in the terrible outcry that he made against the <unk> which he had discovered between <name> and caesar , succeeded in producing a very general and violent tumult throughout the city .
the populace were aroused , and began to assemble in great crowds , and full of indignation and anger .
some knew the facts , and acted under something like an understanding of the cause of their anger .
others only knew that the aim of this sudden outbreak was to assault the romans , and were ready , on any pretext , known or unknown , to join in any deeds of violence directed against these foreign intruders .
there were others still , and these , probably , far the larger portion , who knew nothing and understood nothing but that there was to be tumult and a riot in and around the palaces , and were , accordingly , eager to be there .
ptolemy and his officers had no large body of troops in <name> ; for the events which had thus far occurred since caesar 's arrival had succeeded each other so rapidly , that a very short time had yet elapsed , and the main army remained still at pelusium .
the main force , therefore , by which caesar was now attacked , consisted of the population of the city , headed , perhaps , by the few guards which the young king had at his command .
caesar , on his part , had but a small portion of his forces at the palace where he was attacked .
the rest were scattered about the city .
he , however , seems to have felt no alarm .
he did not even confine himself to acting on the defensive .
he sent out a detachment of his soldiers with orders to seize ptolemy and bring him in a prisoner .
soldiers trained , disciplined , and armed as the <name> veterans were , and nerved by the ardor and enthusiasm which seemed always to animate troops which were under caesar 's personal command , could accomplish almost any undertaking against a mere populace , however numerous or however furiously excited they might be .
the soldiers sallied out , seized ptolemy , and brought him in .
the populace were at first astounded at the daring presumption of this deed , and then exasperated at the indignity of it , considered as a violation of the person of their sovereign .
the tumult would have greatly increased , had it not been that caesar ,  who had now attained all his ends in thus having brought <name> and ptolemy both within his power ,  thought it most expedient to allay it .
he accordingly ascended to the window of a tower , or of some other elevated portion of his palace , so high that missiles from the mob below could not reach him , and began to make signals expressive of his wish to address them .
when silence was obtained , he made them a speech well calculated to quiet the excitement .
he told them that he did not pretend to any right to judge between <name> and ptolemy as their superior , but only in the performance of the duty solemnly assigned by ptolemy <unk> , the father , to the <name> people , whose representative he was .
other than this he claimed no jurisdiction in the case ; and his only wish , in the discharge of the duty which devolved upon him to consider the cause , was to settle the question in a manner just and <unk> to all the parties concerned , and thus arrest the progress of the civil war , which , if not arrested , threatened to involve the country in the most terrible calamities .
he counseled them , therefore , to disperse , and no longer disturb the peace of the city .
he would immediately take measures for trying the question between <name> and ptolemy , and he did not doubt , but that they would all be satisfied with his decision .
this speech , made , as it was , in the eloquent and persuasive , and yet dignified and imposing manner for which caesar 's <unk> to turbulent assemblies like these were so famed , produced a great effect .
some were convinced , others were silenced ; and those whose resentment and anger were not appeased , found themselves deprived of their power by the <unk> of the rest .
the mob was dispersed , and ptolemy remained with <name> in caesar 's custody .
the next day , caesar , according to his promise , convened an assembly of the principal people of <name> and officers of state , and then brought out ptolemy and <name> , that he might decide their cause .
the original <name> which ptolemy <unk> had executed had been deposited in the public archives of <name> , and carefully preserved there .
an authentic copy of it had been sent to rome .
caesar caused the original <name> to be brought out and read to the assembly .
the provisions of it were perfectly explicit and clear .
it required that <name> and ptolemy should be married , and then settled the sovereign power upon them jointly , as king and <name> .
it recognized the <name> commonwealth as the ally of egypt , and constituted the <name> government the <unk> of the <name> , and the guardian of the king and <name> .
in fact , so clear and explicit was this document , that the simple reading of it seemed to be of itself a decision of the question .
when , therefore , caesar announced that , in his judgment , <name> was entitled to share the supreme power with ptolemy , and that it was his duty , as the representative of the <name> power and the <unk> of the <name> , to protect both the king and the <name> in their respective rights , there seemed to be nothing that could be said against his decision .
besides <name> and ptolemy , there were two other children of ptolemy <unk> in the <name> family at this time .
one was a girl , named arsinoÃ« .
the other , a boy , was , singularly enough , named , like his brother , ptolemy .
these children were quite young , but caesar thought that it would perhaps gratify the <unk> , and lead them to acquiesce more readily in his decision , if he were to make some <name> provision for them .
he accordingly proposed to assign the island of cyprus as a realm for them .
this was literally a gift , for cyprus was at this time a <name> possession .
the whole assembly seemed satisfied with this decision except pothinus .
he had been so determined and inveterate an enemy to <name> , that , as he was well aware , her restoration must end in his downfall and ruin .
he went away from the assembly moodily determining that he would not submit to the decision , but would immediately adopt efficient measures to prevent its being carried into effect .
caesar made arrangements for a series of festivals and celebrations , to commemorate and confirm the <unk> of a good understanding between the king and the <name> , and the consequent termination of the war .
such celebrations , he judged , would have great influence in removing any remaining animosities from the minds of the people , and restore the dominion of a kind and friendly feeling throughout the city .
the people fell in with these measures , and cordially <unk> to give them effect ; but pothinus and achillas , though they suppressed all outward expressions of discontent , made incessant efforts in secret to organize a party , and to form plans for <unk> the influence of caesar , and making ptolemy again the sole and exclusive sovereign .
pothinus represented to all whom he could induce to listen to him that caesar 's real design was to make <name> <name> alone , and to depose ptolemy , and urged them to combine with him to resist a policy which would end in bringing egypt under the dominion of a woman .
he also formed a plan , in connection with achillas , for ordering the army back from pelusium .
the army consisted of thirty thousand men .
if that army could be brought to <name> and kept under pothinus 's orders , caesar and his three thousand <name> soldiers would be , they thought , wholly at their <name> .
there was , however , one danger to be guarded against in ordering the army to march toward the capital , and that was , that ptolemy , while under caesar 's influence , might open communication with the officers , and so obtain command of its movements , and thwart all the <unk> designs .
to prevent this , it was arranged between pothinus and achillas that the latter should make his escape from <name> , proceed immediately to the camp at pelusium , resume the command of the troops there , and conduct them himself to the capital ; and that in all these operations , and also subsequently on his arrival , he should obey no orders unless they came to him through pothinus himself .
although sentinels and guards were probably stationed at the gates and avenues leading from the city achillas contrived to effect his escape and to join the army .
he placed himself at the head of the forces , and commenced his march toward the capital .
pothinus remained all the time within the city as a spy , pretending to acquiesce in caesar 's decision , and to be on friendly terms with him , but really plotting for his overthrow , and obtaining all the information which his position enabled him to command , in order that he might co-operate with the army and achillas when they should arrive .
all these things were done with the utmost secrecy , and so cunning and adroit were the conspirators in forming and executing their plots , that caesar seems to have had no knowledge of the measures which his enemies were taking , until he suddenly heard that the main body of <unk> army was approaching the city , at least twenty thousand strong .
in the mean time , however , the forces which he had sent for from syria had not arrived , and no alternative was left but to defend the capital and himself as well as he could with the very small force which he had at his disposal .
he determined , however , first , to try the effect of orders sent out in ptolemy 's name to forbid the approach of the army to the city .
two officers were accordingly intrusted with these orders , and sent out to communicate them to achillas .
the names of these officers were <unk> and <unk> .
it shows in a very striking point of view to what an incredible exaltation the authority and consequence of a sovereign king rose in those ancient days , in the minds of men , that achillas , at the moment when these men made their appearance in the camp , bearing evidently some command from ptolemy in the city , considered it more prudent to kill them at once , without hearing their message , rather than to allow the orders to be delivered and then take the responsibility of disobeying them .
if he could succeed in marching to <name> and in taking possession of the city , and then in <unk> caesar and <name> and restoring ptolemy to the exclusive possession of the throne , he knew very well that the king would rejoice in the result , and would overlook all irregularities on his part in the means by which he had accomplished it , short of absolute disobedience of a known command .
whatever might be the commands that these messengers were bringing him , he supposed that they doubtless originated , not in ptolemy 's own free <name> , but that they were dictated by the authority of caesar .
still , they would be commands coming in ptolemy 's name , and the universal experience of officers serving under the military despots of those ancient days showed that , rather than to take the responsibility of directly disobeying a <name> order once received , it was safer to avoid receiving it by murdering the messengers .
achillas therefore directed the officers to be seized and slain .
they were accordingly taken off and <unk> by the soldiers , and then the bodies were borne away .
the soldiers , however , it was found , had not done their work effectually .
there was no interest for them in such a cold-blooded assassination , and perhaps something like a sentiment of compassion restrained their hands .
at any rate , though both the men were desperately wounded , one only died .
the other lived and recovered .
achillas continued to advance toward the city .
caesar , finding that the crisis which was approaching was becoming very serious in its character , took , himself , the whole command within the capital , and began to make the best arrangements possible under the circumstances of the case to defend himself there .
his <name> were altogether too small to defend the whole city against the overwhelming force which was advancing to assail it .
he accordingly intrenched his troops in the palaces and in the citadel , and in such other parts of the city as it seemed practicable to defend .
he barricaded all the streets and avenues leading to these points , and fortified the gates .
nor did he , while thus doing all in his power to employ the insufficient means of defense already in his hands to the best advantage , neglect the proper exertions for obtaining succor from abroad .
he sent off galleys to syria , to cyprus , to rhodes , and to every other point accessible from <name> where <name> troops might be expected to be found , urging the authorities there to forward re-enforcements to him with the utmost possible dispatch .
during all this time <name> and ptolemy remained in the palace with caesar , both ostensibly <unk> with him in his councils and measures for defending the city from achillas .
<name> , of course , was sincere and in <name> in this co-operation ; but ptolemy 's adhesion to the common cause was very little to be relied upon .
although , situated as he was , he was compelled to seem to be on caesar 's side , he must have secretly desired that achillas should succeed and caesar 's plans be overthrown .
pothinus was more active , though not less cautious in his hostility to them .
he opened secret communication with achillas , sending him information , from time to time , of what took place within the walls , and of the arrangements made there for the defense of the city against him , and gave him also directions how to proceed .
he was very wary and sagacious in all these movements , <unk> all the time to be on <unk> side .
he pretended to be very zealously employed in aiding caesar to secure more effectually the various points where attacks were to be expected , and in maturing and completing the arrangements for defense .
but , notwithstanding all his cunning , he was detected in his double dealing , and his career was suddenly brought to a close , before the great final conflict came on .
there was a barber in caesar 's household , who , for some cause or other , began to suspect pothinus ; and , having little else to do , he employed himself in watching the <unk> movements and reporting them to caesar .
caesar directed the barber to continue his observations .
he did so ; his suspicions were soon confirmed , and at length a letter , which pothinus had written to achillas , was intercepted and brought to caesar .
this furnished the necessary proof of what they called his guilt , and caesar ordered him to be beheaded .
this circumstance produced , of course , a great excitement within the palace , for pothinus had been for many years the great ruling minister of state ,  the king , in fact , in all but in name .
his execution alarmed a great many others , who , though in caesar 's power , were secretly wishing that achillas might prevail .
among those most disturbed by these fears was a man named ganymede .
he was the officer who had charge of arsinoÃ« , <name> 's sister .
the arrangement which caesar had proposed for establishing her in conjunction with her brother ptolemy over the island of cyprus had not gone into effect ; for , immediately after the decision of caesar , the attention of all concerned had been wholly engrossed by the tidings of the advance of the army , and by the busy preparations which were required on all hands for the impending contest .
arsinoÃ« , therefore , with her governor ganymede , remained in the palace .
ganymede had joined pothinus in his plots ; and when pothinus was beheaded , he concluded that it would be safest for him to fly .
he accordingly resolved to make his escape from the city , taking arsinoÃ« with him .
it was a very hazardous attempt but he succeeded in accomplishing it .
arsinoÃ« was very willing to go , for she was now beginning to be old enough to feel the impulse of that insatiable and reckless ambition which seemed to form such an essential element in the character of every son and daughter in the whole <unk> line .
she was insignificant and powerless where she was , but at the head of the army she might become immediately a <name> .
it resulted , in the first instance , as she had anticipated .
achillas and his army received her with acclamations .
under ganymede 's influence they decided that , as all the other members of the <name> family were in <unk> , being held captive by a foreign general , who had by chance obtained possession of the capital , and were thus <unk> for exercising the <name> power , the crown devolved upon arsinoÃ« ; and they accordingly proclaimed her <name> .
every thing was now prepared for a desperate and determined contest for the crown between <name> , with caesar for her minister and general , on the one side , and arsinoÃ« , with ganymede and achillas for her chief officers on the other .
the young ptolemy in the mean time , remained caesar 's prisoner , confused with the intricacies in which the quarrel had become involved , and scarcely knowing now what to wish in respect to the issue of the contest .
it was very difficult to foresee whether it would be best for him that <name> or that arsinoÃ« should succeed .

the war which ensued as the result of the intrigues and maneuvers described in the last chapter is known in the history of rome and <name> caesar as the <unk> war .
the events which occurred during the progress of it , and its termination at last in the triumph of caesar and <name> , <name> form the subject of this chapter .
achillas had greatly the advantage over caesar at the outset of the contest , in respect to the strength of the forces under his command .
caesar , in fact , had with him only a detachment of three or four thousand men , a small body of troops which he had hastily put on board a little squadron of <unk> galleys for pursuing pompey across the mediterranean .
when he set sail from the european shores with this inconsiderable fleet , it is probable that he had no expectation even of landing in egypt at all , and much less of being involved in great military undertakings there .
achillas , on the other hand , was at the head of a force of <unk> effective men .
his troops were , it is true , of a somewhat miscellaneous character , but they were all veteran soldiers , inured to the climate of egypt , and skilled in all the modes of warfare which were suited to the character of the country .
some of them were <name> soldiers , men who had come with the army of <name> <name> from syria when ptolemy <unk> , <name> 's father , was <unk> on the throne , and had been left in egypt , in ptolemy 's service , when <name> returned to rome .
some were native egyptians .
there was also in the army of achillas a large number of fugitive slaves ,  refugees who had made their escape from various points along the shores of the mediterranean , at different periods , and had been from time to time incorporated into the egyptian army .
these fugitives were all men of the most determined and desperate character .
achillas had also in his command a force of two thousand horse .
such a body of cavalry made him , of course , perfect master of all the open country outside the city walls .
at the head of these troops achillas gradually advanced to the very gates of <name> , invested the city on every side , and shut caesar closely in .
the danger of the situation in which caesar was placed was extreme ; but he had been so accustomed to succeed in <unk> himself from the most imminent perils , that neither he himself nor his army seem to have experienced any concern in respect to the result .
caesar personally felt a special pride and pleasure in encountering the difficulties and dangers which now beset him , because <name> was with him to witness his demeanor , to admire his energy and courage , and to reward by her love the efforts and sacrifices which he was making in <unk> her cause .
she confided every thing to him , but she watched all the proceedings with the most eager interest , elated with <name> in respect to the result , and proud of the champion who had thus volunteered to defend her .
in a word , her heart was full of gratitude , admiration , and love .
the immediate effect , too , of the emotions which she felt so strongly was greatly to heighten her natural charms .
the native force and energy of her character were softened and subdued .
her voice , which always possessed a certain inexpressible charm , was <unk> with new sweetness through the influence of affection .
her countenance beamed with fresh animation and beauty , and the <unk> and vivacity of her character , which became at later periods of her life boldness and eccentricity , now being softened and restrained within proper limits by the respectful regard with which she looked upon caesar , made her an enchanting companion .
caesar was , in fact , entirely intoxicated with the fascinations which she unconsciously displayed .
under other circumstances than these , a personal attachment so strong , formed by a military commander while engaged in active service , might have been expected to interfere in some degree with the discharge of his duties ; but in this case , since it was for <name> 's sake and her behalf that the operations which caesar had undertaken were to be prosecuted , his love for her only stimulated the spirit and energy with which he engaged in them .
the first measure to be adopted was , as caesar plainly perceived , to concentrate and strengthen his position in the city , so that he might be able to defend himself there against achillas until he should receive re-enforcements from abroad .
for this purpose he selected a certain group of palaces and <unk> which lay together near the head of the long pier of cause way which led to the pharos , and , withdrawing his troops from all other parts of the city , established them there .
the quarter which he thus occupied contained the great city <unk> and public granaries .
caesar brought together all the arms and munitions of war which he could find in other parts of the city , and also all the corn and other provisions which were contained either in the public <unk> or in private warehouses , and stored the whole within his lines .
he then inclosed the whole quarter with strong defenses .
the avenues leading to it were barricaded with walls of stone .
houses in the vicinity , which might have afforded shelter to an enemy , were demolished and the materials used in constructing walls wherever they were needed , or in strengthening the <unk> .
prodigious military engines , made to throw heavy stones , and beams of wood , and other ponderous missiles , were set up within his lines , and openings were made in the walls and other defenses of the citadel , wherever necessary , to facilitate the action of these machines .
there was a strong fortress situated at the head of the pier or mole leading to the island of pharos , which was without caesar 's lines , and still in the hands of the egyptian authorities .
the egyptians thus commanded the entrance to the mole .
the island itself , also , with the fortress at the other end of the pier , was still in the possession of the egyptian authorities , who seemed disposed to hold it for achillas .
the mole was very long , as the island was nearly a mile from the shore .
there was quite a little town upon the island itself , besides the fortress or castle built there to defend the place .
the garrison of this castle was strong , and the inhabitants of the town , too , constituted a somewhat formidable population , as they consisted of fishermen , sailors , <unk> , and such other desperate characters , as usually congregate about such a spot .
<name> and caesar , from the windows of their palace within the city , looked out upon this island , with the tall light house rising in the center of it and the castle at its base , and upon the long and narrow isthmus connecting it with the main land , and concluded that it was very essential that they should get possession of the post , commanding , as it did , the entrance to the harbor .
in the harbor , which was on the south side of the mole , and , consequently , on the side opposite to that from which achillas was advancing toward the city , there were lying a large number of egyptian vessels , some dismantled , and others manned and armed more or less effectively .
these vessels had not yet come into achillas 's hands , but it would be certain that he would take possession of them as soon as he should gain admittance to those parts of the city which caesar had abandoned .
this it was extremely important to prevent ; for , if achillas held this fleet , especially if he continued to command the island of pharos , he would be perfect master of all the approaches to the city on the side of the sea .
he could then not only receive re-enforcements and supplies himself from that quarter , but he could also effectually cut off the <name> army from all possibility of receiving any .
it became , therefore , as caesar thought , imperiously necessary that he should protect himself from this danger .
this he did by sending out an expedition to burn all the shipping in the harbor , and , at the same time , to take possession of a certain fort upon the island of pharos which commanded the entrance to the port .
this undertaking was abundantly successful .
the troops burned the shipping , took the fort , expelled the egyptian soldiers from it , and put a <name> garrison into it instead , and then returned in safety within caesar 's lines .
<name> witnessed these exploits from her palace windows with feelings of the highest admiration for the energy and valor which her <name> <unk> displayed .
the burning of the egyptian ships in this action , however fortunate for <name> and caesar , was attended with a catastrophe which has ever since been lamented by the whole civilized world .
some of the burning ships were driven by the wind to the shore , where they set fire to the buildings which were contiguous to the water .
the flames spread and produced an extensive conflagration , in the course of which the largest part of the great library was destroyed .
this library was the only general collection of the ancient writings that ever had been made , and the loss of it was never repaired .
the destruction of the egyptian fleet resulted also in the downfall and ruin of achillas .
from the time of arsinoÃ« 's arrival in the camp there had been a constant rivalry and jealousy between himself and ganymede , the <unk> who had accompanied arsinoÃ« in her flight .
two parties had been formed in the army , some declaring for achillas and some for ganymede .
arsinoÃ« advocated ganymede 's interests , and when , at length , the fleet was burned , she charged achillas with having been , by his neglect or incapacity , the cause of the loss .
achillas was tried , condemned , and beheaded .
from that time ganymede assumed the administration of arsinoÃ« 's government as her minister of state and the commander-in-chief of her armies .
about the time that these occurrences took place , the egyptian army advanced into those parts of the city from which caesar had withdrawn , producing those terrible scenes of panic and confusion which always attend a sudden and violent change of military possession within the precincts of a city .
ganymede brought up his troops on every side to the walls of caesar 's <unk> and intrenchments , and hemmed him closely in .
he cut off all avenues of approach to caesar 's lines by land , and commenced vigorous preparations for an assault .
he constructed engines for battering down the walls .
he opened shops and established <unk> in every part of the city for the manufacture of darts , spears , pikes , and all kinds of military machinery .
he built towers supported upon huge wheels , with the design of filling them with armed men when finally ready to make his assault upon caesar 's lines , and moving them up to the walls of the <unk> and palaces , so as to give to his soldiers the advantage of a lofty elevation in making their attacks .
he levied contributions on the <name> citizens for the necessary funds , and provided himself with men by pressing all the artisans , laborers , and men capable of bearing arms into his service .
he sent messengers back into the interior of the country , in every direction , summoning the people to arms , and calling for contributions of money and military stores .
these messengers were instructed to urge upon the people that , unless caesar and his army were at once expelled from <name> , there was imminent danger that the national independence of egypt would be forever destroyed .
the romans , they were to say , had extended their conquests over almost all the rest of the world .
they had sent one army into egypt before , under the command of <name> <name> , under the pretense of restoring ptolemy <unk> to the throne .
now another commander , with another force , had come , offering some other pretexts for interfering in their affairs .
these <name> encroachments , the messengers were to say , would end in the complete subjugation of egypt to a foreign power , unless the people of the country aroused themselves to meet the danger manfully , and to expel the intruders .
as caesar had possession of the island of pharos and of the harbor , ganymede could not cut him off from receiving such re-enforcements of men and arms as he might make arrangements for obtaining beyond the sea ; nor could he curtail his supply of food , as the granaries and magazines within caesar 's quarter of the city contained almost inexhaustible stores of corn .
there was one remaining point essential to the subsistence of an army besieged , and that was an abundant supply of water .
the palaces and <unk> which caesar occupied were supplied with water by means of numerous subterranean <unk> , which conveyed the water from the nile to vast <unk> built under ground , whence it was raised by buckets and <unk> engines for use .
in reflecting upon this circumstance , ganymede conceived the design of secretly digging a canal , so as to turn the waters of the sea by means of it into these <unk> .
this plan he carried into effect .
the consequence was , that the water in the <unk> was gradually changed .
it became first brackish , then more and more salt and bitter , until , at length , it was wholly impossible to use it .
for some time the army within could not understand these changes ; and when , at length , they discovered the cause the soldiers were panic-stricken at the thought , that they were now apparently wholly at the <name> of their enemies , since , without supplies of water , they must all immediately perish .
they considered it hopeless to attempt any longer to hold out , and urged caesar to <unk> the city , embark on board his galleys , and proceed to sea .
instead of doing this , however , caesar , ordering all other operations to be suspended , employed the whole laboring force of his command , under the direction of the captains of the several companies , in digging wells in every part of his quarter of the city .
fresh water , he said , was almost invariably found , at a moderate depth , upon <unk> , even upon ground lying in very close proximity to the sea .
the digging was successful .
fresh water , in great abundance , was found .
thus this danger was passed , and the men 's fears effectually relieved .
a short time after these transactions occurred , there came into the harbor one day , from along the shore west of the city , a small sloop , bringing the intelligence that a squadron of transports had arrived upon the coast to the westward of <name> , and had anchored there , being unable to come up to the city on account of an easterly wind which prevailed at that season of the year .
this squadron was one which had been sent across the mediterranean with arms , ammunition , and military stores for caesar , in answer to <unk> which he had made immediately after he had landed .
the transports being thus <unk> on the coast , and having nearly exhausted their supplies of water , were in distress ; and they accordingly sent forward the sloop , which was probably propelled by oars , to make known their situation to caesar , and to ask for succor .
caesar immediately went , himself , on board of one of his galleys , and ordering the remainder of his little fleet to follow him , he set sail out of the harbor , and then turned to the westward , with a view of proceeding along the coast to the place where the transports were lying .
all this was done secretly .
the land is so low in the vicinity of <name> that boats or galleys are out of sight from it at a very short distance from the shore .
in fact , travelers say that , in coming upon the coast , the illusion produced by the spherical form of the surface of the water and the low and level character of the coast is such that one seems actually to descend from the sea to the land .
caesar might therefore have easily kept his expedition a secret , had it not been that , in order to be provided with a supply of water for the transports immediately on reaching them , he stopped at a solitary part of the coast , at some distance from <name> , and sent a party a little way into the interior in search for water .
this party were discovered by the country people , and were intercepted by a troop of horse and made prisoners .
from these prisoners the egyptians learned that caesar himself was on the coast with a small squadron of galleys .
the tidings spread in all directions .
the people flocked together from every quarter .
they hastily collected all the boats and vessels which could be obtained at the villages in that region and from the various branches of the nile .
in the mean time , caesar had gone on to the anchorage ground of the squadron , and had taken the transports in tow to bring them to the city ; for the galleys , being propelled by oars , were in a measure independent of the wind .
on his return , he found quite a formidable naval armament assembled to dispute the passage .
a severe conflict ensued , but caesar was victorious .
the navy which the egyptians had so suddenly got together was as suddenly destroyed .
some of the vessels were burned , others sunk , and others captured ; and caesar returned in triumph to the port with his transports and stores .
he was welcomed with the acclamations of his soldiers , and , still more warmly , by the <name> and gratitude of <name> , who had been waiting during his absence in great anxiety and suspense to know the result of the expedition , aware as she was that her hero was exposing himself in it to the most imminent personal danger .
the arrival of these re-enforcements greatly improved caesar 's condition , and the circumstance of their coming forced upon the mind of ganymede a sense of the absolute necessity that he should gain possession of the harbor if he intended to keep caesar in check .
he accordingly determined to take immediate measures for forming a naval force .
he sent along the coast , and ordered every ship and galley that could be found in all the ports to be sent immediately to <name> .
he employed as many men as possible in and around the city in building more .
he <unk> some of the most magnificent edifices to procure timber as a material for making benches and oars .
when all was ready , he made a grand attack upon caesar in the port , and a terrible contest ensued for the possession of the harbor , the mole , the island , and the <unk> and fortresses commanding the entrances from the sea .
caesar well knew this contest would be a decisive one in respect to the final result of the war , and he accordingly went forth himself to take an active and personal part in the conflict .
he felt doubtless , too , a strong emotion of pride and pleasure in exhibiting his prowess in the sight of <name> , who could watch the progress of the battle from the palace windows , full of excitement at the dangers which he incurred , and of admiration at the feats of strength and valor which he performed .
during this battle the life of the great conqueror was several times in the most imminent danger .
he wore a habit or mantle of the imperial purple , which made him a conspicuous <name> for his enemies ; and , of course , wherever he went , in that place was the hottest of the fight .
once , in the midst of a scene of most dreadful confusion and din , he leaped from an <unk> boat into the water and swam for his life , holding his cloak between his teeth and drawing it through the water after him , that it might not fall into the hands of his enemies .
he carried , at the same time , as he swam , certain valuable papers which he wished to save , holding them above his head with one hand , while he propelled himself through the water with the other .
the result of this contest was another decisive victory for caesar .
not only were the ships which the egyptians had collected defeated and destroyed , but the mole , with the fortresses at each extremity of it , and the island , with the light house and the town of pharos , all fell into caesar 's hands .
the egyptians now began to be discouraged .
the army and the people , judging , as mankind always do , of the virtue of their military commanders solely by the criterion of success , began to be tired of the rule of ganymede and arsinoÃ« .
they sent secret messengers to caesar <unk> their discontent , and saying that , if he would liberate ptolemy  who , it <name> be recollected , had been all this time held as a sort of prisoner of state in caesar 's palaces  they thought that the people generally would receive him as their sovereign , and that then an arrangement might easily be made for an amicable adjustment of the whole controversy .
caesar was strongly inclined to accede to this proposal .
he accordingly called ptolemy into his presence and , taking him kindly by the hand , informed him of the wishes of the people of egypt , and gave him permission to go .
ptolemy , however , begged not to be sent away .
he professed the strongest attachment to caesar , and the utmost confidence in him , and he very much preferred , he said , to remain under his protection .
caesar replied that , if those were his sentiments , the separation would not be a lasting one .
" if we part as friends , " he said , " we shall soon meet again . "
by these and similar assurances he endeavored to encourage the young <name> , and then sent him away .
ptolemy was received by the egyptians with great <name> , and was immediately placed at the head of the government .
instead , however , of endeavoring to promote a settlement of the quarrel with caesar , he seemed to enter into it now himself , personally , with the utmost ardor , and began at once to make the most extensive preparations both by sea and land for a vigorous prosecution of the war .
what the result of these operations would have been can now not be known , for the general aspect of affairs was , soon after these transactions , totally changed by the occurrence of a new and very important event which suddenly intervened , and which turned the attention of all parties , both egyptians and romans , to the eastern quarter of the kingdom .
the tidings arrived that a large army under the command of a general named <unk> , whom caesar had dispatched into <name> for this purpose , had suddenly appeared at pelusium , had captured that city and were now ready to march to <name> .
the egyptian army immediately broke up its encampments in the neighborhood of <name> , and marched to the eastward to meet these new invaders , caesar followed them with all the forces that he could safely take away from the city .
he left the city in the night , and unobserved , and moved across the country with such celerity that he joined <unk> before the forces of ptolemy had arrived .
after various marches and maneuvers , the armies met , and a great battle was fought .
the egyptians were defeated .
ptolemy 's camp was taken .
as the <name> army burst in upon one side of it , the guards and attendants of ptolemy fled upon the other , clambering over the ramparts in the utmost terror and confusion .
the foremost fell headlong into the ditch below , which was thus soon filled to the brim with the dead and the dying ; while those who came behind pressed on over the bridge thus formed , trampling remorselessly , as they fled , on the bodies of their comrades , who lay writhing , struggling , and shrieking beneath their feet .
those who escaped reached the river .
they crowded together into a boat which lay at the bank and pushed off from the shore .
the boat was <unk> , and it sank as soon as it left the land .
the romans <name> the bodies which floated to the shore upon the bank again , and they found among them one , which , by the <name> <unk> which was upon it , the customary badge and armor of the egyptian kings , they knew to be the body of ptolemy .
the victory which caesar obtained in this battle and the death of ptolemy ended the war .
nothing now remained but for him to place himself at the head of the combined forces and march back to <name> .
the egyptian forces which had been left there made no resistance , and he entered the city in triumph .
he took arsinoÃ« prisoner .
he decreed that <name> should reign as <name> , and that she should marry her youngest brother , the other ptolemy ,  a boy at this time about eleven years of age .
a marriage with one so young was , of course , a mere form .
<name> remained , as before , the companion of caesar .
caesar had , in the mean time , incurred great censure at rome , and throughout the whole <name> world , for having thus turned aside from his own proper duties as the <name> consul , and the commander-in-chief of the armies of the empire , to <unk> himself in the quarrels of a remote and secluded kingdom with which the interests of the <name> commonwealth were so little connected .
his friends and the authorities at rome were continually urging him to return .
they were especially indignant at his protracted neglect of his own proper duties , from knowing that he was held in egypt by a guilty attachment to the <name> ,  thus not only violating his obligations to the state , but likewise inflicting upon his wife calpurnia , and his family at rome , an intolerable wrong .
but caesar was so fascinated by <name> 's charms , and by the mysterious and unaccountable influence which she exercised over him , that he paid no heed to any of these remonstrances .
even after the war was ended he remained some months in egypt to enjoy his favorite 's society .
he would spend whole nights in her company , in feasting and revelry .
he made a splendid <name> progress with her through egypt after the war was over , attended by a numerous train of <name> guards .
he formed a plan for taking her to rome , and marrying her there ; and he took measures for having the laws of the city altered so as to enable him to do so , though he was already married .
all these things produced great discontent and disaffection among caesar 's friends and throughout the <name> army .
the egyptians , too , strongly <unk> the conduct of <name> .
a son was born to her about this time , whom the <unk> named , from his father , <unk> .
<name> was regarded in the new relation of mother , which she now sustained , not with interest and sympathy , but with feelings of reproach and condemnation .
<name> was all this time growing more and more accomplished , and more and more beautiful ; but her vivacity and spirit , which had been so charming while it was simple and childlike , now began to appear more forward and bold .
it is the characteristic of pure and lawful love to soften and subdue the heart , and <unk> a gentle and quiet spirit into all its action ; while that which breaks over the barriers that god and nature have marked out for it , tends to make woman masculine and bold , to <unk> all her <unk> , and to destroy that gentleness and timidity of demeanor which have so great an influence in <unk> her charms .
<name> was beginning to experience these effects .
she was indifferent to the opinions of her subjects , and was only anxious to maintain as long as possible her guilty ascendency over caesar .
caesar , however , finally determined to set out on his return to the capital .
leaving <name> , accordingly , a sufficient force to secure the continuance of her power , he embarked the remainder of his forces in his transports and galleys , and sailed away .
he took the unhappy arsinoÃ« with him , intending to exhibit her as a trophy of his egyptian victories on his arrival at rome .

the war by which caesar <unk> <name> upon the throne was not one of very long duration .
caesar arrived in egypt in pursuit of pompey about the first of <name> ; the war was ended and <name> established in secure possession by the end of <name> ; so that the conflict , violent as it was while it continued , was very brief , the peaceful and commercial pursuits of the <unk> having been interrupted by it only for a few months .
nor did either the war itself , or the <unk> consequent upon it , extend very far into the interior of the country .
the city of <name> itself and the neighboring coasts were the chief scenes of the contest until <unk> arrived at pelusium .
he , it is true , marched across the <name> , and the final battle was fought in the interior of the country .
it was , however , after all , but a very small portion of the egyptian territory that was directly affected by the war .
the great mass of the people , occupying the <name> and fertile tracts which bordered the various branches of the nile , and the long and verdant valley which extended so far into the heart of the continent , knew nothing of the conflict but by vague and distant rumors .
the pursuits of the agricultural population went on , all the time , as steadily and prosperously as ever ; so that when the conflict was ended , and <name> entered upon the quiet and peaceful possession of her power , she found that the resources of her empire were very little impaired .
she availed herself , accordingly , of the revenues which poured in very abundantly upon her , to enter upon a career of the greatest luxury , magnificence , and splendor .
the injuries which had been done to the palaces and other public edifices of <name> the fire , and by the military operations of the siege , were repaired .
the bridges which had been down were rebuilt .
the canals which had been obstructed were opened again .
the sea-water was shut off from the palace <unk> ; the rubbish of demolished houses was removed ; the <unk> were cleared from the streets ; and the injuries which the palaces had suffered either from the violence of military engines or the rough occupation of the <name> soldiery , were repaired .
in a word , the city was speedily restored once more , so far as was possible , to its former order and beauty .
the five hundred , thousand manuscripts of the alexandrian library , which had been burned , could not , indeed , be restored ; but , in all other respects , the city soon resumed in appearance all its former splendor .
even in respect to the library , <name> made an effort to retrieve the loss .
she repaired the ruined buildings , and afterward , in the course of her life , she brought together , it was said , in a manner hereafter to be described , one or two hundred thousand rolls of manuscripts , as the commencement of a new collection .
the new library , however , never acquired the fame and distinction that had pertained to the old .
the former sovereigns of egypt , <name> 's ancestors , had generally , as has already been shown , devoted the immense revenues which they extorted from the <unk> of the valley of the nile to purposes of ambition .
<name> seemed now disposed to expend them in luxury and pleasure .
they , the ptolemies , had employed their resources in erecting vast structures , or founding magnificent institutions at <name> , to add to the <name> of the city , and to widen and extend their own fame .
<name> , on the other hand , as was , perhaps , naturally to be expected of a young , beautiful , and impulsive woman suddenly raised to so conspicuous a position , and to the possession of such unbounded wealth and power , expended her <name> revenues in plans of personal display , and in scenes of festivity , gayety , and enjoyment .
she adorned her palaces , built magnificent barges for pleasure excursions on the nile , and expended enormous sums for dress , for <unk> , and for sumptuous entertainments .
in fact , so lavish were her expenditures for these and similar purposes during the early years of her reign , that she is considered as having carried the extravagance of sensual luxury , and personal display , and splendor , beyond the limits that had ever before or have ever since been attained .
whatever of simplicity of character , and of gentleness and kindness of spirit she might have possessed in her earlier years , of course gradually disappeared under the influences of such a course of life as she now was leading .
she was beautiful and fascinating still , but she began to grow selfish , heartless , and designing .
her little brother ,  he was but eleven years of age , it <name> be recollected , when caesar arranged the marriage between them ,  was an object of jealousy to her .
he was now , of course , too young to take any actual share in the exercise of the <name> power , or to interfere at all in his sister 's plans or pleasures .
but then he was growing older .
in a few years he would be fifteen ,  which was the period of life fixed upon by <unk> arrangements , and , in fact , by the laws and usages of the egyptian kingdom ,  when he was to come into possession of power as king , and as the husband of <name> .
<name> was extremely unwilling that the change in her relations to him and to the government , which this period was to bring , should take place .
accordingly , just before the time arrived , she caused him to be poisoned .
his death released her , as she had intended , from all restraints , and thereafter she continued to reign alone .
during the remainder of her life , so far as the enjoyment of wealth and power , and of all other elements of external prosperity could go , <name> 's career was one of uninterrupted success .
she had no conscientious scruples to interfere with the most full and unrestrained indulgence of every propensity of her heart , and the means of indulgence were before her in the most unlimited profusion .
the only bar to her happiness was the impossibility of satisfying the impulses and passions of the human soul , when they once break over the bounds which the laws both of god and of nature <unk> for restraining them .
in the mean time , while <name> was spending the early years of her reign in all this luxury and splendor , caesar was pursuing his career , as the conqueror of the world , in the most successful manner .
on the death of pompey , he would naturally have succeeded at once to the enjoyment of the supreme power ; but his delay in egypt , and the extent to which it was known that he was entangled with <name> , encouraged and strengthened his enemies in various parts of the world .
in fact , a revolt which broke out in <name> minor , and which it was absolutely necessary that he should proceed at once to quell , was the immediate cause of his leaving egypt at last .
other plans for making head against caesar 's power were formed in spain , in africa , and in italy .
his military skill and energy , however , were so great , and the ascendency which he exercised over the minds of men by his personal presence was so unbounded , and so astonishing , moreover , was the celerity with which he moved from continent to continent , and from kingdom to kingdom , that in a very short period from the time of his leaving egypt , he had conducted most brilliant and successful campaigns in all the three quarters of the world then known , had put down effectually all opposition to his power , and then had returned to rome the acknowledged master of the world .
<name> , who had , of course , watched his career during all this time with great pride and pleasure , concluded , at last , to go to rome and make a visit to him there .
the people of rome were , however , not prepared to receive her very cordially .
it was an age in which vice of every kind was regarded with great indulgence , but the moral instincts of mankind were too strong to be wholly blinded to the true character of so conspicuous an example of wickedness as this .
arsinoÃ« was at rome , too , during this period of caesar 's life .
he had brought her there , it <name> be recollected , on his return from egypt , as a prisoner , and as a trophy of his victory .
his design was , in fact , to reserve her as a captive to <name> his triumph .
a triumph , according to the usages of the ancient romans , was a grand celebration decreed by the senate to great military commanders of the highest rank , when they returned from distant campaigns in which they had made great conquests or gained extraordinary victories .
caesar concentrated all his triumphs into one .
they were celebrated on his return to rome for the last time , after having completed the conquest of the world .
the processions of this triumph occupied four days .
in fact , there were four triumphs , one on each day for the four days .
the wars and conquests which these <unk> were intended to celebrate were those of gaul , of egypt , of <name> , and of africa ; and the processions on the several days consisted of endless trains of prisoners , trophies , arms , banners , pictures , images , <unk> of wagons loaded with plunder , captive princes and princesses , animals wild and tame , and every thing else which the conqueror had been able to bring home with him from his campaigns , to excite the curiosity or the admiration of the people of the city and illustrate the magnitude of his exploits .
of course , the <name> generals , when engaged in distant foreign wars , were ambitious of bringing back as many distinguished captives and as much public plunder as they were able to obtain , in order to add to the variety and splendor of the triumphal procession by which their victories were to be honored on their return .
it was with this view that caesar brought arsinoÃ« from egypt ; and he had retained her as his captive at rome until his conquests were completed and the time for his triumph arrived .
she , of course , formed a part of the triumphal train on the egyptian day .
she walked immediately before the chariot in which caesar rode .
she was in chains , like any other captive , though her chains in honor of her lofty rank , were made of gold .
the effect , however , upon the <name> population of seeing the unhappy <name> , overwhelmed as she was with sorrow and chagrin , as she moved slowly along in the train , among the other emblems and trophies of violence and plunder , proved to be by no means favorable to caesar .
the population were inclined to pity her , and to sympathize with her in her sufferings .
the sight of her distress recalled too , to their minds , the <unk> from duty which caesar had been guilty of in his yielding to the <unk> of <name> , and remaining so long in egypt to the neglect of his proper duties as a <name> minister of state .
in a word , the tide of admiration for caesar 's military exploits which had been setting so strongly in his favor , seemed inclined to turn , and the city was filled with murmurs against him even in the midst of his triumphs .
in fact , the pride and <unk> which led caesar to make his triumphs more splendid and imposing than any former conqueror had ever enjoyed , caused him to <unk> his part so as to produce effects the reverse of his intentions .
the case of arsinoÃ« was one example of this .
instead of impressing the people with a sense of the greatness of his exploits in egypt , in deposing one <name> and bringing her captive to rome , in order that he might place another upon the throne in her stead , it only reproduced anew the <unk> and <unk> which he had deserved by his actions there , but which , had it not been for the pitiable spectacle of arsinoÃ« in the train , might have been forgotten .
there were other examples of a similar character .
there were the feasts , for instance .
from the plunder which caesar had obtained in his various campaigns , he expended the most enormous sums in making feasts and spectacles for the populace at the time of his triumph .
a large portion of the populace was pleased , it is true , with the boundless indulgences thus offered to them ; but the better part of the <name> people were indignant at the waste and extravagance which were every where displayed .
for many days the whole city of rome presented to the view nothing but one wide-spread scene of riot and <unk> .
the people , instead of being pleased with this abundance , said that caesar must have practiced the most extreme and lawless extortion to have obtained the vast amount of money necessary to enable him to supply such unbounded and reckless waste .
there was another way , too , by which caesar turned public opinion strongly against himself , by the very means which he adopted for creating a sentiment in his favor .
the romans , among the other barbarous amusements which were practiced in the city , were specially fond of combats .
these combats were of various kinds .
they were fought sometimes between ferocious beasts of the same or of different species , as dogs against each other , or against bulls , lions , or tigers .
any animals , in fact , were employed for this purpose , that could be teased or goaded into anger and ferocity in a fight .
sometimes men were employed in these combats ,  captive soldiers , that had been taken in war , and brought to rome to fight in the <unk> there as gladiators .
these men were compelled to contend sometimes with wild beasts , and sometimes with one another .
caesar , knowing how highly the <name> assemblies enjoyed such scenes , determined to afford them the indulgence on a most magnificent scale , supposing , of course , that the greater and the more dreadful the fight , the higher would be the pleasure which the spectators would enjoy in witnessing it .
accordingly , in making preparations for the festivities attending his triumph , he caused a large artificial lake to be formed at a convenient place in the vicinity of rome , where it could be surrounded by the populace of the city , and there he made arrangements for a naval battle .
a great number of galleys were introduced into the lake .
they were of the usual size employed in war .
these galleys were manned with numerous soldiers .
<unk> captives were put upon one side , and egyptian upon the other ; and when all was ready , the two squadrons were ordered to approach and fight a real battle for the amusement of the enormous throngs of spectators that were assembled around .
as the nations from which the combatants in this conflict were respectively taken were hostile to each other , and as the men fought , of course , for their lives , the engagement was attended with the usual horrors of a desperate naval encounter .
hundreds were slain .
the dead bodies of the combatants fell from the galleys into the lake and the waters of it were dyed with their blood .
there were land combats , too , on the same grand scale .
in one of them five hundred foot soldiers , twenty elephants , and a troop of thirty horse were engaged on each side .
this combat , therefore , was an action greater , in respect to the number of the combatants , than the famous battle of lexington , which marked the commencement of the american war ; and in respect to the slaughter which took place , it was very probably ten times greater .
the horror of these scenes proved to be too much even for the populace , fierce and merciless as it was , which they were intended to amuse .
caesar , in his eagerness to <unk> all former exhibitions and shows , went beyond the limits within which the seeing of men butchered in bloody combats and dying in agony and despair would serve for a pleasure and a pastime .
the people were shocked ; and <unk> of caesar 's cruelty were added to the other suppressed reproaches and <unk> which every where arose .
<name> , during her visit to rome , lived openly with caesar at his residence , and this excited very general displeasure .
in fact , while the people pitied arsinoÃ« , <name> , notwithstanding her beauty and her thousand personal accomplishments and charms , was an object of general displeasure , so far as public attention , was turned toward her at all .
the public mind was , however , much engrossed by the great political movements made by caesar and the ends toward which he seemed to be aiming .
men accused him of designing to be made a king .
parties were formed for and against him ; and though men did not dare openly to utter their sentiments , their passions became the more violent in proportion to the external force by which they were suppressed .
<name> <name> was at rome at this time .
he warmly espoused caesar 's cause , and encouraged his design of making himself king .
he once , in fact , offered to place a <name> <unk> upon caesar 's head at some public celebration ; but the marks of public disapprobation which the act elicited caused him to desist .
at length , however , the time arrived when caesar determined to cause himself to be proclaimed king .
he took advantage of a certain remarkable <unk> of public affairs , which can not here be particularly described , but which seemed to him specially to favor his designs , and arrangements were made for having him invested with the regal power by the senate .
the murmurs and the discontent of the people at the indications that the time for the realization of their fears was drawing nigh , became more and more audible , and at length a conspiracy was formed to put an end to the danger by destroying the ambitious <unk> 's life .
two stern and determined men , brutus and cassius , were the leaders of this conspiracy .
they matured their plans , organized their band of associates , provided themselves secretly with arms , and when the senate convened , on the day in which the decisive vote was to have been passed , caesar himself presiding , they came up boldly around him in his presidential chair , and murdered him with their daggers .
<name> , from whom the plans of the conspirators had been kept profoundly secret , stood by , looking on stupefied and confounded while the deed was done , but utterly unable to render his friend any protection .
<name> immediately fled from the city and returned to egypt .
arsinoÃ« had gone away before .
caesar , either taking pity on her misfortunes , or impelled , perhaps , by the force of public sentiment , which seemed inclined to take part with her against him , set her at <name> immediately after the ceremonies of his triumph were over .
he would not , however , allow her to return into egypt , for fear , probably , that she might in some way or other be the means of disturbing the government of <name> .
she proceeded , accordingly , into syria , no longer as a captive , but still as an exile from her native land .
we shall hereafter learn what became of her there .
calpurnia mourned the death of her husband with sincere and unaffected grief .
she bore the wrongs which she suffered as a wife with a very patient and <unk> spirit , and loved her husband with the most devoted attachment to the end .
nothing can be more affecting than the proofs of her tender and anxious regard on the night immediately preceding the assassination .
there were certain slight and obscure indications of danger which her watchful devotion to her husband led her to observe , though they eluded the notice of all caesar 's other friends , and they filled her with apprehension and anxiety ; and when at length the bloody body was brought home to her from the senate-house , she was overwhelmed with grief and despair .
she had no children .
she accordingly looked upon <name> <name> as her nearest friend and protector , and in the confusion and terror which prevailed the next day in the city , she hastily packed together the money and other valuables contained in the house , and all her husband's books and papers , and sent them to <name> for safe keeping .

when the tidings of the assassination of caesar were first announced to the people of rome , all ranks and classes of men were struck with amazement and consternation .
no one knew what to say or do .
a very large and influential portion of the community had been caesar 's friends .
it was equally certain that there was a very powerful interest opposed to him .
no one could foresee which of these two parties would now <name> the day , and , of course , for a time , all was uncertainty and indecision .
<name> <name> came forward at once , and assumed the position of <unk> representative and the leader of the party on that side .
a <name> was found among caesar 's effects , and when the <name> was opened it appeared that large sums of money were left to the <name> people , and other large amounts to a nephew of the deceased , named octavius , who <name> be more particularly spoken of hereafter .
<name> was named in the <name> is the <unk> of it .
this and other circumstances seemed to authorize him to come forward as the head and the leader of the caesar party .
brutus and cassius , who remained openly in the city after their desperate deed had been performed , were the acknowledged leaders of the other party ; while the mass of the people were at first so astounded at the magnitude and suddenness of the revolution which the open and public assassination of a <name> emperor by a <name> senate denoted , that they knew not what to say or do .
in fact , the killing of <name> caesar , considering the exalted position which he occupied , the rank and station of the men who perpetrated the deed , and the very extraordinary publicity of the scene in which the act was performed , was , doubtless , the most conspicuous and most appalling case of assassination that has ever occurred .
the whole population of rome seemed for some days to be amazed and stupefied by the tidings .
at length , however , parties began to be more distinctly formed .
the lines of <unk> between them were gradually drawn , and men began to arrange themselves more and more unequivocally on the opposite sides .
for a short time the supremacy of <name> over the caesar party was readily acquiesced in and allowed .
at length , however , and before his arrangements were finally matured , he found that he had two formidable competitors upon his own side .
these were octavius and <unk> .
octavius , who was the nephew of caesar , already alluded to , was a very accomplished and elegant young man , now about nineteen years of age .
he was the son of <name> caesar 's niece .
[ 1 ] [ footnote 1 : this octavius on his subsequent elevation to imperial power , received the name of <name> caesar , and it is by this name that he is generally known in history .
he was , however , called octavius at the commencement of his career , and , to avoid confusion , we shall continue to designate him by this name to the end of our narrative . ]
he had always been a great favorite with his uncle .
every possible attention had been paid to his education , and he had been advanced by caesar , already , to positions of high importance in public life .
caesar , in fact , adopted him as his son , and made him his heir .
at the time of caesar 's death he was at <unk> , a city of <unk> , north of greece .
the troops under his command there offered to march at once with him , if he wished it , to rome , and avenge his uncle 's death .
octavius , after some hesitation , concluded that it would be most prudent for him to proceed thither first himself , alone , as a private person , and demand his rights as his uncle 's heir , according to the provisions of the <name> .
he accordingly did so .
he found , on his arrival , that the <name> , the property , the books and <unk> , and the substantial power of the government , were all in <name> 's hands .
<name> , instead of putting octavius into possession of his property and rights , found various pretexts for evasion and delay .
octavius was too young yet , he said , to assume such weighty responsibilities .
he was himself also too much pressed with the urgency of public affairs to attend to the business of the <name> .
with these and similar excuses as his justification , <name> seemed inclined to pay no regard whatever to octavius 's claims .
octavius , young as he was , possessed a character that was marked with great intelligence , spirit , and resolution .
he soon made many powerful friends in the city of rome and among the <name> senate .
it became a serious question whether he or <name> would gain the greatest ascendency in the party of caesar 's friends .
the contest for this ascendency was , in fact , protracted for two or three years , and led to a vast complication of intrigues , and maneuvers , and civil wars , which can not , however , be here particularly detailed .
the other competitor which <name> had to contend with was a distinguished <name> general named <unk> .
<unk> was an officer of the army , in very high command at the time of caesar 's death .
he was present in the <unk> on the day of the assassination .
he stole secretly away when he saw that the deed was done , and repaired to the camp of the army without the city and immediately assumed the command of the forces .
this gave him great power , and in the course of the contests which subsequently ensued between <name> and octavius , he took an active part , and held in some measure the balance between them .
at length the contest was finally closed by a <unk> of the three rivals .
finding that they could not either of them gain a decided victory over the others , they combined together , and formed the celebrated <unk> , which continued afterward for some time to wield the supreme command in the <name> world .
in forming this league of reconciliation , the three rivals held their conference on an island situated in one of the branches of the po , in the north of italy .
they manifested extreme jealousy and suspicion of each other in coming to this interview .
two bridges were built leading to the island , one from each bank of the stream .
the army of <name> was drawn up upon one side of the river , and that of octavius upon the other .
<unk> went first to the island by one of the bridges .
after examining the ground carefully , to make himself sure that it contained no ambuscade , he made a signal to the other generals , who then came over , each advancing by his own bridge , and accompanied by three hundred guards , who remained upon the bridge to secure a retreat for their masters in case of treachery .
the conference lasted three days , at the expiration of which time the articles were all agreed upon and signed .
this league being formed , the three confederates turned their united force against the party of the conspirators .
of this party brutus and cassius were still at the head .
the scene of the contests between octavius , <name> , and <unk> had been chiefly italy and the other central countries of europe .
brutus and cassius , on the other hand , had gone across the adriatic sea into the east immediately after caesar 's assassination .
they were now in <name> minor , and were employed in concentrating their forces , forming alliances with the various eastern powers , raising troops , bringing over to their side the <name> legions which were stationed in that quarter of the world , seizing magazines , and exacting contributions from all who could be induced to favor their cause .
among other <unk> which they sent , one went to egypt to demand aid from <name> .
<name> , however , was resolved to join the other side in the contest .
it was natural that she should feel grateful to caesar for his efforts and sacrifices in her behalf , and that she should be inclined to favor the cause of his friends .
accordingly , instead of sending troops to aid brutus and cassius , as they had desired her to do , she immediately fitted out an expedition to proceed to the coast of <name> , with a view of rendering all the aid in her power to <name> 's cause .
cassius , on his part , finding that <name> was determined on joining his enemies , immediately resolved on proceeding at once to egypt and taking possession of the country .
he also stationed a military force at <unk> , the southern promontory of greece , to watch for and intercept the fleet of <name> as soon as it should appear on the european shores .
all these plans , however  both those which <name> formed against cassius , and those which cassius formed against her  failed of accomplishment .
<name> 's fleet encountered a terrible storm , which dispersed and destroyed it .
a small remnant was driven upon the coast of africa , but nothing could be saved which could be made available for the purpose intended .
as for cassius 's intended expedition to egypt , it was not carried into effect .
the dangers which began now to threaten him from the direction of italy and rome were so imminent , that , at <unk> urgent request , he gave up the egyptian plan , and the two generals concentrated their forces to meet the armies of the <unk> which were now rapidly advancing to attack them .
they passed for this purpose across the hellespont from <unk> to <unk> , and entered thrace .
after various marches and <unk> , and a long succession of those maneuvers by which two powerful armies , approaching a contest , endeavor each to gain some position of advantage against the other , the various bodies of troops belonging , respectively , to the two powers , came into the vicinity of each other near philippi .
brutus and cassius arrived here first .
there was a plain in the neighborhood of the city , with a rising ground in a certain portion of it .
brutus took possession of this elevation , and intrenched himself there .
cassius posted his forces about three miles distant , near the sea .
there was a line of intrenchments between the two camps , which formed a chain of communication by which the positions of the two commanders were connected .
the armies were thus very advantageously posted .
they had the river <unk> and a marsh on the left of the ground that they occupied , while the plain was before them , and the sea behind .
here they awaited the arrival of their foes .
<name> , who was at this time at <unk> , a city not far distant from philippi , learning that brutus and cassius had taken their positions in anticipation of an attack , advanced immediately and encamped upon the plain .
octavius was detained by sickness at the city of <unk> , not very far distant .
<name> waited for him .
it was ten days before he came .
at length he arrived , though in coming he had to be borne upon a litter , being still too sick to travel in any other way .
<name> approached , and established his camp opposite to that of cassius , near the sea , while octavius took post opposite to brutus .
the four armies then paused , contemplating the probable results of the engagement that was about to ensue .
the forces on the two sides were nearly equal ; but on the republican side , that is , on the part of brutus and cassius , there was great inconvenience and suffering for want of a sufficient supply of provisions and stores .
there was some difference of opinion between brutus and cassius in respect to what it was best for them to do .
brutus was inclined to give the enemy battle .
cassius was reluctant to do so , since , under the circumstances in which they were placed , he considered it unwise to hazard , as they necessarily must do , the whole success of their cause to the chances of a single battle .
a council of war was convened , and the various officers were asked to give their opinions .
in this conference , one of the officers having recommended to postpone the conflict to the next <name> , brutus asked him what advantage he hoped to attain by such delay .
" if i gain nothing else , " replied the officer , " i shall live so much the longer . "
this answer touched cassius 's pride and military sense of honor .
rather than concur in a counsel which was thus , on the part of one of its advocates at least , dictated by what he considered an <unk> love of life , he preferred to retract his opinion .
it was agreed by the council that the army should maintain its ground and give the enemy battle .
the officers then repaired to their respective camps .
brutus was greatly pleased at this decision .
to fight the battle had been his original <name> , and as his counsels had prevailed , he was , of course , gratified with the prospect for the morrow .
he arranged a sumptuous entertainment in his tent , and invited all the officers of his division of the army to sup with him .
the party spent the night in <unk> pleasures , and in mutual congratulations at the prospect of the victory which , as they believed , awaited them on the morrow .
brutus entertained his guests with brilliant conversation all the evening , and inspired them with his own confident anticipations of success in the conflict which was to ensue .
cassius , on the other hand , in his camp by the sea , was silent and <unk> .
he <unk> privately with a few intimate friends .
on rising from the table , he took one of his officers aside , and , pressing his hand , said to him that he felt great misgivings in respect to the result of the contest .
" it is against my judgment , " said he , " that we thus hazard the <name> of rome on the event of one battle , fought under such circumstances as these .
whatever is the result , i wish you to bear me witness hereafter that i was forced into this measure by circumstances that i could not control .
i suppose , however , that i ought to take courage , notwithstanding the reasons that i have for these gloomy forebodings .
let us , therefore , <name> for the best ; and come and sup with me again to-morrow night .
to-morrow is my <unk> . "
the next morning , the <name> mantle  the customary signal displayed in <name> camps on the morning of a day of battle  was seen at the tops of the tents of the two commanding generals , waving there in the air like a banner .
while the troops , in obedience to this signal , were preparing themselves for the conflict , the two generals went to meet each other at a point midway between their two encampments , for a final consultation and agreement in respect to the arrangements of the day .
when this business was concluded , and they were about to separate , in order to proceed each to his own sphere of duty , cassius asked brutus what he intended to do in case the day should go against them .
" we <name> for the best , " said he , " and pray that the gods may <name> us the victory in this most momentous crisis .
but we must remember that it is the greatest and the most momentous of human affairs that are always the most uncertain , and we can not foresee what is to-day to be the result of the battle .
if it goes against us , what do you intend to do ?
do you intend to escape , or to die ? "
" when i was a young man , " said brutus , in reply , " and looked at this subject only as a question of theory , i thought it wrong for a man ever to take his own life .
however great the evils that threatened him , and however desperate his condition , i considered it his duty to live , and to wait patiently for better times .
but now , placed in the position in which i am , i see the subject in a different light .
if we do not gain the battle this day , i shall consider all <name> and possibility of saving our country forever gone , and i shall not leave the field of battle alive . "
cassius , in his despondency , had made the same resolution for himself before , and he was rejoiced to hear brutus utter these sentiments .
he grasped his colleague 's hand with a countenance expressive of the greatest animation and pleasure , and bade him farewell , saying , " we <name> go out boldly to face the enemy .
for we are certain either that we shall conquer them , or that we shall have nothing to fear from their victory over us . "
cassius 's dejection , and the tendency of his mind to take a despairing view of the prospects of the cause in which he was engaged , were owing , in some measure , to certain unfavorable omens which he had observed .
these omens , though really frivolous and wholly unworthy of attention , seem to have had great influence upon him , notwithstanding his general intelligence , and the remarkable strength and energy of his character .
they were as follows : in offering certain sacrifices , he was to wear , according to the usage prescribed on such occasions , a <name> of flowers , and it happened that the officer who brought the <name> , by mistake or accident , presented it wrong side before .
again , in some procession which was formed , and in which a certain image of gold , made in honor of him , was borne , the bearer of it stumbled and fell , and the image was thrown upon the ground .
this was a very dark presage of impending calamity .
then a great number of vultures and other birds of prey were seen for a number of days before the battle , hovering over the <name> army ; and several swarms of bees were found within the precincts of the camp .
so alarming was this last indication , that the officers altered the line of the intrenchments so as to shut out the <unk> spot from the camp .
these and other such things had great influence upon the mind of cassius , in convincing him that some great disaster was impending over him .
nor was brutus himself without warnings of this character , though they seem to have had less power to produce any serious impression upon his mind than in the case of cassius .
the most extraordinary warning which brutus received , according to the story of his ancient historians , was by a supernatural apparition which he saw , some time before , while he was in <name> minor .
he was encamped near the city of sardis at that time .
he was always accustomed to sleep very little , and would often , it was said , when all his officers had retired , and the camp was still , sit alone in his tent , sometimes reading , and sometimes revolving the anxious cares which were always pressing upon his mind .
one night he was thus alone in his tent , with a small lamp burning before him , sitting lost in thought , when he suddenly heard a movement as of some one entering the tent .
he looked up , and saw a strange , unearthly , and monstrous shape , which appeared to have just entered the door and was coming toward him .
the spirit gazed upon him as it advanced , but it did not speak .
brutus , who was not much accustomed to fear , boldly demanded of the apparition who and what it was , and what had brought it there .
" i am your evil spirit , " said the apparition .
" i shall meet you at philippi . "
" then , it seems , " said brutus , " that , at any rate , i shall see you again . "
the spirit made no reply to this , but immediately vanished .
brutus arose , went to the door of his tent , summoned the sentinels , and awakened the soldiers that were sleeping near .
the sentinels had seen nothing ; and , after the most diligent search , no trace of the mysterious visitor could be found .
the next morning brutus related to cassius the occurrence which he had witnessed .
cassius , though very sensitive , it seems , to the influence of omens affecting himself , was quite philosophical in his views in respect to those of other men .
he argued very rationally with brutus to convince him that the vision which he had seen was only a phantom of sleep , taking its form and character from the ideas and images which the situation in which brutus was then placed , and the fatigue and anxiety which he had endured , would naturally impress upon his mind .
but to return to the battle .
brutus fought against octavius ; while cassius , two or three miles distant , encountered <name> , that having been , as <name> be recollected , the disposition of the respective armies and their encampments upon the plain .
brutus was triumphantly successful in his part of the field .
his troops defeated the army of octavius , and got possession of his camp .
the men forced their way into <unk> tent , and pierced the litter in which they supposed that the sick general was lying through and through with their spears .
but the object of their desperate hostility was not there .
he had been borne away by his guards a few minutes before , and no one knew what had become of him .
the result of the battle was , however , unfortunately for those whose adventures we are now more particularly following , very different in cassius 's part of the field .
when brutus , after completing the conquest of his own immediate foes , returned to his elevated camp , he looked toward the camp of cassius , and was surprised to find that the tents had disappeared .
some of the officers around perceived weapons glancing and glittering in the sun in the place where cassius 's tents ought to appear .
brutus now suspected the truth , which was , that cassius had been defeated , and his camp had fallen into the hands of the enemy .
he immediately collected together as large a force as he could command , and marched to the relief of his colleague .
he found him , at last , posted with a small body of guards and attendants upon the top of a small elevation to which he had fled for safety .
cassius saw the troop of horsemen which brutus sent forward coming toward him , and supposed that it was a detachment from <name> 's army advancing to capture him .
he , however , sent a messenger forward to meet them , and ascertain whether they were friends or foes .
the messenger , whose name was <unk> , rode down .
the horsemen recognized <unk> , and , riding up eagerly around him , they dismounted from their horses to congratulate him on his safety , and to press him with inquiries in respect to the result of the battle and the fate of his master .
cassius , seeing all this , but not seeing it very distinctly , supposed that the troop of horsemen were enemies , and that they had surrounded <unk> , and had cut him down or made him prisoner .
he considered it certain , therefore , that all was now finally lost .
accordingly , in execution of a plan which he had previously formed , he called a servant , named <unk> , whom he directed to follow him , and went into a tent which was near .
when brutus and his horsemen came up , they entered the tent .
they found no living person within ; but the dead body of cassius was there , the head being totally dissevered from it .
<unk> was never afterward to be found .
brutus was overwhelmed with grief at the death of his colleague ; he was also oppressed by it with a double burden of responsibility and care , since now the whole conduct of affairs devolved upon him alone .
he found himself surrounded with difficulties which became more and more embarrassing every day .
at length he was compelled to fight a second battle .
the details of the contest itself we can not give , but the result of it was , that , notwithstanding the most unparalleled and desperate exertions made by brutus to keep his men to the work , and to maintain his ground , his troops were borne down and overwhelmed by the irresistible <unk> of his enemies , and his cause was irretrievably and hopelessly ruined .
when brutus found that all was lost , he allowed himself to be conducted off the field by a small body of guards , who , in their retreat , broke through the ranks of the enemy on a side where they saw that they should meet with the least resistance .
they were , however , pursued by a squadron of horse , the horsemen being eager to make brutus a prisoner .
in this emergency , one of brutus 's friends , named <unk> , conceived the design of pretending to be brutus , and , as such , surrendering himself a prisoner .
this plan he carried into effect .
when the troop came up , he called out for quarter , said that he was brutus , and begged them to spare his life , and to take him to <name> .
the men did so , rejoiced at having , as they imagined , secured so invaluable a prize .
in the mean time , the real brutus pressed on to make his escape .
he crossed a <name> which came in his way , and entered into a little <name> , which promised to afford a hiding-place , since it was encumbered with precipitous rocks and shaded with trees .
a few friends and officers accompanied brutus in his flight .
night soon came on , and he lay down in a little recess under a shelving rock , exhausted with fatigue and suffering .
then , raising his eyes to heaven , he <unk> , in lines quoted from a greek poet , the just judgment of god upon the foes who were at that hour <unk> in what he considered the ruin of his country .
he then , in his anguish and despair , enumerated by name the several friends and companions whom he had seen fall that day in battle , mourning the loss of each with bitter grief .
in the mean time , night was coming on , and the party , concealed thus in the wild <name> , were destitute and <unk> .
hungry and thirsty , and spent with fatigue as they were , there seemed to be no prospect for them of either rest or refreshment .
finally they sent one of their number to steal softly back to the rivulet which they had crossed in their retreat , to bring them some water .
the soldier took his helmet to bring the water in for want of any other vessel .
while brutus was drinking the water which they brought , a noise was heard in the opposite direction .
two of the officers were sent to ascertain the cause .
they came back soon , reporting that there was a party of the enemy in that quarter .
they asked where the water was which had been brought .
brutus told them that it had all been drunk , but that he would send immediately for more .
the messenger went accordingly to the <name> again , but he came back very soon , wounded and bleeding , and reported that the enemy was close upon them on that side too , and that he had narrowly escaped with his life .
the apprehensions of brutus 's party were greatly increased by these tidings ; it was evident that all <name> of being able to remain long concealed where they were must fast disappear .
one of the officers , named <unk> , then proposed to make the attempt to find his way out of the snare in which they had become involved .
he would go , he said , as cautiously as possible , avoiding all parties of the enemy , and being favored by the darkness of the night , he hoped to find some way of retreat .
if he succeeded , he would display a torch on a distant elevation which he designated , so that the party in the <name> , on seeing the light , might be assured of his safety .
he would then return and guide them all through the danger , by the way which he should have discovered .
this plan was approved , and <unk> accordingly departed .
in due time the light was seen burning at the place which had been pointed out , and indicating that <unk> had accomplished his undertaking .
brutus and his party were greatly cheered by the new <name> which this result awakened .
they began to watch and listen for their messenger 's return .
they watched and waited long , but he did not come .
on the way back he was intercepted and slain .
when at length all <name> that he would return was finally abandoned , some of the party , in the course of the despairing consultations which the unhappy fugitives held with one another , said that they must not remain any longer where they were , but must make their escape from that spot at all hazards .
" yes , " said brutus , " we must indeed make our escape from our present situation , but we must do it with our hands , and not with our feet . "
he meant by this that the only means now left to them to evade their enemies was <unk> .
when his friends understood that this was his meaning , and that he was resolved to put this design into execution in his own case , they were overwhelmed with sorrow .
brutus took them , one by one , by the hand and bade them farewell .
he thanked them for their fidelity in adhering to his cause to the last , and said that it was a source of great comfort and satisfaction to him that all his friends had proved so faithful and true .
" i do not complain of my hard fate , " he added , " so far as i myself am concerned .
i mourn only for my unhappy country .
as to myself , i think that my condition even now is better than that of my enemies ; for though i die , posterity <name> do me justice , and i shall enjoy forever the honor which virtue and integrity deserve ; while they , though they live , live only to reap the bitter fruits of injustice and of tyranny .
" after i am gone , " he continued , addressing his friends , as before , " think no longer of me , but take care of yourselves .
<name> , i am sure , <name> be satisfied with cassius 's death and mine .
he <name> not be disposed to pursue you <unk> any longer .
make peace with him on the best terms that you can . "
brutus then asked first one and then another of his friends to aid him in the last duty , as he seems to have considered it , of destroying his life ; but one after another declared that they could not do any thing to assist him in carrying into effect so dreadful a determination .
finally , he took with him an old and <unk> friend named <unk> , and went away a little , apart from the rest .
here he <unk> once more the favor which had been refused him before ,  begging that <unk> would hold out his sword .
<unk> still refused .
brutus then called one of his slaves .
upon this <unk> declared that he would do any thing rather than that brutus should die by the hand of a slave .
he took the sword , and .
with his right hand held it extended in the air .
with the left hand he covered his eyes , that he might not witness the horrible spectacle .
brutus , rushed upon the point of the weapon with such fatal force that he fell and immediately expired .
thus ended the great and famous battle of philippi , celebrated in history as marking the termination of the great conflict between the friends and the enemies of caesar , which agitated the world so deeply after the conqueror 's death .
this battle established the ascendency of <name> , and made him for a time the most conspicuous man , as <name> was , the most conspicuous woman , in the world .

<name> had seen <name> , it <name> be recollected , some years before , during his visit to egypt , when she was a young girl .
she was doubtless well acquainted with his character .
it was a character peculiarly fitted , in some respects , to <unk> the imagination of a woman so ardent , and impulsive , and bold as <name> was fast becoming .
<name> had , in fact , made himself an object of universal interest throughout the world , by his wild and eccentric manners and reckless conduct , and by the very extraordinary vicissitudes which had marked his career .
in moral character he was as utterly abandoned and depraved as it was possible to be .
in early life , as has already been stated , he plunged into such a course of dissipation and extravagance that he became utterly and hopelessly ruined ; or , rather , he would have been so , had he not , by the influence of that magic power of fascination which such characters often possess , succeeded in gaining a great ascendency over a young man of immense fortune , named <unk> , who for a time upheld him by becoming <unk> for his debts .
this resource , however , soon failed , and <name> was compelled to abandon rome , and to live for some years as a fugitive and exile , in dissolute wretchedness and want .
during all the subsequent vicissitudes through which he passed in the course of his career , the same habits of lavish expenditure continued , whenever he had funds at his command .
this trait of character took the form sometimes of a <name> generosity .
in his campaigns , the plunder which he acquired he usually divided among his soldiers , reserving nothing for himself .
this made his men enthusiastically devoted to him , and led them to consider his <unk> as a virtue , even when they did not themselves derive any direct advantage from it .
a thousand stories were always in circulation in camp of acts on his part illustrating his reckless disregard of the value of money , some ludicrous , and all eccentric and strange .
in his personal habits , too , he was as different as possible from other men .
he prided himself on being descended from hercules , and he affected a style of dress and a general air and manner in accordance with the savage character of this his pretended ancestor .
his features were sharp , his nose was arched and prominent , and he wore his hair and beard very long  as long , in fact , as he could make them grow .
these peculiarities imparted to his countenance a very wild and ferocious expression .
he adopted a style of dress , too , which , judged of with reference to the prevailing fashions of the time , gave to his whole appearance a rough , savage , and reckless air .
his manner and demeanor corresponded with his dress and appearance .
he lived in habits of the most <unk> familiarity with his soldiers .
he associated freely with them , ate and drank with them in the open air , and joined in their noisy mirth and rude and boisterous hilarity .
his commanding powers of mind , and the desperate recklessness of his courage , enabled him to do all this without danger .
these qualities inspired in the minds of the soldiers a feeling of profound respect for their commander ; and this good opinion he was enabled to retain , notwithstanding such habits of familiarity with his <unk> as would have been fatal to the influence of an ordinary man .
in the most prosperous portion of <name> 's career  for example , during the period immediately preceding the death of caesar  he addicted himself to vicious indulgences of the most open , public , and shameless character .
he had around him a sort of court , formed of <unk> , tumblers , <unk> , <unk> , and other similar characters of the lowest and most disreputable class .
many of these companions were singing and dancing girls , very beautiful , and very highly accomplished in the arts of their respective professions , but all totally corrupt and depraved .
public sentiment , even in that age and nation , strongly condemned this conduct .
the people were pagans , it is true , but it is a mistake to suppose that the formation of a moral sentiment in the community against such vices as these is a work which christianity alone can perform .
there is a law of nature , in the form of an instinct universal in the race , imperiously <unk> that the connection of the sexes shall consist of the union of one man with one woman , and that woman his wife , and very sternly <unk> every other .
so that there has probably never been a community in the world so corrupt , that a man could practice in it such vices as those of <name> , without not only violating his own sense of right and wrong , but also bringing upon himself the general condemnation of those around him .
still , the world is prone to be very tolerant in respect to the vices of the great .
such exalted personages as <name> seem to be judged by a different standard from common men .
even in the countries where those who occupy high stations of trust or of power are actually selected , for the purpose of being placed there , by the voices of their fellow-men , all inquiry into the personal character of a candidate is often suppressed , such inquiry being condemned as wholly irrelevant and improper , and they who succeed in attaining to power enjoy <unk> in their elevation which are denied to common men .
but , notwithstanding the influence of <name> 's rank and power in <unk> him from public censure , he carried his excesses to such an extreme that his conduct was very loudly and very generally condemned .
he would spend all the night in <unk> , and then , the next day , would appear in public , staggering in the streets .
sometimes he would enter the <unk> for the transaction of business when he was so intoxicated that it would be necessary for friends to come to his assistance to conduct him away .
in some of his journeys in the neighborhood of rome , he would take a troop of companions with him of the worst possible character , and travel with them openly and without shame .
there was a certain actress , named <unk> , whom he made his companion on one such occasion .
she was borne upon a litter in his train , and he carried about with him a vast collection of gold and silver plate , and of splendid table furniture , together with an endless supply of luxurious articles of food and of wine , to provide for the entertainments and banquets which he was to celebrate with her on the journey .
he would sometimes stop by the road side , pitch his tents , establish his kitchens , set his cooks at work to prepare a feast , spread his tables , and make a sumptuous banquet of the most costly , complete , and ceremonious character  all to make men wonder at the abundance and perfection of the means of luxury which he could <name> with him wherever he might go .
in fact , he always seemed to feel a special pleasure in doing strange and extraordinary things in order to excite surprise .
once on a journey he had lions harnessed to his carts to draw his baggage , in order to create a sensation .
notwithstanding the <unk> with which <name> abandoned himself to these luxurious pleasures when at rome , no man could endure exposure and hardship better when in camp or on the field .
in fact , he rushed with as much headlong precipitation into difficulty and danger when abroad , as into expense and dissipation when at home .
during his contests with octavius and <unk> , after caesar 's death , he once had occasion to pass the alps , which , with his customary recklessness , he attempted to traverse without any proper supplies of stores or means of transportation .
he was reduced , on the passage , together with the troops under his command , to the most extreme destitution and distress .
they had to feed on roots and herbs , and finally on the bark of trees ; and they barely preserved themselves , by these means , from actual starvation .
<name> seemed , however , to care nothing for all this , but pressed on through the difficulty and danger , manifesting the same daring and determined unconcern to the end .
in the same campaign he found himself at one time reduced to extreme destitution in respect to men .
his troops had been gradually wasted away until his situation had become very desperate .
he conceived , under these circumstances , the most extraordinary idea of going over alone to the camp of <unk> and enticing away his rival 's troops from under the very eyes of their commander .
this bold design was successfully executed .
<name> advanced alone , clothed in wretched garments , and with his matted hair and beard hanging about his breast and shoulders , up to <unk> 's lines .
the men , who knew him well , received him with acclamations ; and pitying the sad condition to which they saw that he was reduced , began to listen to what he had to say .
<unk> , who could not attack him , since he and <name> were not at that time in open hostility to each other , but were only rival commanders in the same army , ordered the trumpeters to sound in order to make a noise which should prevent the words of <name> from being heard .
this interrupted the negotiation ; but the men immediately disguised two of their number in female apparel , and sent them to <name> to make arrangements with him for putting themselves under his command , and offering , at the same time , to murder <unk> , if he would but speak the word .
<name> charged them to do <unk> no injury .
he , however , went over and took possession of the camp , and assumed the command of the army .
he treated <unk> himself , personally , with extreme politeness , and retained him as a subordinate under his command .
not far from the time of caesar 's death , <name> was married .
the name of the <name> was fulvia .
she was a widow at the time of her marriage with <name> , and was a woman of very marked and decided character .
she had led a wild and irregular life previous to that time , but she conceived a very strong attachment to her new husband and devoted herself to him from the time of her marriage with the most constant fidelity .
she soon acquired a very great ascendency over him , and was the means of effecting a very considerable reform in his conduct and character .
she was an ambitious and aspiring woman , and made many very efficient and successful efforts to promote the elevation and aggrandizement of her husband .
she appeared , also , to take a great pride and pleasure in exercising over him , herself , a great personal control .
she succeeded in these attempts in a manner that surprised every body .
it seemed astonishing to all mankind that such a tiger as he had been could be subdued by any human power .
nor was it by gentleness and <unk> that fulvia gained such power over her husband .
she was of a very stern and masculine character , and she seems to have mastered <name> by surpassing him in the use of his own weapons .
in fact , instead of attempting to soothe and <unk> him , she reduced him , it seems , to the necessity of resorting to various contrivances to soften and propitiate her .
once , for example , on his return from a campaign in which he had been exposed to great dangers , he disguised himself and came home at night in the garb of a courier bearing dispatches .
he caused himself to be ushered , muffled and disguised as he was , into fulvia 's apartments , where he handed her some pretended letters , which , he said , were from her husband ; and while fulvia was opening them in great excitement and trepidation , he threw off his disguise , and revealed himself to her by clasping her in his arms and kissing her in the midst of her amazement .
<name> 's marriage with fulvia , besides being the means of reforming his morals in some degree , softened and civilized him in respect to his manners .
his dress and appearance now assumed a different character .
in fact , his political elevation after caesar 's death soon became very exalted , and the various democratic arts by which he had sought to raise himself to it , being now no longer necessary , were , as usual in such cases , gradually discarded .
he lived in great style and splendor when at rome , and when absent from home , on his military campaigns , he began to exhibit the same pomp and parade in his equipage and in his arrangements as were usual in the camps of other <name> generals .
after the battle of philippi , described in the last chapter , <name>  who , with all his faults , was sometimes a very generous foe  as soon as the tidings of brutus 's death were brought to him , repaired immediately to the spot , and appeared to be quite shocked and concerned at the sight of the body .
he took off his own military cloak or mantle  which was a very magnificent and costly garment , being enriched with many expensive ornaments  and spread it over the corpse .
he then gave directions to one of the officers of his household to make arrangements for funeral ceremonies of a very imposing character , as a testimony of his respect for the memory of the deceased .
in these ceremonies it was the duty of the officer to have burned the military cloak which <name> had appropriated to the purpose of a pall , with the body .
he did not , however , do so .
the cloak being very valuable , he reserved it ; and he withheld , also , a considerable part of the money which had been given him for the expenses of the funeral .
he supposed that <name> would probably not inquire very closely into the details of the arrangements made for the funeral of his most inveterate enemy .
<name> , however , did inquire into them , and when he learned what the officer had done , he ordered him to be killed .
the various political changes which occurred , and the movements which took place among the several armies after the battle of philippi , can not be here detailed .
it is sufficient to say that <name> proceeded to the eastward through <name> minor , and in the course of the following year came into <unk> .
from this place he sent a messenger to egypt to <name> , summoning her to appear before him .
there were charges , he said , against her of having aided cassius and brutus in the late war instead of rendering assistance to him .
whether there really were any such charges , or whether they were only <unk> by <name> as pretexts for seeing <name> , the fame of whose beauty was very widely extended , does not certainly appear .
however this may be , he sent to summon the <name> to come to him .
the name of the messenger whom <name> dispatched on this errand was <unk> .
fulvia , <name> 's wife , was not with him at this time .
she had been left behind at rome .
<unk> proceeded to egypt and appeared at <name> 's court .
the <name> was at this time about twenty-eight , but more beautiful , as was said , than ever before .
<unk> was very much struck with her beauty and with a certain fascination in her voice and conversation , of which her ancient biographers often speak as one of the most irresistible of her charms .
he told her that she need have no fear of <name> .
it was of no consequence , he said , what charges there might be against her .
she would find that , in a very few days after she had entered into <unk> presence , she would be in great favor .
she might rely , in fact , he said , on gaining , very speedily , an unbounded ascendency over the general .
he advised her , therefore , to proceed to <unk> without fear ; and to present herself before <name> in as much pomp and magnificence as she could command .
he would answer , he said , for the result .
<name> determined to follow this advice .
in fact , her ardent and impulsive imagination was fired with the idea of making , a second time , the conquest of the greatest general and highest potentate in the world .
she began immediately to make provision for the voyage .
she employed all the resources of her kingdom in procuring for herself the most magnificent means of display , such as expensive and splendid dresses , <name> services of plate , ornaments of precious stones and of gold , and presents in great variety and of the most costly description for <name> .
she appointed , also , a numerous retinue of attendants to accompany her , and , in a word , made all the arrangements complete for an expedition of the most imposing and magnificent character .
while these preparations were going forward , she received new and frequent communications from <name> , urging her to hasten her departure ; but she paid very little attention to them .
it was evident that she felt quite independent , and was intending to take her own time .
at length , however , all was ready , and <name> set sail .
she crossed the mediterranean sea , and entered the mouth of the river <unk> .
<name> was at tarsus , a city upon the <unk> , a small distance above its mouth .
when <name> 's fleet had entered the river , she embarked on board a most magnificent barge which she had constructed for the occasion , and had brought with her across the sea .
this barge was the most magnificent and <unk> vessel that had ever been built .
it was adorned with carvings and decorations of the finest workmanship , and elaborately gilded .
the sails were of purple , and the oars were inlaid and tipped with silver .
upon the deck of this barge <name> <name> appeared , under a canopy of cloth of gold .
she was dressed very magnificently in the costume in which <name> , the goddess of beauty , was then generally represented .
she was surrounded by a company of beautiful boys , who attended upon her in the form of <unk> , and fanned her with their wings , and by a group of young girls representing the <unk> and the graces .
there was a band of musicians stationed upon the deck .
this music guided the oarsmen , as they kept time to it in their rowing ; and , soft as the <name> was , the strains were heard far and wide over the water and along the shores , as the beautiful vessel advanced on its way .
the performers were provided with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and all the other instruments customarily used in those times to produce music of a gentle and voluptuous kind .
[ illustration : meeting of <name> and <name> . ]
in fact , the whole spectacle seemed like a vision of enchantment .
tidings of the approach of the barge spread rapidly around , and the people of the country came down in crowds to the shores of the river to gaze upon it in admiration as it glided slowly along .
at the time of its arrival at tarsus , <name> was engaged in giving a public audience at some tribunal in his palace , but everybody ran to see <name> and the barge , and the great <unk> was left consequently alone , or , at least , with only a few official attendants near him .
<name> , on arriving at the city , landed , and began to pitch her tents on the shores .
<name> sent a messenger to bid her welcome , and to invite her to come and sup with him .
she declined the invitation , saying that it was more proper that he should come and sup with her .
she would accordingly expect him to come , she said , and her tents would be ready at the proper hour .
<name> complied with her proposal , and came to her entertainment .
he was received with a magnificence and splendor which amazed him .
the tents and pavilions where the entertainment was made were illuminated with an immense number of lamps .
these lamps were arranged in a very ingenious and beautiful manner , so as to produce an illumination of the most surprising brilliancy and beauty .
the immense number and variety , too , of the meats and wines , and of the vessels of gold and silver , with which the tables were loaded , and the magnificence and splendor of the dresses worn by <name> and her attendants , combined to render the whole scene one of bewildering enchantment .
the next day , <name> invited <name> to come and return his visit ; but , though he made every possible effort to provide a banquet as sumptuous and as sumptuously served as hers , he failed entirely in this attempt , and acknowledged himself completely outdone .
<name> was , moreover , at these interviews , perfectly fascinated with <unk> charms .
her beauty , her wit , her thousand accomplishments , and , above all , the tact , and adroitness , and self-possession which she displayed in assuming at once so boldly , and carrying out so adroitly , the idea of her social superiority over him , that he yielded his heart almost immediately to her undisputed sway .
the first use which <name> made of her power was to ask <name> , for her sake , to order her sister arsinoÃ« to be slain .
arsinoÃ« had gone , it <name> be recollected , to rome , to <name> caesar 's triumph there , and had afterward retired to <name> , where she was now living an exile .
<name> , either from a sentiment of past revenge , or else from some apprehensions of future danger , now desired that her sister should die .
<name> readily acceded to her request .
he sent an officer in search of the unhappy <name> .
the officer slew her where he found her , within the precincts of a <name> to which she had fled , supposing it a sanctuary which no degree of hostility , however extreme , would have dared to violate .
<name> remained at tarsus for some time , revolving in an incessant round of gayety and pleasure , and living in habits of unrestrained intimacy with <name> .
she was accustomed to spend whole days and nights with him in feasting and revelry .
the immense magnificence of these entertainments , especially on <name> 's part , were the wonder of the world .
she seems to have taken special pleasure in exciting <unk> surprise by the display of her wealth and the boundless extravagance in which she indulged .
at one of her banquets , <name> was expressing his astonishment at the vast number of gold cups , enriched with jewels , that were displayed on all sides .
" oh , " said she , " they are nothing ; if you like them , you shall have them all . "
so saying , she ordered her servants to <name> them to <name> 's house .
the next day she invited <name> again , with a large number of the chief officers of his army and court .
the table was spread with a new service of gold and silver vessels , more extensive and splendid than that of the preceding day ; and at the close of the supper , when the company was about to depart , <name> distributed all these treasures among the guests that had been present at the entertainment .
at another of these feasts , she carried her ostentation and display to the astonishing extreme of taking off from one of her <unk> a <name> of immense value and dissolving it in a cup of vinegar , [ 1 ] which she afterward made into a drink , such as was customarily used in those days , and then drank it .
she was proceeding to do the same with the other <name> , when some of the company arrested the proceeding , and took the remaining <name> away .
[ footnote 1 : pearls , being of the nature of shell in their composition and structure , are soluble in certain acids . ]
in the mean time , while <name> was thus wasting his time in luxury and pleasure with <name> , his public duties were neglected , and every thing was getting into confusion .
fulvia remained in italy .
her position and her character gave her a commanding political influence , and she exerted herself in a very energetic manner to sustain , in that quarter of the world , the interests of her husband 's cause .
she was surrounded with difficulties and dangers , the details of which can not , however , be here particularly described .
she wrote continually to <name> , urgently entreating him to come to rome , and displaying in her letters all those marks of agitation and distress which a wife would naturally feel under the circumstances in which she was placed .
the thought that her husband had been so completely drawn away from her by the guilty arts of such a woman , and led by her to abandon his wife and his family , and leave in neglect and confusion concerns of such momentous magnitude as those which demanded his attention at home , produced an excitement in her mind bordering upon <unk> .
<name> was at length so far influenced by the urgency of the case that he determined to return .
he broke up his quarters at tarsus and moved south toward tyre , which was a great naval port and station in those days .
<name> went with him .
they were to separate at tyre .
she was to embark there for egypt , and he for rome .
at least that was <name> 's plan , but it was not <name> 's .
she had determined that <name> should go with her to <name> .
as might have been expected , when the time came for the decision , the woman gained the day .
her <unk> , her arts , her caresses , her tears , prevailed .
after a brief struggle between the sentiment of love on the one hand and those of ambition and of duty combined on the other , <name> gave up the contest .
abandoning every thing else , he surrendered himself wholly to <name> 's control , and went with her to <name> .
he spent the <name> there , giving himself up with her to every species of sensual indulgence that the most remorseless license could tolerate , and the most unbounded wealth procure .
there seemed , in fact , to be no bounds to the extravagance and infatuation which <name> displayed during the <name> in <name> .
<name> devoted herself to him incessantly , day and night , filling up every moment of time with some new form of pleasure , in order that he might have no time to think of his absent wife , or to listen to the reproaches of his conscience .
<name> , on his part , surrendered himself a willing victim to these wiles , and entered with all his heart into the thousand plans of gayety and <unk> which <name> devised .
they had each a separate establishment in the city , which was maintained at an enormous cost , and they made a arrangement by which each was the guest of the other on alternate days .
these visits were spent in games , sports , spectacles , feasting , drinking , and in every species of riot , irregularity , and excess .
a curious instance is afforded of the accidental manner in which intelligence in respect to the scenes and incidents of private life in those ancient days is sometimes obtained , in a circumstance which occurred at this time at <name> 's court .
it seems that there was a young medical student at <name> that <name> , named philotas , who happened , in some way or other , to have formed an acquaintance with one of <name> 's domestics , a cook .
under the guidance of this cook , philotas went one day into the palace to see what was to be seen .
the cook took his friend into the kitchens , where , to philotas 's great surprise , he saw , among an infinite number and variety of other preparations , eight wild boars roasting before the fires , some being more and some less advanced in the process .
philotas asked what great company was to dine there that day .
the cook smiled at this question , and replied that there was to be no company at all , other than <name> 's ordinary party .
" but , " said the cook , in explanation , " we are obliged always to prepare several suppers , and to have them ready in succession at different hours , for no one can tell at what time they <name> order the entertainment to be served .
sometimes , when the supper has been actually carried in , <name> and <name> <name> get engaged in some new turn of their diversions , and conclude not to sit down just then to the table , and so we have to take the supper away , and presently bring in another . "
<name> had a son with him at <name> at this time , the child of his wife fulvia .
the name of the son , as well as that of the father , was <name> .
he was old enough to feel some sense of shame at his father's <unk> from duty , and to manifest some respectful regard for the rights and the honor of his mother .
instead of this , however , he imitated his father 's example , and , in his own way , was as reckless and extravagant as he .
the same philotas who is above referred to was , after a time , appointed to some office or other in the young <unk> household , so that he was accustomed to sit at his table and share in his <unk> enjoyments .
he relates that once , while they were feasting together , there was a guest present , a physician , who was a very vain and conceited man , and so talkative that no one else had any opportunity to speak .
all the pleasure of conversation was spoiled by his excessive <unk> .
philotas , however , at length puzzled him so completely with a question of logic ,  of a kind similar to those often discussed with great interest in ancient days ,  as to silence him for a time ; and young <name> was so much delighted with this feat , that he gave philotas all the gold and silver plate that there was upon the table , and sent all the articles home to him , after the entertainment was over , telling him .
to put his <name> and stamp upon them , and lock them up .
the question with which philotas puzzled the self-conceited physician was this .
it must be <unk> , however , that in those days it was considered that cold water in an intermittent fever was extremely dangerous , except in some peculiar cases , and in those the effect was good .
philotas then argued as follows : " in cases of a certain kind it is best to give water to a patient in an ague .
all cases of ague are cases of a certain kind .
therefore it is best in all cases to give the patient water . "
philotas having propounded his argument in this way , challenged the physician to point out the fallacy of it ; and while the physician sat perplexed and puzzled in his attempts to unravel the intricacy of it , the company enjoyed a temporary respite from his excessive <unk> .
philotas adds , in his account of this affair , that he sent the gold and silver plate back to young <name> again , being afraid to keep them .
<name> said that perhaps it was as well that this should be done , since many of the vessels were of great value on account of their rare and antique workmanship , and his father might possibly miss them and wish to know what had become of them .
as there were no limits , on the one hand , to the <unk> and grandeur of the pleasures to which <name> and <name> addicted themselves , so there were none to the low and <unk> tendencies which characterized them on the other .
sometimes , at midnight , after having been spending many hours in mirth and revelry in the palace , <name> would disguise himself in the dress of a slave , and <name> forth into the streets , excited with wine , in search of adventures .
in many cases , <name> herself , similarly disguised , would go out with him .
on these excursions <name> would take pleasure in involving himself in all sorts of difficulties and dangers  in street riots , drunken <unk> , and desperate quarrels with the populace  all for <name> 's amusement and his own .
stories of these adventures would circulate afterward among the people , some of whom would admire the free and jovial character of their eccentric visitor , and others would despise him as a <name> degrading himself to the level of a brute .
some of the amusements and pleasures which <name> and <name> pursued were innocent in themselves , though wholly unworthy to be made the serious business of life by personages on whom such exalted duties rightfully devolved .
they made various excursions upon the nile , and arranged parties of pleasure to go out on the water in the harbor , and to various rural retreats in the environs of the city .
once they went out on a <unk> , in boats , in the port .
<name> was unsuccessful ; and feeling chagrined that <name> should witness his ill-luck , he made a secret arrangement with some of the fishermen to dive down , where they could do so unobserved , and fasten fishes to his hook under the water .
by this plan he caught very large and fine fish very fast .
<name> , however , was too wary to be easily deceived by such a stratagem as this .
she observed the <unk> , but pretended not to observe it ; she expressed , on the other hand , the greatest surprise and delight at <name> 's good luck , and the extraordinary skill which it indicated .
the next day she wished to go a fishing again , and a party was accordingly made as on the day before .
she had , however , secretly instructed another fisherman to procure a dried and salted fish from the market , and , watching his opportunity , to get down into the water under the boats and attach it to the hook , before <name> 's divers could get there .
this plan succeeded , and <name> , in the midst of a large and <name> party that were looking on , pulled out an excellent fish , cured and dried , such as was known to every one as an imported article , bought in the market .
it was a fish of a kind that was brought originally from <name> minor .
the boats and the water all around them resounded with the shouts of merriment and laughter which this incident occasioned .
in the mean time , while <name> was thus spending his time in low and ignoble pursuits and in guilty pleasures at <name> , his wife fulvia , after exhausting all other means of inducing her husband to return to her , became desperate , and took measures for <unk> an open war , which she thought would compel him to return .
the extraordinary energy , influence , and talent which fulvia possessed , enabled her to do this in an effectual manner .
she organized an army , formed a camp , placed herself at the head of the troops , and sent such tidings to <name> of the dangers which threatened his cause as greatly alarmed him .
at the same time news came of great disasters in <name> minor , and of alarming insurrections among the provinces which had been committed to his charge there .
<name> saw that he must arouse himself from the spell which had enchanted him and break away from <name> , or that he would be wholly and irretrievably ruined .
he made , accordingly , a desperate effort to get free .
he bade the <name> farewell , embarked hastily in a fleet of galleys , and sailed away to tyre , leaving <name> in her palace , vexed , disappointed , and chagrined .

<name> , in parting with <name> as described in the last chapter , lost him for two or three years .
during this time <name> himself was involved in a great variety of difficulties and dangers , and passed through many eventful scenes , which , however , can not here be described in detail .
his life , during this period , was full of <unk> and excitement , and was spent probably in alternations of remorse for the past and anxiety for the future .
on landing at tyre , he was at first extremely perplexed whether to go to <name> minor or to rome .
his presence was imperiously demanded in both places .
the war which fulvia had <unk> was caused , in part , by the rivalry of octavius , and the collision of his interests with those of her husband .
<name> was very angry with her for having managed his affairs in such a way as to bring about a war .
after a time <name> and fulvia met at athens .
fulvia had retreated to that city , and was very seriously sick there , either from bodily disease , or from the influence of long-continued anxiety , vexation , and distress .
they had a <name> meeting .
neither party was disposed to exercise any <name> toward the other .
<name> left his wife rudely and roughly , after loading her with reproaches .
a short time afterward , she sank down in sorrow to the grave .
the death of fulvia was an event which proved to be of advantage to <name> .
it opened the way to a reconciliation between him and octavius .
fulvia had been extremely active in opposing octavius 's designs , and in organizing plans for resisting him .
he felt , therefore , a special hostility against her , and , through her , against <name> .
now , however , that she was dead , the way seemed to be in some sense opened for a reconciliation .
octavius had a sister , <name> , who had been the wife of a <name> general named <name> .
she was a very beautiful and a very accomplished woman , and of a spirit very different from that of fulvia .
she was gentle , affectionate , and kind , a lover of peace and <name> , and not at all disposed , like fulvia , to assert and maintain her influence over others by an overbearing and violent demeanor .
<name> 's husband died about this time , and , in the course of the movements and negotiations between <name> and octavius , the plan was proposed of a marriage between <name> and <name> , which , it was thought , would ratify and confirm the reconciliation .
this proposal was finally agreed upon , <name> was glad to find so easy a mode of settling his difficulties .
the people of rome , too , and the authorities there , knowing that the peace of the world depended upon the terms on which these two men stood with regard to each other , were extremely desirous that this arrangement should be carried into effect .
there was a law of the commonwealth forbidding the marriage of a widow within a specified period after the death of her husband .
that period had not , in <name> 's case , yet expired .
there was , however , so strong a <name> that no obstacle should be allowed to prevent this proposed union , or even to occasion delay , that the law was altered expressly for this case , and <name> and <name> were married .
the empire was divided between octavius and <name> , octavius receiving the western portion as his share , while the eastern was assigned to <name> .
it is not probable that <name> felt any very strong affection for his new wife , beautiful and gentle as she was .
a man , in fact , who had led such a life as his had been , must have become by this time incapable of any strong and pure attachment .
he , however , was pleased with the novelty of his acquisition , and seemed to forget for a time the loss of <name> .
he remained with <name> a year .
after that he went away on certain military enterprises which kept him some time from her .
he returned again , and again he went away .
all this time <unk> influence over him and over her brother was of the most salutary and excellent character .
she soothed their animosities , quieted their suspicions and jealousies , and at one time , when they were on the brink of open war , she effected a reconciliation between them by the most courageous and energetic , and at the same time , gentle and unassuming efforts .
at the time of this danger she was with her husband in greece ; but she persuaded him to send her to her brother at rome , saying that she was confident that she could arrange a settlement of the difficulties impending .
<name> allowed her to go .
she proceeded to rome , and procured an interview with her brother in the presence of his two principal officers of state .
here she pleaded her husband 's cause with tears in her eyes ; she defended his conduct , explained what seemed to be against him , and entreated her brother not to take such a course as should cast her down from being the happiest of women to being the most miserable .
" consider the circumstances of my case , " said she .
" the eyes of the world are upon me .
of the two most powerful men in the world , i am the wife of one and the sister of another .
if you allow rash counsels to go on and war to ensue , i am hopelessly ruined ; for , whichever is conquered , my husband or my brother , my own happiness <name> be for ever gone . "
octavius sincerely loved his sister , and he was so far softened by her entreaties that he consented to appoint an interview with <name> in order to see if their difficulties could be settled .
this interview was accordingly held .
the two generals came to a river , where , at the opposite banks , each embarked in a boat , and , being rowed out toward each other , they met in the middle of the stream .
a conference ensued , at which all the questions at issue were , for a time at least , very happily arranged .
<name> , however , after a time , began to become tired of his wife , and to sigh for <name> once more .
he left <name> at rome and proceeded to the eastward , under pretense of attending to the affairs of that portion of the empire ; but , instead of doing this , he went to <name> , and there renewed again his former intimacy with the egyptian <name> .
octavius was very indignant at this .
his former hostility to <name> , which had been in a measure appeased by the kind influence of <name> , now broke forth anew , and was heightened by the feeling of resentment naturally awakened by his sister 's wrongs public sentiment in rome , too , was setting very strongly against <name> .
<unk> were written , against him to ridicule him and <name> , and the most decided <unk> were passed upon his conduct .
<name> was universally beloved , and the sympathy which was every where felt for her increased and heightened very much the popular indignation which was felt against the man who could wrong so deeply such sweetness , and gentleness , and affectionate fidelity as hers .
after remaining for some time in <name> , and renewing his connection and intimacy with <name> , <name> went away again , crossing the sea into <name> , with the intention of prosecuting certain military undertakings there which imperiously demanded his attention .
his plan was to return as soon as possible to egypt after the object of his expedition should be accomplished .
he found , however , that he could not bear even a temporary absence from <name> .
his mind <unk> so much upon her , and upon the pleasures which he had enjoyed with her in egypt , and he longed so much to see her again , that he was wholly unfit for the discharge of his duties in the camp .
he became timid , inefficient , and <unk> , and almost every thing that he undertook ended <unk> .
the army , who understood perfectly well the reason of their <unk> <unk> and consequent ill fortune , were extremely indignant at his conduct , and the camp was filled with suppressed murmurs and complaints .
<name> , however , like other persons in his situation , was blind to all these indications of dissatisfaction ; probably he would have disregarded them if he had observed them .
at length , finding that he could bear his absence from his mistress no longer , he set out to march across the country , in the depth of the <name> , to the sea-shore , to a point where he had sent for <name> to come to join him .
the army endured incredible hardships and exposures in this march .
when <name> had once commenced the journey , he was so impatient to get forward that he compelled his troops to advance with a rapidity greater than their strength would bear .
they were , besides , not provided with proper tents or with proper supplies of provisions .
they were often obliged , therefore , after a long and fatiguing march during the day , to bivouac at night in the open air among the mountains , with scanty means of <unk> their hunger , and very little shelter from the cold rain , or from the storms of driving snow .
eight thousand men died on this march , from cold , fatigue , and exposure ; a greater sacrifice , perhaps , than had ever been made before to the mere ardor and impatience of a lover .
when <name> reached the shore , he advanced to a certain sea-port , near <unk> , where <name> was to land .
at the time of his arrival but a very small part of his army was left , and the few men that survived were in a miserably destitute condition .
<name> 's eagerness to see <name> became more and more excited as the time <name> nigh .
she did not come so soon as he had expected , and during the delay he seemed to pine away under the influence of love and sorrow .
he was silent , absent-minded , and sad .
he had no thoughts for any thing but the coming of <name> , and felt no interest in any other plans .
he watched for her incessantly , and would sometimes leave his place at the table , in the midst of the supper , and go down alone to the shore , where he would stand gazing out upon the sea , and saying mournfully to himself , " why does not she come ? "
the animosity and the ridicule which these things awakened against him , on the part of the army , were extreme ; but he was so utterly infatuated that he disregarded all the manifestations of public sentiment around him , and continued to allow his mind to be wholly engrossed with the single idea of <name> 's coming .
she arrived at last .
she brought a great supply of clothes and other necessaries for the use of <name> 's army , so that her coming not only gratified his love , but afforded him , also , a very essential relief , in respect to the military difficulties in which he was involved .
after some time spent in the enjoyment of the pleasure which being thus <unk> to <name> afforded him , <name> began again to think of the affairs of his government , which every month more and more imperiously demanded his attention .
he began to receive urgent calls from various quarters , rousing him to action .
in the mean time , <name>  who had been all this while waiting in distress and anxiety at rome , hearing continually the most gloomy accounts of her husband 's affairs , and the most humiliating tidings in respect to his infatuated devotion to <name>  resolved to make one more effort to save him .
she <unk> with her brother to allow her to raise troops and to collect supplies , and then proceed to the eastward to <unk> him .
octavius consented to this .
he , in fact , assisted <name> in making her preparations .
it is said , however , that he was influenced in this plan by his confident belief that this <name> attempt of his sister to <unk> her husband would fail , and that , by the failure of it , <name> would be put in the wrong , in the estimation of the <name> people , more absolutely and hopelessly than ever , and that the way would thus be prepared for his complete and final destruction .
<name> was rejoiced to obtain her brother 's aid to her undertaking , whatever the motive might be which induced him to afford it .
she accordingly levied a considerable body of troops , raised a large sum of money , provided clothes , and tents , and military stores for the army ; and when all was ready , she left italy and put to sea , having previously dispatched a messenger to her husband to inform him that she was coming .
<name> began now to be afraid that she was to lose <name> again , and she at once began to resort to the usual artifices employed in such cases , in order to retain her power over him .
she said nothing , but assumed the appearance of one pining under the influence of some secret suffering or sorrow .
she contrived to be often surprised in tears .
in such cases she would hastily brush her tears away , and assume a countenance of smiles and good humor , as if making every effort to be happy , though really oppressed with a heavy burden of anxiety and grief .
when <name> was near her she would seem overjoyed at his presence , and gaze upon him with an expression of the most devoted fondness .
when absent from him , she spent her time alone , always silent and dejected , and often in tears ; and she took care that the secret sorrows and sufferings that she endured should be duly made known to <name> , and that he should understand that they were all occasioned by her love for him , and by the danger which she apprehended that he was about to leave her .
the friends and secret agents of <name> , who reported these things to <name> , made , moreover , direct representations to him , for the purpose of <unk> his mind in her favor .
they had , in fact , the astonishing audacity to argue that <name> 's claims upon <name> for a continuance of his love were paramount to those of <name> .
she , that is , <name> , had been his wife , they said , only for a very short time .
<name> had been most <unk> attached to him for many years .
<name> was married to him , they alleged , not under the impulse of love , but from political considerations alone , to please her brother , and to ratify and confirm a political league made with him .
<name> , on the other hand , had given herself up to him in the most absolute and <unk> manner , under the influence solely of a personal affection which she could not control .
she had surrendered and sacrificed every thing to him .
for him she had lost her good name , alienated the affections of her subjects , made herself the object of reproach and censure to all mankind , and now she had left her native land to come and join him in his adverse fortunes .
considering how much she had done , and suffered , and sacrificed for his sake , it would be extreme and unjustifiable cruelty in him to forsake her now .
she never would survive such an abandonment .
her whole soul was so wrapped up in him , that she would pine away and die if he were now to forsake her .
<name> was distressed and agitated beyond measure by the <unk> in which he found that he was involved .
his duty , his inclination perhaps , certainly his ambition , and every dictate of <name> and policy required that he should break away from these <unk> at once and go to meet <name> .
but the spell that bound him was too mighty to be dissolved .
he yielded to <name> 's sorrows and tears .
he dispatched a messenger to <name> , who had by this time reached athens , in greece , directing her not to come any farther .
<name> , who seemed incapable of resentment or anger against her husband , sent back to ask what she should do with the troops , and money , and the military stores which she was bringing .
<name> directed her to leave them in greece .
<name> did so , and mournfully returned to her home .
as soon as she arrived at rome , octavius , her brother , whose indignation was now thoroughly aroused at the baseness of <name> , sent to his sister to say that she must leave <name> 's house and come to him .
a proper self-respect , he said , forbade her remaining any longer under the roof of such a man .
<name> replied that she would not leave her husband's house .
that house was her post of duty , whatever her husband might do , and there she would remain .
she accordingly retired within the precincts of her old home , and devoted herself in patient and <unk> sorrow to the care of the family and the children .
among these children was one young son of <name> 's , born during his marriage with her predecessor fulvia .
in the mean time , while <name> was thus faithfully though mournfully fulfilling her duties as wife and mother , in her husband's house at rome , <name> himself had gone with <name> to <name> , and was abandoning himself once more to a life of guilty pleasure there .
the greatness of mind which this beautiful and devoted wife thus displayed , attracted the admiration of all mankind .
it produced , however , one other effect , which <name> must have greatly <unk> .
it aroused a strong and universal feeling of indignation against the unworthy object toward whom this extraordinary magnanimity was displayed .
in the mean time , <name> gave himself up wholly to <name> 's influence and control , and managed all the affairs of the <name> empire in the east in the way best fitted to promote her aggrandizement and honor .
he made <name> his capital , celebrated triumphs there , arranged ostentatious expeditions into <name> and syria with <name> and her train , gave her whole provinces as presents , and exalted her two sons , <name> and ptolemy , children born during the period of his first acquaintance with her , to positions of the highest rank and station , as his own acknowledged sons .
the consequences of these and similar measures at rome were fatal to <name> 's character and standing .
octavius reported every thing to the <name> senate and people , and made <unk> <unk> and his various <unk> the ground of the heaviest accusations against him .
<name> , hearing of these things , sent his agents to rome and made accusations against octavius ; but these counter accusations were of no avail .
public sentiment was very strong and decided against him at the capital , and octavius began to prepare for war .
<name> perceived that he must prepare to defend himself .
<name> entered into the plans which he formed for this purpose with great ardor .
<name> began to levy troops , and collect and equip galleys and ships of war , and to make <unk> of money and military stores from all the eastern provinces and kingdoms .
<name> put all the resources of egypt at his disposal .
she furnished him with immense sums of money , and with an inexhaustible supply of corn , which she procured for this purpose from her dominions in the valley of the nile .
the various divisions of the immense armament which was thus provided for were ordered to rendezvous at ephesus , where <name> and <name> were awaiting to receive them , having proceeded there when their arrangements in egypt were completed , and they were ready to commence the campaign .
when all was ready for the expedition to set sail from ephesus , it was <name> 's judgment that it would be best for <name> to return to egypt , and leave him to go forth with the fleet to meet octavius alone .
<name> was , however , determined not to go away .
she did not dare to leave <name> at all to himself , for fear that in some way or other a peace would be effected between himself and octavius , which would result in his returning to <name> and abandoning her .
she accordingly contrived to persuade <name> to retain her with him , by bribing his chief counselor to advise him to do so .
his counselor 's name was <unk> .
<unk> , having received <name> 's money , while yet he pretended to be wholly disinterested in his advice , represented to <name> that it would not be reasonable to send <name> away , and deprive her of all participation in the <name> of the war , when she was <unk> so large a part of the expense of it .
besides , a large portion of the army consisted of egyptian troops , who would feel discouraged and disheartened if <name> were to leave them , and would probably act far less efficiently in the conflict than they would do if animated by the presence of their <name> .
then , moreover , such a woman as <name> was not to be considered , as many women would be , an embarrassment and a source of care to a military expedition which she might join , but a very efficient counselor and aid to it .
she was , he said , a very sagacious , energetic , and powerful <name> , accustomed to the command of armies and to the management of affairs of state , and her aid in the conduct of the expedition might be expected to <unk> very materially to its success .
<name> was easily won by such persuasions as these , and it was at length decided that <name> should accompany him .
<name> then ordered the fleet to move forward to the island of samos .
here it was brought to anchor and remained for some time , waiting for the coming in of new re-enforcements , and for the completion of the other arrangements .
<name> , as if becoming more and more infatuated as he approached the brink of his ruin , spent his time while the expedition remained at samos , not in maturing his plans and perfecting his arrangements for the tremendous conflict which was approaching , but in festivities , games , <unk> , and every species of riot and dissolute excess .
this , however , is not surprising .
men almost always , when in a situation analogous to his , fly to similar means of protecting themselves , in some small degree , from the pangs of remorse , and from the forebodings which stand ready to terrify and torment them at every instant in which these gloomy <unk> are not driven away by intoxication and revelry .
at least <name> found it so .
accordingly , an immense company of players , tumblers , fools , <unk> , and <unk> were ordered to assemble at samos , and to devote themselves with all zeal to the amusement of <name> 's court .
the island was one universal scene of riot and revelry .
people were astonished at such celebrations and displays , wholly unsuitable , as they considered them , to the occasion .
if such are the rejoicings , said they , which <name> <unk> before going into the battle , what festivities <name> he contrive on his return , joyous enough to express his pleasure if he shall gain the victory ?
after a time , <name> and <name> , with a magnificent train of attendants , left samos , and , passing across the <unk> sea , landed in greece , and advanced to athens , while the fleet , proceeding westward from samos , passed around <unk> , the southern promontory of greece , and then moved northward along the western coast of the peninsula .
<name> wished to go to athens for a special reason .
it was there that <name> had stopped on her journey toward her husband with re-enforcements and aid ; and while she was there , the people of athens , pitying her sad condition , and admiring the <name> spirit of mind which she displayed in her misfortunes , had paid her great attention , and during her stay among them had bestowed upon her many honors .
<name> now wished to go to the same place , and to triumph over her rival there , by making so great a display of her wealth and magnificence , and of her ascendency over the mind of <name> , as should entirely <unk> and <unk> the more unassuming pretensions of <name> .
she was not willing , it seems , to leave to the unhappy wife whom she had so cruelly wronged even the possession of a place in the hearts of the people of this foreign city , but must go and enviously strive to efface the impression which injured innocence had made , by an ostentatious exhibition of the triumphant prosperity of her own shameless wickedness .
she succeeded well in her plans .
the people of athens were amazed and bewildered at the immense magnificence that <name> exhibited before them .
she distributed vast sums of money among the people .
the city , in return , decreed to her the most exalted honors .
they sent a solemn embassy to her to present her with these decrees .
<name> himself , in the character of a citizen of athens , was one of the embassadors .
<name> received the deputation at her palace .
the reception was attended with the most splendid and imposing ceremonies .
one would have supposed that <name> 's cruel and unnatural hostility to <name> might now have been satisfied ; but it was not .
<name> , while he was at athens , and doubtless at <name> 's <unk> , sent a messenger to rome with a notice of <unk> to <name> , and with an order that she should leave his house .
<name> obeyed .
she went forth from her home , taking the children with her , and bitterly lamenting her cruel <name> .
in the mean time , while all these events had been <unk> in the east , octavius had been making his preparations for the coming crisis , and was now advancing with a powerful fleet across the sea .
he was armed with authority from the <name> senate and people , for he had obtained from them a decree deposing <name> from his power .
the charges made against him all related to <unk> and offenses arising out of his connection with <name> .
octavius contrived to get possession of a <name> which <name> had written before leaving rome , and which he had placed there in what he supposed a very sacred place of deposit .
the <unk> who had it in charge replied to octavius , when he demanded it , that they would not give it to him , but if he wished to take it they would not hinder him .
octavius then took the <name> , and read it to the <name> senate .
it provided , among other things , that at his death , if his death should happen at rome , his body should be sent to <name> to be given to <name> ; and it evinced in other ways a degree of <unk> and <unk> to the egyptian <name> which was considered wholly unworthy of a <name> chief magistrate .
<name> was accused , too , of having plundered cities and provinces , to make presents to <name> ; of having sent a library of two hundred thousand volumes to her from <unk> , to replace the one which <name> caesar had accidentally burned ; of having raised her sons , ignoble as their birth was , to high places of trust and power in the <name> government , and of having in many ways compromised the dignity of a <name> officer by his unworthy conduct in reference to her .
he used , for example , when presiding at a judicial tribunal , to receive <unk> sent him from <name> , and then at once turn off his attention from the proceedings going forward before him to read the letters .
[ 1 ] [ footnote 1 : these letters , in accordance with the scale of expense and extravagance on which <name> determined that every thing relating to herself and <name> should be done , were engraved on tablets made of <unk> , or <name> , or other hard and precious stones . ]
sometimes he did this when sitting in the chair of state , giving audience to embassadors and princes .
<name> probably sent these letters in at such times under the influence of a wanton disposition to show her power .
at one time , as octavius said in his arguments before the <name> senate , <name> was hearing a cause of the greatest importance , and during a time in the progress of the cause when one of the principal orators of the city was addressing him , <name> came passing by , when <name> suddenly arose , and , leaving the court without any ceremony , ran out to follow her .
these and a thousand similar tales exhibited <name> in so odious a light , that his friends forsook his cause , and his enemies gained a complete triumph .
the decree was passed against him , and octavius was authorized to <name> it into effect ; and accordingly , while <name> , with his fleet and army , was moving westward from samos and the <unk> sea , octavius was coming eastward and southward down the adriatic to meet him .
in process of time , after various maneuvers and delays , the two <unk> came into the vicinity of each other at a place called <unk> , which <name> be found upon the map on the western coast of epirus , north of greece .
both of the commanders had powerful fleets at sea , and both had great armies upon the land .
<name> was strongest in land troops , but his fleet was inferior to that of octavius , and he was himself inclined to remain on the land and fight the principal battle there .
but <name> would not consent to this .
she urged him to give octavius battle at sea .
the motive which induced her to do this has been supposed to be her wish to provide a more sure way of escape in case of an unfavorable issue to the conflict .
she thought that in her galleys she could make sail at once across the sea to <name> in case of defeat , whereas she knew not what would become of her if beaten at the head of an army on the land .
the ablest counselors and chief officers in the army urged <name> very strongly not to trust himself to the sea .
to all their arguments and remonstrances , however , <name> turned a deaf ear .
<name> must be allowed to have her way .
on the morning of the battle , when the ships were drawn up in array , <name> held the command of a division of fifty or sixty egyptian vessels , which were all completely manned , and well equipped with masts and sails .
she took good care to have every thing in perfect order for flight , in case flight should prove to be necessary .
with these ships she took a station in reserve , and for a time remained there a quiet witness of the battle .
the ships of octavius advanced to the attack of those of <name> , and the men fought from deck to deck with spears , <unk> , flaming darts , and every other destructive missile which the military <name> had then devised .
<name> 's ships had to contend against great disadvantages .
they were not only <unk> by those of octavius , but were far surpassed by them in the efficiency with which they were manned and armed .
still , it was a very obstinate conflict .
<name> , however , did not wait to see how it was to be finally decided .
as <name> 's forces did not immediately gain the victory , she soon began to yield to her fears in respect to the result , and , finally , fell into a panic and resolved to fly .
she ordered the oars to be manned and the sails to be hoisted , and then forcing her way through a portion of the fleet that was engaged in the contest , and throwing the vessels into confusion as she passed , she succeeded in getting to sea , and then pressed on , under full sail , down the coast to the southward .
<name> , as soon as he perceived that she was going , abandoning every other thought , and impelled by his insane <unk> to her , hastily called up a galley of five banks of oarsmen to pull with all their force after <name> 's flying squadron .
<name> , looking back from the deck of her vessel , saw this swift galley pressing on toward her .
she raised a signal at the stern of the vessel which she was in , that <name> might know for which of the fifty flying ships he was to steer .
guided by the signal , <name> came up to the vessel , and the sailors hoisted him up the side and helped him in .
<name> had , however , disappeared .
overcome with shame and confusion , she did not dare , it seems , to meet the look of the wretched victim of her arts whom she had now irretrievably ruined .
<name> did not seek her .
he did not speak a word .
he went forward to the prow of the ship , and , throwing himself down there alone , pressed his head between his hands , and seemed stunned and stupefied , and utterly overwhelmed with horror and despair .
he was , however , soon aroused from his stupor by an alarm raised on board his galley that they were pursued .
he rose from his seat , seized a spear , and , on ascending to the quarter-deck , saw that there were a number of small light boats , full of men and of arms , coming up behind them , and gaining rapidly upon his galley .
<name> , now free for a moment from his <unk> 's sway , and acting under the impulse of his own indomitable boldness and decision , instead of urging the oarsmen to press forward more rapidly in order to make good their escape , ordered the helm to be put about , and thus , turning the galley around , he faced his pursuers , and drove his ship into the midst of them .
a violent conflict ensued , the din and confusion of which was increased by the shocks and collisions between the boats and the galley .
in the end , the boats were beaten off , all excepting one : that one kept still hovering near , and the commander of it , who stood upon the deck , <unk> his spear with an aim at <name> , and seeking eagerly an opportunity to throw it , seemed by his attitude and the expression of his countenance to be animated by some peculiarly bitter feeling of hostility and hate .
<name> asked him who he was , that dared so fiercely to threaten him .
the man replied by giving his name , and saying that he came to avenge the death of his father .
it proved that he was the son of a man whom <name> had at a previous time , on some account or other , caused to be beheaded .
there followed an obstinate contest between <name> and this fierce assailant , in the end of which the latter was beaten off .
the boats then , having succeeded in making some prizes from <name> 's fleet , though they had failed in capturing <name> himself , gave up the pursuit and returned .
<name> then went back to his place , sat down in the prow , buried his face in his hands , and sank into the same condition of hopeless distress and anguish as before .
when husband and wife are overwhelmed with misfortune and suffering , each instinctively seeks a refuge in the sympathy and support of the other .
it is , however , far otherwise with such connections as that of <name> and <name> .
conscience , which remains calm and quiet in prosperity and <name> , rises up with sudden and unexpected violence as soon as the hour of calamity comes ; and thus , instead of mutual comfort and help , each finds in the thoughts of the other only the means of adding the horrors of remorse to the anguish of disappointment and despair .
so extreme was <name> 's distress , that for three days he and <name> neither saw nor spoke to each other .
she was overwhelmed with confusion and chagrin , and he was in such a condition of mental excitement that she did not dare to approach him .
in a word , reason seemed to have wholly lost its sway  his mind , in the alternations of his insanity , rising sometimes to fearful excitement , in paroxysms of uncontrollable rage , and then sinking again for a time into the stupor of despair .
in the mean time , the ships were passing down as rapidly as possible on the western coast of greece .
when they reached <unk> , the southern promontory of the peninsula , it was necessary to pause and consider what was to be done .
<name> 's women went to <name> and attempted to quiet and calm him .
they brought him food .
they persuaded him to see <name> .
a great number of merchant ships from the ports along the coast gathered around <name> 's little fleet and offered their services .
his cause , they said , was by no means desperate .
the army on the land had not been beaten .
it was not even certain that his fleet had been conquered .
they endeavored thus to revive the ruined commander 's sinking courage , and to urge him to make a new effort to retrieve his fortunes .
but all was in vain .
<name> was sunk in a hopeless despondency .
<name> was determined on going to egypt , and he must go too .
he distributed what treasure remained at his disposal among his immediate followers and friends , and gave them advice about the means of concealing themselves until they could make peace with octavius .
then , giving up all as lost , he followed <name> across the sea to <name> .

the case of <name> <name> affords one of the most extraordinary examples of the power of unlawful love to lead its <unk> and infatuated victim into the very jaws of open and recognized destruction that history records .
cases similar in character occur by thousands in common life ; but <name> 's , though perhaps not more striking in itself than a great multitude of others have been , is the most conspicuous instance that has ever been held up to the observation of mankind .
in early life , <name> was remarkable , as we have already seen , for a certain savage <unk> of character , and for a stern and indomitable recklessness of <name> , so great that it seemed impossible that any thing human should be able to tame him .
he was under the control , too , of an ambition so lofty and aspiring that it appeared to know no bounds ; and yet we find him taken possession of , in the very midst of his career , and in the height of his prosperity and success , by a woman , and so subdued by her arts and fascinations as to yield himself wholly to her guidance , and allow himself to be led about by her entirely at her <name> .
she <unk> whatever there might have been that was <name> and generous in his heart , and substitutes <unk> her own principles of malice and cruelty .
she <unk> all the fires of his ambition , originally so magnificent in its aims that the world seemed hardly large enough to afford it scope , and instead of this lofty passion , fills his soul with a love of the lowest , <unk> , and most ignoble pleasures .
she leads him to betray every public trust , to <unk> from himself all the affections of his countrymen , to repel most cruelly the kindness and <unk> of a beautiful and faithful wife , and , finally to expel this wife and all of his own legitimate family from his house ; and now , at last , she conducts him away in a most cowardly and ignoble flight from the field of his duty as a soldier  he knowing , all the time , that she is hurrying him to disgrace and destruction , and yet utterly without power to break from the control of his invisible chains .
the indignation which <name> 's base abandonment of his fleet and army at the battle of <unk> excited , over all that part of the empire which had been under his command , was extreme .
there was not the slightest possible excuse for such a flight .
his army , in which his greatest strength lay , remained unharmed , and even his fleet was not defeated .
the ships continued the combat until night , notwithstanding the betrayal of their cause by their commander .
they were at length , however , subdued .
the army , also , being discouraged , and losing all motive for resistance , yielded too .
in a very short time the whole country went over to octavius 's side .
in the mean time , <name> and <name> , on their first return to egypt , were completely beside themselves with terror .
<name> formed a plan for having all the treasures that she could save , and a certain number of galleys sufficient for the transportation of these treasures and a small company of friends , carried across the isthmus of suez and launched upon the red sea , in order that she might escape in that direction , and find some remote hiding-place and safe retreat on the shores of arabia or <name> , beyond the reach of octavius 's dreaded power .
she actually commenced this undertaking , and sent one or two of her galleys across the isthmus ; but the arabs seized them as soon as they reached their place of destination , and killed or captured the men that had them in charge , so that this desperate scheme was soon abandoned .
she and <name> then finally concluded to establish themselves at <name> , and made preparation , as well as they could , for defending themselves against octavius there .
<name> , when the first effects of his panic subsided , began to grow mad with vexation and resentment against all mankind .
he determined that he would have nothing to do with <name> or with any of her friends , but went off in a fit of sullen rage , and built a hermitage in a lonely place , on the island of pharos , where he lived for a time , cursing his folly and his wretched fate , and uttering the bitterest invectives against all who had been concerned in it .
here tidings came continually in , informing him of the <unk> of one after another of his armies , of the fall of his provinces in greece and <name> minor , and of the irresistible progress which octavius was now making toward universal dominion .
the tidings of these disasters coming incessantly upon him kept him in a continual fever of resentment and rage .
at last he became tired of his <unk> solitude , a sort of reconciliation ensued between himself and <name> , and he went back again to the city .
here he joined himself once more to <name> , and , collecting together what remained of their joint resources , they plunged again into a life of dissipation and vice , with the vain attempt to drown in mirth and wine the bitter regrets and the anxious forebodings which filled their souls .
they joined with them a company of <unk> as abandoned as themselves , and strove very hard to disguise and conceal their cares in their forced and unnatural gayety .
they could not , however , accomplish this purpose .
octavius was gradually advancing in his progress , and they knew very well that the time of his dreadful reckoning with them must soon come ; nor was there any place on earth in which they could look with any <name> of finding a refuge in it from his vindictive hostility .
<name> , warned by dreadful <unk> of what would probably at last be her fate , amused herself in studying the nature of poisons  not theoretically , but practically  making experiments with them on wretched prisoners and captives whom she compelled to take them in order that she and <name> might see the effects which they produced .
she made a collection of all the poisons which she could procure , and administered portions of them all , that she might see which were sudden and which were slow in their effects , and also learn which produced the greatest distress and suffering , and which , on the other hand , only benumbed and stupefied the faculties , and thus extinguished life with the least infliction of pain .
these experiments were not confined to such vegetable and mineral poisons as could be mingled with the food or administered in a <unk> .
<name> took an equal interest in the effects of the bite of venomous serpents and reptiles .
she procured specimens of all these animals , and tried them upon her prisoners , causing the men to be stung and bitten by them , and then watching the effects .
these investigations were made , not directly with a view to any practical use , which she was to make of the knowledge thus acquired , but rather as an agreeable occupation , to divert her mind , and to amuse <name> and her guests .
the variety in the forms and expressions which the agony of her poisoned victims assumed ,  their <unk> , their cries , their convulsions , and the <unk> of their features when struggling with death , furnished exactly the kind and degree of excitement which she needed to occupy and amuse her mind .
[ illustration : <name> testing the poisons upon the slaves ] <name> was not entirely at ease , however , during the progress of these terrible experiments .
his foolish and childish fondness for <name> was mingled with jealousy , suspicion , and distrust ; and he was so afraid that <name> might secretly poison him , that he would never take any food or wine without requiring that she should taste it before him .
at length , one day , <name> caused the petals of some flowers to be poisoned , and then had the flowers woven into the <unk> which <name> was to wear at supper .
in the midst of the feast , she pulled off the leaves of the flowers from her own <unk> and put them playfully into her wine , and then proposed that <name> should do the same with his <unk> , and that they should then drink the wine , <unk> , as it would be , with the color and the perfume of the flowers .
<name> entered very readily into this proposal , and when he was about to drink the wine , she arrested his hand , and told him that it was poisoned .
" you see now , " said she , " how vain it is for you to watch against me .
if it were possible for me to live without you , how easy it would be for me to devise ways and means to kill you . "
then , to prove that her words were true , she ordered one of the servants to drink <name> 's wine .
he did so , and died before their sight in dreadful agony .
the experiments which <name> thus made on the nature and effects of poison were not , however , wholly without practical result .
<name> learned from them , it is said , that the bite of the <unk> was the easiest and least painful mode of death .
the effect of the venom of that animal appeared to her to be the <unk> of the sensorium into a lethargy or stupor , which soon ended in death , without the intervention of pain .
this knowledge she seems to have laid up in her mind for future use .
the thoughts of <name> appear , in fact , to have been much disposed , at this time , to flow in gloomy channels , for she occupied herself a great deal in building for herself a sepulchral monument in a certain sacred portion of the city .
this monument had , in fact , been commenced many years ago , in accordance with a custom prevailing among egyptian sovereigns , of expending a portion of their revenues during their <unk> in building and decorating their own tombs .
<name> now turned her mind with new interest to her own mausoleum .
she finished it , provided it with the strongest possible bolts and bars , and , in a word , seemed to be preparing it in all respects for occupation .
in the mean time , octavius , having made himself master of all the countries which had formerly been under <name> 's sway , now advanced , meeting none to oppose him , from <name> minor into syria , and from syria toward egypt .
<name> and <name> made one attempt , while he was thus advancing toward <name> , to avert the storm which was impending over them , by sending an embassage to ask for some terms of peace .
<name> proposed , in this embassage , to give up every thing to his conqueror on condition that he might be permitted to retire unmolested with <name> to athens , and allowed to spend the remainder of their days there in peace ; and that the kingdom of egypt might descend to their children .
octavius replied that he could not make any terms with <name> , though he was willing to consent to any thing that was reasonable in behalf of <name> .
the messenger who came back from octavius with this reply spent some time in private interviews with <name> .
this aroused <name> 's jealousy and anger .
he accordingly ordered the unfortunate messenger to be scourged and then sent back to octavius , all <unk> with wounds , with orders to say to octavius that if it displeased him to have one of his servants thus punished , he might revenge himself by <unk> a servant of <name> 's who was then , as it happened , in octavius 's power .
the news at length suddenly arrived at <name> that octavius had appeared before pelusium , and that the city had fallen into his hands .
the next thing <name> and <name> well knew would be , that they should see him at the gates of <name> .
neither <name> nor <name> had any means of resisting his progress , and there was no place to which they could fly .
nothing was to be done but to await , in consternation and terror , the sure and inevitable doom which was now so near .
<name> gathered together all her treasures and sent them to her tomb .
these treasures consisted of great and valuable stores of gold , silver , precious stones , garments of the highest cost , and weapons , and vessels of exquisite workmanship and great value , the hereditary possessions of the egyptian kings .
she also sent to the mausoleum an immense quantity of flax , tow , torches , and other combustibles .
these she stored in the lower apartments of the monument , with the desperate determination of burning herself and her treasures together rather than to fall into the hands of the romans .
in the mean time , the army of octavius steadily continued its march across the desert from pelusium to <name> .
on the way , octavius learned , through the agents in communication with him from within the city what were the arrangements which <name> had made for the destruction of her treasure whenever the danger should become imminent of its falling into his hands .
he was extremely unwilling that this treasure should be lost .
besides its intrinsic value , it was an object of immense importance to him to get possession of it for the purpose of carrying it to rome as a trophy of his triumph .
he accordingly sent secret messengers to <name> , endeavoring to separate her from <name> , and to <unk> her mind with the profession that he felt only friendship for her , and did not mean to do her any injury , being in pursuit of <name> only .
these negotiations were continued from day to day while octavius was advancing .
at last the <name> army reached <name> , and invested it on every side .
as soon as octavius was established in his camp under the walls of the city , <name> planned a <name> , and he executed it , in fact , with considerable energy and success .
he issued suddenly from the gates , at the head of as strong a force as he could command , and attacked a body of octavius 's horsemen .
he succeeded in driving these horsemen away from their position , but he was soon driven back in his turn , and compelled to retreat to the city , fighting as he fled , to beat back his pursuers .
he was extremely elated at the success of this skirmish .
he came to <name> with a countenance full of animation and pleasure , took her in his arms and kissed her , all <unk> for battle as he was , and boasted greatly of the exploit which he had performed .
he praised , too , in the highest terms , the valor of one of the officers who had gone out with him to the fight , and whom he had now brought to the palace to present to <name> .
<name> rewarded the faithful captain 's prowess with a magnificent suit of armor made of gold .
notwithstanding this reward , however , the man deserted <name> that very night , and went over to the enemy .
almost all of <name> 's adherents were in the same state of mind .
they would have gladly gone over to the camp of octavius , if they could have found an opportunity to do so .
in fact , when the final battle was fought , the fate of it was decided by a grand <unk> in the fleet , which went over in a body to the side of octavius .
<name> was planning the operations of the day , and reconnoitering the movements of the enemy from an eminence which he occupied at the head of a body of foot soldiers  all the land forces that now remained to him  and looking off , from the eminence on which he stood , toward the harbor , he observed a movement among the galleys .
they were going out to meet the ships of octavius , which were lying at anchor not very far from them .
<name> supposed that his vessels were going to attack those of the enemy , and he looked to see what exploits they would perform .
they advanced toward octavius 's ships , and when they met them , <name> observed , to his utter amazement , that , instead of the furious combat that he had expected to see , the ships only exchanged friendly salutations , by the use of the customary naval signals ; and then his ships , passing quietly round , took their positions in the lines of the other fleet .
the two fleets had thus become merged and mingled into one .
<name> immediately decided that this was <name> 's treason .
she had made peace with octavius , he thought , and surrendered the fleet to him as one of the conditions of it .
<name> ran through the city , crying out that he was betrayed , and in a <unk> of rage sought the palace .
<name> fled to her tomb .
she took in with her one or two attendants , and bolted and barred the doors , securing the fastenings with the heavy catches and springs that she had previously made ready .
she then directed her women to call out through the door that she had killed herself within the tomb .
the tidings of her death were borne to <name> .
it changed his anger to grief and despair .
his mind , in fact , was now wholly lost to all balance and control , and it passed from the dominion of one <name> passion to another with the most capricious facility .
he cried out with the most bitter expressions of sorrow , mourning , he said , not so much <unk> death , for he should soon follow and join her , as the fact that she had proved herself so superior to him in courage at last , in having thus anticipated him in the work of <unk> .
he was at this time in one of the chambers of the palace , whither he had fled in despair , and was standing by a fire , for the morning was cold .
he had a favorite servant named eros , whom he greatly trusted , and whom he had made to take an oath long before , that whenever it should become necessary for him to die , eros should kill him .
this eros he now called to him , and telling him that the time was come , ordered him to take the sword and strike the blow .
eros took the sword while <name> stood up before him .
eros turned his head aside as if wishing that his eyes should not see the deed which his hands were about to perform .
instead , however , of piercing his master with it , he plunged it into his own breast , fell down at <name> 's feet , and died .
<name> gazed a moment at the shocking spectacle , and then said , " i thank thee for this , <name> eros .
thou hast set me an example .
i must do for myself what thou couldst not do for me . "
so saying , he took the sword from his servant 's hands , plunged it into his body , and staggering to a little bed that was near , fell over upon it in a swoon .
he had received a mortal wound .
the pressure , however , which was produced by the position in which he lay upon the bed , <unk> the wound a little , and stopped the flow of blood .
<name> came presently to himself again , and then began to beg and implore those around him to take the sword and put him out of his misery .
but no one would do it .
he lay for a time suffering great pain , and moaning incessantly , until , at length , an officer came into the apartment and told him that the story which he had heard of <unk> death was not true ; that she was still alive , shut up in her monument , and that she desired to see him there .
this intelligence was the source of new excitement and agitation .
<name> implored the by-standers to <name> him to <name> , that he might see her once more before he died .
they shrank from the attempt ; but , after some hesitation and delay , they concluded to undertake to remove him .
so , taking him in their arms , they bore him along , faint and dying , and marking their track with his blood , toward the tomb .
<name> would not open the gates to let the party in .
the city was all in uproar and confusion through the terror of the assault which octavius was making upon it , and she did not know what treachery might be intended .
she therefore went up to a window above , and letting down ropes and chains , she directed those below to fasten the dying body to them , that she and the two women with her might draw it up .
this was done .
those who witnessed it said that it was a most piteous sight to behold ,  <name> and her women above exhausting their strength in drawing the wounded and bleeding sufferer up the wall , while he , when he approached the window , feebly raised his arms to them , that they might lift him in .
the women had hardly strength sufficient to draw the body up .
at one time it seemed that the attempt would have to be abandoned ; but <name> reached down from the window as far as she could to get hold of <name> 's arms , and thus , by dint of great effort , they succeeded at last in taking him in .
they bore him to a couch which was in the upper room from which the window opened , and laid him down , while <name> wrung her hands and tore her hair , and uttered the most piercing lamentations and cries .
she leaned over the dying <name> , crying out incessantly with the most piteous exclamations of grief .
she bathed his face , which was covered with blood , and vainly endeavored to stanch his wound .
<name> urged her to be calm , and not to mourn his fate .
he asked for some wine .
they brought it to him and he drank it .
he then entreated <name> to save her life , if she possibly could do so , and to make some terms or other with octavius , so as to continue to live .
very soon after this he expired .
in the mean time , octavius had heard of the mortal wound which <name> had given himself ; for one of the by-standers had seized the sword the moment that the deed was done , and had hastened to <name> it to octavius , and to announce to him the death of his enemy .
octavius immediately desired to get <name> into his power .
he sent a messenger , therefore , to the tomb , who attempted to open a parley there with her .
<name> talked with the messenger through the <unk> or crevices , but could not be induced to open the door .
the messenger reported these facts to octavius .
octavius then sent another man with the messenger , and while one was engaging the attention of <name> and her women at the door below , the other obtained ladders , and succeeded in gaining admission into the window above .
<name> was warned of the success of this stratagem by the shrieks of her women , who saw the officer coming down the stairs .
she looked around , and observing at a glance that she was betrayed , and that the officer was coming to seize her , she <name> a little dagger from her robe , and was about to plunge it into her breast , when the officer grasped her arm just in time to prevent the blow .
he took the dagger from her , and then examined her clothes to see that there were no other secret weapons concealed there .
the capture of the <name> being reported to octavius , he appointed an officer to take her into close custody .
this officer was charged to treat her with all possible courtesy , but to keep a close and constant watch over her , and particularly to guard against allowing her any possible means or opportunity for <unk> .
in the mean time , octavius took formal possession of the city , marching in at the head of his troops with the most imposing pomp and parade .
a chair of state , magnificently decorated , was set up for him on a high elevation in a public square ; and here he sat , with circles of guards around him , while the people of the city , assembled before him in the dress of <unk> , and kneeling upon the pavement , begged his forgiveness , and implore him to spare the city .
these petitions the great conqueror graciously condescended to <name> .
many of the princes and generals who had served under <name> came next to beg the body of their commander , that they might give it an honorable burial .
these requests , however , octavius would not accede to , saying that he could not take the body away from <name> .
he , however , gave <name> leave to make such arrangements for the obsequies as she thought fit , and allowed her to appropriate such sums of money from her treasures for this purpose as she desired .
<name> accordingly made the necessary arrangements , and superintended the execution of them ; not , however , with any degree of calmness and composure , but in a state , on the contrary , of extreme agitation and distress .
in fact , she had been living now so long under the unlimited and unrestrained dominion of <name> and passion , that reason was pretty effectually <unk> , and all self-control was gone .
she was now nearly forty years of age , and , though traces of her inexpressible beauty remained , her bloom was faded , and her countenance was <name> with the effects of weeping , anxiety , and despair .
she was , in a word , both in body and mind , only the wreck and ruin of what she once had been .
when the burial ceremonies were performed , and she found that all was over  that <name> was forever gone , and she herself hopelessly and <unk> ruined  she gave herself up to a perfect <unk> of grief .
she beat her breast , and scratched and tore her flesh so dreadfully , in the vain efforts which she made to kill herself , in the paroxysms of her despair , that she was soon covered with <unk> and wounds , which , becoming inflamed and swelled , made her a shocking spectacle to see , and threw her into a fever .
she then conceived the idea of pretending to be more sick than she was , and so refusing food and starving herself to death .
she attempted to execute this design .
she rejected every medical remedy that was offered her , and would not eat , and lived thus some days without food .
octavius , to whom every thing relating to his captive was minutely reported by her attendants , suspected her design .
he was very unwilling that she should die , having set his heart on exhibiting her to the <name> people , on his return to the capital , in his triumphal procession .
he accordingly sent her orders , requiring that she should submit to the treatment prescribed by the physician , and take her food , enforcing these his commands with a certain threat which he imagined might have some influence over her .
and what threat does the reader imagine could possibly be devised to reach a mind so sunk , so desperate , so wretched as hers ?
every thing seemed already lost but life , and life was only an insupportable burden .
what interests , then , had she still remaining upon which a threat could take hold ?
octavius , in looking for some avenue by which he could reach her , reflected that she was a mother .
<unk> , the son of <name> caesar , and <name> , <name> , and ptolemy , <name> 's children , were still alive .
octavius imagined that in the secret recesses of her wrecked and ruined soul there might be some lingering principle of maternal affection remaining which he could goad into life and action .
he accordingly sent word to her that , if she did not yield to the physician and take her food , he would kill every one of her children .
the threat produced its effect .
the crazed and frantic patient became calm .
she received her food .
she submitted to the physician .
under his treatment her wounds began to heal , the fever was allayed , and at length she appeared to be gradually recovering .
when octavius learned that <name> had become composed , and seemed to be in some sense convalescent , he resolved to pay her a visit .
as he entered the room where she was confined , which seems to have been still the upper chamber of her tomb , he found her lying on a low and miserable bed , in a most wretched condition , and exhibiting such a spectacle of disease and wretchedness that he was shocked at beholding her .
she appeared , in fact , almost wholly bereft of reason .
when octavius came in , she suddenly leaped out of the bed , half naked as she was , and covered with bruises and wounds , and crawled miserably along to her conqueror 's feet in the attitude of a <unk> .
her hair was torn from her head , her limbs were swollen and disfigured , and great bandages appeared here and there , indicating that there were still worse injuries than these concealed .
from the midst of all this <unk> and misery there still beamed from her sunken eyes a great portion of their former beauty , and her voice still possessed the same inexpressible charm that had characterized it so strongly in the days of her prime .
octavius made her go back to her bed again and lie down .
<name> then began to talk and excuse herself for what she had done , attributing all the blame of her conduct to <name> .
octavius , however , interrupted her , and defended <name> from her <unk> , saying to her that it was not his fault so much as hers .
she then suddenly changed her tone , and acknowledging her sins , piteously implored <name> .
she begged octavius to pardon and spare her , as if now she were afraid of death and dreaded it , instead of desiring it as a boon .
in a word , her mind , the victim and the prey alternately of the most dissimilar and inconsistent passions , was now overcome by fear .
to propitiate octavius , she brought out a list of all her private treasures , and delivered it to him as a complete inventory of all that she had .
one of her <unk> , however , named <unk> , who was standing by , said to octavius that that list was not complete .
<name> had , he alleged , reserved several things of great value , which she had not put down upon it .
this assertion , thus suddenly exposing her <unk> , threw <name> into a violent rage .
she sprang from her bed and assaulted her secretary in a most furious manner .
octavius and the others who were here interposed , and compelled <name> to lie down again , which she did , uttering all the time the most grievous complaints at the wretched degradation to which she was reduced , to be insulted thus by her own servant at such a time .
if she had reserved any thing , she said , of her private treasures , it was only for presents to some of her faithful friends , to induce them the more zealously to <unk> with octavius in her behalf .
octavius replied by urging her to feel no concern on the subject whatever .
he freely gave her , he said , all that she had reserved , and he promised in other respects to treat her in the most honorable and courteous manner .
octavius was much pleased at the result of this interview .
it was obvious , as it appeared to him , that <name> had ceased to <name> to die ; that she now , on the contrary , wished to live , and that he should accordingly succeed in his <name> of taking her him to <name> his triumph at rome .
he accordingly made his arrangements for departure , and <name> was notified that in three days she was to set out , together with her children , to go into syria .
octavius said syria , as he did not wish to alarm <name> by speaking of rome .
she , however , understood well where the journey , if once commenced , would necessarily end , and she was fully determined in her own mind that she would never go there .
she asked to be allowed to pay one parting visit to <name> 's tomb .
this request was granted ; and she went to the tomb with a few attendants , carrying with her <unk> and garlands of flowers .
at the tomb her grief broke forth anew , and was as violent as ever .
she <unk> her lover 's death with loud cries and lamentations , uttered while she was placing the garlands upon the tomb , and offering the <unk> and incense , which were customary in those days , as expressions of grief .
" these , " said she , as she made the offerings , " are the last <unk> of affection that i can ever pay thee , my dearest , dearest lord .
i can not join thee , for i am a captive and a prisoner , and they <name> not let me die .
they watch me every hour , and are going to bear me far away , to exhibit me to thine enemies , as a badge and trophy of their triumph over thee .
oh <unk> , dearest <name> , with the gods where thou <name> now , since those that reign here on earth have utterly forsaken me ; implore them to save me from this fate , and let me die here in my native land , and be buried by thy side in this tomb . "
when <name> returned to her apartment again after this melancholy ceremony , she seemed to be more composed than she had been before .
she went to the bath , and then she attired herself handsomely for supper .
she had ordered supper that night to be very sumptuously served .
she was at <name> to make these arrangements , for the restrictions upon her movements , which had been imposed at first , were now removed , her appearance and demeanor having been for some time such as to lead octavius to suppose that there was no longer any danger that she would attempt <unk> .
her entertainment was arranged , therefore , according to her directions , in a manner corresponding with the customs of her court when she had been a <name> .
she had many attendants , and among them were two of her own women .
these women were <unk> and faithful servants and friends .
while she was at supper , a man tame to the door with a basket , and wished to enter .
the guards asked him what he had in his basket .
he opened it to let them see ; and , lifting up some green leaves which were laid over the top , he showed the soldiers that the basket was filled with figs .
he said that they were for <name> 's supper .
the soldiers admired the appearance of the figs , saying that they were very fine and beautiful .
the man asked the soldiers to take some of them .
this they declined , but allowed the man to pass in .
when the supper was ended , <name> sent all of her attendants away except the two women .
they remained .
after a little time , one of these women came out with a letter for octavius , which <name> had written , and which she wished to have immediately delivered .
one of the soldiers from the guard stationed at the gates was accordingly dispatched to <name> the letter .
octavius , when it was given to him , opened the envelope at once and read the letter , which was written , as was customary in those days , on a small tablet of metal .
he found that it was a brief but urgent petition from <name> , written evidently in agitation and excitement , praying that he would overlook her offense , and allow her to be buried with <name> .
octavius immediately inferred that she had destroyed herself .
he sent off some messengers at once , with orders to go directly to her place of confinement and ascertain the truth , intending to follow them himself immediately .
the messengers , on their arrival at the gates , found the sentinels and soldiers quietly on guard before the door , as if all were well .
on entering <name> 's room , however , they beheld a shocking spectacle .
<name> was lying dead upon a couch .
one of her women was upon the floor , dead too .
the other , whose name was <unk> , was sitting over the body of her mistress , fondly caressing her , arranging flowers in her hair , and adorning her <unk> .
the messengers of octavius , on witnessing this spectacle , were overcome with amazement , and demanded of <unk> what it could mean .
" it is all right , " said <unk> .
" <name> has acted in a manner worthy of a <name> descended from so <name> a line of kings . "
as <unk> said this , she began to sink herself , fainting , upon the bed , and almost immediately expired .
the by-standers were not only shocked at the spectacle which was thus presented before them , but they were perplexed and confounded in their attempts to discover by what means <name> and her women had succeeded in effecting their design .
they examined the bodies , but no marks of violence were to be discovered .
they looked all around the room , but no weapons , and no indication of any means of poison , were to be found .
they discovered something that appeared like the slimy track of an animal on the wall , toward a window , which they thought might have been produced by an <unk> ; but the reptile itself was nowhere to be seen .
they examined the body with great care , but no marks of any bite or sting were to be found , except that there were two very slight and scarcely discernible <unk> on the arm , which some persons fancied might have been so caused .
the means and manner of her death seemed to be involved in impenetrable mystery .
there were various rumors on the subject subsequently in circulation both at <name> and at rome , though the mystery was never fully solved .
some said that there was an <unk> concealed among the figs which the servant man brought in in the basket ; that he brought it in that manner , by a <unk> arrangement between him and <name> , and that , when she received it , she placed the creature on her arm .
others say that she had a small steel instrument like a needle , with a poisoned point , which she had kept concealed in her hair , and that she killed herself with that , without producing any visible wound .
another story was , that she had an <unk> in a box somewhere in her apartment , which she had reserved for this occasion , and when the time finally came , that she pricked and teased it with a golden <unk> to make it angry , and then placed it upon her flesh and received its sting .
which of these stones , if either of them , was true , could never be known .
it has , however , been generally believed among mankind that <name> died in some way or other by the <unk> sting of the <unk> , and paintings and sculptures without number have been made to illustrate and commemorate the scene .
this supposition in respect to the mode of her death is , in fact , confirmed by the action of octavius himself on his return to rome , which furnishes a strong indication of his opinion of the manner in which his captive at last eluded him .
disappointed in not being able to exhibit the <name> herself in his triumphal train , he caused a golden statue representing her to be made , with an image of an <unk> upon the arm of it , and this sculpture he caused to be borne conspicuously before him in his grand triumphal entry into the capital , as the token and trophy of the final downfall of the unhappy egyptian <name> .

preface .
one special object which the author of this series has had in view , in the plan and method which he has followed in the preparation of the successive volumes , has been to adapt them to the purposes of text-books in schools .
the study of a general <unk> of history , such as is frequently used as a text-book , is highly useful , if it comes in at the right stage of education , when the mind is sufficiently matured , and has acquired sufficient preliminary knowledge to understand and appreciate so condensed a generalization as a summary of the whole history of a nation contained in an ordinary volume must necessarily be .
without this degree of maturity of mind , and this preparation , the study of such a work <name> be , as it too frequently is , a mere mechanical committing to memory of names , and dates , and phrases , which awaken no interest , communicate no ideas , and impart no useful knowledge to the mind .
a class of ordinary pupils , who have not yet become much acquainted with history , would , accordingly , be more benefited by having their attention concentrated , at first , on detached and separate topics , such as those which form the subjects , respectively , of these volumes .
by studying thus fully the history of individual monarchs , or the narratives of single events , they can go more fully into detail ; they conceive of the transactions described as realities ; their reflecting and reasoning powers are occupied on what they read ; they take notice of the motives of conduct , of the gradual development of character , the good or ill desert of actions , and of the connection of causes and consequences , both in respect to the influence of wisdom and virtue on the one hand , and , on the other , of folly and crime .
in a word , their minds and hearts are occupied instead of merely their memories .
they reason , they sympathize , they pity , they approve , and they condemn .
they enjoy the real and true pleasure which constitutes the charm of historical study for minds that are mature ; and they acquire a taste for truth instead of fiction , which <name> tend to direct their reading into proper channels in all future years .
the use of these works , therefore , as text-books in classes , has been kept continually in mind in the preparation of them .
the running index on the tops of the pages is intended to serve instead of questions .
these <unk> can be used in their present form as topics , in respect to which , when announced in the class , the pupils are to repeat substantially what is said on the <name> ; or , on the other hand , questions in form , if that mode is preferred , can be readily framed from them by the teacher .
in all the volumes , a very regular system of division is observed , which <name> greatly facilitate the <unk> of lessons .

<name> was the founder of the ancient persian empire  a monarchy , perhaps , the most wealthy and magnificent which the world has ever seen .
of that strange and incomprehensible principle of human nature , under the influence of which vast masses of men , notwithstanding the universal instinct of aversion to control , combine , under certain circumstances , by millions and millions , to maintain , for many successive centuries , the representatives of some one great family in a condition of exalted , and absolute , and utterly irresponsible ascendency over themselves , while they toil for them , watch over them , submit to endless and most humiliating privations in their behalf , and commit , if commanded to do so , the most inexcusable and atrocious crimes to sustain the <unk> they have thus made in their lofty estate , we have , in the case of this persian monarchy , one of the most extraordinary exhibitions .
the persian monarchy appears , in fact , even as we look back upon it from this remote distance both of space and of time , as a very vast wave of human power and grandeur .
it swelled up among the populations of <name> , between the persian gulf and the caspian sea , about five hundred years before christ , and rolled on in undiminished magnitude and <name> for many centuries .
it bore upon its crest the <name> line of astyages and his successors .
<name> was , however , the first of the princes whom it held up conspicuously to the admiration of the world and he rode so gracefully and gallantly on the lofty crest that mankind have given him the credit of raising and sustaining the magnificent <unk> on which he was borne .
how far we are to consider him as founding the monarchy , or the monarchy as raising and illustrating him , <name> appear more fully in the course of this narrative .
<unk> with this persian monarchy in the east , there flourished in the west the small but very efficient and vigorous republics of greece .
the greeks had a written character for their language which could be easily and rapidly executed , while the ordinary language of the persians was scarcely written at all .
there was , it is true , in this latter nation , a certain learned character , which was used by the priests for their mystic records , and also for certain sacred books which constituted the only national archives .
it was , however , only slowly and with difficulty that this character could be penned , and , when penned , it was unintelligible to the great mass of the population .
for this reason , among others , the greeks wrote narratives of the great events which occurred in their day , which narratives they so embellished and adorned by the picturesque lights and shades in which their genius enabled them to present the scenes and characters described as to make them universally admired , while the surrounding nations produced nothing but formal governmental records , not worth to the community at large the toil and labor necessary to <unk> them and make them intelligible .
thus the greek writers became the historians , not only of their own republics , but also of all the nations around them ; and with such admirable genius and power did they fulfill this function , that , while the records of all other nations <unk> with them have been almost entirely neglected and forgotten , the language of the greeks has been preserved among mankind , with infinite labor and toil , by successive generations of scholars , in every civilized nation , for two thousand years , solely in order that men may continue to read these tales .
two greek historians have given us a narrative of the events connected with the life of <name>  herodotus and xenophon .
these writers disagree very materially in the statements which they make , and modern readers are divided in opinion on the question which to believe .
in order to present this question fairly to the minds of our readers , we must commence this volume with some account of these two authorities , whose guidance , conflicting as it is , furnishes all the light which we have to follow .
herodotus was a philosopher and scholar .
xenophon was a great general .
the one spent his life in solitary study , or in visiting various countries in the pursuit of knowledge ; the other distinguished himself in the command of armies , and in distant military expeditions , which he conducted with great energy and skill .
they were both , by birth , men of wealth and high station , so that they occupied , from the beginning , conspicuous positions in society ; and as they were both energetic and enterprising in character , they were led , each , to a very romantic and adventurous career , the one in his travels , the other in his campaigns , so that their personal history and their exploits attracted great attention even while they lived .
herodotus was born in the year 484 before christ , which was about fifty years after the death of the <name> whose history forms the subject of this volume .
he was born in the grecian state of <unk> , in <name> minor , and in the city of <unk> .
<unk> , as may be seen from the map at the commencement of this volume , was in the southwestern part of <name> minor , near the shores of the Ã¦gean sea .
herodotus became a student at a very early age .
it was the custom in greece , at that time , to give to young men of his rank a good intellectual education .
in other nations , the training of the young men , in wealthy and powerful families , was confined almost exclusively to the use of arms , to horsemanship , to athletic feats , and other such accomplishments as would give them a manly and graceful personal bearing , and enable them to excel in the various friendly contests of the public games , as well as prepare them to maintain their ground against their enemies in personal combats on the field of battle .
the greeks , without neglecting these things , taught their young men also to read and to write , explained to them the structure and the philosophy of language , and trained them to the study of the poets , the orators , and the historians which their country had produced .
thus a general taste for intellectual pursuits and pleasures was diffused throughout the community .
public affairs were discussed , before large audiences assembled for the purpose , by orators who felt a great pride and pleasure in the exercise of the power which they had acquired of persuading , convincing , or exciting the mighty masses that listened to them ; and at the great public celebrations which were customary in those days , in addition to the <unk> , the races , the games , and the military spectacles , there were certain literary entertainments provided , which constituted an essential part of the public pleasures .
tragedies were acted , poems recited , odes and <unk> <name> , and narratives of martial enterprises and exploits , and geographical and historical descriptions of neighboring nations , were read to vast throngs of listeners , who , having been accustomed from infancy to witness such performances , and to hear them applauded , had learned to appreciate and enjoy them .
of course , these literary exhibitions would make impressions , more or less strong , on different minds , as the mental temperaments and characters of individuals varied .
they seem to have exerted a very powerful influence on the mind of herodotus in his early years .
he was inspired , when very young , with a great zeal and ardor for the attainment of knowledge ; and as he advanced toward maturity , he began to be ambitious of making new discoveries , with a view of communicating to his countrymen , in these great public assemblies , what he should thus acquire .
accordingly , as soon as he arrived at a suitable age , he resolved to set out upon a tour into foreign countries , and to bring back a report of what he should see and hear .
the intercourse of nations was , in those days , mainly carried on over the waters of the mediterranean sea ; and in times of peace , almost the only mode of communication was by the ships and the caravans of the merchants who traded from country to country , both by sea and on the land .
in fact , the knowledge which one country possessed of the geography and the manners and customs of another , was almost wholly confined to the reports which these merchants circulated .
when military expeditions invaded a territory , the commanders , or the writers who accompanied them , often wrote descriptions of the scenes which they witnessed in their campaigns , and described briefly the countries through which they passed .
these cases were , however , comparatively rare ; and yet , when they occurred , they furnished accounts better authenticated , and more to be relied upon , and expressed , moreover , in a more systematic and regular form , than the reports of the merchants , though the information which was derived from both these sources combined was very insufficient , and tended to excite more curiosity than it gratified .
herodotus , therefore , conceived that , in thoroughly exploring the countries on the shores of the mediterranean and in the interior of <name> , examining their geographical position , inquiring into their history , their institutions , their manners , customs , and laws , and writing the results for the entertainment and instruction of his countrymen , he had an ample field before him for the exercise of all his powers .
he went first to egypt .
egypt had been until that time , closely shut up from the rest of mankind by the jealousy and watchfulness of the government .
but now , on account of some recent political changes , which <name> be hereafter more particularly alluded to , the way was opened for travelers from other countries to come in .
herodotus was the first to avail himself of this opportunity .
he spent some time in the country , and made himself minutely acquainted with its history , its antiquities , its political and social condition at the time of his visit , and with all the other points in respect to which he supposed that his countrymen would wish to be informed .
he took copious notes of all that he saw .
from egypt he went westward into <unk> , and thence he traveled slowly along the whole southern shore of the mediterranean sea as far as to the straits of gibraltar , noting , with great care , every thing which presented itself to his own personal observation , and <unk> himself of every possible source of information in respect to all other points of importance for the object which he had in view .
the straits of gibraltar were the ends of the earth toward the westward in those ancient days , and our traveler accordingly , after reaching them , returned again to the eastward .
he visited tyre , and the cities of <unk> , on the eastern coast of the mediterranean sea , and thence went still farther eastward to <unk> and babylon .
it was here that he obtained the materials for what he has written in respect to the medes and persians , and to the history of <name> .
after spending some time in these countries , he went on by land still further to the eastward , into the heart of <name> .
the country of <unk> was considered as at " the end of the earth " in this direction .
herodotus penetrated for some distance into the almost trackless wilds of this remote land , until he found that he had gone as far from the great center of light and power on the shores of the Ã¦gean sea as he could expect the curiosity of his countrymen to follow him .
he passed thence round toward the north , and came down through the countries north of the danube into greece , by way of the epirus and macedon .
to make such a journey as this was , in fact , in those days , almost to explore the whole known world .
it ought , however , here to be stated , that many modern scholars , who have examined , with great care , the accounts which herodotus has given of what he saw and heard in his wanderings , doubt very seriously whether his journeys were really as extended as he pretends .
as his object was to read what he was intending to write at great public assemblies in greece , he was , of course , under every possible inducement to make his narrative as interesting as possible , and not to <unk> at all from whatever there might be extraordinary either in the extent of his wanderings or in the <unk> of the objects and scenes which he saw , or in the romantic nature of the adventures which he met with in his protracted tour .
cicero , in <unk> him as a writer , says that he was the first who evinced the power to adorn a historical narrative .
between adorning and <unk> , the line is not to be very distinctly marked ; and herodotus has often been accused of having drawn more from his fancy than from any other source , in respect to a large portion of what he relates and describes .
some do not believe that he ever even entered half the countries which he professes to have thoroughly explored , while others find , in the minuteness of his specifications , something like conclusive proof that he related only what he actually saw .
in a word , the question of his <unk> has been discussed by successive generations of scholars ever since his day , and strong parties have been formed who have gone to extremes in the opinions they have taken ; so that , while some confer upon him the title of the father of history , others say it would be more in accordance with his merits to call him the father of lies .
in controversies like this , and , in fact , in all controversies , it is more agreeable to the mass of mankind to take sides strongly with one party or the other , and either to believe or disbelieve one or the other fully and cordially .
there is a class of minds , however , more calm and better balanced than the rest , who can deny themselves this pleasure , and who see that often , in the most bitter and decided controversies , the truth lies between .
by this class of minds it has been generally supposed that the narratives of herodotus are substantially true , though in many cases highly colored and embellished , or , as cicero called it , adorned , as , in fact , they inevitably must have been under the circumstances in which they were written .
we can not follow minutely the circumstances of the subsequent life of herodotus .
he became involved in some political disturbances and difficulties in his native state after his return , in consequence of which he retired , partly a fugitive and partly an exile , to the island of samos , which is at a little distance from <unk> , and not far from the shore .
here he lived for some time in seclusion , occupied in writing out his history .
he divided it into nine books , to which , respectively , the names of the nine muses were afterward given , to designate them .
the island of samos , where this great literary work was performed , is very near to <unk> , where , a few hundred years later , the <unk> <name> , in a similar retirement , and in the use of the same language and character , wrote the book of revelation .
when a few of the first books of his history were completed , herodotus went with the manuscript to <name> , at the great celebration of the <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> were periods recurring at intervals of about four years .
by means of them the greeks reckoned their time .
the <unk> were celebrated as they occurred , with games , shows , spectacles , and parades , which were conducted on so magnificent a scale that vast crowds were accustomed to assemble from every part of greece to witness and join in them .
they were held at <name> , a city on the western side of greece .
nothing now remains to <name> the spot but some acres of confused and unintelligible ruins .
the personal fame of herodotus and of his travels had preceded him , and when he arrived at <name> he found the curiosity and eagerness of the people to listen to his narratives extreme .
he read copious extracts from his accounts , so far as he had written them , to the vast assemblies which convened to hear him , and they were received with unbounded applause ; and inasmuch as these assemblies comprised nearly all the statesmen , the generals , the philosophers , and the scholars of greece , applause expressed by them became at once universal renown .
herodotus was greatly gratified at the interest which his countrymen took in his narratives , and he determined thenceforth to devote his time <unk> to the continuation and completion of his work .
it was twelve years , however , before his plan was finally accomplished .
he then repaired to athens , at the time of a grand festive celebration which was held in that city , and there he appeared in public again , and read extended portions of the additional books that he had written .
the admiration and applause which his work now elicited was even greater than before .
in deciding upon the passages to be read , herodotus selected such as would be most likely to excite the interest of his grecian hearers , and many of them were glowing accounts of grecian exploits in former wars which had been waged in the countries which he had visited .
to expect that , under such circumstances , herodotus should have made his history wholly impartial , would be to suppose the historian not human .
the athenians were greatly pleased with the narratives which herodotus thus read to them of their own and of their ancestors ' exploits .
they considered him a national benefactor for having made such a record of their deeds , and , in addition to the unbounded applause which they bestowed upon him , they made him a public <name> of a large sum of money .
during the remainder of his life herodotus continued to enjoy the high degree of literary renown which his writings had acquired for him  a renown which has since been extended and increased , rather than diminished , by the lapse of time .
as for xenophon , the other great historian of <name> , it has already been said that he was a military commander , and his life was accordingly spent in a very different manner from that of his great competitor for historic fame .
he was born at athens , about thirty years after the birth of herodotus , so that he was but a child while herodotus was in the midst of his career .
when he was about twenty-two years of age , he joined a celebrated military expedition which was formed in greece , for the purpose of proceeding to <name> minor to enter into the service of the governor of that country .
the name of this governor was <name> ; and to distinguish him from <name> the great , whose history is to form the subject of this volume , and who lived about one hundred and fifty years before him , he is commonly called <name> the younger .
this expedition was headed by a grecian general named <unk> .
the soldiers and the subordinate officers of the expedition did not know for what special service it was designed , as <name> had a treasonable and guilty object in view , and he kept it accordingly concealed , even from the agents who were to aid him in the execution of it .
his plan was to make war upon and <unk> his brother <unk> , then king of persia , and consequently his sovereign .
<name> was a very young man , but he was a man of a very energetic and accomplished character , and of unbounded ambition .
when his father died , it was arranged that <unk> , the older son , should succeed him .
<name> was extremely unwilling to submit to this supremacy of his brother .
his mother was an artful and unprincipled woman , and <name> , being the youngest of her children , was her favorite .
she encouraged him in his ambitious designs ; and so desperate was <name> himself in his determination to accomplish them , that it is said he attempted to assassinate his brother on the day of his coronation .
his attempt was discovered , and it failed .
his brother , however , instead of punishing him for the treason , had the generosity to pardon him , and sent him to his government in <name> minor .
<name> immediately turned all his thoughts to the plan of raising an army and making war upon his brother , in order to gain forcible possession of his throne .
that he might have a plausible pretext for making the necessary military preparations , he pretended to have a quarrel with one of his neighbors , and wrote , <unk> , many letters to the king , affecting solicitude for his safety , and asking aid .
the king was thus deceived , and made no preparations to resist the force which <name> was assembling , not having the remotest suspicion that its <name> was babylon .
the auxiliary army which came from greece to enter into <unk> service under these circumstances , consisted of about thirteen thousand men .
he had , it was said , a hundred thousand men besides ; but so celebrated were the greeks in those days for their courage , their discipline , their powers of endurance , and their indomitable tenacity and energy , that <name> very properly considered this corps as the flower of his army .
xenophon was one of the younger grecian generals .
the army crossed the hellespont , and entered <name> minor , and , passing across the country , reached at last the famous pass of <unk> , in the southwestern part of the country  a narrow defile between the mountains and the sea , which opens the only passage in that quarter toward the persian regions beyond .
here the suspicions which the greeks had been for some time inclined to feel , that they were going to make war upon the persian monarch himself , were confirmed , and they refused to proceed .
their unwillingness , however , did not arise from any <unk> of conscience about the guilt of treason , or the wickedness of helping an ungrateful and unprincipled wretch , whose forfeited life had once been given to him by his brother , in making war upon and destroying his benefactor .
soldiers have never , in any age of the world , any thing to do with <unk> of conscience in respect to the work which their commanders give them to perform .
the greeks were perfectly willing to serve in this or in any other undertaking ; but , since it was rebellion and treason that was asked of them , they considered it as specially hazardous , and so they concluded that they were entitled to extra pay .
<name> made no objection to this demand ; an arrangement was made accordingly , and the army went on .
<unk> assembled suddenly the whole force of his empire on the plains of babylon  an immense army , consisting , it is said , of over a million of men .
such vast forces occupy , necessarily , a wide extent of country , even when drawn up in battle array .
so great , in fact , was the extent occupied in this case , that the greeks , who conquered all that part of the king 's forces which was directly opposed to them , supposed , when night came , at the close of the day of battle , that <name> had been every where victorious ; and they were only <unk> when , the next day , messengers came from the persian camp to inform them that <name> 's whole force , excepting themselves , was defeated and dispersed , and that <name> himself was slain , and to summon them to surrender at once and unconditionally to the conquerors .
the greeks refused to surrender .
they formed themselves immediately into a compact and solid body , fortified themselves as well as they could in their position , and prepared for a desperate defense .
there were about ten thousand of them left , and the persians seem to have considered them too formidable to be attacked .
the persians entered into negotiations with them , offering them certain terms on which they would be allowed to return peaceably into greece .
these negotiations were protracted from day to day for two or three weeks , the persians treacherously using toward them a friendly tone , and evincing a disposition to treat them in a liberal and generous manner .
this threw the greeks off their guard , and finally the persians contrived to get <unk> and the leading greek generals into their power at a feast , and then they seized and murdered them , or , as they would perhaps term it , executed them as rebels and traitors .
when this was reported in the grecian camp , the whole army was thrown at first into the utmost consternation .
they found themselves two thousand miles from home , in the heart of a hostile country , with an enemy nearly a hundred times their own number close upon them , while they themselves were without provisions , without horses , without money ; and there were deep rivers , and rugged mountains , and every other possible physical obstacle to be surmounted , before they could reach their own frontiers .
if they surrendered to their enemies , a hopeless and most miserable slavery was their inevitable doom .
under these circumstances , xenophon , according to his own story , called together the surviving officers in the camp , urged them not to despair , and recommended that immediate measures should be taken for commencing a march toward greece .
he proposed that they should elect commanders to take the places of those who had been killed , and that , under their new organization , they should immediately set out on their return .
these plans were adopted .
he himself was chosen as the commanding general , and under his guidance the whole force was conducted safely through the countless difficulties and dangers which beset their way , though they had to defend themselves , at every step of their progress , from an enemy so vastly more numerous than they , and which was hanging on their flanks and on their rear , and making the most incessant efforts to surround and capture them .
this retreat occupied two hundred and fifteen days .
it has always been considered as one of the greatest military achievements that has ever been performed .
it is called in history the retreat of the ten thousand .
xenophon acquired by it a double immortality .
he led the army , and thus attained to a military renown which <name> never fade ; and he afterward wrote a narrative of the exploit , which has given him an equally extended and permanent literary fame .
some time after this , xenophon returned again to <name> as a military commander , and distinguished himself in other campaigns .
he acquired a large fortune , too , in these wars , and at length retired to a villa , which he built and adorned magnificently , in the neighborhood of <name> , where herodotus had acquired so extended a fame by reading his histories .
it was probably , in some degree , through the influence of the success which had attended the labors of herodotus in this field , that xenophon was induced to enter it .
he devoted the later years of his life to writing various historical memoirs , the two most important of which that have come down to modern times are , first , the narrative of his own expedition , under <name> the younger , and , secondly , a sort of romance or tale founded on the history of <name> the great .
this last is called the <unk> ; and it is from this work , and from the history written by herodotus , that nearly all our knowledge of the great persian monarch is derived .
the question how far the stories which herodotus and xenophon have told us in relating the history of the great persian king are true , is of less importance than one would at first imagine ; for the case is one of those numerous instances in which the narrative itself , which genius has written , has had far greater influence on mankind than the events themselves exerted which the narrative professes to record .
it is now far more important for us to know what the story is which has for eighteen hundred years been read and listened to by every generation of men , than what the actual events were in which the tale thus told had its origin .
this consideration applies very extensively to history , and especially to ancient history .
the events themselves have long since ceased to be of any great interest or importance to readers of the present day ; but the accounts , whether they are fictitious or real , partial or impartial , honestly true or embellished and colored , since they have been so widely circulated in every age and in every nation , and have impressed themselves so universally and so permanently in the mind and memory of the whole human race , and have penetrated into and colored the literature of every civilized people , it becomes now necessary that every well-informed man should understand .
in a word , the real <name> is now a far less important personage to mankind than the <name> of herodotus and xenophon , and it is , accordingly , their story which the author proposes to relate in this volume .
the reader <name> understand , therefore , that the end and aim of the work is not to guarantee an exact and certain account of <name> as he actually lived and acted , but only to give a true and faithful summary of the story which for the last two thousand years has been in circulation respecting him among mankind .

there are records coming down to us from the very earliest times of three several kingdoms situated in the heart of <unk> , media , and persia , the two latter of which , at the period when they first emerge indistinctly into view , were more or less connected with and dependent upon the former .
astyages was the king of media ; cambyses was the name of the ruling <name> or magistrate of persia .
cambyses married mandane , the daughter of astyages , and <name> was their son .
in <unk> the circumstances of his birth , herodotus relates , with all seriousness , the following very extraordinary story : while mandane was a maiden , living at her father 's palace and home in media , astyages awoke one morning terrified by a dream .
he had dreamed of a great inundation , which overwhelmed and destroyed his capital , and submerged a large part of his kingdom .
the great rivers of that country were liable to very destructive floods , and there would have been nothing extraordinary or alarming in the king 's imagination being haunted , during his sleep , by the image of such a calamity , were it not that , in this case , the deluge of water which produced such disastrous results seemed to be , in some mysterious way , connected with his daughter , so that the dream appeared to portend some great calamity which was to originate in her .
he thought it perhaps indicated that after her marriage she should have a son who would rebel against him and seize the supreme power , thus overwhelming his kingdom as the inundation had done which he had seen in his dream .
to guard against this imagined danger , astyages determined that his daughter should not be married in media , but that she should be provided with a husband in some foreign land , so as to be taken away from media altogether .
he finally selected cambyses , the king of persia , for her husband .
persia was at that time a comparatively small and circumscribed dominion , and cambyses , though he seems to have been the supreme ruler of it , was very far beneath astyages in rank and power .
the distance between the two countries was considerable , and the institutions and customs of the people of persia were simple and rude , little likely to awaken or encourage in the minds of their princes any treasonable or ambitious designs .
astyages thought , therefore , that in sending mandane there to be the wife of the king , he had taken effectual precautions to guard against the danger portended by his dream .
mandane was accordingly married , and conducted by her husband to her new home .
about a year afterward her father had another dream .
he dreamed that a vine proceeded from his daughter , and , growing rapidly and luxuriantly while he was regarding it , extended itself over the whole land .
now the vine being a symbol of <unk> and plenty , astyages might have considered this vision as an omen of good ; still , as it was good which was to be derived in some way from his daughter , it naturally awakened his fears anew that he was doomed to find a rival and competitor for the possession of his kingdom in <unk> son and heir .
he called together his soothsayers , related his dream to them , and asked for their interpretation .
they decided that it meant that mandane would have a son who would one day become a king .
astyages was now seriously alarmed , and he sent for mandane to come home , ostensibly because he wished her to pay a visit to her father and to her native land , but really for the purpose of having her in his power , that he might destroy her child so soon as one should be born .
mandane came to media , and was established by her father in a residence near his palace , and such officers and domestics were put in charge of her household as astyages could rely upon to do whatever he should command .
things being thus arranged , a few months passed away , and then mandane 's child was born .
immediately on hearing of the event , astyages sent for a certain officer of his court , an unscrupulous and hardened man , who possessed , as he supposed , enough of depraved and reckless resolution for the commission of any crime , and addressed him as follows : " i have sent for you , harpagus , to commit to your charge a business of very great importance .
i confide fully in your principles of obedience and fidelity , and depend upon your doing , yourself , with your own hands , the work that i require .
if you fail to do it , or if you attempt to evade it by putting it off upon others , you <name> suffer severely .
i wish you to take mandane 's child to your own house and put him to death .
you may accomplish the object in any mode you please , and you may arrange the circumstances of the burial of the body , or the disposal of it in any other way , as you think best ; the essential thing is , that you see to it , yourself , that the child is killed . "
harpagus replied that whatever the king might command it was his duty to do , and that , as his master had never hitherto had occasion to censure his conduct , he should not find him wanting now .
harpagus then went to receive the infant .
the attendants of mandane had been ordered to deliver it to him .
not at all suspecting the object for which the child was thus taken away , but naturally supposing , on the other hand , that it was for the purpose of some visit , they arrayed their unconscious charge in the most <unk> and costly of the robes which mandane , his mother , had for many months been interested in preparing for him , and then gave him up to the custody of harpagus , expecting , doubtless , that he would be very speedily returned to their care .
although harpagus had expressed a ready willingness to obey the cruel <unk> of the king at the time of receiving it , he manifested , as soon as he received the child , an extreme degree of anxiety and distress .
he immediately sent for a herdsman named <unk> to come to him .
in the mean time , he took the child home to his house , and in a very excited and agitated manner related to his wife what had passed .
he laid the child down in the apartment , leaving it neglected and alone , while he conversed with his wife in a harried and anxious manner in respect to the dreadful situation in which he found himself placed .
she asked him what he intended to do .
he replied that he certainly should not , himself , destroy the child .
" it is the son of mandane , " said he .
" she is the king 's daughter .
if the king should die , mandane would succeed him , and then what terrible danger would <unk> over me if she should know me to have been the slayer of her son ! "
harpagus said , moreover , that he did not dare absolutely to disobey the orders of the king so far as to save the child 's life , and that he had sent for a herdsman , whose pastures extended to wild and desolate forests and mountains  the gloomy haunts of wild beasts and birds of prey  intending to give the child to him , with orders to <name> it into those solitudes and abandon it there .
his name was <unk> .
while they were speaking this herdsman came in .
he found harpagus and his wife talking thus together , with countenances expressive of anxiety and distress , while the child , uneasy under the confinement and inconveniences of its splendid dress , and terrified at the strangeness of the scene and the circumstances around it , and perhaps , moreover , experiencing some dawning and embryo emotions of resentment at being laid down in neglect , cried aloud and incessantly .
harpagus gave the astonished herdsman his charge .
he , afraid , as harpagus had been in the presence of astyages , to evince any hesitation in respect to obeying the orders of his superior , whatever they might be , took up the child and bore it away .
he carried it to his hut .
it so happened that his wife , whose name was <unk> , had at that very time a new-born child , but it was dead .
her dead son had , in fact , been born during the absence of <unk> .
he had been extremely unwilling to leave his home at such a time , but the summons of harpagus must , he knew , be obeyed .
his wife , too , not knowing what could have occasioned so sudden and urgent a call , had to bear , all the day , a burden of anxiety and solicitude in respect to her husband , in addition to her disappointment and grief at the loss of her child .
her anxiety and grief were changed for a little time into astonishment and curiosity at seeing the beautiful babe , so magnificently dressed , which her husband brought to her , and at hearing his extraordinary story .
he said that when he first entered the house of harpagus and saw the child lying there , and heard the directions which harpagus gave him to <name> it into the mountains and leave it to die , he supposed that the babe belonged to some of the domestics of the household , and that harpagus wished to have it destroyed in order to be relieved of a burden .
the richness , however , of the infant 's dress , and the deep anxiety and sorrow which was indicated by the countenances and by the conversation of harpagus and his wife , and which seemed altogether too <name> to be excited by the concern which they would probably feel for any servant 's offspring , appeared at the time , he said , inconsistent with that supposition , and perplexed and bewildered him .
he said , moreover , that in the end , harpagus had sent a man with him a part of the way when he left the house , and that this man had given him a full explanation of the case .
the child was the son of mandane , the daughter of the king , and he was to be destroyed by the orders of astyages himself , for fear that at some future period he might attempt to usurp the throne .
they who know any thing of the feelings of a mother under the circumstances in which <unk> was placed , can imagine with what emotions she received the little sufferer , now nearly exhausted by <unk> , fatigue , and fear , from her husband 's hands , and the <unk> pleasure with which she <name> him to her bosom , to comfort and relieve him .
in an hour she was , as it were , herself his mother , and she began to plead hard with her husband for his life .
<unk> said that the child could not possibly be saved .
harpagus had been most <name> and positive in his orders , and he was coming himself to see that they had been executed .
he would demand , undoubtedly , to see the body of the child , to assure himself that it was actually dead .
<unk> , instead of being convinced by her husband's reasoning , only became more and more <name> in her desires that the child might be saved .
she rose from her couch and clasped her husband 's knees , and begged him with the most <name> entreaties and with many tears to <name> her request .
her husband was , however , inexorable .
he said that if he were to yield , and attempt to save the child from its doom , harpagus would most certainly know that his orders had been disobeyed , and then their own lives would be forfeited , and the child itself sacrificed after all , in the end .
the thought then occurred to <unk> that her own dead child might be substituted for the living one , and be exposed in the mountains in its stead .
she proposed this plan , and , after much anxious doubt and hesitation , the herdsman consented to adopt it .
they took off the splendid robes which adorned the living child , and put them on the corpse , each equally unconscious of the change .
the little limbs of the son of mandane were then more simply clothed in the coarse and scanty covering which belonged to the new character which he was now to assume , and then the babe was restored to its place in <unk> bosom .
<unk> placed his own dead child , completely disguised as it was by the <name> robes it wore , in the little basket or cradle in which the other had been brought , and , accompanied by an attendant , whom he was to leave in the forest to keep watch over the body , he went away to seek some wild and desolate solitude in which to leave it exposed .
[ illustration : the exposure of the infant . ]
three days passed away , during which the attendant whom the herdsman had left in the forest watched near the body to prevent its being devoured by wild beasts or birds of prey , and at the end of that time he brought it home .
the herdsman then went to harpagus to inform him that the child was dead , and , in proof that it was really so , he said that if harpagus would come to his hut he could see the body .
harpagus sent some messenger in whom he could confide to make the observation .
the herdsman exhibited the dead child to him , and he was satisfied .
he reported the result of his mission to harpagus , and harpagus then ordered the body to be buried .
the child of mandane , whom we may call <name> , since that was the name which he subsequently received , was brought up in the herdsman 's hut , and passed every where for <unk> child .
harpagus , after receiving the report of his messenger , then informed astyages that his orders had been executed , and that the child was dead .
a trusty messenger , he said , whom he had sent for the purpose , had seen the body .
although the king had been so <name> to have the deed performed , he found that , after all , the knowledge that his orders had been obeyed gave him very little satisfaction .
the fears , prompted by his selfishness and ambition , which had led him to commit the crime , gave place , when it had been perpetrated , to remorse for his unnatural cruelty .
mandane mourned incessantly the death of her innocent babe , and loaded her father with reproaches for having destroyed it , which he found it very hard to bear .
in the end , he repented bitterly of what he had done .
the secret of the child 's preservation remained concealed for about ten years .
it was then discovered in the following manner : <name> , like <name> , cÃ¦sar , <name> the conqueror , <name> , and other commanding minds , who obtained a great ascendancy over masses of men in their <unk> years , evinced his dawning superiority at a very early period of his boyhood .
he took the lead of his playmates in their sports , and made them submit to his regulations and decisions .
not only did the peasants ' boys in the little hamlet where his reputed father lived thus yield the precedence to him , but sometimes , when the sons of men of rank and station came out from the city to join them in their plays , even then <name> was the acknowledged head .
one day the son of an officer of king astyages 's court  his father 's name was <unk>  came out , with other boys from the city , to join these village boys in their sports .
they were playing king .
<name> was the king .
herodotus says that the other boys chose him as such .
it was , however , probably such a sort of choice as that by which kings and emperors are made among men , a yielding more or less voluntary on the part of the subjects to the resolute and determined energy with which the <unk> places himself upon the throne .
during the progress of the play , a quarrel arose between <name> and the son of <unk> .
the latter would not obey , and <name> beat him .
he went home and complained bitterly to his father .
the father went to astyages to protest against such an indignity offered to his son by a peasant boy , and demanded that the little tyrant should be punished .
probably far the larger portion of intelligent readers of history consider the whole story as a romance ; but if we look upon it as in any respect true , we must conclude that the median monarchy must have been , at that time , in a very rude and simple condition indeed , to allow of the submission of such a question as this to the personal <unk> of the reigning king .
however this may be , herodotus states that <unk> went to the palace of astyages , taking his son with him , to offer proofs of the violence of which the herdsman 's son had been guilty , by showing the <unk> and bruises that had been produced by the blows .
" is this the treatment , " he asked , indignantly , of the king , when he had completed his statement , " that my boy is to receive from the son of one of your slaves ? "
astyages seemed to be convinced that <unk> had just cause to complain , and he sent for <unk> and his son to come to him in the city .
when they arrived , <name> advanced into the presence of the king with that courageous and manly bearing which romance writers are so fond of <unk> to boys of <name> birth , whatever may have been the circumstances of their early training .
astyages was much struck with his appearance and air .
he , however , sternly laid to his charge the accusation which <unk> had brought against him .
pointing to <unk> 's son , all bruised and swollen as he was , he asked , " is that the way that you , a mere herdsman 's boy , dare to treat the son of one of my nobles ? "
the little <name> looked up into his stern judge 's face with an undaunted expression of countenance , which , considering the circumstances of the case , and the smallness of the scale on which this embryo heroism was represented , was partly ludicrous and partly sublime .
" my lord , " said he , " what i have done i am able to justify .
i did punish this boy , and i had a right to do so .
i was king , and he was my subject , and he would not obey me .
if you think that for this i deserve punishment myself , here i am ; i am ready to suffer it . "
if astyages had been struck with the appearance and manner of <name> at the commencement of the interview , his admiration was awakened far more strongly now , at hearing such words , uttered , too , in so exalted a tone , from such a child .
he remained a long time silent .
at last he told <unk> and his son that they might retire .
he would take the affair , he said , into his own hands , and dispose of it in a just and proper manner .
astyages then took the herdsman aside , and asked him , in an <name> tone , whose boy that was , and where he had obtained him .
<unk> was terrified .
he replied , however , that the boy was his own son , and that his mother was still living at home , in the hut where they all resided .
there seems to have been something , however , in his appearance and manner , while making these assertions , which led astyages not to believe what he said .
he was convinced that there was some unexplained mystery in respect to the origin of the boy , which the herdsman was <unk> withholding .
he assumed a displeased and threatening air , and ordered in his guards to take <unk> into custody .
the terrified herdsman then said that he would explain all , and he accordingly related honestly the whole story .
astyages was greatly rejoiced to find that the child was alive .
one would suppose it to be almost inconsistent with this feeling that he should be angry with harpagus for not having destroyed it .
it would seem , in fact , that harpagus was not amenable to serious censure , in any view of the subject , for he had taken what he had a right to consider very effectual measures for carrying the orders of the king into faithful execution .
but astyages seems to have been one of those inhuman monsters which the possession and long-continued exercise of despotic power have so often made , who take a calm , quiet , and deliberate satisfaction in torturing to death any wretched victim whom they can have any pretext for destroying , especially if they can invent some new means of torment to give a fresh <unk> to their pleasure .
these monsters do not act from passion .
men are sometimes inclined to <unk> great cruelties and crimes which are perpetrated under the influence of sudden anger , or from the terrible impulse of those impetuous and uncontrollable emotions of the human soul which , when once excited , seem to make men insane ; but the crimes of a tyrant are not of this kind .
they are the calm , deliberate , and sometimes carefully <unk> <unk> of a nature essentially <unk> .
when , therefore , astyages learned that harpagus had failed of literally obeying his command to destroy , with his own hand , the infant which had been given him , although he was pleased with the consequences which had resulted from it , he immediately perceived that there was another pleasure besides that he was to derive from the transaction , namely , that of gratifying his own imperious and ungovernable <name> by taking vengeance on him who had failed , even in so slight a degree , of fulfilling its dictates .
in a word , he was glad that the child was saved , but he did not consider that that was any reason why he should not have the pleasure of punishing the man who saved him .
thus , far from being transported by any sudden and violent feeling of resentment to an inconsiderate act of revenge , astyages began , calmly and coolly , and with a deliberate malignity more worthy of a demon than of a man , to consider how he could best accomplish the purpose he had in view .
when , at length , his plan was formed , he sent for harpagus to come to him .
harpagus came .
the king began the conversation by asking harpagus what method he had employed for destroying the child of mandane , which he , the king , had delivered to him some years before .
harpagus replied by stating the exact truth .
he said that , as soon as he had received the infant , he began immediately to consider by what means he could effect its destruction without involving himself in the guilt of murder ; that , finally , he had determined upon employing the herdsman <unk> to expose it in the forest till it should perish of hunger and cold ; and , in order to be sure that the king 's <unk> was fully obeyed , he charged the herdsman , he said , to keep strict watch near the child till it was dead , and then to bring home the body .
he had then sent a confidential messenger from his own household to see the body and provide for its interment .
he solemnly assured the king , in conclusion , that this was the real truth , and that the child was actually destroyed in the manner he had described .
the king then , with an appearance of great satisfaction and pleasure , informed harpagus that the child had not been destroyed after all , and he related to him the circumstances of its having been exchanged for the dead child of <unk> , and brought up in the herdsman 's hut .
he informed him , too , of the singular manner in which the fact that the infant had been preserved , and was still alive , had been discovered .
he told harpagus , moreover , that he was greatly rejoiced at this discovery .
" after he was dead , as i supposed , " said he , " i bitterly repented of having given orders to destroy him .
i could not bear my daughter 's grief , or the reproaches which she incessantly uttered against me .
but the child is alive , and all is well ; and i am going to give a grand entertainment as a festival of rejoicing on the occasion . "
astyages then requested harpagus to send his son , who was about thirteen years of age , to the palace , to be a companion to <name> , and , inviting him very specially to come to the entertainment , he dismissed him with many marks of attention and honor .
harpagus went home , trembling at the thought of the imminent danger which he had incurred , and of the narrow escape by which he had been saved from it .
he called his son , directed him to prepare himself to go to the king , and dismissed him with many charges in respect to his behavior , both toward the king and toward <name> .
he related to his wife the conversation which had taken place between himself and astyages , and she rejoiced with him in the apparently happy issue of an affair which might well have been expected to have been their ruin .
the sequel of the story is too horrible to be told , and yet too essential to a right understanding of the influences and effects produced on human nature by the possession and exercise of despotic and irresponsible power to be omitted .
harpagus came to the festival .
it was a grand entertainment .
harpagus was placed in a conspicuous position at the table .
a great variety of dishes were brought in and set before the different guests , and were eaten without question .
toward the close of the feast , astyages asked harpagus what he thought of his fare .
harpagus , half terrified with some mysterious presentiment of danger , expressed himself well pleased with it .
astyages then told him there was plenty more of the same kind , and ordered the attendants to bring the basket in .
they came accordingly , and uncovered a basket before the wretched guest , which contained , as he saw when he looked into it , the head , and hands , and feet of his son .
astyages asked him to help himself to whatever part he liked !
the most astonishing part of the story is yet to be told .
it relates to the action of harpagus in such an emergency .
he looked as composed and placid as if nothing unusual had occurred .
the king asked him if he knew what he had been eating .
he said that he did ; and that whatever was agreeable to the <name> of the king was always pleasing to him ! !
it is hard to say whether despotic power exerts its worst and most <unk> influences on those who wield it , or on those who have it to bear ; on its masters , or on its slaves .
after the first feelings of pleasure which astyages experienced in being relieved from the sense of guilt which oppressed his mind so long as he supposed that his orders for the murder of his infant grandchild had been obeyed , his former uneasiness lest the child should in future years become his rival and competitor for the possession of the median throne , which had been the motive originally <unk> him to the commission of the crime , returned in some measure again , and he began to consider whether it was not incumbent on him to take some measures to guard against such a result .
the end of his deliberations was , that he concluded to send for the magi , or soothsayers , as he had done in the case of his dream , and obtain their judgment on the affair in the new aspect which it had now assumed .
when the magi had heard the king 's narrative of the circumstances under which the discovery of the child 's preservation had been made , through complaints which had been preferred against him on account of the manner in which he had exercised the prerogatives of a king among his playmates , they decided at once that astyages had no cause for any further apprehensions in respect to the dreams which had disturbed him previous to his grandchild 's birth .
" he has been a king , " they said , " and the danger is over .
it is true that he has been a monarch only in play , but that is enough to satisfy and fulfill the <unk> of the vision .
occurrences very slight and trifling in themselves are often found to accomplish what seemed of very serious magnitude and moment , as portended .
your grandchild has been a king , and he <name> never reign again .
you have , therefore , no further cause to fear , and may send him to his parents in persia with perfect safety . "
the king determined to adopt this advice .
he ordered the soothsayers , however , not to <unk> their <unk> and vigilance , and if any signs or omens should appear to indicate approaching danger , he charged them to give him immediate warning .
this they faithfully promised to do .
they felt , they said , a personal interest in doing it ; for <name> being a persian <name> , his accession to the median throne would involve the subjection of the medes to the persian dominion , a result which they wished in every account to avoid .
so , promising to watch <unk> for every indication of danger , they left the presence of the king .
the king then sent for <name> .
it seems that <name> , though astonished at the great and mysterious changes which had taken place in his condition , was still ignorant of his true history .
astyages now told him that he was to go into persia .
" you <name> rejoin there , " said he , " your true parents , who , you <name> find , are of very different rank in life from the herdsman whom you have lived with thus far .
you <name> make the journey under the charge and escort of persons that i have appointed for the purpose .
they <name> explain to you , on the way , the mystery in which your parentage and birth seems to you at present enveloped .
you <name> find that i was induced many years ago , by the influence of an untoward dream , to treat you injuriously .
but all has ended well , and you can now go in peace to your proper home . "
as soon as the preparations for the journey could be made , <name> set out , under the care of the party appointed to conduct him , and went to persia .
his parents were at first dumb with astonishment , and were then overwhelmed with gladness and <name> at seeing their <unk> and long-lost babe reappear , as if from the dead , in the form of this tall and handsome boy , with health , intelligence , and happiness beaming in his countenance .
they overwhelmed him with caresses , and the heart of mandane , especially , was filled with pride and pleasure .
as soon as <name> became somewhat settled in his new home , his parents began to make arrangements for giving him as complete an education as the means and opportunities of those days afforded .
xenophon , in his narrative of the early life of <name> , gives a minute , and , in some respects , quite an extraordinary account of the mode of life led in cambyses 's court .
the sons of all the nobles and officers of the court were educated together , within the precincts of the <name> palaces , or , rather , they spent their time together there , occupied in various pursuits and avocations , which were intended to train them for the duties of future life , though there was very little of what would be considered , in modern times , as education .
they were not generally taught to read , nor could they , in fact , since there were no books , have used that <name> if they had acquired it .
the only intellectual instruction which they seem to have received was what was called learning justice .
the boys had certain teachers , who explained to them , more or less formally , the general principles of right and wrong , the injunctions and <unk> of the laws , and the obligations resulting from them , and the rules by which controversies between man and man , arising in the various relations of life , should be settled .
the boys were also trained to apply these principles and rules to the cases which occurred among themselves , each acting as judge in turn , to discuss and decide the questions that arose from time to time , either from real transactions as they occurred , or from hypothetical cases invented to put their powers to the test .
to stimulate the exercise of their powers , they were rewarded when they decided right , and punished when they decided wrong .
<name> himself was punished on one occasion for a wrong decision , under the following circumstances : a bigger boy took away the coat of a smaller boy than himself , because it was larger than his own , and gave him his own smaller coat instead .
the smaller boy complained of the wrong , and the case was referred to <name> for his <unk> .
after hearing the case , <name> decided that each boy should keep the coat that fitted him .
the teacher condemned this as a very unjust decision .
" when you are called upon , " said he , " to consider a question of what fits best , then you should determine as you have done in this case ; but when you are appointed to decide whose each coat is , and to <unk> it to the proper owner , then you are to consider what constitutes right possession , and whether he who takes a thing by force from one who is weaker than himself , should have it , or whether he who made it or purchased it should be protected in his property .
you have decided against law , and in favor of violence and wrong . "
<name> 's sentence was thus condemned , and he was punished for not reasoning more soundly .
the boys at this persian court were trained to many manly exercises .
they were taught to wrestle and to run .
they were instructed in the use of such arms as were employed in those times , and rendered dexterous in the use of them by daily exercises .
they were taught to put their skill in practice , too , in hunting excursions , which they took , by turns , with the king , in the neighboring forest and mountains .
on these occasions , they were armed with a bow , and a quiver of arrows , a shield , a small sword or dagger which was worn at the side in a sort of scabbard , and two javelins .
one of these was intended to be thrown , the other to be retained in the hand , for use in close combat , in case the wild beast , in his desperation , should advance to a personal <unk> .
these hunting expeditions were considered extremely important as a part of the system of youthful training .
they were often long and fatiguing .
the young men became inured , by means of them , to toil , and privation , and exposure .
they had to make long marches , to encounter great dangers , to engage in desperate conflicts , and to submit sometimes to the inconveniences of hunger and thirst , as well as exposure to the extremes of heat and cold , and to the violence of storms .
all this was considered as precisely the right sort of discipline to make them good soldiers in their future martial campaigns .
<name> was not , himself , at this time , old enough to take a very active part in these severer services , as they belonged to a somewhat advanced stage of persian education , and he was yet not quite twelve years old .
he was a very beautiful boy , tall and graceful in form and his countenance was striking and expressive .
he was very <name> and open in his disposition and character , speaking honestly , and without fear , the sentiments of his heart , in any presence and on all occasions .
he was extremely kind hearted , and amiable , too , in his disposition , averse to saying or doing any thing which could give pain to those around him .
in fact , the <unk> and cordiality of his address and manners , and the unaffected <unk> and sincerity which characterized his disposition , made him a universal favorite .
his frankness , his childish simplicity , his vivacity , his personal <name> and beauty , and his generous and self-sacrificing spirit , rendered him the object of general admiration throughout the court , and filled mandane 's heart with maternal gladness and pride .

when <name> was about twelve years old , if the narrative which xenophon gives of his history is true , he was invited by his grandfather astyages to make a visit to media .
as he was about ten years of age , according to herodotus , when he was restored to his parents , he could have been residing only two years in persia when he received this invitation .
during this period , astyages had received , through mandane and others , very glowing descriptions of the intelligence and vivacity of the young <name> , and he naturally felt a <name> to see him once more .
in fact , <name> 's personal attractiveness and beauty , joined to a certain <name> and <name> generosity of spirit which he seems to have manifested in his earliest years , made him a universal favorite at home , and the reports of these qualities , and of the various sayings and doings on <name> 's part , by which his disposition and character were revealed , awakened strongly in the mind of astyages that kind of interest which a grandfather is always very prone to feel in a handsome and precocious grandchild .
as <name> had been sent to persia as soon as his true rank had been discovered , he had had no opportunities of seeing the splendor of <name> life in media , and the manners and habits of the persians were very plain and simple .
<name> was accordingly very much impressed with the magnificence of the scenes to which he was introduced when he arrived in media , and with the <unk> and luxuries , the pomp and display , and the spectacles and parades in which the median court abounded .
astyages himself took great pleasure in witnessing and increasing his little grandson 's admiration for these wonders .
it is one of the most extraordinary and beautiful of the provisions which god has made for securing the continuance of human happiness to the very end of life , that we can renew , through sympathy with children , the pleasures which , for ourselves alone , had long since , through repetition and <unk> , lost their charm .
the rides , the walks , the flowers gathered by the road-side , the rambles among pebbles on the beach , the songs , the games , and even the little picture-book of childish tales which have utterly and entirely lost their power to affect the mind even of middle life , directly and alone , regain their magic influence , and call up vividly all the old emotions , even to the heart of <unk> age , when it seeks these enjoyments in companionship and sympathy with children or grandchildren beloved .
by giving to us this capacity for renewing our own sensitiveness to the impressions of pleasure through sympathy with childhood , god has provided a true and effectual remedy for the <unk> and insensibility of age .
let any one who is in the decline of years , whose time passes but heavily away , and who supposes that nothing can awaken interest in his mind or give him pleasure , make the experiment of taking children to a ride or to a concert , or to see a menagerie or a museum , and he <name> find that there is a way by which he can again enjoy very highly the pleasures which he had supposed were for him forever exhausted and gone .
this was the result , at all events , in the case of astyages and <name> .
the monarch took a new pleasure in the luxuries and splendors which had long since lost their charm for him , in observing their influence and effect upon the mind of his little grandson .
<name> , as we have already said , was very <name> and open in his disposition , and spoke with the utmost freedom of every thing that he saw .
he was , of course , a privileged person , and could always say what the feeling of the moment and his own childish conceptions prompted , without danger .
he had , however , according to the account which xenophon gives , a great deal of good sense , as well as of <unk> and brilliancy ; so that , while his remarks , through their originality and point , attracted every one 's attention , there was a native politeness and sense of propriety which restrained him from saying any thing to give pain .
even when he disapproved of and condemned what he saw in the arrangements of his grandfather 's court or household , he did it in such a manner  so ingenuous , good-natured , and unassuming , that it amused all and offended none .
in fact , on the very first interview which astyages had with <name> , an instance of the boy 's readiness and tact occurred , which impressed his grandfather very much in his favor .
the persians , as has been already remarked , were accustomed to dress very plainly , while , on the other hand , at the median court the superior officers , and especially the king , were always very splendidly adorned .
accordingly , when <name> was introduced into his grandfather 's presence , he was quite dazzled with the display .
the king wore a purple robe , very richly adorned , with a belt and collars , which were embroidered highly , and set with precious stones .
he had bracelets , too , upon his wrists , of the most costly character .
he wore flowing locks of artificial hair , and his face was painted , after the median manner .
<name> gazed upon this <name> spectacle for a few moments in silence , and then exclaimed , " why , mother !
what a handsome man my grandfather is ! "
such an exclamation , of course , made great amusement both for the king himself and for the others who were present ; and at length mandane , somewhat <unk> , it must be confessed , asked <name> which of the two he thought the handsomest , his father or his grandfather .
<name> escaped from the danger of deciding such a formidable question by saying that his father was the handsomest man in persia , but his grandfather was the handsomest of all the medes he had ever seen .
astyages was even more pleased by this proof of his <unk> adroitness and good sense than he had been with the compliment which the boy had paid to him ; and thenceforward <name> became an established favorite , and did and said , in his grandfather 's presence , almost whatever he pleased .
when the first childish feelings of excitement and curiosity had subsided , <name> seemed to attach very little value to the fine clothes and <name> trappings with which his grandfather was disposed to adorn him , and to all the other external marks of parade and display , which were generally so much prized among the medes .
he was much more inclined to continue in his former habits of plain dress and frugal means than to imitate median ostentation and luxury .
there was one pleasure , however , to be found in media , which in persia he had never enjoyed , that he prized very highly .
that was the pleasure of learning to ride on horseback .
the persians , it seems , either because their country was a rough and mountainous region , or for some other cause , were very little accustomed to ride .
they had very few horses , and there were no bodies of cavalry in their armies .
the young men , therefore , were not trained to the <name> of horsemanship .
even in their hunting excursions they went always on foot , and were accustomed to make long marches through the forests and among the mountains in this manner , loaded heavily , too , all the time , with the burden of arms and provisions which they were obliged to <name> .
it was , therefore , a new pleasure to <name> to mount a horse .
horsemanship was a great <name> among the medes .
their horses were beautiful and fleet , and splendidly caparisoned .
astyages provided for <name> the best animals which could be procured , and the boy was very proud and happy in exercising himself in the new accomplishment which he thus had the opportunity to acquire .
to ride is always a great source of pleasure to boys ; but in that period of the world , when physical strength was so much more important and more highly valued than at present , horsemanship was a vastly greater source of gratification than it is now .
<name> felt that he had , at a single leap , <unk> his power , and thus risen at once to a far higher rank in the scale of being than he had occupied before ; for , as soon as he had once learned to be at home in the saddle , and to subject the spirit and the power of his horse to his own <name> , the courage , the strength , and the speed of the animal became , in fact , almost personal <unk> of his own .
he felt , accordingly , when he was galloping over the plains , or pursuing deer in the park , or running over the <unk> with his companions , as if it was some <unk> strength and speed of his own that he was exercising , and which , by some magic power , was attended by no <unk> exertion , and followed by no fatigue .
the various officers and servants in astyages 's household , as well as astyages himself , soon began to feel a strong interest in the young <name> .
each took a pleasure in explaining to him what pertained to their several departments , and in teaching him whatever he desired to learn .
the attendant highest in rank in such a household was the cup-bearer .
he had the charge of the tables and the wine , and all the general arrangements of the palace seem to have been under his direction .
the cup-bearer in astyages 's court was a sacian .
he was , however , less a friend to <name> than the rest .
there was nothing within the range of his official duties that he could teach the boy ; and <name> did not like his wine .
besides , when astyages was engaged , it was the cup-bearer 's duty to guard him from interruption , and at such times he often had occasion to restrain the young <name> from the <name> of entering his grandfather 's apartments as often as he pleased .
at one of the entertainments which astyages gave in his palace , <name> and mandane were invited ; and astyages , in order to gratify the young <name> as highly as possible , set before him a great variety of dishes  meats , and <unk> , and delicacies of every kind  all served in costly vessels , and with great parade and ceremony .
he supposed that <name> would have been <unk> with the luxury and splendor of the entertainment .
he did not , however , seem much pleased .
astyages asked him the reason , and whether the feast which he saw before him was not a much finer one than he had been accustomed to see in persia .
<name> said , in reply , that it seemed to him to be very troublesome to have to eat a little of so many separate things .
in persia they managed , he thought , a great deal better .
" and how do you manage in persia ? "
asked astyages .
" why , in persia , " replied <name> , " we have plain bread and meat , and eat it when we are hungry ; so we get health and strength , and have very little trouble . "
astyages laughed at this simplicity , and told <name> that he might , if he preferred it , live on plain bread and meat while he remained in media , and then he would return to persia in as good health as he came .
<name> was satisfied ; he , however , asked his grandfather if he would give him all those things which had been set before him , to dispose of as he thought proper ; and on his grandfather 's <unk> , he began to call the various attendants up to the table , and to distribute the costly dishes to them , in return , as he said , for their various kindnesses to him .
" this , " said he to one , " is for you , because you take pains to teach me to ride ; this , " to another , " for you , because you gave me a javelin ; this to you , because you serve my grandfather well and faithfully ; and this to you , because you honor my mother . "
thus he went on until he had distributed all that he had received , though he omitted , as it seemed <unk> , to give any thing to the sacian cup-bearer .
this sacian being an officer of high rank , of tall and handsome figure , and beautifully dressed , was the most conspicuous attendant at the feast , and could not , therefore , have been accidentally passed by .
astyages accordingly asked <name> why he had not given any thing to the sacian  the servant whom , as he said , he liked better than all the others .
" and what is the reason , " asked <name> , in reply , " that this sacian is such a favorite with you ? "
" have you not observed , " replied astyages , " how gracefully and elegantly he pours out the wine for me , and then hands me the cup ? "
the sacian was , in fact , uncommonly accomplished in respect to the personal <name> and dexterity for which <unk> in those days were most highly valued , and which constitute , in fact , so essential a part of the qualifications of a master of ceremonies at a <name> court in every age .
<name> , however , instead of yielding to this argument , said , in reply , that he could come into the room and pour out the wine as well as the sacian could do it , and he asked his grandfather to allow him to try .
astyages consented .
<name> then took the <unk> of wine , and went out .
in a moment he came in again , stepping grandly , as he entered , in mimicry of the sacian , and with a countenance of assumed gravity and <unk> , which imitated so well the air and manner of the cup-bearer as greatly to amuse the whole company assembled .
<name> advanced thus toward the king and presented him with the cup , imitating , with the <name> and dexterity natural to childhood , all the ceremonies which he had seen the cup-bearer himself perform , except that of tasting the wine .
the king and mandane laughed heartily .
<name> then , throwing off his assumed character , jumped up into his grandfather 's lap and kissed him , and turning to the cup-bearer , he said , " now , sacian , you are ruined .
i shall get my grandfather to appoint me in your place .
i can hand the wine as well as you , and without tasting it myself at all . "
" but why did you not taste it ? "
asked astyages ; " you should have performed that part of the duty as well as the rest . "
it was , in fact , a very essential part of the duty of a cup-bearer to taste the wine that he offered before presenting it to the king .
he did this , however , not by putting the cup to his lips , but by pouring out a little of it into the palm of his hand .
this custom was adopted by these ancient despots to guard against the danger of being poisoned ; for such a danger would of course be very much diminished by requiring the officer who had the custody of the wine , and without whose knowledge no foreign substance could well be introduced into it , always to drink a portion of it himself immediately before <unk> it to the king .
to astyages 's question why he had not tasted the wine , <name> replied that he was afraid it was poisoned .
" what led you to imagine that it was poisoned ? "
asked his grandfather .
" because , " said <name> , " it was poisoned the other day , when you made a feast for your friends , on your <unk> .
i knew by the effects .
it made you all crazy .
the things that you do not allow us boys to do , you did yourselves , for you were very rude and noisy ; you all bawled together , so that nobody could hear or understand what any other person said .
presently you went to singing in a very ridiculous manner , and when a singer ended his song , you applauded him , and declared that he had <name> admirably , though nobody had paid attention .
you went to telling stories , too , each one of his own accord , without succeeding in making any body listen to him .
finally , you got up and began to dance , but it was out of all rule and measure ; you could not even stand erect and steadily .
then , you all seemed to forget who and what you were .
the guests paid no regard to you as their king , but treated you in a very familiar and disrespectful manner , and you treated them in the same way ; so i thought that the wine that produced these effects must have been poisoned . "
of course , <name> did not seriously mean that he thought the wine had been actually poisoned .
he was old enough to understand its nature and effects .
he undoubtedly intended his reply as a playful satire upon the intemperate excesses of his grandfather 's court .
" but have not you ever seen such things before ? "
asked astyages .
" does not your father ever drink wine until it makes him <name> ? "
" no , " replied <name> , " indeed he does not .
he drinks only when he is thirsty , and then only enough for his thirst , and so he is not harmed . "
he then added , in a contemptuous tone , " he has no sacian cup-bearer , you may depend , about him . "
" what is the reason , my son , " here asked mandane , " why you dislike this sacian so much ? "
" why , every time that i want to come and see my grandfather , " replied <name> , " this <unk> man always stops me , and <name> not let me come in .
i wish , grandfather , you would let me have the rule over him just for three days . "
" why , what would you do to him ? "
asked astyages .
" i would treat him as he treats me now , " replied <name> .
" i would stand at the door , as he does when i want to come in , and when he was coming for his dinner , i would stop him and say , 'you can not come in now ; he is busy with some men . ' "
in saying this , <name> imitated , in a very ludicrous manner , the gravity and dignity of the sacian 's air and manner .
" then , " he continued , " when he came to supper , i would say , 'he is bathing now ; you must come some other time ; ' or else , 'he is going to sleep , and you <name> disturb him . '
so i would torment him all the time , as he now torments me , in keeping me out when i want to come and see you . "
such conversation as this , half playful , half <name> , of course amused astyages and mandane very much , as well as all the other listeners .
there is a certain charm in the simplicity and confiding frankness of childhood , when it is honest and sincere , which in <name> 's case was heightened by his personal <name> and beauty .
he became , in fact , more and more a favorite the longer he remained .
at length , the indulgence and the attentions which he received began to produce , in some degree , their usual injurious effects .
<name> became too talkative , and sometimes he appeared a little vain .
still , there was so much true kindness of heart , such consideration for the feelings of others , and so respectful a regard for his grandfather , his mother , and his uncle , [ a ] that his faults were overlooked , and he was the life and soul of the company in all the social gatherings which took place in the palaces of the king .
[ footnote a : the uncle here referred to was mandane 's brother .
his name was <unk> .
he was at this time a <name> <name> , the heir apparent to the throne .
he figures very conspicuously in the subsequent portions of xenophon 's history as astyages 's successor on the throne .
herodotus does not mention him at all , but makes <name> himself the direct successor of astyages . ]
at length the time arrived for mandane to return to persia .
astyages proposed that she should leave <name> in media , to be educated there under his grandfather 's charge .
mandane replied that she was willing to gratify her father in every thing , but she thought it would be very hard to leave <name> behind , unless he was willing , of his own accord , to stay .
astyages then proposed the subject to <name> himself .
" if you <name> stay , " said he , " the sacian shall no longer have power to keep you from coming in to see me ; you shall come whenever you choose .
then , besides , you shall have the use of all my horses , and of as many more as you please , and when you go home at last you shall take as many as you wish with you .
then you may have all the animals in the park to hunt .
you can pursue them on horseback , and shoot them with bows and arrows , or kill them with javelins , as men do with wild beasts in the woods .
i <name> provide boys of your own age to play with you , and to ride and hunt with you , and <name> have all sorts of arms made of suitable size for you to use ; and if there is any thing else that you should want at any time , you <name> only have to ask me for it , and i <name> immediately provide it . "
the pleasure of riding and of hunting in the park was very <unk> to <name> 's mind , and he consented to stay .
he represented to his mother that it would be of great advantage to him , on his final return to persia , to be a skillful and powerful horseman , as that would at once give him the superiority over all the persian youths , for they were very little accustomed to ride .
his mother had some fears lest , by too long a residence in the median court , her son should acquire the luxurious habits , and proud and haughty manners , which would be constantly before him in his grandfather 's example ; but <name> said that his grandfather , being imperious himself , required all around him to be submissive , and that mandane need not fear but that he would return at last as dutiful and docile as ever .
it was decided , therefore , that <name> should stay , while his mother , bidding her child and her father farewell , went back to persia .
after his mother was gone , <name> <unk> himself very strongly to all persons at his grandfather 's court by the nobleness and generosity of character which he evinced , more and more , as his mind was gradually developed .
he applied himself with great diligence to acquiring the various accomplishments and arts then most highly prized , such as leaping , <unk> , racing , riding , throwing the javelin , and drawing the bow .
in the friendly contests which took place among the boys , to test their comparative excellence in these exercises , <name> would challenge those whom he knew to be superior to himself , and allow them to enjoy the pleasure of victory , while he was satisfied , himself , with the superior stimulus to exertion which he derived from coming thus into comparison with attainments higher than his own .
he pressed forward boldly and ardently , undertaking every thing which promised to be , by any possibility , within his power ; and , far from being disconcerted and discouraged at his mistakes and failures , he always joined merrily in the laugh which they occasioned , and renewed his attempts with as much ardor and alacrity as before .
thus he made great and rapid progress , and learned first to equal and then to surpass one after another of his companions , and all without exciting any jealousy or envy .
it was a great amusement both to him and to the other boys , his playmates , to hunt the animals in the park , especially the deer .
the park was a somewhat extensive domain , but the animals were soon very much diminished by the slaughter which the boys made among them .
astyages endeavored to supply their places by procuring more .
at length , however , all the sources of supply that were conveniently at hand were exhausted ; and <name> , then finding that his grandfather was put to no little trouble to obtain tame animals for his park , proposed , one day , that he should be allowed to go out into the forests , to hunt the wild beasts with the men .
" there are animals enough there , grandfather , " said <name> , " and i shall consider them all just as if you had procured them expressly for me . "
in fact , by this time <name> had grown up to be a tall and handsome young man , with strength and vigor sufficient , under favorable circumstances , to endure the fatigues and exposures of real hunting .
as his person had become developed , his mind and manners , too , had undergone a change .
the gayety , the <unk> , the self-confidence , and talkative vivacity of his childhood had disappeared , and he was fast becoming reserved , sedate , deliberate , and cautious .
he no longer entertained his grandfather 's company by his mimicry , his <unk> , and his childish wit .
he was silent ; he observed , he listened , he shrank from publicity , and spoke , when he spoke at all , in subdued and gentle tones .
instead of crowding forward eagerly into his grandfather 's presence on all occasions , <unk> and <unk> , as he had done before , he now became , of his own accord , very much afraid of <unk> trouble or interruption .
he did not any longer need a sacian to restrain him , but became , as xenophon expresses it , a sacian to himself , taking great care not to go into his grandfather 's apartments without previously ascertaining that the king was disengaged ; so that he and the sacian now became very great friends .
this being the state of the case , astyages consented that <name> should go out with his son <unk> into the forests to hunt at the next opportunity .
the party set out , when the time arrived , on horseback , the hearts of <name> and his companions bounding , when they mounted their steeds , with feelings of elation and pride .
there were certain attendants and guards appointed to keep near to <name> , and to help him in the rough and <name> parts of the country , and to protect him from the dangers to which , if left alone , he would doubtless have been exposed .
<name> talked with these attendants , as they rode along , of the mode of hunting , of the difficulties of hunting , the characters and the habits of the various wild beasts , and of the dangers to be shunned .
his attendants told him that the dangerous beasts were bears , lions , tigers , boars , and <unk> ; that such animals as these often attacked and killed men , and that he must avoid them ; but that stags , wild goats , wild sheep , and wild asses were harmless , and that he could hunt such animals as they as much as he pleased .
they told him , moreover , that steep , <name> , and broken ground was more dangerous to the huntsman than any beasts , however ferocious ; for riders , off their guard , driving impetuously over such ways , were often thrown from their horses , or fell with them over precipices or into chasms , and were killed .
[ illustration : <name> 's hunting . ]
<name> listened very attentively to these instructions , with every disposition to give heed to them ; but when he came to the trial , he found that the ardor and impetuosity of the <name> drove all considerations of <name> wholly from his mind .
when the men got into the forest , those that were with <name> roused a stag , and all set off eagerly in pursuit , <name> at the head .
away went the stag over rough and dangerous ground .
the rest of the party turned aside , or followed cautiously , while <name> urged his horse forward in the wildest excitement , thinking of nothing , and seeing nothing but the stag bounding before him .
the horse came to a chasm which he was obliged to leap .
but the distance was too great ; he came down upon his knees , threw <name> violently forward almost over his head , and then , with a bound and a scramble , recovered his feet and went on .
<name> clung <unk> to the horse 's mane , and at length succeeded in getting back to the saddle , though , for a moment his life was in the most imminent danger .
his attendants were extremely terrified , though he himself seemed to experience no feeling but the pleasurable excitement of the <name> ; for , as soon as the obstacle was cleared , he pressed on with new impetuosity after the stag , overtook him , and killed him with his javelin .
then , alighting from his horse , he stood by the side of his victim , to wait the coming up of the party , his countenance beaming with an expression of triumph and delight .
his attendants , however , on their arrival , instead of applauding his exploit , or seeming to share his pleasure , sharply reproved him for his recklessness and daring .
he had entirely disregarded their instructions , and they threatened to report him to his grandfather .
<name> looked perplexed and uneasy .
the excitement and the pleasure of victory and success were struggling in his mind against his dread of his grandfather 's displeasure .
just at this instant he heard a new halloo .
another party in the neighborhood had roused fresh game .
all <name> 's returning sense of duty was blown at once to the winds .
he sprang to his horse with a shout of wild enthusiasm , and rode off toward the scene of action .
the game which had been started , a furious wild boar , just then issued from a thicket directly before him .
<name> , instead of <unk> the danger , as he ought to have done , in obedience to the orders of those to whom his grandfather had intrusted him , dashed on to meet the boar at full speed , and aimed so true a thrust with his javelin against the beast as to <unk> him in the forehead .
the boar fell , and lay upon the ground in dying struggles , while <name> 's heart was filled with <name> and triumph even greater than before .
when <unk> came up , he reproved <name> anew for running such risks .
<name> received the reproaches meekly , and then asked <unk> to give him the two animals that he had killed ; he wanted to <name> them home to his grandfather .
" by no means , " said <unk> , " your grandfather would be very much displeased to know what you had done .
he would not only condemn you for acting thus , but he would <unk> us too , severely , for allowing you to do so . "
" let him punish me , " said <name> , " if he wishes , after i have shown him the stag and the boar , and you may punish me too , if you think best ; but do let me show them to him . "
<unk> consented , and <name> made arrangements to have the bodies of the beasts and the bloody javelins carried home .
<name> then presented the carcasses to his grandfather , saying that it was some game which he had taken for him .
the javelins he did not exhibit directly , but he laid them down in a place where his grandfather would see them .
astyages thanked him for his presents , but he said he had no such need of presents of game as to wish his grandson to expose himself to such imminent dangers to take it .
" well , grandfather , " said <name> , " if you do not want the meat , give it to me , and i <name> divide it among my friends . "
astyages agreed to this , and <name> divided his booty among his companions , the boys , who had before hunted with him in the park .
they , of course , took their several portions home , each one carrying with his share of the gift a glowing account of the valor and prowess of the giver .
it was not generosity which led <name> thus to give away the fruits of his toil , but a <name> to widen and extend his fame .
when <name> was about fifteen or sixteen years old , his uncle <unk> was married , and in celebrating his nuptials , he formed a great hunting party , to go to the frontiers between media and <unk> to hunt there , where it was said that game of all kinds was very plentiful , as it usually was , in fact , in those days , in the neighborhood of disturbed and unsettled frontiers .
the very causes which made such a region as this a safe and frequented haunt for wild beasts , made it unsafe for men , and <unk> did not consider it prudent to venture on his excursion without a considerable force to attend him .
his hunting party formed , therefore , quite a little army .
they set out from home with great pomp and ceremony , and proceeded to the frontiers in regular organization and order , like a body of troops on a march .
there was a squadron of horsemen , who were to hunt the beasts in the open parts of the forest , and a considerable detachment of <unk> footmen also , who were to rouse the game , and drive them out of their lurking places in the glens and thickets .
<name> accompanied this expedition .
when <unk> reached the frontiers , he concluded , instead of contenting himself and his party with hunting wild beasts , to make an incursion for plunder into the assyrian territory , that being , as <unk> expresses it , a more <name> enterprise than the other .
the nobleness , it seems , consisted in the greater <unk> of the danger , in having to contend with armed men instead of ferocious brutes , and in the higher value of the prizes which they would obtain in case of success .
the idea of there being any injustice or wrong in this wanton and <unk> <unk> upon the territories of a neighboring nation seems not to have entered the mind either of the <name> robber himself or of his historian .
<name> distinguished himself very conspicuously in this expedition , as he had done in the hunting excursion before ; and when , at length , this nuptial party returned home , loaded with booty , the tidings of <name> 's exploits went to persia .
cambyses thought that if his son was beginning to take part , as a soldier , in military campaigns , it was time for him to be recalled .
he accordingly sent for him , and <name> began to make preparations for his return .
the day of his departure was a day of great sadness and sorrow among all his companions in media , and , in fact , among all the members of his grandfather 's household .
they accompanied him for some distance on his way , and took leave of him , at last , with much regret and many tears .
<name> distributed among them , as they left him , the various articles of value which he possessed , such as his arms , and ornaments of various kinds , and costly articles of dress .
he gave his median robe , at last , to a certain youth whom he said he loved the best of all .
the name of this special favorite was araspes .
as these his friends parted from him , <name> took his leave of them , one by one , as they returned , with many proofs of his affection for them , and with a very sad and heavy heart .
the boys and young men who had received these presents took them home , but they were so valuable , that they or their parents , supposing that they were given under a momentary impulse of feeling , and that they ought to be returned , sent them all to astyages .
astyages sent them to persia , to be restored to <name> .
<name> sent them all back again to his grandfather , with a request that he would distribute them again to those to whom <name> had originally given them , " which , " said he , " grandfather , you must do , if you wish me ever to come to media again with pleasure and not with shame . "
such is the story which xenophon gives of <name> 's visit to media , and in its romantic and incredible details it is a specimen of the whole narrative which this author has given of his hero 's life .
it is not , at the present day , supposed that these , and the many similar stories with which xenophon 's books are filled , are true history .
it is not even thought that xenophon really intended to offer his narrative as history , but rather as an historical romance  a fiction founded on fact , written to amuse the warriors of his times , and to serve as a vehicle for <unk> such principles of philosophy , of morals , and of military science as seemed to him worthy of the attention of his countrymen .
the story has no air of reality about it from beginning to end , but only a sort of poetical fitness of one part to another , much more like the contrived coincidences of a romance writer than like the real events and transactions of actual life .
a very large portion of the work consists of long discourses on military , moral , and often metaphysical philosophy , made by generals in council , or commanders in conversation with each other when going into battle .
the occurrences and incidents out of which these conversations arise always take place just as they are wanted and arrange themselves in a manner to produce the highest dramatic effect ; like the stag , the broken ground , and the wild boar in <name> 's hunting , which came , one after another , to furnish the hero with poetical occasions for displaying his juvenile bravery , and to produce the most picturesque and poetical grouping of incidents and events .
xenophon too , like other writers of romances , makes his hero a model of military virtue and magnanimity , according to the ideas of the times .
he displays superhuman sagacity in <unk> his foes , he performs prodigies of valor , he forms the most sentimental attachments , and receives with a romantic confidence the <unk> of men who come over to his side from the enemy , and who , being traitors to old friends , would seem to be only worthy of suspicion and distrust in being received by new ones .
every thing , however , results well ; all whom he <unk> in prove worthy ; all whom he <unk> prove base .
all his friends are generous and <name> , and all his enemies treacherous and cruel .
every prediction which he makes is verified , and all his enterprises succeed ; or if , in any respect , there occurs a partial failure , the incident is always of such a character as to heighten the impression which is made by the final and triumphant success .
such being the character of xenophon 's tale , or rather drama , we shall content ourselves , after giving this specimen of it , with adding , in some subsequent chapters , a few other scenes and incidents drawn from his narrative .
in the mean time , in relating the great leading events of <name> 's life , we shall take herodotus for our guide , by following his more sober , and , probably , more trustworthy record .

the scene of our narrative must now be changed , for a time , from persia and media , in the east , to <name> minor , in the west , where the great croesus , originally king of <name> , was at this time gradually extending his empire along the shores of the Ã¦gean sea .
the name of croesus is associated in the minds of men with the idea of boundless wealth , the phrase " as <name> as croesus " having been a common proverb in all the modern languages of europe for many centuries .
it was to this croesus , king of <name> , whose story we are about to relate , that the proverb alludes .
the country of <name> , over which this famous sovereign originally ruled , was in the western part of <name> minor , bordering on the Ã¦gean sea .
croesus himself belonged to a dynasty , or race of kings , called the <unk> .
the founder of this line was gyges , who displaced the dynasty which preceded him and established his own by a revolution effected in a very remarkable manner .
the circumstances were as follows : the name of the last monarch of the old dynasty  the one , namely , whom gyges displaced  was <unk> .
gyges was a household servant in <unk> 's family  a sort of slave , in fact , and yet , as such slaves often were in those rude days , a personal favorite and boon companion of his master .
<unk> was a dissolute and unprincipled tyrant .
he had , however , a very beautiful and modest wife , whose name was <unk> .
<unk> was very proud of the beauty of his <name> , and was always <unk> it , though , as the event proved , he could not have felt for her any true and honest affection .
in some of his revels with gyges , when he was boasting of <unk> 's charms , he said that the beauty of her form and figure , when <unk> , was even more exquisite than that of her features ; and , finally , the monster , growing more and more excited , and having rendered himself still more of a brute than he was by nature by the influence of wine , declared that gyges should see for himself .
he would conceal him , he said , in the <name> 's bed-chamber , while she was undressing for the night .
gyges remonstrated very earnestly against this proposal .
it would be doing the innocent <name> , he said , a great wrong .
he assured the king , too , that he believed fully all that he said about <unk> 's beauty , without applying such a test , and he begged him not to insist upon a proposal with which it would be criminal to comply .
the king , however , did insist upon it , and gyges was compelled to yield .
whatever is offered as a favor by a <unk> despot to an humble inferior , it would be death to refuse .
gyges allowed himself to be placed behind a <unk> door of the king 's apartment , when the king retired to it for the night .
there he was to remain while the <name> began to <unk> herself for retiring , with a strict injunction to withdraw at a certain time which the king designated , and with the utmost caution , so as to prevent being observed by the <name> .
gyges did as he was ordered .
the beautiful <name> laid aside her garments and made her toilet for the night with all the quiet composure and confidence which a woman might be expected to feel while in so sacred and inviolable a sanctuary , and in the presence and under the guardianship of her husband .
just as she was about to retire to rest , some movement alarmed her .
it was gyges going away .
she saw him .
she instantly understood the case .
she was overwhelmed with indignation and shame .
she , however , suppressed and concealed her emotions ; she spoke to <unk> in her usual tone of voice , and he , on his part , secretly rejoiced in the adroit and successful manner in which his little contrivance had been carried into execution .
the next morning <unk> sent , by some of her confidential messengers , for gyges to come to her .
he came , with some forebodings , perhaps , but without any direct reason for believing that what he had done had been discovered .
<unk> , however , informed him that she knew all , and that either he or her husband must die .
gyges earnestly remonstrated against this decision , and <unk> forgiveness .
he explained the circumstances under which the act had been performed , which seemed , at least so far as he was concerned , to <unk> the deed .
the <name> was , however , fixed and decided .
it was wholly inconsistent with her ideas of womanly delicacy that there should be two living men who had both been admitted to her bed-chamber .
" the king , " she said , " by what he has done , has forfeited his claims to me and resigned me to you .
if you <name> kill him , seize his kingdom , and make me your wife , all shall be well ; otherwise you must prepare to die . "
from this hard alternative , gyges chose to assassinate the king , and to make the lovely object before him his own .
the excitement of indignation and resentment which glowed upon her cheek , and with which her bosom was heaving , made her more beautiful than ever .
" how shall our purpose be accomplished ? "
asked gyges .
" the deed , " she replied , " shall be perpetrated in the very place which was the scene of the dishonor done to me .
i <name> admit you into our bed-chamber in my turn , and you shall kill <unk> in his bed . "
when night came , <unk> stationed gyges again behind the same door where the king had placed him .
he had a dagger in his hand .
he waited there till <unk> was asleep .
then at a signal given him by the <name> , he entered , and stabbed the husband in his bed .
he married <unk> , and possessed himself of the kingdom .
after this , he and his successors reigned for many years over the kingdom of <name> , constituting the dynasty of the <unk> , from which , in process of time , king croesus descended .
the successive sovereigns of this dynasty gradually extended the lydian power over the countries around them .
the name of <unk> father , who was the monarch that immediately preceded him , was <unk> .
<unk> waged war toward the southward , into the territories of the city of miletus .
he made annual incursions into the country of the <unk> for plunder , always taking care , however , while he seized all the movable property that he could find , to leave the villages and towns , and all the hamlets of the laborers without injury .
the reason for this was , that he did not wish to drive away the population , but to encourage them to remain and cultivate their lands , so that there might be new flocks and herds , and new stores of corn , and fruit , and wine , for him to plunder from in succeeding years .
at last , on one of these marauding excursions , some fires which were accidentally set in a field spread into a neighboring town , and destroyed , among other buildings , a <name> consecrated to <name> .
after this , <unk> found himself quite unsuccessful in all his expeditions and campaigns .
he sent to a famous oracle to ask the reason .
" you can expect no more success , " replied the oracle , " until you rebuild the <name> that you have destroyed . "
but how could he rebuild the <name> ?
the site was in the <unk> country .
his men could not build an edifice and defend themselves , at the same time , from the attacks of their foes .
he concluded to demand a truce of the <unk> until the reconstruction should be completed , and he sent embassadors to miletus , accordingly , to make the proposal .
the proposition for a truce resulted in a permanent peace , by means of a very singular stratagem which <unk> , the king of miletus , practiced upon <unk> .
it seems that <unk> supposed that <unk> had been reduced to great distress by the loss and destruction of provisions and stores in various parts of the country , and that he would soon be forced to yield up his kingdom .
this was , in fact , the case ; but <unk> determined to disguise his real condition , and to destroy , by an artifice , all the hopes which <unk> had formed from the supposed scarcity in the city .
when the herald whom <unk> sent to miletus was about to arrive , <unk> collected all the corn , and grain , and other provisions which he could command , and had them heaped up in a public part of the city , where the herald was to be received , so as to present indications of the most ample abundance of food .
he collected a large body of his soldiers , too , and gave them leave to feast themselves without <unk> on what he had thus gathered .
accordingly , when the herald came in to deliver his message , he found the whole city given up to feasting and revelry , and he saw stores of provisions at hand , which were in process of being distributed and consumed with the most prodigal profusion .
the herald reported this state of things to <unk> .
<unk> then gave up all hopes of reducing miletus by famine , and made a permanent peace , binding himself to its stipulations by a very solemn treaty .
to celebrate the event , too , he built two temples to <name> instead of one .
a story is related by herodotus of a remarkable escape made by arion at sea , which occurred during the reign of <unk> , the father of croesus .
we <name> give the story as herodotus relates it , leaving the reader to judge for himself whether such tales were probably true , or were only introduced by herodotus into his narrative to make his histories more entertaining to the grecian assemblies to whom he read them .
arion was a celebrated singer .
he had been making a tour in sicily and in the southern part of italy , where he had acquired considerable wealth , and he was now returning to corinth .
he embarked at tarentum , which is a city in the southern part of italy , in a corinthian vessel , and put to sea .
when the sailors found that they had him in their power , they determined to <name> and murder him .
they accordingly seized his gold and silver , and then told him that he might either kill himself or jump overboard into the sea .
one or the other he must do .
if he would kill himself on board the vessel , they would give him decent burial when they reached the shore .
arion seemed at first at a loss how to decide in so hard an alternative .
at length he told the sailors that he would throw himself into the sea , but he asked permission to sing them one of his songs before he took the fatal plunge .
they consented .
he accordingly went into the cabin , and spent some time in dressing himself magnificently in the splendid and <unk> robes in which he had been accustomed to appear upon the stage .
at length he reappeared , and took his position on the side of the ship , with his harp in his hand .
he sang his song , accompanying himself upon the harp , and then , when he had finished his performance , he leaped into the sea .
the seamen divided their plunder and pursued their voyage .
arion , however , instead of being drowned , was taken up by a <unk> that had been charmed by his song , and was borne by him to <unk> , which is the promontory formed by the southern extremity of the peloponnesus .
there arion landed in safety .
from <unk> he proceeded to corinth , wearing the same dress in which he had plunged into the sea .
on his arrival , he complained to the king of the crime which the sailors had committed , and narrated his wonderful escape .
the king did not believe him , but put him in prison to wait until the ship should arrive .
when at last the vessel came , the king summoned the sailors into his presence , and asked them if they knew any thing of arion .
arion himself had been previously placed in an adjoining room , ready to be called in as soon as his presence was required .
the mariners answered to the question which the king put to them , that they had seen arion in tarentum , and that they had left him there .
arion was then himself called in .
his sudden appearance , clothed as he was in the same dress in which the mariners had seen him leap into the sea , so terrified the <unk> criminals , that they confessed their guilt , and were all punished by the king .
a marble statue , representing a man seated upon a <unk> , was erected at <unk> to commemorate this event , where it remained for centuries afterward , a monument of the wonder which arion had achieved .
at length <unk> died and croesus succeeded him .
croesus extended still further the power and fame of the lydian empire , and was for a time very successful in all his military schemes .
by looking upon the map , the reader <name> see that the Ã¦gean sea , along the coasts of <name> minor , is studded with islands .
these islands were in those days very fertile and beautiful , and were densely inhabited by a commercial and maritime people , who possessed a multitude of ships , and were very powerful in all the adjacent seas .
of course their land forces were very few , whether of horse or of foot , as the habits and manners of such a <unk> people were all foreign to modes of warfare required in land campaigns .
on the sea , however , these islanders were supreme .
croesus formed a scheme for attacking these islands and bringing them under his sway , and he began to make preparations for building and <unk> a fleet for this purpose , though , of course , his subjects were as unused to the sea as the nautical islanders were to military operations on the land .
while he was making these preparations , a certain philosopher was visiting at his court : he was one of the seven wise men of greece , who had recently come from the peloponnesus .
croesus asked him if there was any news from that country .
" i heard , " said the philosopher , " that the inhabitants of the islands were preparing to invade your dominions with a squadron of ten thousand horse . "
croesus , who supposed that the philosopher was serious , appeared greatly pleased and elated at the prospect of his <unk> enemies attempting to meet him as a body of cavalry .
" no doubt , " said the philosopher , after a little pause , " you would be pleased to have those sailors attempt to contend with you on horseback ; but do you not suppose that they <name> be equally pleased at the prospect of encountering lydian <unk> on the ocean ? "
croesus perceived the absurdity of his plan , and abandoned the attempt to execute it .
croesus acquired the enormous wealth for which he was so celebrated from the golden sands of the river <unk> , which flowed through his kingdom .
the river brought the particles of gold , in grains , and globules , and flakes , from the mountains above , and the servants and slaves of croesus washed the sands , and thus separated the heavier deposit of the metal .
in respect to the origin of the gold , however , the people who lived upon the banks of the river had a different explanation from the simple one that the waters brought down the treasure from the mountain ravines .
they had a story that , ages before , a certain king , named <unk> , rendered some service to a god , who , in his turn , offered to <name> him any favor that he might ask .
<unk> asked that the power might be granted him to turn whatever he touched into gold .
the power was bestowed , and <unk> , after changing various objects around him into gold until he was satisfied , began to find his new acquisition a source of great inconvenience and danger .
his clothes , his food , and even his drink , were changed to gold when he touched them .
he found that he was about to starve in the midst of a world of treasure , and he implored the god to take back the fatal gift .
the god directed him to go and bathe in the <unk> , and he should be restored to his former condition .
<unk> did so , and was saved , but not without transforming a great portion of the sands of the stream into gold during the process of his restoration .
croesus thus attained quite speedily to a very high degree of wealth , prosperity , and renown .
his dominions were widely extended ; his palaces were full of treasures ; his court was a scene of <unk> magnificence and splendor .
while in the enjoyment of all this grandeur , he was visited by solon , the celebrated grecian <unk> , who was traveling in that part of the world to observe the institutions and customs of different states .
croesus received solon with great distinction , and showed him all his treasures .
at last he one day said to him , " you have traveled , solon , over many countries , and have studied , with a great deal of attention and care , all that you have seen .
i have heard great <unk> of your wisdom , and i should like very much to know who , of all the persons you have ever known , has seemed to you most fortunate and happy . "
the king had no doubt that the answer would be that he himself was the one .
" i think , " replied solon , after a pause , " that <unk> , an athenian citizen , was the most fortunate and happy man i have ever known . "
" <unk> , an athenian ! "
repeated croesus , surprised .
" what was there in his case which you consider so remarkable ? "
" he was a peaceful and quiet citizen of athens , " said solon .
" he lived happily with his family , under a most excellent government , enjoying for many years all the pleasures of domestic life .
he had several amiable and virtuous children , who all grew up to maturity , and loved and honored their parents as long as they lived .
at length , when his life was drawing toward its natural termination , a war broke out with a neighboring nation , and <unk> went with the army to defend his country .
he aided very essentially in the defeat of the enemy , but fell , at last , on the field of battle .
his countrymen greatly lamented his death .
they buried him publicly where he fell , with every circumstance of honor . "
solon was proceeding to recount the domestic and social virtues of <unk> , and the peaceful happiness which he enjoyed as the result of them , when croesus interrupted him to ask who , next to <unk> , he considered the most fortunate and happy man .
solon , after a little farther reflection , mentioned two brothers , <unk> and <unk> , private persons among the greeks , who were celebrated for their great personal strength , and also for their devoted attachment to their mother .
he related to croesus a story of a feat they performed on one occasion , when their mother , at the celebration of some public festival , was going some miles to a <name> , in a car to be drawn by oxen .
there happened to be some delay in bringing the oxen , while the mother was waiting in the car .
as the oxen did not come , the young men took hold of the pole of the car themselves , and walked off at their ease with the load , amid the acclamations of the spectators , while their mother 's heart was filled with exultation and pride .
croesus here interrupted the philosopher again , and expressed his surprise that he should place private men , like those whom he had named , who possessed no wealth , or prominence , or power , before a monarch like him , occupying a station of such high authority and renown , and possessing such boundless treasures .
" croesus , " replied solon , " i see you now , indeed , at the height of human power and grandeur .
you reign supreme over many nations , and you are in the enjoyment of unbounded affluence , and every species of luxury and splendor .
i can not , however , decide whether i am to consider you a fortunate and happy man , until i know how all this is to end .
if we consider seventy years as the allotted period of life , you have a large portion of your existence yet to come , and we can not with certainty pronounce any man happy till his life is ended . "
this conversation with solon made a deep impression upon <unk> mind , as was afterward proved in a remarkable manner ; but the impression was not a pleasant or a salutary one .
the king , however , suppressed for the time the resentment which the presentation of these unwelcome truths awakened within him , though he treated solon afterward with indifference and neglect , so that the philosopher soon found it best to withdraw .
croesus had two sons .
one was deaf and dumb .
the other was a young man of uncommon promise , and , of course , as he only could succeed his father in the government of the kingdom , he was naturally an object of the king 's particular attention and care .
his name was <unk> .
he was unmarried .
he was , however , old enough to have the command of a considerable body of troops , and he had often distinguished himself in the lydian campaigns .
one night the king had a dream about <unk> which greatly alarmed him .
he dreamed that his son was destined to die of a wound received from the point of an iron spear .
the king was made very uneasy by this ominous dream .
he determined at once to take every precaution in his power to avert the threatened danger .
he immediately detached <unk> from his command in the army , and made provision for his marriage .
he then very carefully collected all the darts , javelins , and every other <unk> weapon that he could find about the palace , and caused them to be deposited carefully in a secure place , where there could be no danger even of an accidental injury from them .
about that time there appeared at the court of croesus a stranger from <unk> , a neighboring state , who presented himself at the palace and asked for protection .
he was a <name> of the <name> family of <unk> , and his name was <unk> .
he had had the misfortune , by some unhappy accident , to kill his brother ; his father , in consequence of it , had banished him from his native land , and he was now homeless , friendless , and destitute .
croesus received him kindly .
" your family have always been my friends , " said he , " and i am glad of the opportunity to make some return by extending my protection to any member of it suffering misfortune .
you shall reside in my palace , and all your wants shall be supplied .
come in , and forget the calamity which has befallen you , instead of distressing yourself with it as if it had been a crime . "
thus croesus received the unfortunate <unk> into his household .
after the <name> had been <unk> in his new home for some time , messengers came from <unk> , a neighboring state , saying that a wild boar of enormous size and unusual ferocity had come down from the mountains , and was lurking in the cultivated country , in thickets and glens , from which , at night , he made great havoc among the flocks and herds , and asking that croesus would send his son , with a band of hunters and a pack of dogs , to help them destroy the common enemy .
croesus consented immediately to send the dogs and the men , but he said that he could not send his son .
" my son , " he added , " has been lately married , and his time and attention are employed about other things . "
when , however , <unk> himself heard of this reply , he remonstrated very earnestly against it , and begged his father to allow him to go .
" what <name> the world think of me , " said he " if i shut myself up to these <unk> pursuits and enjoyments , and shun those dangers and toils which other men consider it their highest honor to share ?
what <name> my fellow-citizens think of me , and how shall i appear in the eyes of my wife ?
she <name> despise me . "
croesus then explained to his son the reason why he had been so careful to avoid exposing him to danger .
he related to him the dream which had alarmed him .
" it is on that account , " said he , " that i am so anxious about you .
you are , in fact , my only son , for your speechless brother can never be my heir . "
<unk> said , in reply , that he was not surprised , under those circumstances , at his father 's anxiety ; but he maintained that this was a case to which his caution could not properly apply .
" you dreamed , " he said , " that i should be killed by a weapon pointed with iron ; but a boar has no such weapon .
if the dream had portended that i was to perish by a tusk or a tooth , you might reasonably have restrained me from going to hunt a wild beast ; but <unk> instruments are the weapons of men , and we are not going , in this expedition , to contend with men . "
the king , partly convinced , perhaps , by the arguments which <unk> offered , and partly overborne by the urgency of his request , finally consented to his request and allowed him to go .
he consigned him , however , to the special care of <unk> , who was likewise to accompany the expedition , charging <unk> to keep constantly by his side , and to watch over him with the utmost vigilance and fidelity .
the band of huntsmen was organized , the dogs prepared , and the train departed .
very soon afterward , a messenger came back from the hunting ground , breathless , and with a countenance of extreme concern and terror , bringing the dreadful tidings that <unk> was dead .
<unk> himself had killed him .
in the ardor of the <name> , while the huntsmen had surrounded the boar , and were each intent on his own personal danger while in close combat with such a monster , and all were hurling darts and javelins at their ferocious foe , the spear of <unk> missed its aim , and entered the body of the unhappy <name> .
he bled to death on the spot .
soon after the messenger had made known these terrible tidings , the hunting train , transformed now into a funeral procession , appeared , bearing the dead body of the king 's son , and followed by the wretched <unk> himself , who was wringing his hands , and crying out incessantly in accents and exclamations of despair .
he begged the king to kill him at once , over the body of his son , and thus put an end to the unutterable agony that he endured .
this second calamity was more , he said , than he could bear .
he had killed before his own brother , and now he had murdered the son of his greatest benefactor and friend .
croesus , though overwhelmed with anguish , was disarmed of all resentment at witnessing <unk> 's suffering .
he endeavored to soothe and quiet the agitation which the unhappy man endured , but it was in vain .
<unk> could not be calmed .
croesus then ordered the body of his son to be buried with proper honors .
the funeral services were performed with great and solemn ceremonies , and when the body was interred , the household of croesus returned to the palace , which was now , in spite of all its splendor , shrouded in gloom .
that night  at midnight  <unk> , finding his mental anguish insupportable retired from his apartment to the place where <unk> had been buried , and killed himself over the grave .
* * * * * solon was wise in saying that he could not tell whether wealth and grandeur were to be accounted as happiness till he saw how they would end .
croesus was plunged into <unk> grief , and into extreme dejection and misery for a period of two years , in consequence of this calamity , and yet this calamity was only the beginning of the end .
chapter v. accession of <name> to the throne .
b.c .
<unk> change in the character of cyrus.  his <unk>  <unk> of <unk>  <name> makes great progress in mental and personal <unk>  harpagus 's plans for <unk>  suspicions of <unk>  condition of <unk>  discontent in <unk>  proceedings of <unk>  his deportment toward <unk>  co-operation in <unk>  harpagus writes to cyrus.  harpagus 's singular method of conveying his letter to cyrus.  contents of <unk> letter.  excitement of cyrus.  <name> <unk> to <unk> plan.  how to raise an army.  the day of <unk>  the day of <unk>  speech of cyrus.  ardor of the <unk>  <unk> of <unk>  the battle.  rage of <unk>  his vengeance on the <unk>  defeat and capture of <unk>  interview with <unk>  <name> king of media and <unk>  confinement of <unk>  acquiescence of the <unk>  death of <unk>  suddenness of <unk> <unk>  harpagus .
while croesus had thus , on his side of the river <unk>  which was the stream that marked the boundary between the lydian empire on the west and the persian and assyrian dominions on the east  been employed in building up his grand structure of outward magnificence and splendor , and in contending , within , against an overwhelming tide of domestic misery and woe , great changes had taken place in the situation and prospects of <name> .
from being an artless and <unk> child , he had become a calculating , ambitious , and aspiring man , and he was preparing to take his part in the great public contests and struggles of the day , with the same eagerness for <unk> , and the same unconcern for the welfare and happiness of others , which always <unk> the spirit of ambition and love of power .
although it is by no means certain that what xenophon relates of his visit to his grandfather astyages is meant for a true narrative of facts , it is not at all improbable that such a visit might have been made , and that occurrences , somewhat similar , at least , to those which his narrative records , may have taken place .
it may seem strange to the reader that a man who should , at one time , wish to put his grandchild to death , should , at another , be disposed to treat him with such a profusion of kindness and attention .
there is nothing , however , really extraordinary in this .
nothing is more fluctuating than the <name> of a despot .
man , accustomed from infancy to govern those around him by his own impetuous <name> , never learns self-control .
he gives himself up to the dominion of the passing animal emotions of the hour .
it may be jealousy , it may be revenge , it may be parental fondness , it may be hate , it may be love  whatever the feeling is that the various incidents of life , as they occur , or the influences , irritating or exhilarating , which are produced by food or wine , awaken in his mind , he follows its impulse blindly and without reserve .
he loads a favorite with kindness and caresses at one hour , and <unk> his assassination the next .
he imagines that his infant grandchild is to become his rival , and he deliberately orders him to be left in a gloomy forest alone , to die of cold and hunger .
when the imaginary danger has passed away , he seeks amusement in making the same grandchild his plaything , and <unk> him with favors bestowed solely for the gratification of the giver , under the influence of an affection almost as purely animal as that of a lioness for her young .
favors of such a sort can awaken no permanent gratitude in any heart , and thus it is quite possible that <name> might have evinced , during the simple and guileless days of his childhood , a deep veneration and affection for his grandfather , and yet , in subsequent years , when he had arrived at full maturity , have learned to regard him simply in the light of a great political potentate , as likely as any other potentate around him to become his rival or his enemy .
this was , at all events , the result .
<name> , on his return to persia , grew rapidly in strength and stature , and soon became highly distinguished for his personal <name> , his winning manners , and for the various martial accomplishments which he had acquired in media , and in which he excelled almost all his companions .
he gained , as such princes always do , a vast ascendency over the minds of all around him .
as he advanced toward maturity , his mind passed from its interest in games , and hunting , and athletic sports , to plans of war , of conquest , and of extended dominion .
in the mean time , harpagus , though he had , at the time when he endured the horrid punishment which astyages inflicted upon him , expressed no resentment , still he had secretly felt an extreme indignation and anger , and he had now , for fifteen years , been nourishing covert schemes and plans for revenge .
he remained all this time in the court of astyages , and was apparently his friend .
he was , however , in heart a most bitter and implacable enemy .
he was looking continually for a plan or prospect which should promise some <name> of affording him his <unk> revenge .
his eyes were naturally turned toward <name> .
he kept up a communication with him so far as it was possible , for astyages watched very closely what passed between the two countries , being always suspicious of plots against his government and crown .
harpagus , however , contrived to evade this vigilance in some degree .
he made continual reports to <name> of the tyranny and <unk> of astyages , and of the <unk> of the realm of media , and he endeavored to stimulate his rising ambition to the <name> of one day possessing for himself both the median and persian throne .
in fact , persia was not then independent of media .
it was more or less connected with the government of astyages , so that cambyses , the chief ruler of persia , <name> 's father , is called sometimes a king and sometimes a <unk> , which last title is equivalent to that of viceroy or governor general .
whatever his true and proper title may have been , persia was a median <unk> , and <name> , therefore , in forming plans for gaining possession of the median throne , would consider himself as rather endeavoring to rise to the supreme command in his own native country , than as projecting any scheme for foreign conquest .
harpagus , too , looked upon the subject in the same light .
accordingly , in pushing forward his plots toward their execution , he operated in media as well as persia , he ascertained , by diligent and sagacious , but by very covert inquiries , who were discontented and ill at ease under the dominion of astyages , and by sympathizing with and encouraging them , he increased their discontent and <unk> .
whenever astyages , in the exercise of his tyranny inflicted an injury upon a powerful subject , harpagus espoused the cause of the injured man , condemned , with him , the intolerable oppression of the king , and thus fixed and perpetuated his enmity .
at the same time , he took pains to collect and to <unk> among the medes all the information which he could obtain favorable to <name> , in respect to his talents , his character , and his just and generous spirit , so that , at length , the ascendency of astyages , through the instrumentality of these measures , was very extensively undermined , and the way was rapidly becoming prepared for <name> 's accession to power .
during all this time , moreover , harpagus was personally very deferential and obsequious to astyages , and professed an unbounded <unk> to his interests .
he maintained a high rank at court and in the army , and astyages relied upon him as one of the most obedient and submissive of his servants , without entertaining any suspicion whatever of his true designs .
at length a favorable occasion arose , as harpagus thought , for the execution of his plans .
it was at a time when astyages had been guilty of some unusual acts of tyranny and oppression , by which he had produced extensive dissatisfaction among his people .
harpagus communicated , very cautiously , to the principal men around him , the designs that he had long been forming for deposing astyages and elevating <name> in his place .
he found them favorably inclined to the plan .
the way being thus prepared , the next thing was to contrive some secret way of communicating with <name> .
as the proposal which he was going to make was that <name> should come into media with as great a force as he could command , and head an insurrection against the government of astyages , it would , of course , be death to him to have it discovered .
he did not dare to trust the message to any living messenger , for fear of betrayal ; nor was it safe to send a letter by any ordinary mode of transmission , lest the letter should be intercepted by some of astyages 's spies , and thus the whole plot be discovered .
he finally adopted the following very extraordinary plan : [ illustration : the secret correspondence . ]
he wrote a letter to <name> , and then taking a hare , which some of his huntsmen had caught for him , he opened the body and concealed the letter within .
he then sewed up the skin again in the most careful manner , so that no signs of the <unk> should remain .
he delivered this hare , together with some nets and other hunting apparatus , to certain trustworthy servants , on whom he thought he could rely , charging them to deliver the hare into <name> 's own hands , and to say that it came from harpagus , and that it was the request of harpagus that <name> should open it himself and alone .
harpagus concluded that this mode of making the communication was safe ; for , in case the persons to whom the hare was intrusted were to be seen by any of the spies or other persons employed by astyages on the frontiers , they would consider them as hunters returning from the <name> with their game , and would never think of examining the body of a hare , in the hands of such a party , in search after a clandestine correspondence .
the plan was perfectly successful .
the men passed into persia without any suspicion .
they delivered the hare to <name> , with their message .
he opened the hare , and found the letter .
it was in substance as follows : " it is plain , <name> , that you are a favorite of heaven , and that you are destined to a great and glorious career .
you could not otherwise have escaped , in so miraculous a manner , the <unk> set for you in your infancy .
astyages meditated your death , and he took such measures to effect it as would seem to have made your destruction sure .
you were saved by the special interposition of heaven .
<name> are aware by what extraordinary incidents you were preserved and discovered , and what great and unusual prosperity has since attended you .
you know , too , what cruel punishments astyages inflicted upon me , for my humanity in saving you .
the time has now come for retribution .
from this time the authority and the dominions of astyages may be yours .
persuade the persians to revolt .
put yourself at the head of an army , and march into media .
i shall probably myself be appointed to command the army sent out to oppose you .
if so , we <name> join our forces when we meet , and i <name> enter your service .
i have conferred with the leading nobles in media , and they are all ready to espouse your cause .
you may rely upon finding every thing thus prepared for you here ; come , therefore , without any delay . "
<name> was thrown into a fever of excitement and agitation on reading this letter .
he determined to accede to harpagus 's proposal .
he revolved in his mind for some time the measures by which he could raise the necessary force .
of course he could not openly announce his plan and enlist an army to effect it , for any avowed and public movement of that kind would be immediately made known to astyages , who , by being thus <unk> of his enemies ' designs , might take effectual measures to circumvent them .
he determined to resort to deceit , or , as he called it , stratagem ; nor did he probably have any distinct perception of the <unk> of such a mode of proceeding .
the demon of war <unk> and justifies falsehood and treachery , in all its forms , on the part of his <unk> .
he always <unk> a forgery , a false pretense , or a lie : he calls it a stratagem .
<name> had a letter prepared , in the form of a commission from astyages , appointing him commander of a body of persian forces to be raised for the service of the king .
<name> read the <unk> document in the public assembly of the persians , and called upon all the warriors to join him .
when they were organized , he ordered them to assemble on a certain day , at a place that he named , each one provided with a woodman 's ax .
when they were thus mustered , he marched them into a forest , and set them at work to clear a piece of ground .
the army toiled all day , <unk> the trees , and piling them up to be burned .
they cleared in this way , as herodotus states , a piece of ground eighteen or twenty <unk> in extent .
<name> kept them thus engaged in severe and incessant toil all the day , giving them , too , only coarse food and little rest .
at night he dismissed them , commanding them to assemble again the second day .
on the second day , when they came together , they found a great banquet prepared for them , and <name> directed them to devote the day to feasting and making <name> .
there was an abundance of meats of all kinds , and <name> wines in great profusion .
the soldiers gave themselves up for the whole day to merriment and revelry .
the toils and the hard fare of the day before had prepared them very effectually to enjoy the rest and the luxuries of this festival .
they spent the hours in feasting about their camp-fires and reclining on the grass , where they amused themselves and one another by relating tales , or joining in <name> songs and dances .
at last , in the evening , <name> called them together , and asked them which day they had liked the best .
they replied that there was nothing at all to like in the one , and nothing to be disliked in the other .
they had had , on the first day , hard work and bad fare , and on the second , uninterrupted ease and the most luxurious pleasures .
" it is indeed so , " said <name> , " and you have your <name> in your own hands to make your lives pass like either of these days , just as you choose .
if you <name> follow me , you <name> enjoy ease , abundance , and luxury .
if you refuse , you must remain as you are , and toil on as you do now , and endure your present privations and hardships to the end of your days . "
he then explained to them his designs .
he told them that although media was a great and powerful kingdom , still that they were as good soldiers as the medes , and with the arrangements and preparations which he had made , they were sure of victory .
the soldiers received this proposal with great enthusiasm and <name> .
they declared themselves ready to follow <name> wherever he should lead them , and the whole body immediately commenced making preparations for the expedition .
astyages was , of course , soon informed of these proceedings .
he sent an order to <name> , summoning him immediately into his presence .
<name> sent back word , in reply , that astyages would probably see him sooner than he wished , and went on vigorously with his preparations .
when all was ready , the army marched , and , crossing the frontiers , they entered into media .
in the mean time , astyages had collected a large force , and , as had been anticipated by the conspirators , he put it under the command of harpagus .
harpagus made known his design of going over to <name> as soon as he should meet him , to as large a portion of the army as he thought it prudent to admit to his confidence ; the rest knew nothing of the plan ; and thus the median army advanced to meet the invaders , a part of the troops with minds intent on resolutely meeting and <unk> their enemies , while the rest were secretly preparing to go over at once to their side .
when the battle was joined , the honest part of the median army fought valiantly at first , but soon , thunderstruck and utterly confounded at seeing themselves abandoned and betrayed by a large body of their comrades , they were easily overpowered by the triumphant persians .
some were taken prisoners ; some fled back to astyages ; and others , following the example of the deserters , went over to <name> 's camp and swelled the <name> of his train .
<name> , thus <unk> by the <unk> he had received , and encouraged by the flight or dispersion of all who still wished to oppose him , began to advance toward the capital .
astyages , when he heard of the <unk> of harpagus and of the discomfiture of his army , was thrown into a perfect phrensy of rage and hate .
the <unk> prediction of his dream seemed now about to be fulfilled , and the magi , who had taught him that when <name> had once been made king of the boys in sport , there was no longer any danger of his aspiring to regal power , had proved themselves false .
they had either intentionally deceived him , or they were ignorant themselves , and in that case they were worthless impostors .
although the danger from <name> 's approach was imminent in the extreme , astyages could not take any measures for guarding against it until he had first gratified the despotic cruelty of his nature by taking vengeance on these false <unk> .
he directed to have them all seized and brought before him , and then , having upbraided them with bitter reproaches for their false predictions , he ordered them all to be crucified .
he then adopted the most decisive measures for raising an army .
he ordered every man capable of bearing arms to come forward , and then , putting himself at the head of the immense force which he had thus raised , he advanced to meet his enemy .
he supposed , no doubt , that he was sure of victory ; but he <unk> the power which the discipline , the resolution , the concentration , and the terrible energy of <name> 's troops gave to their formidable array .
he was defeated .
his army was totally cut to pieces , and he himself was taken prisoner .
harpagus was present when he was taken , and he exulted in <unk> triumph over the fallen tyrant 's ruin .
astyages was filled with rage and despair .
harpagus asked him what he thought now of the supper in which he had compelled a father to feed on the flesh of his child .
astyages , in reply , asked harpagus whether he thought that the success of <name> was owing to what he had done .
harpagus replied that it was , and <unk> explained to astyages the plots he had formed , and the preparations which he had made for <name> 's invasion , so that astyages might see that his destruction had been effected by harpagus alone , in terrible retribution for the atrocious crime which he had committed so many years before , and for which the vengeance of the sufferer had slumbered , during the long interval , only to be more complete and overwhelming at last .
astyages told harpagus that he was a miserable wretch , the most foolish and most wicked of mankind .
he was the most foolish , for having plotted to put power into another 's hands which it would have been just as easy for him to have secured and retained in his own ; and he was the most wicked , for having betrayed his country , and delivered it over to a foreign power , merely to gratify his own private revenge .
the result of this battle was the complete overthrow of the power and kingdom of astyages , and the establishment of <name> on the throne of the united kingdom of media and persia .
<name> treated his grandfather with kindness after his victory over him .
he kept him confined , it is true , but it was probably that indirect and qualified sort of confinement which is all that is usually enforced in the case of princes and kings .
in such cases , some extensive and often sumptuous residence is assigned to the illustrious prisoner , with grounds sufficiently extensive to afford every necessary range for recreation and exercise , and with bodies of troops for keepers , which have much more the form and appearance of military guards of honor attending on a <name> , than of <unk> confining a prisoner .
it was probably in such an imprisonment as this that astyages passed the remainder of his days .
the people , having been wearied with his despotic tyranny , rejoiced in his downfall , and acquiesced very readily in the milder and more <unk> government of <name> .
astyages came to his death many years afterward , in a somewhat remarkable manner .
<name> sent for him to come into persia , where he was himself then residing .
the officer who had astyages in charge , conducted him , on the way , into a desolate wilderness , where he perished of fatigue , exposure , and hunger .
it was supposed that this was done in obedience to secret orders from <name> , who perhaps found the charge of such a prisoner a burden .
the officer , however , was cruelly punished for the act ; but even this may have been only for appearances , to divert the minds of men from all suspicion that <name> could himself have been an accomplice in such a crime .
the whole revolution which has been described in this chapter , from its first <unk> to its final accomplishment , was effected in a very short period of time , and <name> thus found himself very unexpectedly and suddenly elevated to a throne .
harpagus continued in his service , and became subsequently one of his most celebrated generals .

as soon as <name> had become established on his throne as king of the medes and persians , his influence and power began to extend westward toward the confines of the empire of croesus , king of <name> .
croesus was aroused from the dejection and stupor into which the death of his son had plunged him , as related in a former chapter , by this threatening danger .
he began to consider very earnestly what he could do to avert it .
the river <unk> , a great river of <name> minor , which flows northward into the black sea , was the eastern boundary of the lydian empire .
croesus began to entertain the design of raising an army and crossing the <unk> , to invade the empire of <name> , thinking that that would perhaps be safer policy than to wait for <name> to cross the <unk> , and bring the war upon him .
still , the enterprise of invading persia was a vast undertaking , and the responsibility great of being the aggressor in the contest .
after carefully considering the subject in all its aspects , croesus found himself still perplexed and undecided .
the greeks had a method of looking into futurity , and of ascertaining , as they imagined , by supernatural means , the course of future events , which was peculiar to that people ; at least no other nation seems ever to have practiced it in the precise form which prevailed among them .
it was by means of the oracles .
there were four or five localities in the grecian countries which possessed , as the people thought , the property of inspiring persons who visited them , or of giving to some natural object certain supernatural powers by which future events could be foretold .
the three most important of these oracles were situated respectively at delphi , at <unk> , and at the oasis of jupiter ammon .
delphi was a small town built in a sort of valley , shaped like an <unk> , on the southern side of mount <unk> .
mount <unk> is north of the peloponnesus , not very far from the shores of the gulf of corinth .
delphi was in a picturesque and romantic situation , with the mountain behind it , and steep , precipitous rocks descending to the level country before .
these precipices answered instead of walls to defend the <name> and the town .
in very early times a cavern or fissure in the rocks was discovered at delphi , from which there issued a stream of gaseous vapor , which produced strange effects on those who <unk> it .
it was supposed to inspire them .
people resorted to the place to obtain the benefit of these inspirations , and of the knowledge which they imagined they could obtain by means of them .
finally , a <name> was built , and a priestess resided constantly in it , to <unk> the vapor and give the responses .
when she gave her answers to those who came to consult the oracle , she sat upon a sort of <unk> stool , which was called the sacred tripod .
these stools were greatly celebrated as a very important part of the sacred apparatus of the place .
this oracle became at last so renowned , that the greatest potentates , and even kings , came from great distances to consult it , and they made very <name> and costly presents at the shrine when they came .
these presents , it was supposed , tended to induce the god who presided over the oracle to give to those who made them favorable and auspicious replies .
the deity that dictated the predictions of this oracle was apollo .
there was another circumstance , besides the existence of the cave , which <unk> the locality where this oracle was situated .
the people believed that this spot was the exact center of the earth , which of course they considered as one vast plain .
there was an ancient story that jupiter , in order to determine the central point of creation , liberated two eagles at the same time , in opposite quarters of the heavens , that they might fly toward one another , and so <name> the middle point by the place of their meeting .
they met at delphi .
another of the most celebrated oracles was at <unk> .
<unk> was northwest of delphi , in the epirus , which was a country in the western part of what is now turkey in europe , and on the shores of the adriatic sea .
the origin of the oracle at <unk> was , as the priestesses there told herodotus , as follows : in very ancient times , two black doves were set at <name> in thebes , which was a very venerable and sacred city of egypt .
one flew toward the north and the other toward the west .
the former crossed the mediterranean , and then continued its flight over the peloponnesus , and over all the southern provinces of greece , until it reached <unk> .
there it alighted on a <unk> , and said , in a human voice , that that spot was divinely appointed for the seat of a sacred oracle .
the other dove flew to the oasis of jupiter ammon .
there were three priestesses at <unk> in the days of herodotus .
their names were <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
the answers of the oracle were , for a time , obtained by the priestesses from some appearances which they observed in the sacred beech on which the dove alighted , when the tree was agitated by the wind .
in later times , however , the responses were obtained in a still more singular manner .
then was a brazen statue of a man , holding a whip in his hand .
the whip had three lashes , which were formed of brazen chains .
at the end of each chain was an <unk> , as it was called , which was a row of little knots or knobs , such as were commonly appended to the lashes of whips used in those days for <unk> criminals .
these heavy lashes <name> suspended in the hand of the statue over a great brazen <unk> , in such a manner that the wind would <unk> them , from time to time , against its sides , causing the <unk> to ring and resound like a gong .
there was , however , something in this <unk> supernatural and divine ; for , though it was not loud , it was very long continued , when once the margin of the <unk> was touched , however gently , by the lashes .
in fact , it was commonly said that if touched in the morning , it would be night before the <unk> would have died entirely away .
such a belief could be very easily sustained among the common people ; for a large , open-mouthed vessel like the <unk> <unk> , with thin sides formed of sonorous metal , might be kept in a state of continual vibration by the wind alone .
they who wished to consult this oracle came with <name> presents both for the priestesses and for the shrine , and when they had made the offerings , and performed the preliminary ceremonies required , they propounded their questions to the priestesses , who obtained the replies by interpreting , according to certain rules which they had formed , the sounds emitted by the mysterious gong .
the second black dove which took its flight from thebes alighted , as we have already said , in the oasis of jupiter ammon .
this oasis was a small fertile spot in the midst of the deserts of africa , west of egypt , about a hundred miles from the nile , and somewhat nearer than that to the mediterranean sea .
it was first discovered in the following manner : a certain king was marching across the deserts , and his army , having exhausted their supplies of water , were on the point of perishing with thirst , when a ram mysteriously appeared , and took a position before them as their guide .
they followed him , and at length came suddenly upon a green and fertile valley , many miles in length .
the ram conducted them into this valley , and then suddenly vanished , and a copious fountain of water sprung up in the place where he had stood .
the king , in gratitude for this divine interposition , consecrated the spot and built a <name> upon it , which was called the <name> of jupiter ammon .
the dove alighted here , and ever afterward the oracles delivered by the priests of this <name> were considered as divinely inspired .
these three were the most important oracles .
there were , however , many others of subordinate consequence , each of which had its own peculiar ceremonies , all senseless and absurd .
at one there was a sort of <unk> cave in the rocks , the spot being inclosed by an artificial wall .
the cave was about six feet wide and eight feet deep .
the descent into it was by a ladder .
previously to consulting this oracle certain ceremonies were necessary , which it required several days to perform .
the applicant was to offer sacrifices to many different deities , and to purify himself in various ways .
he was then conducted to a stream in the neighborhood of the oracle , where he was to be anointed and washed .
then he drank a certain magical water , called the water of forgetfulness , which made him forget all previous sorrows and cares .
afterward he drank of another enchanted cup , which contained the water of remembrance ; this was to make him remember all that should be communicated to him in the cave .
he then descended the ladder , and received within the cave the responses of the oracle .
at another of these oracles , which was situated in attica , the magic virtue was supposed to reside in a certain marble statue , carved in honor of an ancient and celebrated prophet , and placed in a <name> .
whoever wished to consult this oracle must abstain from wine for three days , and from food of every kind for twenty-four hours preceding the application .
he was then to offer a ram as a sacrifice ; and afterward , taking the skin of the ram from the carcass , he was to spread it out before the statue and lie down upon it to sleep .
the answers of the oracle came to him in his dreams .
but to return to croesus .
he wished to ascertain , by consulting some of these oracles , what the result of his proposed invasion of the dominions of <name> would be , in case he should undertake it ; and in order to determine which of the various oracles were most worthy of reliance , he conceived the plan of putting them all to a preliminary test .
he effected this object in the following manner : he dispatched a number of messengers from sardis , his capital , sending one to each of the various oracles .
he directed these messengers to make their several journeys with all convenient dispatch ; but , in order to provide for any cases of accidental detention or delay , he allowed them all one hundred days to reach their several places of destination .
on the hundredth day from the time of their leaving sardis , they were all to make applications to the oracles , and inquire what croesus , king of <name> , was doing at that time .
of course he did not tell them what he should be doing ; and as the oracles themselves could not possibly know how he was employed by any human powers , their answers would seem to test the validity of their claims to powers divine .
croesus kept the reckoning of the days himself with great care , and at the hour appointed on the hundredth day , he employed himself in boiling the flesh of a turtle and of a lamb together in a brazen vessel .
the vessel was covered with a lid , which was also of brass .
he then awaited the return of the messengers .
they came in due time , one after another , bringing the replies which they had severally obtained .
the replies were all unsatisfactory , except that of the oracle at delphi .
this answer was in verse , as , in fact , the responses of that oracle always were .
the priestess who sat upon the tripod was accustomed to give the replies in an incoherent and <unk> manner , as impostors are very apt to do in uttering prophecies , and then the attendant priests and secretaries wrote them out in verse .
the verse which the messenger brought back from the <unk> tripod was in greek ; but some idea of its style , and the import of it , is conveyed by the following imitation : " i number the sands , i measure the sea , what 's hidden to others is known to me .
the lamb and the turtle are <unk> slow with brass above them and brass below . "
of course , croesus decided that the <unk> oracle was the one that he must rely upon for guidance in respect to his projected campaign .
and he now began to prepare to consult it in a manner corresponding with the vast importance of the subject , and with his own boundless wealth .
he provided the most extraordinary and sumptuous presents .
some of these treasures were to be deposited in the <name> , as sacred gifts , for permanent preservation there .
others were to be offered as a burnt sacrifice in honor of the god .
among the latter , besides an incredible number of living victims , he caused to be prepared a great number of couches , magnificently decorated with silver and gold , and <unk> and other vessels of gold , and dresses of various kinds richly embroidered , and numerous other articles , all intended to be used in the ceremonies preliminary to his application to the oracle .
when the time arrived , a vast concourse of people assembled to witness the spectacle .
the animals were sacrificed , and the people feasted on the flesh ; and when these ceremonies were concluded , the couches , the <unk> , the utensils of every kind , the dresses  every thing , in short , which had been used on the occasion , were heaped up into one great <unk> pile , and set on fire .
every thing that was combustible was consumed , while the gold was melted , and ran into plates of great size , which were afterward taken out from the ashes .
thus it was the workmanship only of these articles which was destroyed and lost by the fire .
the gold , in which the chief value consisted , was saved .
it was gold from the <unk> .
besides these articles , there were others made , far more magnificent and costly , for the <name> itself .
there was a silver cistern or tank , large enough to hold three thousand gallons of wine .
this tank was to be used by the inhabitants of delphi in their great festivals .
there was also a smaller cistern , or immense <unk> , as it might , perhaps , more properly be called , which was made of gold .
there were also many other smaller presents , such as basins , vases , and statues , all of silver and gold , and of the most costly workmanship .
the gold , too , which had been taken from the fire , was cast again , a part of it being formed into the image of a lion , and the rest into large plates of metal for the lion to stand upon .
the image was then set up upon the plates , within the precincts of the <name> .
there was one piece of statuary which croesus presented to the oracle at delphi , which was , in some respects , more extraordinary than any of the rest .
it was called the <unk> .
it was an image representing a woman , a servant in the household of croesus , whose business it was to bake the bread .
the reason that induced croesus to honor this <unk> with a statue of gold was , that on one occasion during his childhood she had saved his life .
the mother of croesus died when he was young , and his father married a second time .
the second wife wished to have some one of her children , instead of croesus , succeed to her husband 's throne .
in order , therefore , to remove croesus out of the way , she prepared some poison and gave it to the <unk> , instructing her to put it into the bread which croesus was to eat .
the <unk> received the poison and promised to obey .
but , instead of doing so , she revealed the intended murder to croesus , and gave the poison to the <name> 's own children .
in gratitude for this fidelity to him , croesus , when he came to the throne , caused this statue to be made , and now he placed it at delphi , where he supposed it would forever remain .
the memory of his faithful servant was indeed <unk> by the measure , though the statue itself , as well as all these other treasures , in process of time disappeared .
in fact , statues of brass or of marble generally make far more <unk> monuments than statues of gold ; and no structure or object of <name> is likely to be very permanent among mankind unless the workmanship is worth more than the material .
croesus did not proceed himself to delphi with these presents , but sent them by the hands of trusty messengers , who were instructed to perform the ceremonies required , to offer the gifts , and then to make inquiries of the oracle in the following terms .
" croesus the sovereign of <name> and of various other kingdoms , in return for the wisdom which has marked your former declarations , has sent you these gifts .
he now furthermore desires to know whether it is safe for him to proceed against the persians , and if so , whether it is best for him to seek the assistance of any allies . "
the answer was as follows : " if croesus crosses the <unk> , and <unk> a war with persia , a mighty empire <name> be overthrown .
it <name> be best for him to form an alliance with the most powerful states of greece . "
croesus was extremely pleased with this response .
he immediately resolved on undertaking the expedition against <name> ; and to express his gratitude for so favorable an answer to his questions , he sent to delphi to inquire what was the number of inhabitants in the city , and , when the answer was reported to him , he sent a present of a sum of money to every one .
the <unk> , in their turn , conferred special privileges and honors upon the <unk> and upon croesus in respect to their oracle , giving them the precedence in all future consultations , and conferring upon them other marks of distinction and honor .
at the time when croesus sent his present to the inhabitants of delphi , he took the opportunity to address another inquiry to the oracle , which was , whether his power would ever decline .
the oracle replied in a <unk> of greek verse , similar in its style to the one recorded on the previous occasion .
it was as follows : " <unk> a mule shall mount upon the median throne , then , and not till then , shall great croesus fear to lose his own . "
this answer pleased the king quite as much as the former one had done .
the allusion to the contingency of a mule 's reigning in media he very naturally regarded as only a <unk> and <unk> mode of expressing an utter impossibility .
croesus considered himself and the continuance of his power as perfectly secure .
he was fully confirmed in his determination to organize his expedition without any delay , and to proceed immediately to the proper measures for obtaining the grecian alliance and aid which the oracle had recommended .
the plans which he formed , and the events which resulted , <name> be described in subsequent chapters .
in respect to these grecian oracles , it is proper here to state , that there has been much discussion among scholars on the question how they were enabled to maintain , for so long a period , so extended a credit among a people as intellectual and well informed as the greeks .
it was doubtless by means of a variety of contrivances and influences that this end was attained .
there is a natural love of the marvelous among the humbler classes in all countries , which leads them to be very ready to believe in what is mystic and supernatural ; and they accordingly exaggerate and color such real incidents as occur under any strange or remarkable circumstances , and invest any unusual phenomena which they witness with a miraculous or supernatural interest .
the cave at delphi might really have emitted gases which would produce quite striking effects upon those who <unk> them ; and how easy it would be for those who witnessed these effects to imagine that some divine and miraculous powers must exist in the <unk> current which produced them .
the priests and priestesses , who inhabited the temples in which these oracles were contained , had , of course , a strong interest in keeping up the belief of their reality in the minds of the community ; so were , in fact , all the inhabitants of the cities which sprung up around them .
they derived their support from the visitors who frequented these places , and they contrived various ways for drawing contributions , both of money and gifts , from all who came .
in one case there was a sacred stream near an oracle , where persons , on permission from the priests , were allowed to bathe .
after the bathing , they were expected to throw pieces of money into the stream .
what afterward , in such cases , became of the money , it is not difficult to imagine .
nor is it necessary to suppose that all these priests and priestesses were impostors .
having been trained up from infancy to believe that the inspirations were real , they would continue to look upon them as such all their lives .
even at the present day we shall all , if we closely <unk> our mental habits , find ourselves continuing to take for granted , in our <unk> years , what we <unk> imbibed or were erroneously taught in infancy , and that , often , in cases where the most obvious dictates of reason , or even the plain testimony of our senses , might show us that our notions are false .
the priests and priestesses , therefore , who imposed on the rest of mankind , may have been as honestly and as deep in the delusion themselves as any of their <unk> .
the answers of the oracles were generally vague and indefinite , and susceptible of almost any interpretation , according to the result .
whenever the event corresponded with the prediction , or could be made to correspond with it by the ingenuity of the <unk> , the story of the coincidence would , of course , be every where spread abroad , becoming more striking and more exact at each repetition .
where there was a failure , it would not be direct and absolute , on account of the <unk> and <unk> of the response , and there would therefore be no interest felt in hearing or in circulating the story .
the cases , thus , which would tend to establish the truth of the oracle , would be universally known and remembered , while those of a contrary bearing would be speedily forgotten .
there is no doubt , however , that in many cases the responses were given in collusion with the one who consulted the oracle , for the purpose of deceiving others .
for example , let us suppose that croesus wished to establish strongly the <unk> of the <unk> oracle in the minds of his countrymen , in order to encourage them to enlist in his armies , and to engage in the enterprise which he was contemplating against <name> with resolution and confidence ; it would have been easy for him to have let the priestess at delphi know what he was doing on the day when he sent to inquire , and thus himself to have directed her answer .
then , when his messengers returned , he would appeal to the answer as proof of the reality of the inspiration which seemed to furnish it .
<name> the great certainly did , in this way , act in collusion with the priests at the <name> of jupiter ammon .
* * * * * the fact that there have been so many and such successful cases of falsehood and imposture among mankind in respect to revelations from heaven , is no indication , as some <unk> suppose , that no revelation is true , but is , on the other hand , strong evidence to the contrary .
the author of human existence has given no instincts in vain ; and the universal tendency of mankind to believe in the supernatural , to look into an unseen world , to seek , and to imagine that they find , revelations from heaven , and to expect a continuance of existence after this earthly life is over , is the strongest possible natural evidence that there is an unseen world ; that man may have true communications with it ; that a personal deity reigns , who <unk> and <unk> of human conduct , and that there is a future state of being .
in this point of view , the absurd oracles of greece , and the universal <unk> which they obtained , constitute strong evidence that there is somewhere to be found inspiration and prophecy really divine .

b.c .

there were , in fact , three inducements which combined their influence on the mind of croesus , in leading him to cross the <unk> , and invade the dominions of the medes and persians : first , he was ambitious to extend his own empire ; secondly , he feared that if he did not attack <name> , <name> would himself cross the <unk> and attack him ; and , thirdly , he felt under some obligation to consider himself the ally of astyages , and thus bound to espouse his cause , and to aid him in putting down , if possible , the usurpation of <name> , and in recovering his throne .
he felt under this obligation because astyages was his brother-in-law ; for the latter had married , many years before , a daughter of <unk> , who was the father of croesus .
this , as croesus thought , gave him a just title to interfere between the <unk> king and the rebel who had <unk> him .
under the influence of all these reasons combined , and encouraged by the responses of the oracle , he determined on attempting the invasion .
the first measure which he adopted was to form an alliance with the most powerful of the states of greece , as he had been directed to do by the oracle .
after much inquiry and consideration , he concluded that the <unk> state was the most powerful .
their chief city was sparta , in the peloponnesus .
they were a warlike , stern , and indomitable race of men , capable of bearing every possible hardship , and of enduring every degree of fatigue and toil , and they desired nothing but military <name> for their reward .
this was a species of wages which it was very easy to pay ; much more easy to furnish than coin , even for croesus , notwithstanding the abundant supplies of gold which he was accustomed to obtain from the sands of the <unk> .
croesus sent embassadors to sparta to inform the people of the plans which he contemplated , and to ask their aid .
he had been instructed , he said , by the oracle at delphi , to seek the alliance of the most powerful of the states of greece , and he accordingly made application to them .
they were gratified with the compliment implied in selecting them , and acceded readily to his proposal .
besides , they were already on very friendly terms with croesus ; for , some years before , they had sent to him to procure some gold for a statue which they had occasion to erect , offering to give an equivalent for the value of it in such productions as their country afforded .
croesus supplied them with the gold that they needed , but generously refused to receive any return .
in the mean time , croesus went on , energetically , at sardis , making the preparations for his campaign .
one of his counselors , whose name was <unk> , ventured , one day , strongly to dissuade him from undertaking the expedition .
" you have nothing to gain by it , " said he , " if you succeed , and every thing to lose if you fail .
consider what sort of people these persians are whom you are going to combat .
they live in the most rude and simple manner , without luxuries , without pleasures , without wealth .
if you conquer their country , you <name> find nothing in it worth bringing away .
on the other hand , if they conquer you , they <name> come like a vast band of <unk> into <name> , where there is every thing to tempt and reward them .
i counsel you to leave them alone , and to remain on this side the <unk> , thankful if <name> <name> be contented to remain on the other . "
but croesus was not in a mood of mind to be persuaded by such reasoning .
when all things were ready , the army commenced its march and moved eastward , through one province of <name> minor after another , until they reached the <unk> .
this river is a considerable stream , which rises in the interior of the country , and flows northward into the <unk> sea .
the army encamped on the banks of it , and some plan was to be formed for crossing the stream .
in accomplishing this object , croesus was aided by a very celebrated engineer who accompanied his army , named <unk> .
<unk> was a native of miletus , and is generally called in history , <unk> the <unk> .
he was a very able mathematician and <unk> , and many accounts remain of the discoveries and performances by which he acquired his renown .
for example , in the course of his travels , he at one time visited egypt , and while there , he contrived a very simple way of measuring the height of the pyramids .
he set up a pole on the plain in an upright position , and then measured the pole and also its shadow .
he also measured the length of the shadow of the pyramid .
he then calculated the height of the pyramid by this proportion : as the length of shadow of the pole is to that of the pole itself , so is the length of the shadow of the pyramid to its height .
<unk> was an astronomer as well as a philosopher and engineer .
he learned more exactly the true length of the year than it had been known before ; and he also made some calculations of <unk> , at least so far as to predict the year in which they would happen .
one eclipse which he predicted happened to occur on the day of a great battle between two contending armies .
it was cloudy , so that the combatants could not see the sun .
this circumstance , however , which concealed the eclipse itself , only made the darkness which was caused by it the more intense .
the armies were much terrified at this sudden cessation of the light of day , and supposed it to be a warning from heaven that they should desist from the combat .
<unk> the <unk> was the author of several of the geometrical <unk> and demonstrations now included in the elements of euclid .
the celebrated fifth proposition of the first book , so famous among all the modern nations of europe as the great stumbling block in the way of beginners in the study of geometry , was his .
the discovery of the truth expressed in this proposition , and of the complicated demonstration which establishes it , was certainly a much greater mathematical performance than the measuring of the altitude of the pyramids by their shadow .
but to return to croesus .
<unk> undertook the work of transporting the army across the river .
he examined the banks , and found , at length , a spot where the land was low and level for some distance from the stream .
he caused the army to be brought up to the river at this point , and to be encamped there , as near to the bank as possible , and in as compact a form .
he then employed a vast number of laborers to cut a new channel for the waters , behind the army , leading out from the river above , and <unk> it again at a little distance below .
when this channel was finished , he turned the river into its new course , and then the army passed without difficulty over the former bed of the stream .
the <unk> being thus passed , croesus moved on in the direction of media .
but he soon found that he had not far to go to find his enemy .
<name> had heard of his plans through deserters and spies , and he had for some time been advancing to meet him .
one after the other of the nations through whose dominions he had passed , he had subjected to his sway , or , at least , brought under his influence by treaties and alliances , and had received from them all re-enforcements to swell the <name> of his army .
one nation only remained  the babylonians .
they were on the side of croesus .
they were jealous of the growing power of the medes and persians , and had made a league with croesus , promising to aid him in the war .
the other nations of the east were in alliance with <name> , and he was slowly moving on , at the head of an immense combined force , toward the <unk> , at the very time when croesus was crossing the stream .
the scouts , therefore , that preceded the army of croesus on its march , soon began to fall back into the camp , with intelligence that there was a large armed force coming on to meet them , the advancing columns filling all the roads , and threatening to overwhelm them .
the scouts from the army of <name> carried back similar intelligence to him .
the two armies accordingly halted and began to prepare for battle .
the place of their meeting was called <unk> .
it was in the province of <unk> , and toward the eastern part of <name> minor .
a great battle was fought at <unk> .
it was continued all day , and remained undecided when the sun went down .
the combatants separated when it became dark , and each withdrew from the field .
each king found , it seems , that his antagonist was more formidable than he had imagined , and on the morning after the battle they both seemed inclined to remain in their respective encampments , without evincing any disposition to renew the contest .
croesus , in fact , seems to have considered that he was fortunate in having so far repulsed the formidable invasion which <name> had been intending for him .
he considered <name> 's army as repulsed , since they had withdrawn from the field , and showed no disposition to return to it .
he had no doubt that <name> would now go back to media again , having found how well prepared croesus had been to receive him .
for himself , he concluded that he ought to be satisfied with the advantage which he had already gained , as the result of one campaign , and return again to sardis to recruit his army , the force of which had been considerably impaired by the battle , and so postpone the grand invasion till the next season .
he accordingly set out on his return .
he dispatched messengers , at the same time , to babylon , to sparta , to egypt , and to other countries with which he was in alliance , informing these various nations of the great battle of <unk> and its results , and asking them to send him , early in the following spring , all the re-enforcements that they could command , to join him in the grand campaign which he was going to make the next season .
he continued his march homeward without any interruption , sending off , from time to time , as he was moving through his own dominions , such portions of his troops as desired to return to their homes , <unk> upon them to come back to him in the spring .
by this temporary <unk> of a portion of his army , he saved the expense of maintaining them through the <name> .
very soon after croesus arrived at sardis , the whole country in the neighborhood of the capital was thrown into a state of universal alarm by the news that <name> was close at hand .
it seems that <name> had remained in the vicinity of <unk> long enough to allow croesus to return , and to give him time to dismiss his troops and establish himself securely in the city .
he then suddenly resumed his march , and came on toward sardis with the utmost possible dispatch .
croesus , in fact , had no announcement of his approach until he heard of his arrival .
all was now confusion and alarm , both within and without the city .
croesus hastily collected all the forces that he could command .
he sent immediately to the neighboring cities , summoning all the troops in them to hasten to the capital .
he enrolled all the inhabitants of the city that were capable of bearing arms .
by these means he collected , in a very short time , quite a formidable force , which he <name> up , in battle array , on a great plain not far from the city , and there waited , with much anxiety and solicitude , for <name> to come on .
the lydian army was superior to that of <name> in cavalry , and as the place where the battle was to be fought was a plain , which was the kind of ground most favorable for the operations of that species of force , <name> felt some solicitude in respect to the impression which might be made by it on his army .
nothing is more terrible than the onset of a squadron of horse when charging an enemy upon the field of battle .
they come in vast bodies , sometimes consisting of many thousands , with the speed of the wind , the men flourishing their <unk> and rending the air with the most unearthly cries , those in advance being driven irresistibly on by the weight and impetus of the masses behind .
the dreadful torrent bears down and <unk> every thing that attempts to resist its way .
they trample one another and their enemies together promiscuously in the dust ; the foremost of the column press on with the utmost fury , afraid quite as much of the headlong torrent of friends coming on behind them , as of the line of fixed and motionless enemies who stand ready to receive them before .
these enemies , stationed to withstand the charge , arrange themselves in triple or quadruple rows , with the shafts of their spears planted against the ground , and the points directed forward and upward to receive the advancing horsemen .
these spears <unk> and kill the foremost horses ; but those that come on behind , leaping and plunging over their fallen companions , soon break through the lines and put their enemies to flight , in a scene of indescribable havoc and confusion .
croesus had large bodies of horse , while <name> had no efficient troops to oppose them .
he had a great number of camels in the rear of his army , which had been employed as beasts of burden to transport the baggage and stores of the army on their march .
<name> concluded to make the experiment of opposing these camels to the cavalry .
it is frequently said by the ancient historians that the horse has a natural antipathy to the camel , and can not bear either the smell or the sight of one , though this is not found to be the case at the present day .
however the fact might have been in this respect , <name> determined to arrange the camels in his front as he advanced into battle .
he accordingly ordered the baggage to be removed , and , releasing their ordinary drivers from the charge of them , he assigned each one to the care of a soldier , who was to mount him , armed with a spear .
even if the supposed antipathy of the horse for the camel did not take effect , <name> thought that their large and heavy bodies , defended by the spears of their riders , would afford the most effectual means of resistance against the shock of the lydian squadrons that he was now able to command .
the battle commenced , and the squadrons of horse came on .
but , as soon as they came near the camels , it happened that , either from the influence of the antipathy above referred to , or from alarm at the novelty of the spectacle of such huge and <unk> beasts , or else because of the substantial resistance which the camels and the spears of their riders made to the shock of their charge , the horses were soon thrown into confusion and put to flight .
in fact , a general panic seized them , and they became totally unmanageable .
some threw their riders ; others , seized with a sort of phrensy , became entirely independent of control .
they turned , and trampled the foot soldiers of their own army under foot , and threw the whole body into disorder .
the consequence was , that the army of croesus was wholly defeated ; they fled in confusion , and crowded in vast throngs through the gates into the city , and fortified themselves there .
<name> advanced to the city , invested it closely on all sides , and commenced a siege .
but the appearances were not very encouraging .
the walls were lofty , thick , and strong , and the <name> within the city were amply sufficient to guard them .
nor was the prospect much more promising of being soon able to reduce the city by famine .
the wealth of croesus had enabled him to lay up almost inexhaustible stores of food and clothing , as well as treasures of silver and gold .
he hoped , therefore , to be able to hold out against the besiegers until help should come from some of his allies .
he had sent messengers to them , asking them to come to his rescue without any delay , before he was shut up in the city .
the city of sardis was built in a position naturally strong , and one part of the wall passed over <name> precipices which were considered entirely impassable .
there was a sort of <name> or <name> gorge in this quarter , outside of the walls , down which dead bodies were thrown on one occasion subsequently , at a time when the city was besieged , and beasts and birds of prey fed upon them there undisturbed , so lonely was the place and so desolate .
in fact , the walls that crowned these precipices were considered absolutely inaccessible , and were very slightly built and very feebly guarded .
there was an ancient legend that , a long time before , when a certain males was king of <name> , one of his wives had a son in the form of a lion , whom they called <name> , and an oracle declared that if this <name> were carried around the walls of the city , it would be rendered impregnable , and should never be taken .
they carried <name> , therefore , around , so far as the regular walls extended .
when they came to this precipice of rocks , they returned , considering that this part of the city was impregnable without any such ceremony .
a spur or eminence from the mountain of <unk> , which was behind the city , projected into it at this point , and there was a strong citadel built upon its summit .
[ illustration : the siege of sardis . ]
<name> continued the siege fourteen days , and then he determined that he must , in some way or other , find the means of carrying it by assault , and to do this he must find some place to scale the walls .
he accordingly sent a party of horsemen around to explore every part , offering them a large reward if they would find any place where an entrance could be effected .
the horsemen made the circuit , and reported that their search had been in vain .
at length a certain soldier , named <unk> , after studying for some time the precipices on the side which had been deemed inaccessible , saw a sentinel , who was stationed on the walls above , leave his post and come climbing down the rocks for some distance to get his helmet , which had accidentally dropped down .
<unk> watched him both as he descended and as he returned .
he reflected on this discovery , communicated it to others , and the <unk> of scaling the rock and the walls at that point was discussed .
in the end , the attempt was made and was successful .
<unk> went up first , followed by a few daring spirits who were ambitious of the <name> of the exploit .
they were not at first observed from above .
the way being thus shown , great <name> followed on , and so large a force succeeded in thus gaining an entrance that the city was taken .
in the dreadful confusion and din of the storming of the city , croesus himself had a very narrow escape from death .
he was saved by the miraculous speaking of his deaf and dumb son  at least such is the story .
<name> had given positive orders to his soldiers , both before the great battle on the plain and during the siege , that , though they might slay <unk> else they pleased , they must not harm croesus , but must take him alive .
during the time of the storming of the town , when the streets were filled with infuriated soldiers , those on the one side wild with the excitement of triumph , and those on the other maddened with rage and despair , a party , rushing along , overtook croesus and his helpless son , whom the unhappy father , it seems , was making a desperate effort to save .
the persian soldiers were about to <unk> croesus with their spears , when the son , who had never spoken before , called out , " it is croesus ; do not kill him . "
the soldiers were arrested by the words , and saved the monarch 's life .
they made him prisoner , and bore him away to <name> .
croesus had sent , a long time before , to inquire of the <unk> oracle by what means the power of speech could be restored to his son .
the answer was , that that was a boon which he had better not ask ; for the day on which he should hear his son speak for the first time , would be the darkest and most unhappy day of his life .
<name> had not ordered his soldiers to spare the life of croesus in battle from any sentiment of humanity toward him , but because he wished to have his case reserved for his own decision .
when croesus was brought to him a captive , he ordered him to be put in chains , and carefully guarded .
as soon as some degree of order was restored in the city , a large funeral pile was erected , by his directions , in a public square , and croesus was brought to the spot .
fourteen lydian young men , the sons , probably , of the most prominent men in the state , were with him .
the pile was large enough for them all , and they were placed upon it .
they were all laid upon the wood .
croesus raised himself and looked around , surveying with extreme consternation and horror the preparations which were making for lighting the pile .
his heart sank within him as he thought of the dreadful fate that was before him .
the spectators stood by in solemn silence , awaiting the end .
croesus broke this awful pause by crying out , in a tone of anguish and despair , " oh solon !
solon !
solon ! "
the officers who had charge of the execution asked him what he meant .
<name> , too , who was himself personally superintending the scene , asked for an explanation .
croesus was , for a time , too much agitated and distracted to reply .
there were difficulties in respect to language , too , which embarrassed the conversation , as the two kings could speak to each other only through an interpreter .
at length croesus gave an account of his interview with solon , and of the sentiment which the philosopher had expressed , that no one could decide whether a man was truly prosperous and happy till it was determined how his life was to end .
<name> was greatly interested in this narrative ; but , in the mean time , the interpreting of the conversation had been slow , a considerable period had elapsed , and the officers had lighted the fire .
the pile had been made extremely combustible , and the fire was rapidly making its way through the whole mass .
<name> eagerly ordered it to be extinguished .
the efforts which the soldiers made for this purpose seemed , at first , likely to be fruitless ; but they were aided very soon by a sudden shower of rain , which , coming down from the mountains , began , just at this time , to fall ; and thus the flames were extinguished , and croesus and the captives saved .
<name> immediately , with a <unk> very common among great monarchs in the treatment of both enemies and favorites , began to consider croesus as his friend .
he ordered him to be unbound , brought him near his person , and treated him with great consideration and honor .
croesus remained after this for a long time with <name> , and accompanied him in his subsequent campaigns .
he was very much incensed at the oracle at delphi for having deceived him by its false responses and predictions , and thus led him into the terrible snare into which he had fallen .
he procured the fetters with which he had been chained when placed upon the pile , and sent them to delphi with orders that they should be thrown down upon the threshold of the <name>  the visible symbol of his captivity and ruin  as a reproach to the oracle for having <unk> him and caused his destruction .
in doing this , the messengers were to ask the oracle whether <unk> like that which had been practiced on croesus was the kind of gratitude it evinced to one who had enriched it by such a profusion of offerings and gifts .
to this the priests of the oracle said in reply , that the destruction of the lydian dynasty had long been decreed by the fates , in retribution for the guilt of gyges , the founder of the line .
he had murdered his master , and usurped the throne , without any title to it whatever .
the judgments of heaven had been denounced upon gyges for this crime , to fall on himself or on some of his descendants .
the <unk> apollo at delphi had done all in his power to postpone the falling of the blow until after the death of croesus , on account of the <unk> <unk> which he had made to the oracle ; but he had been unable to effect it : the decrees of fate were inexorable .
all that the oracle could do was to postpone  as it had done , it said , for three years  the execution of the sentence , and to give croesus warning of the evil that was impending .
this had been done by announcing to him that his crossing the <unk> would cause the destruction of a mighty empire , meaning that of <name> , and also by informing him that when he should find a mule upon the throne of media he must expect to lose his own .
<name> , who was descended , on the father 's side , from the persian stock , and on the mother 's from that of media , was the hybrid sovereign represented by the mule .
when this answer was reported to croesus , it is said that he was satisfied with the explanations , and admitted that the oracle was right , and that he himself had been unreasonable and wrong .
however this may be , it is certain that , among mankind at large , since croesus 's day , there has been a great disposition to overlook whatever of <unk> there may have been in the falsehood and imposture of the oracle , through admiration of the adroitness and dexterity which its ministers evinced in saving themselves from exposure .

in his advance toward the dominions of croesus in <name> minor , <name> had passed to the northward of the great and celebrated city of babylon .
babylon was on the euphrates , toward the southern part of <name> .
it was the capital of a large and very fertile region , which extended on both sides of the euphrates toward the persian gulf .
the limits of the country , however , which was subject to babylon , varied very much at different times , as they were extended or contracted by revolutions and wars .
the river euphrates was the great source of fertility for the whole region through which it flowed .
the country watered by this river was very densely populated , and the inhabitants were industrious and peaceable , cultivating their land , and living quietly and happily on its fruits .
the surface was intersected with canals , which the people had made for conveying the water of the river over the land for the purpose of <unk> it .
some of these canals were navigable .
there was one great trunk which passed from the euphrates to the <unk> , supplying many minor canals by the way , that was navigable for vessels of considerable burden .
the traffic of the country was , however , mainly conducted by means of boats of moderate size , the construction of which seemed to herodotus very curious and remarkable .
the city was enormously large , and required immense supplies of food , which were brought down in these boats from the agricultural country above .
the boats were made in the following manner : first a frame was built , of the shape of the intended boat , broad and shallow , and with the stem and stern of the same form .
this frame was made of willows , like a basket , and , when finished , was covered with a <unk> of skins .
a layer of reeds was then spread over the bottom of the boat to protect the frame , and to distribute evenly the pressure of the cargo .
the boat , thus finished , was laden with the produce of the country , and was then floated down the river to babylon .
in this navigation the boatmen were careful to protect the leather <unk> from injury by avoiding all contact with rocks , or even with the gravel of the shores .
they kept their craft in the middle of the stream by means of two oars , or , rather , an oar and a paddle , which were worked , the first at the bows , and the second at the stern .
the advance of the boat was in some measure accelerated by these boatmen , though their main function was to steer their vessel by keeping it out of eddies and away from projecting points of land , and directing its course to those parts of the stream where the current was swiftest , and where it would consequently be borne forward most rapidly to its destination .
these boats were generally of very considerable size , and they carried , in addition to their cargo and crew , one or more beasts of burden  generally asses or mules .
these animals were allowed the pleasure , if any pleasure it was to them , of sailing thus idly down the stream , for the sake of having them at hand at the end of the voyage , to <name> back again , up the country , the skins , which constituted the most valuable portion of the craft they sailed in .
it was found that these skins , if carefully preserved , could be easily transported up the river , and would answer the purpose of a second voyage .
accordingly , when the boats arrived at babylon , the cargo was sold , the boats were broken up , the skins were folded into packs , and in this form the mules carried them up the river again , the boatmen driving the mules as they walked by their side .
babylon was a city of immense extent and magnitude .
in fact , the accounts given of the space which it covered have often been considered incredible .
these accounts make the space which was included within the walls four or five times as large as london .
a great deal of this space was , however , occupied by parks and gardens connected with the <name> palaces , and by open squares .
then , besides , the houses occupied by the common people in the ancient cities were of fewer stories in height , and consequently more extended on the ground , than those built in modern times .
in fact , it is probable that , in many instances , they were mere ranges of huts and hovels , as is the case , indeed , to a considerable extent , in oriental cities , at the present day , so that it is not at all impossible that even so large an area as four or five times the size of london may have been included within the fortifications of the city .
in respect to the walls of the city , very extraordinary and apparently contradictory accounts are given by the various ancient authors who described them .
some make them seventy-five and others two or three hundred feet high .
there have been many discussions in respect to the comparative <unk> of these several statements , and some ingenious attempts have been made to reconcile them .
it is not , however , at all surprising that there should be such a diversity in the dimensions given , for the <unk> of an ancient city was seldom of the same height in all places .
the structure necessarily varied according to the nature of the ground , being high wherever the ground without was such as to give the enemy an advantage in an attack , and lower in other situations , where the conformation of the surface was such as to afford , of itself , a partial protection .
it is not , perhaps , impossible that , at some particular points  as , for example , across glens and ravines , or along steep declivities  the walls of babylon may have been raised even to the very extraordinary height which herodotus <unk> to them .
the walls were made of bricks , and the bricks were formed of <name> and earth , which was dug from a trench made outside of the lines .
this trench served the purpose of a ditch , to strengthen the fortification when the wall was completed .
the water from the river , and from streams flowing toward the river , was admitted to these ditches on every side , and kept them always full .
the sides of these ditches were lined with bricks too , which were made , like those of the walls , from the earth obtained from the excavations .
they used for all this masonry a cement made from a species of <unk> , which was found in great quantities floating down one of the rivers which flowed into the euphrates , in the neighborhood of babylon .
the river euphrates itself flowed through the city .
there was a <unk> or low wall along the banks of it on either side , with openings at the terminations of the streets leading to the water , and flights of steps to go down .
these openings were secured by gates of brass , which , when closed , would prevent an enemy from gaining access to the city from the river .
the great streets , which terminated thus at the river on one side , extended to the walls of the city on the other , and they were crossed by other streets at right angles to them .
in the outer walls of the city , at the extremities of all these streets , were massive gates of brass , with hinges and frames of the same metal .
there were a hundred of these gates in all .
they were guarded by watch-towers on the walls above .
the watch-towers were built on both the inner and outer faces of the wall , and the wall itself was so broad that there was room between these watch-towers for a chariot and four to drive and turn .
the river , of course , divided the city into two parts .
the king's palace was in the center of one of these divisions , within a vast circular inclosure , which contained the palace buildings , together with the spacious courts , and parks , and gardens pertaining to them .
in the center of the other division was a corresponding inclosure , which contained the great <name> of <unk> .
here there was a very lofty tower , divided into eight separate towers , one above another , with a winding staircase to ascend to the summit .
in the upper story was a sort of chapel , with a couch , and a table , and other furniture for use in the sacred ceremonies , all of gold .
above this , on the highest platform of all , was a grand observatory , where the <unk> <unk> made their celestial observations .
there was a bridge across the river , connecting one section of the city with the other , and it is said that there was a subterranean passage under the river also , which was used as a private communication between two public edifices  palaces or <unk>  which were situated near the extremities of the bridge .
all these constructions were of the most grand and imposing character .
in addition to the architectural magnificence of the buildings , the gates and walls were embellished with a great variety of sculptures : images of animals , of every form and in every attitude ; and men , single and in groups , models of great sovereigns , and representations of hunting scenes , battle scenes , and great events in the <unk> history .
the most remarkable , however , of all the wonders of babylon  though perhaps not built till after <name> 's time  were what were called the hanging gardens .
although called the hanging gardens , they were not suspended in any manner , as the name might denote , but were supported upon arches and walls .
the arches and walls sustained a succession of terraces , rising one above another , with broad flights of steps for ascending to them , and on these terraces the gardens were made .
the upper terrace , or platform , was several hundred feet from the ground ; so high , that it was necessary to build arches upon arches within , in order to attain the requisite elevation .
the lateral thrust of these arches was sustained by a wall twenty-five feet in thickness , which surrounded the garden on all sides , and rose as high as the <unk> tier of arches , upon which would , of course , be concentrated the pressure and weight of all the pile .
the whole structure thus formed a sort of artificial hill , square in form , and rising , in a succession of terraces , to a broad and level area upon the top .
the extent of this grand square upon the summit was four hundred feet upon each side .
the surface which served as the foundation for the gardens that adorned these successive terraces and the area above was formed in the following manner : over the masonry of the arches there was laid a pavement of broad flat stones , sixteen feet long and four feet wide .
over these there was placed a stratum of reeds , laid in <unk> , and above them another flooring of bricks , cemented closely together , so as to be impervious to water .
to make the security complete in this respect , the upper surface of this brick flooring was covered with sheets of lead , overlapping each other in such a manner as to convey all the water which might <unk> through the mold away to the sides of the garden .
the earth and mold were placed upon this surface , thus prepared , and the stratum was so deep as to allow large trees to take root and grow in it .
there was an engine constructed in the middle of the upper terrace , by which water could be drawn up from the river , and distributed over every part of the vast pile .
the gardens , thus completed , were filled to profusion with every species of tree , and plant , and vine , which could produce fruit or flowers to enrich or adorn such a scene .
every country in communication with babylon was made to contribute something to increase the endless variety of <unk> beauty which was here literally <unk> .
gardeners of great experience and skill were constantly employed in cultivating the <unk> , <unk> the fruit-trees and the vines , preserving the walks , and introducing new varieties of vegetation .
in a word , the hanging gardens of babylon became one of the wonders of the world .
the country in the neighborhood of babylon , extending from the river on either hand was in general level and low , and subject to inundations .
one of the sovereigns of the country , a <name> named <unk> , had formed the grand design of constructing an immense lake , to take off the superfluous water in case of a flood , and thus prevent an overflow .
she also opened a great number of lateral and winding channels for the river , wherever the natural disposition of the surface afforded facilities for doing so , and the earth which was taken out in the course of these excavations was employed in raising the banks by artificial terraces , such as are made to confine the mississippi at new orleans , and are there called levees .
[ b ] the object of <unk> in these measures was <unk> .
she wished , in the first place , to open all practicable channels for the flow of the water , and then to confine the current within the channels thus made .
she also wished to make the navigation of the stream as intricate and complicated as possible , so that , while the natives of the country might easily find their way , in boats , to the capital , a foreign enemy , if he should make the attempt , might be confused and lost .
these were the rivers of babylon on the banks of which the captive jews sat down and wept when they remembered zion .
[ footnote b : from the french word <unk> , raised . ]
this <name> <unk> seems to have been quite distinguished for her engineering and architectural plans .
it was she that built the bridge across the euphrates , within the city ; and as there was a feeling of jealousy and ill <name> , as usual in such a case , between the two divisions of the town which the river formed , she caused the bridge to be constructed with a movable platform or draw , by means of which the communication might be cut off at pleasure .
this draw was generally up at night and down by day .
herodotus relates a curious anecdote of this <name> , which , if true , <unk> in another way the peculiar originality of mind and the ingenuity which characterized all her operations .
she caused her tomb to be built , before her death , over one of the principal gates of the city .
upon the <unk> of this monument was a very conspicuous inscription to this effect : " if any one of the sovereigns , my successors , shall be in extreme want of money , let him open my tomb and take what he may think proper ; but let him not resort to this resource unless the urgency is extreme . "
the tomb remained for some time after the <name> 's death quite undisturbed .
in fact , the people of the city avoided this gate altogether , on account of the dead body deposited above it , and the spot became well-nigh deserted .
at length , in process of time , a subsequent sovereign , being in want of money , ventured to open the tomb .
he found , however , no money within .
the gloomy vault contained nothing but the dead body of the <name> , and a label with this inscription : " if your avarice were not as insatiable as it is base , you would not have intruded on the repose of the dead . "
it was not surprising that <name> , having been so successful in his enterprises thus far , should now begin to turn his thoughts toward this great <unk> empire , and to feel a <name> to bring it under his sway .
the first thing , however , was to confirm and secure his lydian conquests .
he spent some time , therefore , in organizing and arranging , at sardis , the affairs of the new government which he was to substitute for that of croesus there .
he designated certain portions of his army to be left for garrisons in the conquered cities .
he appointed persian officers , of course , to command these forces ; but , as he wished to conciliate the <unk> , he appointed many of the municipal and civil officers of the country from among them .
there would appear to be no danger in doing this , as , by giving the command of the army to persians , he retained all the real power directly in his own hands .
one of these civil officers , the most important , in fact , of all , was the grand treasurer .
to him <name> committed the charge of the stores of gold and silver which came into his possession at sardis , and of the revenues which were afterward to <unk> .
<name> appointed a lydian named <unk> to this trust , hoping by such measures to conciliate the people of the country , and to make them more ready to submit to his sway .
things being thus arranged , <name> , taking croesus with him , set out with the main army to return toward the east .
as soon as he had left <name> , <unk> excited the <unk> to revolt .
the name of the commander-in-chief of the military forces which <name> had left was <unk> .
<unk> abandoned the city and retired toward the coast where he contrived to raise a large army , formed partly of <unk> and partly of bodies of foreign troops , which he was enabled to hire by means of the treasures which <name> had put under his charge .
he then advanced to sardis , took possession of the town , and shut up <unk> , with his persian troops , in the citadel .
when the tidings of these events came to <name> , he was very much incensed , and determined to destroy the city .
croesus , however , <unk> very earnestly in its behalf .
he recommended that <name> , instead of burning sardis , should send a sufficient force to <unk> the population , and that he should then <unk> such laws and make such arrangements as should turn the minds of the people to habits of luxury and pleasure .
" by doing this , " said croesus , " the people <name> , in a short time , become so <unk> and so <unk> that you <name> have nothing to fear from them . "
<name> decided on adopting this plan .
he dispatched a median named <unk> , an officer of his army , at the head of a strong force , with orders to go back to sardis , to deliver <unk> from his danger , to seize and put to death all the leaders in the lydian rebellion excepting <unk> .
<unk> was to be saved alive , and sent a prisoner to <name> in persia .
<unk> did not wait for the arrival of <unk> .
as soon as he heard of his approach , he abandoned the ground , and fled <unk> to the city of <unk> , and sought refuge there .
when <unk> had reached sardis and <unk> the government of <name> there , he sent messengers to <unk> , demanding the surrender of the fugitive .
the people of <unk> were uncertain whether they ought to comply .
they said that they must first consult an oracle .
there was a very ancient and celebrated oracle near miletus .
they sent messengers to this oracle , demanding to know whether it were according to the <name> of the gods or not that the fugitive should be surrendered .
the answer brought back was , that they might surrender him .
they were accordingly making arrangements for doing this , when one of the citizens , a very prominent and influential man , named <unk> , expressed himself not satisfied with the reply .
he did not think it possible , he said , that the oracle could really counsel them to deliver up a helpless fugitive to his enemies .
the messengers must have misunderstood or <unk> the answer which they had received .
he finally persuaded his countrymen to send a second embassy : he himself was placed at the head of it .
on their arrival , <unk> addressed the oracle as follows : " to avoid a cruel death from the persians , <unk> , a lydian , fled to us for refuge .
the persians demanded that we should surrender him .
much as we are afraid of their power , we are still more afraid to deliver up a helpless <unk> for protection without clear and decided directions from you . "
the embassy received to this demand the same reply as before .
still <unk> was not satisfied ; and , as if by way of bringing home to the oracle somewhat more forcibly a sense of the true character of such an action as it seemed to recommend , he began to make a circuit in the grove which was around the <name> in which the oracle resided , and to <name> and destroy the nests which the birds had built there , <unk> , apparently , by the sacred repose and <unk> of the scene .
this had the desired effect .
a solemn voice was heard from the interior of the <name> , saying , in a warning tone , " impious man !
how dost thou dare to molest those who have placed themselves under my protection ? "
to this <unk> replied by asking the oracle how it was that it watched over and guarded those who sought its own protection , while it directed the people of <unk> to abandon and betray <unk> for theirs .
to this the oracle answered , " i direct them to do it , in order that such impious men may the sooner bring down upon their heads the judgments of heaven for having dared to entertain even the thought of delivering up a helpless fugitive . "
when this answer was reported to the people of <unk> , they did not dare to give <unk> up , nor , on the other hand , did they dare to incur the enmity of the persians by retaining and protecting him .
they accordingly sent him secretly away .
the emissaries of <unk> , however , followed him .
they kept constantly on his track , demanding him successively of every city where the hapless fugitive sought refuge , until , at length , partly by threats and partly by a reward , they induced a certain city to surrender him .
<unk> sent him , a prisoner , to <name> .
soon after this <unk> himself died , and harpagus was appointed governor of <name> in his stead .
in the mean time , <name> went on with his conquests in the heart of <name> , and at length , in the course of a few years , he had completed his arrangements and preparations for the attack on babylon .
he advanced at the head of a large force to the vicinity of the city .
the king of babylon , whose name was <unk> , withdrew within the walls , shut the gates , and felt perfectly secure .
a simple wall was in those days a very effectual protection against any armed force whatever , if it was only high enough not to be scaled , and thick enough to resist the blows of a battering ram .
the artillery of modern times would have speedily made a fatal breach in such structures ; but there was nothing but the simple force of man , applied through <unk> beams of wood , in those days , and <unk> knew well that his walls would bid all such modes of <unk> a complete defiance .
he stationed his soldiers , therefore , on the walls , and his sentinels in the watch towers , while he himself , and all the nobles of his court , feeling perfectly secure in their impregnable condition , and being abundantly supplied with all the means that the whole empire could furnish , both for sustenance and enjoyment , gave themselves up , in their spacious palaces and gardens , to gayety , festivity , and pleasure .
<name> advanced to the city .
he stationed one large detachment of his troops at the opening in the main walls where the river entered into the city , and another one below , where it issued from it .
these detachments were ordered to march into the city by the bed of the river , as soon as they should observe the water subsiding .
he then employed a vast force of laborers to open new channels , and to widen and deepen those which had existed before , for the purpose of drawing off the waters from their usual bed .
when these passages were thus prepared , the water was let into them one night , at a time previously designated , and it soon ceased to flow through the city .
the detachments of soldiers marched in over the bed of the stream , carrying with them vast <name> of ladders .
with these they easily scaled the low walls which lined the banks of the river , and <unk> was thunderstruck with the announcement made to him in the midst of one of his feasts that the persians were in complete and full possession of the city .

the period of the invasion of <unk> by <name> , and the taking of the city , was during the time while the jews were in captivity there .
<name> was their deliverer .
it results from this circumstance that the name of <name> is connected with sacred history more than that of any other great conqueror of ancient times .
it was a common custom in the early ages of the world for powerful sovereigns to take the people of a conquered country captive , and make them slaves .
they employed them , to some extent , as personal household servants , but more generally as agricultural laborers , to till the lands .
an account of the captivity of the jews in babylon is given briefly in the closing chapters of the second book of chronicles , though many of the attendant circumstances are more fully detailed in the book of <name> .
<name> was a prophet who lived in the time of the captivity .
<unk> , the king of babylon , made repeated incursions into the land of judea , sometimes carrying away the reigning monarch , sometimes deposing him and appointing another sovereign in his stead , sometimes <unk> a tax or tribute upon the land , and sometimes plundering the city , and carrying away all the gold and silver that he could find .
thus the kings and the people were kept in a continual state of anxiety and terror for many years , exposed incessantly to the inroads of this nation of robbers and <unk> , that had , so unfortunately for them , found their way across their frontiers .
king <unk> was the last of this oppressed and unhappy line of jewish kings .
the prophet <name> was accustomed to denounce the sins of the jewish nation , by which these terrible calamities had been brought upon them , with great courage , and with an eloquence solemn and sublime .
he declared that the miseries which the people suffered were the special judgments of heaven , and he proclaimed repeatedly and openly , and in the most public places of the city , still heavier calamities which he said were impending .
the people were troubled and distressed at these prophetic warnings , and some of them were deeply incensed against <name> for uttering them .
finally , on one occasion , he took his stand in one of the public courts of the <name> , and , addressing the concourse of priests and people that were there , he declared that , unless the nation repented of their sins and turned to god , the whole city should be overwhelmed .
even the <name> itself , the sacred house of god , should be destroyed , and the very site abandoned .
the priests and the people who heard this denunciation were greatly exasperated .
they seized <name> , and brought him before a great judicial assembly for trial .
the judges asked him why he uttered such predictions , declaring that by doing so he acted like an enemy to his country and a traitor , and that he deserved to die .
the excitement was very great against him , and the populace could hardly be restrained from open violence .
in the midst of this scene <name> was calm and unmoved , and replied to their accusations as follows : " every thing which i have said against this city and this house , i have said by the direction of the lord jehovah .
instead of resenting it , and being angry with me for delivering my message , it becomes you to look at your sins , and repent of them , and forsake them .
it may be that by so doing god <name> have <name> upon you , and <name> avert the calamities which otherwise <name> most certainly come .
as for myself , here i am in your hands .
<name> can deal with me just as you think best .
<name> can kill me if you <name> , but you may be assured that if you do so , you <name> bring the guilt and the consequences of shedding innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city .
i have said nothing and foretold nothing but by commandment of the lord .
" [ c ] [ footnote c : <name> , <unk> , <unk> . ]
the speech produced , as might have been expected , a great division among the hearers .
some were more angry than ever , and were eager to put the prophet to death .
others defended him , and insisted that he should not die .
the latter , for the time , prevailed .
<name> was set at <name> , and continued his <name> <unk> with the people on account of their sins , and his terrible <unk> of the impending ruin of the city just as before .
these unwelcome truths being so painful for the people to hear , other prophets soon began to appear to utter contrary predictions , for the sake , doubtless , of the popularity which they should themselves acquire by their promises of returning peace and prosperity .
the name of one of these false prophets was <unk> .
on one occasion , <name> , in order to present and enforce what he had to say more effectually on the minds of the people by means of a visible symbol , made a small wooden yoke , by divine direction , and placed it upon his neck , as a token of the bondage which his predictions were threatening .
<unk> took this yoke from his neck and broke it , saying that , as he had thus broken <name> 's wooden yoke , so god would break the yoke of <unk> from all nations within two years ; and then , even those of the jews who had already been taken captive to babylon should return again in peace .
<name> replied that <unk> 's predictions were false , and that , though the wooden yoke was broken , god would make for <unk> a yoke of iron , with which he should bend the jewish nation in a bondage more cruel than ever .
still , <name> himself predicted that after seventy years from the time when the last great captivity should come , the jews should all be restored again to their native land .
he expressed this certain restoration of the jews , on one occasion , by a sort of symbol , by means of which he made a much stronger impression on the minds of the people than could have been done by simple words .
there was a piece of land in the country of <name> , one of the provinces of judea , which belonged to the family of <name> , and it was held in such a way that , by paying a certain sum of money , <name> himself might possess it , the right of redemption being in him .
<name> was in prison at this time .
his uncle 's son came into the court of the prison , and proposed to him to purchase the land .
<name> did so in the most public and formal manner .
the title deeds were drawn up and subscribed , witnesses were summoned , the money weighed and paid over , the whole transaction being regularly completed according to the forms and usages then common for the conveyance of landed property .
when all was finished , <name> gave the papers into the hands of his scribe , directing him to put them safely away and preserve them with care , for after a certain period the country of judea would again be restored to the peaceable possession of the jews , and such titles to land would possess once more their full and original value .
on one occasion , when <name> 's personal <name> was restricted so that he could not utter publicly , himself , his <unk> warnings , he employed <unk> , his scribe , to write them from his dictation , with a view of reading them to the people from some public and frequented part of the city .
the prophecy thus dictated was inscribed upon a roll of parchment .
<unk> waited , when he had completed the writing , until a favorable opportunity occurred for reading it , which was on the occasion of a great festival that was held at jerusalem , and which brought the inhabitants of the land together from all parts of judea .
on the day of the festival , <unk> took the roll in his hand , and stationed himself at a very public place , at the entrance of one of the great courts of the <name> ; there , calling upon the people to hear him , he began to read .
a great concourse gathered around him , and all listened to him with profound attention .
one of the by-standers , however , went down immediately into the city , to the king 's palace , and reported to the king 's council , who were then assembled there , that a great concourse was convened in one of the courts of the <name> , and that <unk> was there reading to them a discourse or prophecy which had been written by <name> .
the members of the council sent a summons to <unk> to come immediately to them , and to bring his writing with him .
when <unk> arrived , they directed him to read what he had written .
<unk> accordingly read it .
they asked him when and how that discourse was written .
<unk> replied that he had written it , word by word , from the dictation of <name> .
the officers informed him that they should be obliged to report the circumstances to the king , and they counseled <unk> to go to <name> and recommend to him to conceal himself , lest the king , in his anger , should do him some sudden and violent injury .
[ d ] [ footnote d : see the account of these transactions in the <unk> chapter of <name> . ]
the officers then , leaving the roll in one of their own apartments , went to the king , and reported the facts to him .
he sent one of his attendants , named <unk> , to bring the roll .
when it came , the king directed <unk> to read it .
<unk> did so , standing by a fire which had been made in the apartment , for it was bitter cold .
after <unk> had read a few pages from the roll , finding that it contained a repetition of the same denunciations and warnings by which the king had often been displeased before , he took a knife and began to cut the parchment into pieces , and to throw it on the fire .
some other persons who were standing by interfered , and earnestly begged the king not to allow the roll to be burned .
but the king did not interfere .
he permitted <unk> to destroy the parchment altogether , and then sent officers to take <name> and <unk> , and bring them to him but they were nowhere to be found .
the prophet , on one occasion , was reduced to extreme distress by the persecutions which his faithfulness , and the incessant urgency of his warnings and <unk> had brought upon him .
it was at a time when the <unk> armies had been driven away from jerusalem for a short period by the egyptians , as one vulture drives away another from its prey .
<name> determined to avail himself of the opportunity to go to the province of <name> , to visit his friends and family there .
he was intercepted , however , at one of the gates , on his way , and accused of a design to make his escape from the city , and go over to the <unk> .
the prophet earnestly denied this charge .
they paid no regard to his declarations , but sent him back to jerusalem , to the officers of the king 's government , who confined him in a house which they used as a prison .
after he had remained in this place of confinement for several days , the king sent and took him from it , and brought him to the palace .
the king inquired whether he had any prophecy to utter from the lord .
<name> replied that the word of the lord was , that the <unk> should certainly return again , and that <unk> himself should fall into their hands , and be carried captive to babylon .
while he thus persisted so strenuously in the declarations which he had made so often before , he demanded of the king that he should not be sent back again to the house of imprisonment from which he had been rescued .
the king said he would not send him back , and he accordingly directed , instead , that he should be taken to the court of the public prison , where his confinement would be less rigorous , and there he was to be supplied daily with food , so long , as the king expressed it , as there should be any food remaining in the city .
but <name> 's enemies were not at rest .
they came again , after a time , to the king , and represented to him that the prophet , by his gloomy and terrible predictions , discouraged and depressed the hearts of the people , and weakened their hands ; that he ought , accordingly , to be regarded as a public enemy ; and they begged the king to proceed decidedly against him .
the king replied that he would give him into their hands , and they might do with him what they pleased .
there was a dungeon in the prison , the only access to which was from above .
prisoners were let down into it with ropes , and left there to die of hunger .
the bottom of it was wet and <unk> , and the prophet , when let down into its gloomy depths , sank into the deep mire .
here he would soon have died of hunger and misery ; but the king , feeling some misgivings in regard to what he had done , lest it might really be a true prophet of god that he had thus delivered into the hands of his enemies , inquired what the people had done with their prisoner ; and when he learned that he had been thus , as it were , buried alive , he immediately sent officers with orders to take him out of the dungeon .
the officers went to the dungeon .
they opened the mouth of it .
they had brought ropes with them , to be used for drawing the unhappy prisoner up , and cloths , also , which he was to fold together and place under his arms , where the ropes were to pass .
these ropes and cloths they let down into the dungeon , and called upon <name> to place them properly around his body .
thus they <name> him safely up out of the dismal den .
these cruel persecutions of the faithful prophet were all unavailing either to silence his voice or to avert the calamities which his warnings portended .
at the appointed time , the judgments which had been so long predicted came in all their terrible reality .
the babylonians invaded the land in great force , and encamped about the city .
the siege continued for two years .
at the end of that time the famine became insupportable .
<unk> , the king , determined to make a <unk> , with as strong a force as he could command , secretly , at night , in hopes to escape with his own life , and intending to leave the city to its fate .
he succeeded in passing out through the city gates with his band of followers , and in actually passing the <unk> lines ; but he had not gone far before his escape was discovered .
he was pursued and taken .
the city was then stormed , and , as usual in such cases , it was given up to plunder and destruction .
vast <name> of the inhabitants were killed ; many more were taken captive ; the principal buildings , both public and private , were burned ; the walls were broken down , and all the public treasures of the jews , the gold and silver vessels of the <name> , and a vast quantity of private plunder , were carried away to babylon by the conquerors .
all this was seventy years before the conquest of babylon by <name> .
[ illustration : raising <name> from the dungeon . ]
of course , during the time of this captivity , a very considerable portion of the inhabitants of judea remained in their native land .
the <unk> of a whole people to a foreign land is impossible .
a vast number , however , of the inhabitants of the country were carried away , and they remained , for two generations , in a miserable bondage .
some of them were employed as agricultural laborers in the rural districts of babylon ; others remained in the city , and were engaged in servile labors there .
the prophet <name> lived in the palaces of the king .
he was summoned , as the reader <name> recollect , to <unk> 's feast , on the night when <name> forced his way into the city , to interpret the mysterious writing on the wall , by which the fall of the <unk> monarchy was announced in so terrible a manner .
one year after <name> had conquered babylon , he issued an edict <unk> the jews to return to jerusalem , and to rebuild the city and the <name> .
this event had been long before predicted by the prophets , as the result which god had determined upon for purposes of his own .
we should not naturally have expected that such a conqueror as <name> would feel any real and honest interest in promoting the designs of god ; but still , in the proclamation which he issued <unk> the jews to return , he acknowledged the supreme divinity of jehovah , and says that he was charged by him with the work of <unk> his <name> , and restoring his worship at its ancient seat on mount zion .
it has , however , been supposed by some scholars , who have examined attentively all the circumstances connected with these transactions , that so far as <name> was influenced by political considerations in ordering the return of the jews , his design was to <unk> that nation as a barrier between his dominions and those of the egyptians .
the egyptians and the <unk> had long been deadly enemies , and now that <name> had become master of the <unk> realms , he would , of course , in assuming their territories and their power , be obliged to defend himself against their foes .
whatever may have been the motives of <name> , he decided to allow the hebrew captives to return , and he issued a proclamation to that effect .
as seventy years had elapsed since the captivity commenced , about two generations had passed away , and there could have been very few then living who had ever seen the land of their fathers .
the jews were , however , all eager to return .
they collected in a vast assembly , with all the treasures which they were allowed to take , and the stores of provisions and baggage , and with horses , and mules , and other beasts of burden to transport them .
when assembled for the march , it was found that the number , of which a very exact census was taken , was forty-nine thousand six hundred and <unk> .
they had also with them seven or eight hundred horses , about two hundred and fifty mules , and about five hundred camels .
the chief part , however , of their baggage and stores was borne by asses , of which there were nearly seven thousand in the train .
the march of this peaceful multitude of families  men , women , and children together  burdened as they went , not with arms and ammunition for conquest and destruction , but with tools and implements for honest industry , and stores of provisions and utensils for the peaceful purposes of social life , as it was , in its bearings and results , one of the grandest events of history , so it must have presented , in its progress , one of the most extraordinary spectacles that the world has ever seen .
the grand caravan pursued its long and <unk> march from babylon to jerusalem without molestation .
all arrived safely , and the people immediately commenced the work of repairing the walls of the city and <unk> the <name> .
when , at length , the foundations of the <name> were laid , a great celebration was held to commemorate the event .
this celebration exhibited a remarkable scene of mingled rejoicing and mourning .
the younger part of the population , who had never seen jerusalem in its former grandeur , felt only exhilaration and <name> at their <unk> in the city of their fathers .
the work of raising the edifice , whose foundations they had laid , was to them simply a new enterprise , and they looked forward to the work of carrying it on with pride and pleasure .
the old men , however , who remembered the former <name> , were filled with mournful recollections of days of prosperity and peace in their childhood and of the magnificence of the former <name> , which they could now never <name> to see realized again .
it was customary in those days , to express sorrow and grief by exclamations and outcries , as gladness and <name> are expressed audibly now .
accordingly , on this occasion , the cries of grief and of bitter regret at the thought of losses which could now never be <unk> , were mingled with the shouts of rejoicing and triumph raised by the ardent and young , who knew nothing of the past , but looked forward with <name> and happiness to the future .
the jews encountered various <unk> , and met with much opposition in their attempts to reconstruct their ancient city , and to <unk> the mosaic ritual there .
we must , however , now return to the history of <name> , referring the reader for a narrative of the circumstances connected with the <unk> of jerusalem to the very minute account given in the sacred books of <name> and <unk> .

in the preceding chapters of this work , we have followed mainly the authority of herodotus , except , indeed , in the account of the visit of <name> to his grandfather in his childhood , which is taken from xenophon .
we shall , in this chapter , relate the story of panthea , which is also one of xenophon 's tales .
we give it as a specimen of the romantic narratives in which xenophon 's history abounds , and on account of the many illustrations of an ancient manners and customs which it contains , leaving it for each reader to decide for himself what weight he <name> attach to its claims to be regarded as veritable history .
we relate the story here in our own language , but as to the facts , we follow faithfully the course of xenophon 's narration .
panthea was a <unk> captive .
she was taken , together with a great many other captives and much plunder , after one of the great battles which <name> fought with the <unk> .
her husband was an assyrian general , though he himself was not captured at this time with his wife .
the spoil which came into possession of the army on the occasion of the battle in which panthea was taken was of great value .
there were beautiful and costly suits of arms , <name> tents made of splendid materials and highly ornamented , large sums of money , vessels of silver and gold , and slaves  some prized for their beauty , and others for certain accomplishments which were highly valued in those days .
<name> appointed a sort of commission to divide this spoil .
he pursued always a very generous policy on all these occasions , showing no <name> to secure such treasures to himself , but distributing them with profuse liberality among his officers and soldiers .
the commissioners whom he appointed in this case divided the spoil among the various generals of the army , and among the different bodies of soldiery , with great impartiality .
among the prizes assigned to <name> were two singing women of great fame , and this <unk> <name> .
<name> thanked the <unk> for the share of booty which they had thus assigned to him , but said that if any of his friends wished for either of these captives , they could have them .
an officer asked for one of the singers .
<name> gave her to him immediately , saying , " i consider myself more obliged to you for asking her , than you are to me for giving her to you . "
as for the <unk> <name> , <name> had not yet seen her , but he called one of his most intimate and confidential friends to him , and requested him to take her under his charge .
the name of this officer was araspes .
he was a <unk> , and he had been <name> 's particular friend and playmate when he was a boy , visiting his grandfather in media .
the reader <name> perhaps recollect that he is mentioned toward the close of our account of that visit , as the special favorite to whom <name> presented his robe or mantle when he took leave of his friends in returning to his native land .
araspes , when he received this charge , asked <name> whether he had himself seen the <name> .
<name> replied that he had not .
araspes then proceeded to give an account of her .
the name of her husband was abradates , and he was the king of susa , as they termed him .
the reason why he was not taken prisoner at the same time with his wife was , that when the battle was fought and the assyrian camp captured , he was absent , having gone away on an embassage to another nation .
this circumstance shows that abradates , though called a king , could hardly have been a sovereign and independent <name> , but rather a governor or viceroy  those words expressing to our minds more truly the station of such a sort of king as could be sent on an embassy .
araspes went on to say that , at the time of their making the capture , he , with some others , went into panthea 's tent , where they found her and her attendant ladies sitting on the ground , with veils over their faces , patiently awaiting their doom .
notwithstanding the concealment produced by the attitudes and dress of these ladies , there was something about the air and figure of panthea which showed at once that she was the <name> .
the leader of araspes 's party asked them all to rise .
they did so , and then the superiority of panthea was still more apparent than before .
there was an extraordinary <name> and beauty in her attitude and in all her motions .
she stood in a dejected posture , and her countenance was sad , though inexpressibly lovely .
she endeavored to appear calm and composed , though the tears had evidently been falling from her eyes .
the soldiers pitied her in her distress , and the leader of the party attempted to console her , as araspes said , by telling her that she had nothing to fear ; that they were aware that her husband was a most worthy and excellent man ; and although , by this capture , she was lost to him , she would have no cause to regret the event , for she would be reserved for a new husband not at all inferior to her former one either in person , in understanding , in rank , or in power .
these <unk> attempts at consolation did not appear to have the good effect desired .
they only awakened panthea 's grief and suffering anew .
the tears began to fall again faster than before .
her grief soon became more and more uncontrollable .
she sobbed and cried aloud , and began to wring her hands and tear her mantle  the customary oriental expression of <unk> sorrow and despair .
araspes said that in these gesticulations her neck , and hands , and a part of her face appeared , and that she was the most beautiful woman that he had ever beheld .
he wished <name> to see her .
<name> said , " no ; he would not see her by any means . "
araspes asked him why .
he said that there would be danger that he should forget his duty to the army , and lose his interest in the great military enterprise in which he was engaged , if he should allow himself to become captivated by the charms of such a <name> , as he very probably would be if he were now to visit her .
araspes said in reply that <name> might at least see her ; as to becoming captivated with her , and devoting himself to her to such a degree as to neglect his other duties , he could certainly control himself in respect to that danger .
<name> said that it was not certain that he could so control himself ; and then there followed a long discussion between <name> and araspes , in which araspes maintained that every man had the command of his own heart and affections , and that , with proper determination and energy , he could direct the channels in which they should run , and confine them within such limits and bounds as he pleased .
<name> , on the other hand , maintained that human passions were stronger than the human <name> ; that no one could rely on the strength of his resolutions to control the impulses of the heart once strongly excited , and that a man 's only safety was in controlling the circumstances which tended to excite them .
this was specially true , he said , in respect to the passion of love .
the experience of mankind , he said , had shown that no strength of moral principle , no firmness of purpose , no <unk> of resolution , no degree of suffering , no fear of shame , was sufficient to control , in the hearts of men , the impetuosity of the passion of love , when it was once fairly awakened .
in a word , araspes advocated , on the subject of love , a sort of new school philosophy , while that of <name> leaned very seriously toward the old .
in conclusion , <name> <unk> counseled araspes to beware lest he should prove that love was stronger than the <name> by becoming himself <unk> of the beautiful <unk> <name> .
araspes said that <name> need not fear ; there was no danger .
he must be a miserable wretch indeed , he said , who could not summon within him sufficient resolution and energy to control his own passions and desires .
as for himself , he was sure that he was safe .
as usual with those who are <unk> and <unk> , araspes failed when the time of trial came .
he took charge of the <name> captive whom <name> committed to him with a very firm resolution to be faithful to his trust .
he pitied the unhappy <name> 's misfortunes , and admired the heroic <name> and gentleness of spirit with which she bore them .
the beauty of her countenance , and her thousand personal charms , which were all heightened by the expression of sadness and sorrow which they bore , touched his heart .
it gave him pleasure to <name> her every indulgence consistent with her condition of captivity , and to do every thing in his power to promote her welfare .
she was very grateful for these favors , and the few brief words and looks of kindness with which she returned them repaid him for his efforts to please her a <unk> .
he saw her , too , in her tent , in the presence of her maidens , at all times ; and as she looked upon him as only her <unk> and guard , and as , too , her mind was wholly occupied by the thoughts of her absent husband and her hopeless grief , her actions were entirely free and <unk> in his presence .
this made her only the more attractive ; every attitude and movement seemed to possess , in araspes 's mind , an inexpressible charm .
in a word , the result was what <name> had predicted .
araspes became wholly absorbed in the interest which was awakened in him by the charms of the beautiful captive .
he made many resolutions , but they were of no avail .
while he was away from her , he felt strong in his determination to yield to these feelings no more ; but as soon as he came into her presence , all these resolutions melted wholly away , and he yielded his heart entirely to the control of emotions which , however <unk> they might appear at a distance , were found , when the time of trial came , to possess a certain mysterious and magic power , which made it most delightful for the heart to yield before them in the contest , and utterly impossible to stand firm and resist .
in a word , when seen at a distance , love appeared to him an enemy which he was ready to brave , and was sure that he could overcome ; but when near , it transformed itself into the guise of a friend , and he accordingly threw down the arms with which he had intended to combat it , and gave himself up to it in a delirium of pleasure .
things continued in this state for some time .
the army advanced from post to post , and from encampment to encampment , taking the captives in their train .
new cities were taken , new provinces overrun , and new plans for future conquests were formed .
at last a case occurred in which <name> wished to send some one as a spy into a distant <unk> country .
the circumstances were such that it was necessary that a person of considerable intelligence and rank should go , as <name> wished the messenger whom he should send to make his way to the court of the sovereign , and become personally acquainted with the leading men of the state , and to examine the general resources of the kingdom .
it was a very different case from that of an ordinary spy , who was to go into a neighboring camp merely to report the <name> and disposition of an organized army .
<name> was uncertain whom he should send on such an embassy .
in the mean time , araspes had ventured to express to panthea his love for her .
she was offended .
in the first place , she was faithful to her husband , and did not wish to receive such addresses from any person .
then , besides , she considered araspes , having been placed in charge of her by <name> , his master , only for the purpose of keeping her safely , as guilty of a betrayal of his trust in having dared to <name> and express sentiments of affection for her himself .
she , however , forbore to reproach him , or to complain of him to <name> .
she simply repelled the advances that he made , supposing that , if she did this with firmness and decision , araspes would feel rebuked and would say no more .
it did not , however , produce this effect .
araspes continued to <unk> her with declarations of love , and at length she felt compelled to appeal to <name> .
<name> , instead of being incensed at what might have been considered a betrayal of trust on the part of araspes , only laughed at the failure and fall in which all his favorite 's promises and <unk> had ended .
he sent a messenger to araspes to caution him in regard to his conduct , telling him that he ought to respect the feelings of such a woman as panthea had proved herself to be .
the messenger whom <name> sent was not content with delivering his message as <name> had dictated it .
he made it much more stern and severe .
in fact , he reproached the lover , in a very harsh and bitter manner , for indulging such a passion .
he told him that he had betrayed a sacred trust reposed in him , and acted in a manner at once impious and unjust .
araspes was overwhelmed with remorse and anguish , and with fear of the consequences which might ensue , as men are when the time arrives for being called to account for <unk> which , while they were committing them , gave them little concern .
when <name> heard how much araspes had been distressed by the message of reproof which he had received , and by his fears of punishment , he sent for him .
araspes came .
<name> told him that he had no occasion to be alarmed .
" i do not wonder , " said he , " at the result which has happened .
we all know how difficult it is to resist the influence which is exerted upon our minds by the charms of a beautiful woman , when we are thrown into circumstances of familiar intercourse with her .
whatever of wrong there has been ought to be considered as more my fault than yours .
i was wrong in placing you in such circumstances of temptation , by giving you so beautiful a woman in charge . "
araspes was very much struck with the generosity of <name> , in thus endeavoring to soothe his anxiety and remorse , and taking upon himself the responsibility and the blame .
he thanked <name> very earnestly for his kindness ; but he said that , notwithstanding his <unk> willingness to forgive him , he felt still oppressed with grief and concern , for the knowledge of his fault had been spread abroad in the army ; his enemies were rejoicing over him , and were <unk> his disgrace and ruin ; and some persons had even advised him to make his escape , by <unk> before any worse calamity should befall him .
" if this is so , " said <name> , " it puts it in your power to render me a very essential service . "
<name> then explained to araspes the necessity that he was under of finding some confidential agent to go on a secret mission into the enemy 's country , and the importance that the messenger should go under such circumstances as not to be suspected of being <name> 's friend in disguise .
" you can pretend to <unk> , " said he ; " it <name> be immediately said that you fled for fear of my displeasure .
i <name> pretend to send in pursuit of you .
the news of your evasion <name> spread rapidly , and <name> be carried , doubtless , into the enemy 's country ; so that , when you arrive there , they <name> be prepared to welcome you as a deserter from my cause , and a <unk> . "
this plan was agreed upon , and araspes prepared for his departure .
<name> gave him his instructions , and they concerted together the information  fictitious , of course  which he was to communicate to the enemy in respect to <name> 's situation and designs .
when all was ready for his departure , <name> asked him how it was that he was so willing to separate himself thus from the beautiful panthea .
he said in reply , that when he was absent from panthea , he was capable of easily forming any determination , and of pursuing any line of conduct that his duty required , while yet , in her presence , he found his love for her , and the impetuous feelings to which it gave rise , wholly and absolutely uncontrollable .
as soon as araspes was gone , panthea , who supposed that he had really fled for fear of the indignation of the king , in consequence of his <unk> to his trust , sent to <name> a message , expressing her regret at the unworthy conduct and the flight of araspes , and saying that she could , and gladly would , if he consented , repair the loss which the desertion of araspes occasioned by sending for her own husband .
he was , she said , dissatisfied with the government under which he lived , having been cruelly and <unk> treated by the <name> .
" if you <name> allow me to send for him , " she added , " i am sure he <name> come and join your army ; and i assure you that you <name> find him a much more faithful and devoted servant than araspes has been . "
<name> consented to this proposal , and panthea sent for abradates .
abradates came at the head of two thousand horse , which formed a very important addition to the forces under <name> 's command .
the meeting between panthea and her husband was joyful in the extreme .
when abradates learned from his wife how honorable and kind had been the treatment which <name> had rendered to her , he was overwhelmed with a sense of gratitude , and he declared that he would do the utmost in his power to <unk> the obligations he was under .
abradates entered at once , with great ardor and zeal , into plans for making the force which he had brought as efficient as possible in the service of <name> .
he observed that <name> was interested , at that time , in attempting to build and equip a corps of armed chariots , such as were often used in fields of battle in those days .
this was a very expensive sort of force , corresponding , in that respect , with the artillery used in modern times .
the carriages were heavy and strong , and were drawn generally by two horses .
they had short , <unk> blades of steel projecting from the <unk> on each side , by which the ranks of the enemy were <unk> down when the carriages were driven among them .
the chariots were made to contain , besides the driver of the horses , one or more warriors , each armed in the <unk> manner .
these warriors stood on the floor of the vehicle , and fought with javelins and spears .
the great plains which abound in the interior countries of <name> were very favorable for this species of warfare .
[ illustration : the war chariot of abradates . ]
abradates immediately fitted up for <name> a hundred such chariots at his own expense , and provided horses to draw them from his own troop .
he made one chariot much larger than the rest , for himself , as he intended to take command of this corps of chariots in person .
his own chariot was to be drawn by eight horses .
his wife panthea was very much interested in these preparations .
she wished to do something herself toward the outfit .
she accordingly furnished , from her own private treasures , a helmet , a <unk> , and <unk> of gold .
these articles formed a suit of armor sufficient to cover all that part of the body which would be exposed in standing in the chariot .
she also provided <unk> and <unk> of brass for the horses .
the whole chariot , thus equipped , with its eight horses in their <name> trappings and resplendent armor , and with abradates standing within it , clothed in his <unk> of gold , presented , as it drove , in the sight of the whole army , around the plain of the encampment , a most imposing spectacle .
it was a worthy leader , as the spectators thought , to head the formidable column of a hundred similar engines which were to follow in its train .
if we imagine the havoc which a hundred <unk> carriages would produce when driven , with headlong fury , into dense masses of men , on a vast open plain , we shall have some idea of one item of the horrors of ancient war .
the full splendor of abradates 's <unk> were not , however , displayed at first , for panthea kept what she had done a secret for a time , intending to reserve her contribution for a parting present to her husband when the period should arrive for going into battle .
she had accordingly taken the measure for her work by stealth , from the armor which abradates was accustomed to wear , and had caused the <unk> to make the golden pieces with the utmost secrecy .
besides the substantial defenses of gold which she provided , she added various other articles for ornament and decoration .
there was a purple robe , a crest for the helmet , which was of a <name> color , plumes , and likewise bracelets for the wrists .
panthea kept all these things herself until the day arrived when her husband was going into battle for the first time with his train , and then , when he went into his tent to prepare himself to ascend his chariot , she brought them to him .
abradates was astonished when he saw them .
he soon understood how they had been provided , and he exclaimed , with a heart full of surprise and pleasure , " and so , to provide me with this splendid armor and dress , you have been depriving yourself of all your finest and most beautiful ornaments ! "
" no , " said panthea , " you are yourself my finest ornament , if you appear in other people 's eyes as you do in mine , and i have not deprived myself of you . "
the appearance which abradates made in other people 's eyes was certainly very splendid on this occasion .
there were many spectators present to see him mount his chariot and drive away ; but so great was their admiration of panthea 's affection and regard for her husband , and so much impressed were they with her beauty , that the great chariot , the resplendent horses , and the grand warrior with his armor of gold , which the magnificent equipage was intended to convey , were , all together , scarcely able to draw away the eyes of the spectators from her .
she stood , for a while , by the side of the chariot , addressing her husband in an under tone , reminding him of the obligations which they were under to <name> for his generous and <name> treatment of her , and urging him , now that he was going to be put to the test , to redeem the promise which she had made in his name , that <name> would find him faithful , brave , and true .
the driver then closed the door by which abradates had mounted , so that panthea was separated from her husband , though she could still see him as he stood in his place .
she gazed upon him with a countenance full of affection and solicitude .
she kissed the margin of the chariot as it began to move away .
she walked along after it as it went , as if , after all , she could not bear the separation .
abradates turned , and when he saw her coming on after the carriage , he said , waving his hand for a parting salutation , " farewell , panthea ; go back now to your tent , and do not be anxious about me .
farewell . "
panthea turned  her attendants came and took her away  the spectators all turned , too , to follow her with their eyes , and no one paid any regard to the chariot or to abradates until she was gone .
on the field of battle , before the engagement commenced , <name> , in passing along the lines , paused , when he came to the chariots of abradates , to examine the arrangements which had been made for them , and to converse a moment with the chief .
he saw that the chariots were drawn up in a part of the field where there was opposed to them a very formidable array of egyptian soldiers .
the egyptians in this war were allies of the enemy .
abradates , leaving his chariot in the charge of his driver , descended and came to <name> , and remained in conversation with him for a few moments , to receive his last orders .
<name> directed him to remain where he was , and not to attack the enemy until he received a certain signal .
at length the two chieftains separated ; abradates returned to his chariot , and <name> moved on .
abradates then moved slowly along his lines , to encourage and animate his men , and to give them the last directions in respect to the charge which they were about to make on the enemy when the signal should be given .
all eyes were turned to the magnificent spectacle which his equipage presented as it advanced toward them ; the chariot , moving slowly along the line , the tall and <unk> form of its commander rising in the center of it , while the eight horses , animated by the sound of the trumpets , and by the various excitements of the scene , stepped proudly , their brazen armor clanking as they came .
when , at length , the signal was given , abradates , calling on the other chariots to follow , put his horses to their speed , and the whole line rushed impetuously on to the attack of the egyptians .
war horses , properly trained to their work , <name> fight with their hoofs with almost as much reckless determination as men <name> with spears .
they rush madly on to encounter whatever opposition there may be before them , and strike down and leap over whatever comes in their way , as if they fully understood the nature of the work that their riders or drivers were wishing them to do .
<name> , as he passed along from one part of the battle field to another , saw the horses of <unk> line dashing thus impetuously into the thickest ranks of the enemy .
the men , on every side , were beaten down by the horses ' hoofs , or <unk> by the wheels , or cut down by the <unk> ; and they who here and there escaped these dangers , became the aim of the soldiers who stood in the chariots , and were transfixed with their spears .
the heavy wheels rolled and jolted mercilessly over the bodies of the wounded and the fallen , while the <unk> caught hold of and cut through every thing that came in their way  whether the shafts of javelins and spears , or the limbs and bodies of men  and tore every thing to pieces in their terrible career .
as <name> rode rapidly by , he saw abradates in the midst of this scene , driving on in his chariot , and shouting to his men in a phrensy of excitement and triumph .
the battle in which these events occurred was one of the greatest and most important which <name> fought .
he gained the victory .
his enemies were every where routed and driven from the field .
when the contest was at length decided , the army desisted from the slaughter and encamped for the night .
on the following day , the generals assembled at the tent of <name> to discuss the arrangements which were to be made in respect to the disposition of the captives and of the spoil , and to the future movements of the army .
abradates was not there .
for a time , <name> , in the excitement and confusion of the scene did not observe his absence .
at length he inquired for him .
a soldier present told him that he had been killed from his chariot in the midst of the egyptians , and that his wife was at that moment attending to the interment of the body , on the banks of a river which flowed near the field of battle .
<name> , on hearing this , uttered a loud exclamation of astonishment and sorrow .
he dropped the business in which he had been engaged with his council , mounted his horse , commanded attendants to follow him with every thing that could be necessary on such an occasion , and then , asking those who knew to lead the way , he drove off to find panthea .
when he arrived at the spot , the dead body of abradates was lying upon the ground , while panthea sat by its side , holding the head in her lap , overwhelmed herself with unutterable sorrow .
<name> leaped from his horse , knelt down by the side of the corpse , saying , at the same time , " alas !
thou brave and faithful soul , and <name> thou gone ? "
at the same time , he took hold of the hand of abradates ; but , as he attempted to raise it , the arm came away from the body .
it had been cut off by an egyptian sword .
<name> was himself shocked at the spectacle , and panthea 's grief broke forth anew .
she cried out with bitter anguish , replaced the arm in the position in which she had arranged it before , and told <name> that the rest of the body was in the same condition .
whenever she attempted to speak , her sobs and tears almost prevented her utterance .
she bitterly reproached herself for having been , perhaps , the cause of her husband 's death , by urging him , as she had done , to fidelity and courage when he went into battle .
" and now , " she said , " he is dead , while i , who urged him forward into the danger , am still alive . "
<name> said what he could to console panthea 's grief ; but he found it utterly <unk> .
he gave directions for furnishing her with every thing which she could need , and promised her that he would make ample arrangements for providing for her in future .
" you shall be treated , " he said , " while you remain with me , in the most honorable manner ; or if you have any friends whom you wish to join , you shall be sent to them safely whenever you please . "
panthea thanked him for his kindness .
she had a friend , she said , whom she wished to join , and she would let him know in due time who it was .
in the mean time , she wished that <name> would leave her alone , for a while , with her servants , and her <unk> , and the dead body of her husband .
<name> accordingly withdrew .
as soon as he had gone , panthea sent away the servants also , retaining the <unk> alone .
the <unk> began to be anxious and concerned at witnessing these mysterious arrangements , as if they portended some new calamity .
she wondered what her mistress was going to do .
her doubts were dispelled by seeing panthea produce a sword , which she had kept concealed hitherto beneath her robe .
her maid begged her , with much earnestness and many tears , not to destroy herself ; but panthea was immovable .
she said she could not live any longer .
she directed the maid to envelop her body , as soon as she was dead , in the same mantle with her husband , and to have them both deposited together in the same grave ; and before her stupefied attendant could do any thing to save her , she sat down by the side of her husband 's body , laid her head upon his breast , and in that position gave herself the fatal wound .
in a few minutes she ceased to breathe .
* * * * * <name> expressed his respect for the memory of abradates and panthea by erecting a lofty monument over their common grave .

we have given the story of panthea , as contained in the preceding chapter , in our own language , it is true , but without any intentional addition or embellishment whatever .
each reader <name> judge for himself whether such a narrative , written for the entertainment of vast assemblies at public games and celebrations , is most properly to be regarded as an invention of romance , or as a simple record of veritable history .
a great many extraordinary and dramatic incidents and adventures , similar in general character to the story of panthea , are <unk> with the narrative in xenophon 's history .
there are also , besides these , many long and minute details of dialogues and conversations , which , if they had really occurred , would have required a very high degree of skill in <unk> to produce such reports of them as xenophon has given .
the incidents , too , out of which these conversations grew , are worthy of attention , as we can often judge , by the nature and character of an incident described , whether it is one which it is probable might actually occur in real life , or only an invention intended to furnish an opportunity and a pretext for the <unk> of the sentiments , or the expression of the views of the different speakers .
it was the custom in ancient days , much more than it is now , to attempt to add to the point and spirit of a discussion , by presenting the various views which the subject naturally elicited in the form of a conversation arising out of circumstances invented to sustain it .
the incident in such cases was , of course , a fiction , contrived to furnish points of attachment for the dialogue  a sort of trellis , constructed artificially to support the vine .
we shall present in this chapter some specimens of these conversations , which <name> give the reader a much more distinct idea of the nature of them than any general description can convey .
at one time in the course of <name> 's career , just after he had obtained some great victory , and was celebrating his triumphs , in the midst of his armies , with spectacles and games , he instituted a series of races , in which the various nations that were represented in his army furnished their several champions as competitors the army marched out from the city which <name> had captured , and where he was then residing , in a procession of the most imposing magnificence .
animals intended to be offered in sacrifice , caparisoned in trappings of gold , horsemen most sumptuously equipped , chariots of war splendidly built and adorned , and banners and trophies of every kind , were conspicuous in the train .
when the vast procession reached the <unk> , the immense concourse was formed in ranks around it , and the racing went on .
when it came to the turn of the sacian nation to enter the course , a private man , of no apparent importance in respect to his rank or standing , came forward as the champion ; though the man appeared insignificant , his horse was as fleet as the wind .
he flew around the arena with astonishing speed , and came in at the goal while his competitor was still midway of the course .
every body was astonished at this performance .
<name> asked the sacian whether he would be willing to sell that horse , if he could receive a kingdom in exchange for it  kingdoms being the coin with which such sovereigns as <name> made their purchases .
the sacian replied that he would not sell his horse for any kingdom , but that he would readily give him away to oblige a worthy man .
" come with me , " said <name> , " and i <name> show you where you may throw blindfold , and not miss a worthy man . "
so saying , <name> conducted the sacian to a part of the field where a number of his officers and attendants were moving to and fro , mounted upon their horses , or seated in their chariots of war .
the sacian took up a hard clod of earth from a bank as he walked along .
at length they were in the midst of the group .
" throw ! "
said <name> .
the sacian shut his eyes and threw .
it happened that , just at that instant , an officer named pheraulas was riding by .
he was conveying some orders which <name> had given him to another part of the field .
pheraulas had been originally a man of humble life , but he had been advanced by <name> to a high position on account of the great fidelity and zeal which he had evinced in the performance of his duty .
the clod which the sacian threw struck pheraulas in the mouth , and wounded him severely .
now it is the part of a good soldier to stand at his post or to press on , in obedience to his orders , as long as any physical capacity remains ; and pheraulas , true to his military obligation , rode on without even turning to see whence and from what cause so unexpected and violent an assault had proceeded .
the sacian opened his eyes , looked around , and coolly asked who it was that he had hit .
<name> pointed to the horseman who was riding rapidly away , saying , " that is the man , who is riding so fast past those chariots yonder .
you hit him . "
" why did he not turn back , then ? "
asked the sacian .
" it is strange that he did not , " said <name> ; " he must be some madman . "
the sacian went in pursuit of him .
he found pheraulas with his face covered with blood and dirt , and asked him if he had received a blow .
" i have , " said pheraulas , " as you see . "
" then , " said the sacian , " i make you a present of my horse . "
pheraulas asked an explanation .
the sacian accordingly gave him an account of what had taken place between himself and <name> , and said , in the end , that he gladly gave him his horse , as he , pheraulas , had so <unk> proved himself to be a most worthy man .
pheraulas accepted the present , with many thanks , and he and the sacian became thereafter very strong friends .
some time after this , pheraulas invited the sacian to an entertainment , and when the hour arrived , he set before his friend and the other guests a most sumptuous feast , which was served in vessels of gold and silver , and in an apartment furnished with carpets , and <unk> , and couches of the most gorgeous and splendid description .
the sacian was much impressed with this magnificence , and he asked pheraulas whether he had been a <name> man at home , that is , before he had joined <name> 's army .
pheraulas replied that he was not then <name> .
his father , he said , was a farmer , and he himself had been accustomed in early life to till the ground with the other laborers on his father 's farm .
all the wealth and luxury which he now enjoyed had been bestowed upon him , he said , by <name> .
" how fortunate you are ! "
said the sacian ; " and it must be that you enjoy your present riches all the more highly on account of having experienced in early life the inconveniences and ills of poverty .
the pleasure must be more intense in having desires which have long been felt gratified at last than if the objects which they rested upon had been always in one 's possession . "
" you imagine , i suppose , " replied pheraulas , " that i am a great deal happier in consequence of all this wealth and splendor ; but it is not so .
as to the real enjoyments of which our natures are capable , i can not receive more now than i could before .
i can not eat any more , drink any more , or sleep any more , or do any of these things with any more pleasure than when i was poor .
all that i gain by this abundance is , that i have more to watch , more to guard , more to take care of .
i have many servants , for whose wants i have to provide , and who are a constant source of solicitude to me .
one calls for food , another for clothes , and a third is sick , and i must see that he has a physician .
my other possessions , too , are a constant care .
a man comes in , one day , and brings me sheep that have been torn by the wolves ; and , on another day , tells me of oxen that have fallen from a precipice , or of a distemper which has broken out among the flocks or herds .
my wealth , therefore , brings me only an increase of anxiety and trouble , without any addition to my joys . "
" but those things , " said the sacian , " which you name , must be unusual and extraordinary occurrences .
when all things are going on prosperously and well with you , and you can look around on all your possessions and feel that they are yours , then certainly you must be happier than i am . "
" it is true , " said pheraulas , " that there is a pleasure in the possession of wealth , but that pleasure is not great enough to balance the suffering which the calamities and losses inevitably connected with it occasion .
that the suffering occasioned by losing our possessions is greater than the pleasure of retaining them , is proved by the fact that the pain of a loss is so exciting to the mind that it often <unk> men of sleep , while they enjoy the most calm and quiet repose so long as their possessions are retained , which proves that the pleasure does not move them so deeply .
they are kept awake by the vexation and chagrin on the one hand , but they are never kept awake by the satisfaction on the other . "
" that is true , " replied the sacian .
" men are not kept awake by the mere continuing to possess their wealth , but they very often are by the original acquisition of it . "
" yes , indeed , " replied pheraulas ; " and if the enjoyment of being <name> could always continue as great as that of first becoming so , the <name> would , i admit , be very happy men ; but it is not , and can not be so .
they who possess much , must lose , and expend , and give much ; and this necessity brings more of pain than the possessions themselves can give of pleasure . "
the sacian was not convinced .
the giving and expending , he maintained , would be to him , in itself , a source of pleasure .
he should like to have much , for the very purpose of being able to expend much .
finally , pheraulas proposed to the sacian , since he seemed to think that riches would afford him so much pleasure , and as he himself , pheraulas , found the possession of them only a source of trouble and care , that he would convey all his wealth to the sacian , he himself to receive only an ordinary maintenance from it .
" you are in jest , " said the sacian .
" no , " said pheraulas , " i am in <name> . "
and he renewed his proposition , and pressed the sacian urgently to accept of it .
the sacian then said that nothing could give him greater pleasure than such an arrangement .
he expressed great gratitude for so generous an offer , and promised that , if he received the property , he would furnish pheraulas with most ample and abundant supplies for all his wants , and would relieve him entirely of all responsibility and care .
he promised , moreover , to obtain from <name> permission that pheraulas should thereafter be excused from the duties of military service , and from all the toils , privations , and hardships of war , so that he might thenceforth lead a life of quiet , luxury , and ease , and thus live in the enjoyment of all the benefits which wealth could procure , without its anxieties and cares .
the plan , thus arranged , was carried into effect .
pheraulas divested himself of his possessions , conveying them all to the sacian .
both parties were extremely pleased with the operation of the scheme , and they lived thus together for a long time .
whatever pheraulas acquired in any way , he always brought to the sacian , and the sacian , by accepting it , relieved pheraulas of all responsibility and care .
the sacian loved pheraulas , as xenophon says , in closing this narrative , because he was thus continually bringing him gifts ; and pheraulas loved the sacian , because he was always willing to take the gifts which were thus brought to him .
among the other conversations , whether real or imaginary , which xenophon records , he gives some specimens of those which took place at festive entertainments in <name> 's tent , on occasions when he invited his officers to dine with him .
he commenced the conversation , on one of these occasions , by inquiring of some of the officers present whether they did not think that the common soldiers were equal to the officers themselves in intelligence , courage , and military skill , and in all the other substantial qualities of a good soldier .
" i know not how that may be , " replied one of the officers .
" how they <name> prove when they come into action with the enemy , i can not tell ; but a more perverse and <unk> set of fellows in camp , than these i have got in my regiment , i never knew .
the other day , for example , when there had been a sacrifice , the meat of the victims was sent around to be distributed to the soldiers .
in our regiment , when the steward came in with the first distribution , he began by me , and so went round , as far as what he had brought would go .
the next time he came , he began at the other end .
the supply failed before he had got to the place where he had left off before , so that there was a man in the middle that did not get any thing .
this man immediately broke out in loud and angry complaints , and declared that there was no equality or fairness whatever in such a mode of division , unless they began sometimes in the center of the line .
" upon this , " continued the officer , " i called to the discontented man , and invited him to come and sit by me , where he would have a better chance for a good share .
he did so .
it happened that , at the next distribution that was made , we were the last , and he fancied that only the smallest pieces were left , so he began to complain more than before .
'oh , misery ! '
said he , 'that i should have to sit here ! '
'be patient , ' said i ; <unk> soon they <name> begin the distribution with us , and then you <name> have the best chance of all . '
and so it proved for , at the next distribution , they began at us , and the man took his share first ; but when the second and third men took theirs , he fancied that their pieces looked larger than his , and he reached forward and put his piece back into the basket , intending to change it ; but the steward moved rapidly on , and he did not get another , so that he lost his distribution altogether .
he was then quite furious with rage and vexation . "
<name> and all the company laughed very heartily at these <unk> of <unk> and discontent ; and then other stories , of a somewhat similar character , were told by other guests .
one officer said that a few days previous he was drilling a part of his troops , and he had before him on the plain what is called , in military language , a squad of men , whom he was teaching to march .
when he gave the order to advance , one , who was at the head of the file , marched forward with great alacrity , but all the rest stood still .
" i asked him , " continued the officer , " what he was doing .
<unk> , ' said he , 'as you ordered me to do . '
'it was not you alone that i ordered to march , ' said i , 'but all . '
so i sent him back to his place , and then gave the command again .
upon this they all advanced promiscuously and in disorder toward me , each one acting for himself , without regard to the others , and leaving the <unk> , who ought to have been at the head , altogether behind .
the <unk> said , 'keep back !
keep back ! '
upon this the men were offended , and asked what they were to do about such contradictory orders .
'one commands us to advance , and another to keep back ! '
said they ; 'how are we to know which to obey ? ' "
<name> and his guests were so much amused at the awkwardness of these recruits , and the ridiculous predicament in which the officer was placed by it , that the narrative of the speaker was here interrupted by universal and long-continued laughter .
" finally , " continued the officer , " i sent the men all back to their places , and explained to them that , when a command was given , they were not to obey it in confusion and unseemly haste , but regularly and in order , each one following the man who stood before him .
'you must regulate your proceeding , ' said i , 'by the action of the <unk> ; when he advances , you must advance , following him in a line , and governing your movements in all respects by his . '
" just at this moment , " continued the officer , " a man came to me for a letter which was to go to persia , and which i had left in my tent .
i directed the <unk> to run to my tent and bring the letter to me .
he immediately set off , and the rest , obeying literally the directions which i had just been giving them , all followed , running behind him in a line like a troop of savages , so that i had the whole squad of twenty men running in a body off the field to fetch a letter ! "
when the general hilarity which these <unk> occasioned had a little subsided , <name> said he thought that they could not complain of the character of the soldiers whom they had to command , for they were certainly , according to these accounts , sufficiently ready to obey the orders they received .
upon this , a certain one of the guests who was present , named <unk> , a gloomy and <unk> man , who had not joined at all in the merriment which the conversation had caused , asked <name> if he believed those stories to be true .
" why ? "
asked <name> ; " what do you think of them ? "
" i think , " said <unk> , " that these officers invented them to make the company laugh .
it is evident that they were not telling the truth , since they related the stories in such a vain and arrogant way . "
" arrogant ! "
said <name> ; " you ought not to call them arrogant ; for , even if they invented their <unk> , it was not to gain any selfish ends of their own , but only to amuse us and promote our enjoyment .
such persons should be called polite and agreeable rather than arrogant . "
" if , <unk> , " said one of the officers who had related the anecdotes , " we had told you melancholy stories to make you gloomy and wretched , you might have been justly displeased ; but you certainly ought not to complain of us for making you <name> . "
" yes , " said <unk> , " i think i may .
to make a man laugh is a very insignificant and useless thing .
it is far better to make him weep .
such thoughts and such conversation as makes us serious , thoughtful , and sad , and even moves us to tears , are the most salutary and the best . "
" well , " replied the officer , " if you <name> take my advice , you <name> lay out all your powers of inspiring gloom , and melancholy , and of bringing tears , upon our enemies , and bestow the mirth and laughter upon us .
there must be a prodigious deal of laughter in you , for none ever comes out .
you neither use nor expend it yourself , nor do you afford it to your friends . "
" then , " said <unk> , " why do you attempt to draw it from me ? "
" it is preposterous ! "
said another of the company ; " for one could more easily strike fire out of <unk> than get a laugh from him ! "
<unk> could not help smiling at this comparison ; upon which <name> , with an air of <unk> gravity , reproved the person who had spoken , saying that he had corrupted the most sober man in the company by making him smile , and that to disturb such gravity as that of <unk> was carrying the spirit of mirth and merriment altogether too far .
* * * * * these specimens <name> suffice .
they serve to give a more distinct idea of the <unk> of xenophon than any general description could afford .
the book is a drama , of which the principal elements are such narratives as the story of panthea , and such conversations as those contained in this chapter , intermingled with long discussions on the principles of government , and on the discipline and management of armies .
the principles and the sentiments which the work <unk> and explains are now of little value , being no longer applicable to the affairs of mankind in the altered circumstances of the present day .
the book , however , retains its rank among men on account of a certain beautiful and simple magnificence <unk> the style and language in which it is written , which , however , can not be appreciated except by those who read the narrative in the original tongue .

after having made the conquest of the <unk> empire , <name> found himself the sovereign of nearly all of <name> , so far as it was then known .
beyond his dominions there lay , on every side , according to the opinions which then prevailed , vast tracts of <unk> territory , desolate and impassable .
these <unk> were rendered unfit for man , sometimes by excessive heat , sometimes by excessive cold , sometimes from being parched by perpetual drought , which produced bare and desolate deserts , and sometimes by incessant rains , which drenched the country and filled it with morasses and fens .
on the north was the great caspian sea , then almost wholly unexplored , and extending , as the ancients believed , to the polar ocean .
on the west side of the caspian sea were the caucasian mountains , which were supposed , in those days , to be the highest on the globe .
in the neighborhood of these mountains there was a country , inhabited by a wild and half-savage people , who were called scythians .
this was , in fact , a sort of generic term , which was applied , in those days , to almost all the aboriginal tribes beyond the confines of civilization .
the scythians , however , if such they can properly be called , who lived on the borders of the caspian sea , were not wholly <unk> .
they possessed many of those mechanical arts which are the first to be matured among warlike nations .
they had no iron or steel , but they were accustomed to work other metals , particularly gold and brass .
they tipped their spears and javelins with brass , and made brazen plates for defensive armor , both for themselves and for their horses .
they made , also , many ornaments and decorations of gold .
these they attached to their helmets , their belts , and their banners .
they were very formidable in war , being , like all other northern nations , perfectly desperate and reckless in battle .
they were excellent horsemen , and had an abundance of horses with which to exercise their skill ; so that their armies consisted , like those of the cossacks of modern times , of great bodies of cavalry .
the various campaigns and conquests by which <name> obtained possession of his extended dominions occupied an interval of about thirty years .
it was near the close of this interval , when he was , in fact , advancing toward a late period of life , that he formed the plan of penetrating into these northern regions , with a view of adding them also to his domains .
he had two sons , cambyses and smerdis .
his wife is said to have been a daughter of astyages , and that he married her soon after his conquest of the kingdom of media , in order to reconcile the <unk> more easily to his sway , by making a median <name> their <name> .
among the western nations of europe such a marriage would be abhorred , astyages having been <name> 's grandfather ; but among the <unk> , in those days , alliances of this nature were not uncommon .
it would seem that this <name> was not living at the time that the events occurred which are to be related in this chapter .
her sons had grown up to maturity , and were now princes of great distinction .
one of the scythian or northern nations to which we have referred were called the <unk> .
they formed a very extensive and powerful realm .
they were governed , at this time , by a <name> named tomyris .
she was a widow , past middle life .
she had a son named <unk> , who had , like the sons of <name> , attained maturity , and was the heir to the throne .
<unk> was , moreover , the commander-in-chief of the armies of the <name> .
the first plan which <name> formed for the <unk> of the realm of the <unk> to his own dominions was by a matrimonial alliance .
he accordingly raised an army and commenced a movement toward the north , sending , at the same time , embassadors before him into the country of the <unk> , with offers of marriage to the <name> .
the <name> knew very well that it was her dominions , and not herself , that constituted the great attraction for <name> , and , besides , she was of an age when ambition is a stronger passion than love .
she refused the offers , and sent back word to <name> forbidding his approach .
<name> , however , continued to move on .
the boundary between his dominions and those of the <name> was at the river <unk> , a stream flowing from west to east , through the central parts of <name> , toward the caspian sea .
as <name> advanced , he found the country growing more and more wild and desolate .
it was inhabited by savage tribes , who lived on roots and herbs , and who were elevated very little , in any respect , above the wild beasts that roamed in the forests around them .
they had one very singular custom , according to herodotus .
it seems that there was a plant which grew among them , that bore a fruit , whose fumes , when it was roasting on a fire , had an exhilarating effect , like that produced by wine .
these savages , therefore , herodotus says , were accustomed to assemble around a fire , in their <unk> festivities , and to throw some of this fruit in the midst of it .
the fumes emitted by the fruit would soon begin to <unk> the whole circle , when they would throw on more fruit , and become more and more excited , until , at length , they would jump up , and dance about , and sing , in a state of complete <unk> .
among such savages as these , and through the forests and <unk> in which they lived , <name> advanced till he reached the <unk> .
here , after considering , for some time , by what means he could best pass the river , he determined to build a floating bridge , by means of boats and rafts obtained from the natives on the banks , or built for the purpose .
it would be obviously much easier to transport the army by using these boats and rafts to float the men across , instead of constructing a bridge with them ; but this would not have been safe , for the transportation of the army by such a means would be gradual and slow ; and if the enemy were lurking in the neighborhood , and should make an attack upon them in the midst of the operation , while a part of the army were upon one bank and a part upon the other , and another portion still , perhaps , in boats upon the stream , the defeat and destruction of the whole would be almost inevitable .
<name> planned the formation of the bridge , therefore , as a means of transporting his army in a body , and of landing them on the opposite bank in solid columns , which could be formed into order of battle without any delay .
while <name> was engaged in the work of constructing the bridge , embassadors appeared , who said that they had been sent from tomyris .
she had commissioned them , they said , to warn <name> to desist entirely from his designs upon her kingdom , and to return to his own .
this would be the wisest course , too , tomyris said , for himself , and she counseled him , for his own welfare , to follow it .
he could not foresee the result , if he should invade her dominions and encounter her armies .
fortune had favored him thus far , it was true , but fortune might change , and he might find himself , before he was aware , at the end of his victories .
still , she said , she had no expectation that he would be disposed to listen to this warning and advice , and , on her part , she had no objection to his persevering in his invasion .
she did not fear him .
he need not put himself to the expense and trouble of building a bridge across the <unk> .
she would agree to withdraw all her forces three days ' march into her own country , so that he might cross the river safely and at his leisure , and she would await him at the place where she should have encamped ; or , if he preferred it , she would cross the river and meet him on his own side .
in that case , he must retire three days ' march from the river , so as to afford her the same opportunity to make the passage undisturbed which she had offered him .
she would then come over and march on to attack him .
she gave <name> his <unk> which branch of this alternative to choose .
<name> called a council of war to consider the question .
he laid the case before his officers and generals , and asked for their opinion .
they were unanimously agreed that it would be best for him to accede to the last of the two proposals made to him , viz. , to draw back three days ' journey toward his own dominions , and wait for tomyris to come and attack him there .
there was , however , one person present at this consultation , though not regularly a member of the council , who gave <name> different advice .
this was croesus , the fallen king of <name> .
ever since the time of his captivity , he had been retained in the camp and in the household of <name> , and had often accompanied him in his expeditions and campaigns .
though a captive , he seems to have been a friend ; at least , the most friendly relations appeared to subsist between him and his conqueror ; and he often figures in history as a wise and honest counselor to <name> , in the various emergencies in which he was placed .
he was present on this occasion , and he <unk> from the opinion which was expressed by the officers of the army .
" i ought to apologize , perhaps , " said he , " for presuming to offer any counsel , captive as i am ; but i have derived , in the school of calamity and misfortune in which i have been taught , some advantages for learning wisdom which you have never enjoyed .
it seems to me that it <name> be much better for you not to fall back , but to advance and attack tomyris in her own dominions ; for , if you retire in this manner , in the first place , the act itself is discreditable to you : it is a retreat .
then , if , in the battle that follows , tomyris conquers you , she is already advanced three days ' march into your dominions , and she may go on , and , before you can take measures for raising another army , make herself mistress of your empire .
on the other hand , if , in the battle , you conquer her , you <name> be then six days ' march back of the position which you would occupy if you were to advance now .
" i <name> propose , " continued croesus , " the following plan : cross the river according to tomyris 's offer , and advance the three days' journey into her country .
leave a small part of your force there , with a great abundance of your most valuable baggage and supplies  luxuries of all kinds , and <name> wines , and such articles as the enemy <name> most value as plunder .
then fall back with the main body of your army toward the river again , in a secret manner , and encamp in an ambuscade .
the enemy <name> attack your advanced detachment .
they <name> conquer them .
they <name> seize the stores and supplies , and <name> suppose that your whole army is vanquished .
they <name> fall upon the plunder in disorder , and the discipline of their army <name> be overthrown .
they <name> go to feasting upon the provisions and to drinking the wines , and then , when they are in the midst of their festivities and revelry , you can come back suddenly with the real strength of your army , and wholly overwhelm them . "
<name> determined to adopt the plan which croesus thus recommended .
he accordingly gave answer to the embassadors of tomyris that he would accede to the first of her proposals .
if she would draw back from the river three days ' march , he would cross it with his army as soon as practicable , and then come forward and attack her .
the embassadors received this message , and departed to deliver it to their <name> .
she was faithful to her agreement , and <name> her forces back to the place proposed , and left them there , encamped under the command of her son .
<name> seems to have felt some forebodings in respect to the manner in which this expedition was to end .
he was advanced in life , and not now as well able as he once was to endure the privations and hardships of such campaigns .
then , the incursion which he was to make was into a remote , and wild , and dangerous country and he could not but be aware that he might never return .
perhaps he may have had some <unk> of conscience , too , at thus wantonly disturbing the peace and invading the territories of an innocent neighbor , and his mind may have been the less at ease on that account .
at any rate , he resolved to settle the affairs of his government before he set out , in order to secure both the tranquillity of the country while he should be absent , and the regular transmission of his power to his descendants in case he should never return .
accordingly , in a very formal manner , and in the presence of all his army , he delegated his power to cambyses , his son , constituting him regent of the realm during his absence .
he committed croesus to his son 's special care , charging him to pay him every attention and honor .
it was arranged that these persons , as well as a considerable portion of the army , and a large number of attendants that had followed the camp thus far , were not to accompany the expedition across the river , but were to remain behind and return to the capital .
these arrangements being all thus finally made , <name> took leave of his son and of croesus , crossed the river with that part of the army which was to proceed , and commenced his march .
the uneasiness and anxiety which <name> seems to have felt in respect to his future fate on this memorable march affected even his dreams .
it seems that there was among the officers of his army a certain general named hystaspes .
he had a son named <name> , then a youth of about twenty years of age , who had been left at home , in persia , when the army marched , not being old enough to accompany them .
<name> dreamed , one night , immediately after crossing the river , that he saw this young <name> with wings on his shoulders , that extended , the one over <name> and the other over europe , thus overshadowing the world .
when <name> awoke and reflected upon his dream , it seemed to him to portend that <name> might be aspiring to the government of his empire .
he considered it a warning intended to put him on his guard .
when he awoke in the morning , he sent for hystaspes , and related to him his dream .
" i am satisfied , " said he , " that it denotes that your son is forming ambitious and treasonable designs .
do you , therefore , return home , and arrest him in this fatal course .
secure him , and let him be ready to give me an account of his conduct when i shall return . "
hystaspes , having received this commission , left the army and returned .
the name of this hystaspes acquired a historical immortality in a very singular way , that is , by being always used as a part of the appellation by which to designate his distinguished son .
in after years <name> did attain to a very extended power .
he became <name> the great .
as , however , there were several other persian monarchs called <name> , some of whom were nearly as great as this the first of the name , the usage was gradually established of calling him <name> hystaspes ; and thus the name of the father has become familiar to all mankind , simply as a consequence and pendant to the celebrity of the son .
after sending off hystaspes , <name> went on .
he followed , in all respects , the plan of croesus .
he marched his army into the country of tomyris , and advanced until he reached the point agreed upon .
here he stationed a feeble portion of his army , with great stores of provisions and wines , and abundance of such articles as would be prized by the barbarians as booty .
he then <name> back with the main body of his army toward the <unk> , and concealed his forces in a hidden encampment .
the result was as croesus had anticipated .
the body which he had left was attacked by the troops of tomyris , and effectually routed .
the provisions and stores fell into the hands of the victors .
they gave themselves up to the most unbounded <name> , and their whole camp was soon a universal scene of rioting and excess .
even the commander , <unk> , tomyris 's son , became intoxicated with the wine .
while things were in this state , the main body of the army of <name> returned suddenly and unexpectedly , and fell upon their now helpless enemies with a force which entirely overwhelmed them .
the booty was recovered , large <name> of the enemy were slain , and others were taken prisoners .
<unk> himself was captured ; his hands were bound ; he was taken into <name> 's camp , and closely guarded .
the result of this stratagem , triumphantly successful as it was , would have settled the contest , and made <name> master of the whole realm , if as he , at the time , supposed was the case , the main body of <unk> forces had been engaged in this battle ; but it seems that tomyris had learned , by <unk> and spies , how large a force there was in <name> 's camp , and had only sent a detachment of her own troops to attack them , not judging it necessary to call out the whole .
two thirds of her army remained still uninjured .
with this large force she would undoubtedly have advanced without any delay to attack <name> again , were it not for her maternal concern for the safety of her son .
he was in <name> 's power , a helpless captive , and she did not know to what cruelties he would be exposed if <name> were to be exasperated against her .
while her heart , therefore , was burning with resentment and anger , and with an almost uncontrollable thirst for revenge , her hand was restrained .
she kept back her army , and sent to <name> a conciliatory message .
she said to <name> that he had no cause to be specially elated at his victory ; that it was only one third of her forces that had been engaged , and that with the remainder she held him completely in her power .
she urged him , therefore , to be satisfied with the injury which he had already inflicted upon her by destroying one third of her army , and to liberate her son , retire from her dominions , and leave her in peace .
if he would do so , she would not molest him in his departure ; but if he would not , she swore by the sun , the great god which she and her countrymen adored , that , insatiable as he was for blood , she would give it to him till he had his fill .
of course <name> was not to be frightened by such threats as these .
he refused to deliver up the captive <name> , or to withdraw from the country , and both parties began to prepare again for war .
<unk> was intoxicated when he was taken , and was unconscious of the calamity which had befallen him .
when at length he awoke from his stupor , and learned the full extent of his misfortune , and of the indelible disgrace which he had incurred , he was overwhelmed with astonishment , disappointment , and shame .
the more he reflected upon his condition , the more hopeless it seemed .
even if his life were to be spared , and if he were to recover his <name> , he never could recover his honor .
the <unk> of such a defeat and such a captivity , he knew well , must be indelible .
he begged <name> to loosen his bonds and allow him personal <name> within the camp .
<name> , pitying , perhaps , his misfortunes , and the deep dejection and distress which they occasioned , acceded to this request .
<unk> watched an opportunity to seize a weapon when he was not observed by his guards , and killed himself .
his mother tomyris , when she heard of his fate , was frantic with grief and rage .
she considered <name> as the wanton destroyer of the peace of her kingdom and the murderer of her son , and she had now no longer any reason for restraining her thirst for revenge .
she immediately began to concentrate her forces , and to summon all the additional troops that she could obtain from every part of her kingdom .
<name> , too , began in <name> to strengthen his lines , and to prepare for the great final struggle .
at length the armies approached each other , and the battle began .
the attack was commenced by the archers on either side , who shot showers of arrows at their opponents as they were advancing .
when the arrows were spent , the men fought hand to hand , with spears , and javelins , and swords .
the persians fought desperately , for they fought for their lives .
they were in the heart of an enemy 's country , with a broad river behind them to cut off their retreat , and they were contending with a wild and savage foe , whose natural <unk> was rendered still more ferocious and terrible than ever by the exasperation which they felt , in sympathy with their injured <name> .
for a long time it was wholly uncertain which side would win the day .
the advantage , here and there along the lines , was in some places on one side , and in some places on the other ; but , though overpowered and beaten , the several bands , whether of persians or scythians , would neither retreat nor surrender , but the survivors , when their comrades had fallen , continued to fight on till they were all slain .
it was evident , at last , that the scythians were gaining the day .
when night came on , the persian army was found to be almost wholly destroyed ; the remnant dispersed .
when all was over , the scythians , in exploring the field , found the dead body of <name> among the other ghastly and mutilated remains which covered the ground .
they took it up with a ferocious and exulting <name> , and carried it to tomyris .
tomyris treated it with every possible indignity .
she cut and mutilated the lifeless form ; as if it could still feel the injuries inflicted by her insane revenge .
" miserable wretch ! "
said she ; " though i am in the end your conqueror , you have ruined my peace and happiness forever .
you have murdered my son .
but i promised you your fill of blood , and you shall have it . "
so saying , she filled a can with persian blood , obtained , probably , by the execution of her captives , and , cutting off the head of her victim from the body , she plunged it in , exclaiming , " drink there , insatiable monster , till your murderous thirst is satisfied . "
this was the end of <name> .
cambyses , his son , whom he had appointed regent during his absence , succeeded quietly to the government of his vast dominions .
in reflecting on this melancholy termination of this great <unk> history , our minds naturally revert to the scenes of his childhood , and we wonder that so amiable , and gentle , and generous a boy should become so selfish , and unfeeling , and overbearing as a man .
but such are the natural and inevitable effects of ambition and an inordinate love of power .
the history of a conqueror is always a <unk> and melancholy tale .
he begins life with an exhibition of great and <name> qualities , which awaken in us , who read his history , the same admiration that was felt for him , personally , by his friends and countrymen while he lived , and on which the vast ascendency which he acquired over the minds of his fellow-men , and which led to his power and fame , was , in a great measure , founded .
on the other hand , he ends life neglected , hated , and abhorred .
his ambition has been gratified , but the gratification has brought with it no substantial peace or happiness ; on the contrary , it has filled his soul with uneasiness , discontent , <unk> , and misery .
the histories of heroes would be far less painful in the perusal if we could reverse this moral change of character , so as to have the cruelty , the selfishness , and the oppression exhaust themselves in the comparatively unimportant transactions of early life , and the spirit of kindness , generosity , and <unk> blessing and <unk> its close .
to be generous , disinterested , and <name> , seems to be necessary as the <unk> of great military success ; and to be hard-hearted , selfish , and cruel is the almost inevitable consequence of it .
the exceptions to this rule , though some of them are very splendid , are yet very few .

in describing the character and the action of the personages whose histories form the subjects of this series , the writer makes no attempt to darken the colors in which he <unk> their deeds of violence and wrong , or to increase , by indignant denunciations , the <unk> which heroes and conquerors have so often brought upon themselves , in the estimation of mankind , by their ambition , their tyranny , or their desperate and reckless crimes .
in fact , it seems desirable to diminish , rather than to increase , the spirit of <unk> which often leads men so harshly to condemn the errors and sins of others , committed in circumstances of temptation to which they themselves were never exposed .
besides , to denounce or <unk> guilt , in a narrative of the transactions in which it was displayed , has little influence in awakening a healthy sensitiveness in the conscience of the reader .
we observe , accordingly , that in the narratives of the sacred scriptures , such denunciations are seldom found .
the story of <unk> 's <unk> and rebellion , of <unk> <unk> and murder , of herod 's tyranny , and all other narratives of crime , are related in a calm , simple , impartial , and forbearing spirit , which leads us to condemn the sins , but not to feel a <unk> resentment and wrath against the sinner .
this example , so obviously proper and right , the writer of this series has made it his endeavor in all respects to follow .

about five or six hundred years before christ , almost the whole of the interior of <name> was united in one vast empire .
the founder of this empire was <name> the great .
he was originally a persian ; and the whole empire is often called the persian monarchy , taking its name from its founder 's native land .
<name> was not contented with having annexed to his dominion all the civilized states of <name> .
in the latter part of his life , he conceived the idea that there might possibly be some additional <name> and power to be acquired in subduing certain half-savage regions in the north , beyond the <unk> .
he accordingly raised an army , and set off on an expedition for this purpose , against a country which was governed by a barbarian <name> named tomyris .
he met with a variety of adventures on this expedition , all of which are fully detailed in our history of <name> .
there is , however , only one occurrence that it is necessary to allude to particularly here .
that one relates to a remarkable dream which he had one night , just after he had crossed the river .
to explain properly the nature of this dream , it is necessary first to state that <name> had two sons .
their names were cambyses and smerdis .
he had left them in persia when he set out on his expedition across the <unk> .
there was also a young man , then about twenty years of age , in one of his capitals , named <name> .
he was the son of one of the nobles of <name> 's court .
his father 's name was hystaspes .
hystaspes , besides being a <name> of the court , was also , as almost all nobles were in those days , an officer of the army .
he accompanied <name> in his march into the territories of the barbarian <name> , and was with him there , in camp , at the time when this narrative commences .
<name> , it seems , felt some misgivings in respect to the result of his enterprise ; and , in order to insure the tranquillity of his empire during his absence , and the secure transmission of his power to his rightful successor in case he should never return , he established his son cambyses as regent of his realms before he crossed the <unk> , and delivered the government of the empire , with great formality , into his hands .
this took place upon the frontier , just before the army passed the river .
the mind of a father , under such circumstances , would naturally be occupied , in some degree , with thoughts relating to the arrangements which his son would make , and to the difficulties he would be likely to encounter in managing the momentous concerns which had been committed to his charge .
the mind of <name> was undoubtedly so occupied , and this , probably , was the origin of the remarkable dream .
his dream was , that <name> appeared to him in a vision , with vast wings growing from his shoulders .
<name> stood , in the vision , on the confines of europe and <name> , and his wings , expanded either way , overshadowed the whole known world .
when <name> awoke and reflected on this ominous dream , it seemed to him to portend some great danger to the future security of his empire .
it appeared to denote that <name> was one day to bear sway over all the world .
perhaps he might be even then forming ambitious and treasonable designs .
<name> immediately sent for hystaspes , the father of <name> ; when he came to his tent , he commanded him to go back to persia , and keep a strict watch over the conduct of his son until he himself should return .
hystaspes received this commission , and departed to execute it ; and <name> , somewhat relieved , perhaps , of his anxiety by this measure of precaution , went on with his army toward his place of destination .
<name> never returned .
he was killed in battle ; and it would seem that , though the import of his dream was ultimately fulfilled , <name> was not , at that time , meditating any schemes of obtaining possession of the throne , for he made no attempt to interfere with the regular transmission of the imperial power from <name> to cambyses his son .
at any rate , it was so transmitted .
the tidings of <name> 's death came to the capital , and cambyses , his son , reigned in his stead .
the great event of the reign of cambyses was a war with egypt , which originated in the following very singular manner : it has been found , in all ages of the world , that there is some peculiar quality of the soil , or climate , or atmosphere of egypt which tends to produce an inflammation of the eyes .
the inhabitants themselves have at all times been very subject to this disease , and foreign armies marching into the country are always very seriously affected by it .
thousands of soldiers in such armies are sometimes disabled from this cause , and many are made <unk> blind .
now a country which produces a disease in its worst form and degree , <name> produce also , generally , the best physicians for that disease .
at any rate , this was supposed to be the case in ancient times ; and accordingly , when any powerful potentate in those days was afflicted himself with <unk> , or had such a case in his family , egypt was the country to send to for a physician .
now it happened that <name> himself , at one time in the course of his life , was attacked with this disease , and he dispatched an embassador to amasis , who was then king of egypt , asking him to send him a physician .
amasis , who , like all the other absolute sovereigns of those days , regarded his subjects as slaves that were in all respects entirely at his disposal , selected a physician of distinction from among the attendants about his court , and ordered him to repair to persia .
the physician was extremely reluctant to go .
he had a wife and family , from whom he was very unwilling to be separated ; but the orders were imperative , and he must obey .
he set out on the journey , therefore , but he secretly resolved to devise some mode of <unk> himself on the king for the cruelty of sending him .
he was well received by <name> , and , either by his skill as a physician , or from other causes , he acquired great influence at the persian court .
at last he contrived a mode of <unk> himself on the egyptian king for having exiled him from his native land .
the king had a daughter , who was a <name> of great beauty .
her father was very strongly attached to her .
the physician recommended to <name> to send to amasis and demand this daughter in marriage .
as , however , <name> was already married , the egyptian <name> would , if she came , be his <unk> rather than his wife , or , if considered a wife , it could only be a secondary and subordinate place that she could occupy .
the physician knew that , under these circumstances , the king of egypt would be extremely unwilling to send her to <name> , while he would yet scarcely dare to refuse ; and the <name> of plunging him into extreme embarrassment and distress , by means of such a demand from so powerful a sovereign , was the motive which led the physician to recommend the measure .
<name> was pleased with the proposal , and sent , accordingly , to make the demand .
the king , as the physician had anticipated , could not endure to part with his daughter in such a way , nor did he , on the other hand , dare to incur the displeasure of so powerful a monarch by a direct and open refusal .
he finally resolved upon escaping from the difficulty by a stratagem .
there was a young and beautiful captive <name> in his court named <unk> .
her father , whose name was <unk> , had been formerly the king of egypt , but he had been <unk> and killed by amasis .
since the downfall of her family , <unk> had been a captive ; but , as she was very beautiful and very accomplished , amasis conceived the design of sending her to <name> , under the pretense that she was the daughter whom <name> had demanded .
he accordingly brought her forth , provided her with the most costly and splendid dresses , loaded her with presents , ordered a large retinue to attend her , and sent her forth to persia .
<name> was at first very much pleased with his new bride .
<unk> became , in fact , his principal favorite ; though , of course , his other wife , whose name was <unk> , and her children , cambyses and smerdis , were jealous of her , and hated her .
one day , a persian <name> was visiting at the court , and as she was standing near <unk> , and saw her two sons , who were then tall and handsome young men , she expressed her admiration of them , and said to <unk> , " how proud and happy you must be ! "
" no , " said <unk> ; " on the contrary , i am very miserable ; for , though i am the mother of these children , the king <unk> and despises me .
all his kindness is bestowed on this egyptian woman . "
cambyses , who heard this conversation , sympathized deeply with <unk> in her resentment .
" mother , " said he , " be patient , and i <name> avenge you .
as soon as i am king , i <name> go to egypt and turn the whole country upside down . "
in fact , the tendency which there was in the mind of cambyses to look upon egypt as the first field of war and conquest for him , so soon as he should succeed to the throne , was encouraged by the influence of his father ; for <name> , although he was much captivated by the charms of the <name> whom the king of egypt had sent him , was greatly incensed against the king for having practiced upon him such a deception .
besides , all the important countries in <name> were already included within the persian dominions .
it was plain that if any future progress were to be made in extending the empire , the regions of europe and africa must be the theatre of it .
egypt seemed the most accessible and vulnerable point beyond the confines of <name> ; and thus , though <name> himself , being advanced somewhat in years , and interested , moreover , in other projects , was not prepared to undertake an enterprise into africa himself , he was very willing that such plans should be cherished by his son .
cambyses was an ardent , impetuous , and <unk> boy , such as the sons of <name> and powerful men are very apt to become .
they <unk> , by a sort of sympathy , the ambitious and aspiring spirit of their fathers ; and as all their childish caprices and passions are generally indulged , they never learn to submit to control .
they become vain , self-conceited , reckless , and cruel .
the conqueror who <unk> an empire , although even his character generally <unk> very seriously toward the close of his career , still usually knows something of moderation and generosity .
his son , however , who <unk> his father 's power , seldom <unk> the virtues by which the power was acquired .
these truths , which we see continually exemplified all around us , on a small scale , in the families of the wealthy and the powerful , were illustrated most conspicuously , in the view of all mankind , in the case of <name> and cambyses .
the father was prudent , cautious , wise , and often generous and forbearing .
the son grew up headstrong , impetuous , <unk> , and uncontrollable .
he had the most lofty ideas of his own greatness and power , and he felt a supreme contempt for the rights , and indifference to the happiness of all the world besides .
his history gives us an illustration of the worst which the principle of hereditary sovereignty can do , as the best is exemplified in the case of <name> of england .
cambyses , immediately after his father 's death , began to make arrangements for the egyptian invasion .
the first thing to be determined was the mode of transporting his armies thither .
egypt is a long and narrow valley , with the rocks and deserts of arabia on one side , and those of sahara on the other .
there is no convenient mode of access to it except by sea , and cambyses had no naval force sufficient for a maritime expedition .
while he was revolving the subject in his mind , there arrived in his capital of susa , where he was then residing , a deserter from the army of amasis in egypt .
the name of this deserter was <unk> .
he was a greek , having been the commander of a body of greek troops who were employed by amasis as auxiliaries in his army .
he had had a quarrel with amasis , and had fled to persia , intending to join cambyses in the expedition which he was contemplating , in order to revenge himself on the egyptian king .
<unk> said , in telling his story , that he had had a very narrow escape from egypt ; for , as soon as amasis had heard that he had fled , he dispatched one of his swiftest vessels , a galley of three banks of oars , in hot pursuit of the fugitive .
the galley overtook the vessel in which <unk> had taken passage just as it was landing in <name> minor .
the egyptian officers seized it and made <unk> prisoner .
they immediately began to make their preparations for the return voyage , putting <unk> , in the mean time , under the charge of guards , who were instructed to keep him very safely .
<unk> , however , cultivated a good understanding with his guards , and presently invited them to drink wine with him .
in the end , he got them intoxicated , and while they were in that state he made his escape from them , and then , traveling with great secrecy and caution until he was beyond their reach , he succeeded in making his way to cambyses in susa .
<unk> gave cambyses a great deal of information in respect to the geography of egypt , the proper points of attack , the character and resources of the king , and communicated , likewise , a great many other particulars which it was very important that cambyses should know .
he recommended that cambyses should proceed to egypt by land , through arabia ; and that , in order to secure a safe passage , he should send first to the king of the arabs , by a formal embassy , asking permission to cross his territories with an army , and engaging the <unk> to aid him , if possible , in the transit .
cambyses did this .
the arabs were very willing to join in any projected hostilities against the egyptians ; they offered cambyses a free passage , and agreed to aid his army on their march .
to the faithful fulfillment of these stipulations the arab chief bound himself by a treaty , executed with the most solemn forms and ceremonies .
the great difficulty to be encountered in traversing the deserts which cambyses would have to cross on his way to egypt was the want of water .
to provide for this necessity , the king of the arabs sent a vast number of camels into the desert , laden with great sacks or bags full of water .
these camels were sent forward just before the army of cambyses came on , and they deposited their supplies along the route at the points where they would be most needed .
herodotus , the greek traveler , who made a journey into egypt not a great many years after these transactions , and who wrote subsequently a full description of what he saw and heard there , gives an account of another method by which the arab king was said to have conveyed water into the desert , and that was by a canal or pipe , made of the skins of oxen , which he laid along the ground , from a certain river of his dominions , to a distance of twelve days ' journey over the sands !
this story herodotus says he did not believe , though elsewhere in the course of his history he gravely relates , as true history , a thousand tales infinitely more improbable than the idea of a leathern pipe or hose like this to serve for a <unk> of water .
by some means or other , at all events , the arab chief provided supplies of water in the desert for cambyses 's army , and the troops made the passage safely .
they arrived , at length , on the frontiers of egypt .
[ a ] here they found that amasis , the king , was dead , and psammenitus , his son , had succeeded him .
psammenitus came forward to meet the invaders .
a great battle was fought .
the egyptians were routed .
psammenitus fled up the nile to the city of memphis , taking with him such broken remnants of his army as he could get together after the battle , and feeling extremely incensed and exasperated against the invader .
in fact , cambyses had now no excuse or pretext whatever for waging such a war against egypt .
the monarch who had deceived his father was dead , and there had never been any cause of complaint against his son or against the egyptian people .
psammenitus , therefore , regarded the invasion of egypt by cambyses as a wanton and wholly unjustifiable <unk> , and he determined , in his own mind , that such invaders deserved no <name> , and that he would show them none .
soon after this , a galley on the river , belonging to cambyses , containing a crew of two hundred men , fell into his hands .
the egyptians , in their rage , tore these persians all to pieces .
this exasperated cambyses in his turn , and the war went on , attended by the most atrocious cruelties on both sides .
[ footnote a : for the places mentioned in this chapter , and the track of cambyses on his expedition , see the map at the commencement of this volume . ]
in fact , cambyses , in this egyptian campaign , pursued such a career of inhuman and reckless folly , that people at last considered him insane .
he began with some small semblance of moderation , but he proceeded , in the end , to the <unk> of the most terrible excesses of violence and wrong .
as to his moderation , his treatment of psammenitus personally is almost the only instance that we can record .
in the course of the war , psammenitus and all his family fell into cambyses 's hands as captives .
a few days afterward , cambyses conducted the unhappy king without the gates of the city to exhibit a spectacle to him .
the spectacle was that of his beloved daughter , clothed in the garments of a slave , and attended by a company of other maidens , the daughters of the nobles and other persons of distinction belonging to his court , all going down to the river , with heavy <unk> , to draw water .
the fathers of all these hapless maidens had been brought out with psammenitus to witness the degradation and misery of their children .
the maidens cried and sobbed aloud as they went along , overwhelmed with shame and terror .
their fathers manifested the utmost agitation and distress .
cambyses stood smiling by , highly enjoying the spectacle .
psammenitus alone appeared unmoved .
he gazed on the scene silent , motionless , and with a countenance which indicated no active suffering ; he seemed to be in a state of <unk> and despair .
cambyses was disappointed , and his pleasure was marred at finding that his victim did not feel more acutely the sting of the torment with which he was endeavoring to goad him .
when this train had gone by , another came .
it was a company of young men , with <unk> about their necks , going to execution .
cambyses had ordered that for every one of the crew of his galley that the egyptians had killed , ten egyptians should be executed .
this proportion would require two thousand victims , as there had been two hundred in the crew .
these victims were to be selected from among the sons of the leading families ; and their parents , after having seen their delicate and gentle daughters go to their servile toil , were now next to behold their sons march in a long and terrible array to execution .
the son of psammenitus was at the head of the column .
the egyptian parents who stood around psammenitus wept and lamented aloud , as one after another saw his own child in the train .
psammenitus himself , however , remained as silent and motionless , and with a countenance as vacant as before .
cambyses was again disappointed .
the pleasure which the exhibition afforded him was incomplete without visible manifestations of suffering in the victim for whose torture it was principally designed .
after this train of captives had passed , there came a mixed collection of wretched and miserable men , such as the siege and sacking of a city always produces in countless <name> .
among these was a venerable man whom psammenitus recognized as one of his friends .
he had been a man of wealth and high station ; he had often been at the court of the king , and had been entertained at his table .
he was now , however , reduced to the last extremity of distress , and was begging of the people something to keep him from starving .
the sight of this man in such a condition seemed to awaken the king from his blank and <unk> despair .
he called his old friend by name in a tone of astonishment and pity , and burst into tears .
cambyses , observing this , sent a messenger to psammenitus to inquire what it meant .
" he wishes to know , " said the messenger , " how it happens that you could see your own daughter set at work as a slave , and your son led away to execution unmoved , and yet feel so much commiseration for the misfortunes of a stranger . "
we might suppose that any one possessing the ordinary <unk> of the human soul would have understood without an explanation the meaning of this , though it is not surprising that such a heartless monster as cambyses did not comprehend it .
psammenitus sent him word that he could not help weeping for his friend , but that his distress and anguish on account of his children were too great for tears .
the persians who were around cambyses began now to feel a strong sentiment of compassion for the unhappy king , and to <unk> with cambyses in his favor .
they begged him , too , to spare <unk> son .
it <name> interest those of our readers who have perused our history of <name> to know that croesus , the captive king of <name> , whom they <name> recollect to have been committed to cambyses 's charge by his father , just before the close of his life , when he was setting forth on his last fatal expedition , and who accompanied cambyses on this invasion of egypt , was present on this occasion , and was one of the most <name> <unk> in psammenitus 's favor .
cambyses allowed himself to be persuaded .
they sent off a messenger to order the execution of the king 's son to be stayed ; but he arrived too late .
the unhappy <name> had already fallen .
cambyses was so far appeased by the influence of these facts , that he <unk> from doing psammenitus or his family any further injury .
he , however , advanced up the nile , <unk> and plundering the country as he went on , and at length , in the course of his conquests , he gained possession of the tomb in which the embalmed body of amasis was deposited .
he ordered this body to be taken out of its sarcophagus , and treated with every <name> of <unk> .
his soldiers , by his orders , beat it with rods , as if it could still feel , and goaded it , and cut it with swords .
they pulled the hair out of the head by the roots , and loaded the lifeless form with every conceivable <name> of insult and <unk> .
finally , cambyses ordered the mutilated remains that were left to be burned , which was a procedure as abhorrent to the ideas and feelings of the egyptians as could possibly be devised .
cambyses took every opportunity to insult the religious , or as , perhaps , we ought to call them , the superstitious feelings of the egyptians .
he broke into their temples , <unk> their altars , and subjected every thing which they held most sacred to insult and <unk> .
among their objects of religious veneration was the sacred bull called <unk> .
this animal was selected from time to time , from the country at large , by the priests , by means of certain marks which they pretended to discover upon its body , and which indicated a divine and sacred character .
the sacred bull thus found was kept in a magnificent <name> , and attended and fed in a most sumptuous manner .
in serving him , the attendants used vessels of gold .
cambyses arrived at the city where <unk> was kept at a time when the priests were celebrating some sacred occasion with festivities and rejoicings .
he was himself then returning from an unsuccessful expedition which he had made , and , as he entered the town , stung with vexation and anger at his defeat , the gladness and <name> which the egyptians manifested in their ceremonies served only to irritate him , and to make him more angry than ever .
he killed the priests who were <unk> .
he then demanded to be taken into the edifice to see the sacred animal , and there , after insulting the feelings of the <unk> in every possible way by ridicule and scornful words , he stabbed the innocent bull with his dagger .
the animal died of the wound , and the whole country was filled with horror and indignation .
the people believed that this deed would most assuredly bring down upon the impious <unk> of it the judgments of heaven .
cambyses organized , while he was in egypt , several mad expeditions into the surrounding countries .
in a fit of passion , produced by an unsatisfactory answer to an embassage , he set off suddenly , and without any proper preparation , to march into <unk> .
the provisions of his army were exhausted before he had performed a fifth part of the march .
still , in his infatuation , he determined to go on .
the soldiers subsisted for a time on such vegetables as they could find by the way ; when these failed , they slaughtered and ate their beasts of burden ; and finally , in the extremity of their famine , they began to kill and devour one another ; then , at length , cambyses concluded to return .
he sent off , too , at one time , a large army across the desert toward the <name> of jupiter ammon , without any of the necessary precautions for such a march .
this army never reached their destination , and they never returned .
the people of the oasis said that they were overtaken by a sand storm in the desert , and were all overwhelmed .
[ illustration : the army of cambyses overwhelmed in the desert . ]
there was a certain officer in attendance on cambyses named prexaspes .
he was a sort of confidential friend and companion of the king ; and his son , who was a fair , and graceful , and accomplished youth , was the king 's cup-bearer , which was an office of great consideration and honor .
one day cambyses asked prexaspes what the persians generally thought of him .
prexaspes replied that they thought and spoke well of him in all respects but one .
the king wished to know what the exception was .
prexaspes rejoined , that it was the general opinion that he was too much addicted to wine .
cambyses was offended at this reply ; and , under the influence of the feeling , so wholly unreasonable and absurd , which so often leads men to be angry with the innocent medium through which there comes to them any communication which they do not like , he determined to punish prexaspes for his freedom .
he ordered his son , therefore , the cup-bearer , to take his place against the wall on the other side of the room .
" now , " said he , " i <name> put what the persians say to the test . "
as he said this , he took up a bow and arrow which were at his side , and began to fit the arrow to the string .
" if , " said he , " i do not shoot him exactly through the heart , it shall prove that the persians are right .
if i do , then they are wrong , as it <name> show that i do not drink so much as to make my hand unsteady . "
so saying , he <name> the bow , the arrow flew through the air and pierced the poor boy 's breast .
he fell , and cambyses coolly ordered the attendants to open the body , and let prexaspes see whether the arrow had not gone through the heart .
these , and a constant succession of similar acts of atrocious and reckless cruelty and folly , led the world to say that cambyses was insane .

among the other acts of profligate wickedness which have blackened <unk> and forever cambyses 's name , he married two of his own sisters , and brought one of them with him to egypt as his wife .
the natural instincts of all men , except those whose early life has been given up to the most shameless and dissolute habits of vice , are sufficient to preserve them from such crimes as these .
cambyses himself felt , it seems , some misgivings when contemplating the first of these marriages ; and he sent to a certain council of judges , whose province it was to interpret the laws , asking them their opinion of the <unk> of such a marriage .
kings ask the opinion of their legal advisers in such cases , not because they really wish to know whether the act in question is right or wrong , but because , having themselves determined upon the performance of it , they wish their counselors to give it a sort of legal sanction , in order to justify the deed , and diminish the popular <unk> which it might otherwise incur .
the persian judges whom cambyses consulted on this occasion understood very well what was expected of them .
after a grave deliberation , they returned answer to the king that , though they could find no law allowing a man to marry his sister , they found many which authorized a king of persia to do whatever he thought best .
cambyses accordingly carried his plan into execution .
he married first the older sister , whose name was atossa .
atossa became subsequently a personage of great historical distinction .
the daughter of <name> , the wife of <name> , and the mother of xerxes , she was the link that bound together the three most magnificent potentates of the whole eastern world .
how far these sisters were willing <unk> in the guilt of their <unk> marriages we can not now know .
the one who went with cambyses into egypt was of a humane , and gentle , and timid disposition , being in these respects wholly unlike her brother ; and it may be that she merely yielded , in the transaction of her marriage , to her brother's arbitrary and imperious <name> .
besides this sister , cambyses had brought his brother smerdis with him into egypt .
smerdis was younger than cambyses , but he was superior to him in strength and personal accomplishments .
cambyses was very jealous of this superiority .
he did not dare to leave his brother in persia , to manage the government in his stead during his absence , lest he should take advantage of the temporary power thus committed to his hands , and usurp the throne altogether .
he decided , therefore , to bring smerdis with him into egypt , and to leave the government of the state in the hands of a regency composed of two magi .
these magi were public officers of distinction , but , having no hereditary claims to the crown , cambyses thought there would be little danger of their attempting to usurp it .
it happened , however , that the name of one of these magi was smerdis .
this coincidence between the magian 's name and that of the <name> led , in the end , as <name> presently be seen , to very important consequences .
the uneasiness and jealousy which cambyses felt in respect to his brother was not wholly allayed by the arrangement which he thus made for keeping him in his army , and so under his own personal observation and command .
smerdis evinced , on various occasions , so much strength and skill , that cambyses feared his influence among the officers and soldiers , and was rendered continually watchful , suspicious , and afraid .
a circumstance at last occurred which excited his jealousy more than ever , and he determined to send smerdis home again to persia .
the circumstance was this : after cambyses had succeeded in obtaining full possession of egypt , he formed , among his other wild and desperate schemes , the design of invading the territories of a nation of <unk> who lived in the interior of africa , around and beyond the sources of the nile .
the <unk> were celebrated for their savage strength and bravery .
cambyses wished to obtain information respecting them and their country before setting out on his expedition against them , and he determined to send spies into their country to obtain it .
but , as <unk> was a territory so remote , and as its institutions and customs , and the language , the dress , and the manners of its inhabitants were totally different from those of all the other nations of the earth , and were almost wholly unknown to the persian army , it was impossible to send persians in disguise , with any <name> that they could enter and explore the country without being discovered .
it was very doubtful , in fact , whether , if such spies were to be sent , they could succeed in reaching <unk> at all .
now there was , far up the nile , near the cataracts , at a place where the river widens and forms a sort of bay , a large and fertile island called <unk> , which was inhabited by a half-savage tribe called the <unk> .
they lived mainly by fishing on the river , and , consequently , they had many boats , and were accustomed to make long excursions up and down the stream .
their name was , in fact , derived from their occupation .
it was a greek word , and might be translated " fishermen .
" [ b ] the manners and customs of <unk> or savage nations depend entirely , of course , upon the modes in which they procure their subsistence .
some depend on hunting wild beasts , some on rearing flocks and herds of tame animals , some on cultivating the ground , and some on fishing in rivers or in the sea .
these four different modes of procuring food result in as many totally diverse modes of life : it is a curious fact , however , that while a nation of hunters differs very essentially from a nation of herdsmen or of fishermen , though they may live , perhaps , in the same neighborhood with them , still , all nations of hunters , however widely they may be separated in geographical position , very strongly resemble one another in character , in customs , in institutions , and in all the usages of life .
it is so , moreover , with all the other types of national constitution mentioned above .
the greeks observed these characteristics of the various savage tribes with which they became acquainted , and whenever they met with a tribe that lived by fishing , they called them <unk> .
[ footnote b : literally , <unk> . ]
cambyses sent to the <unk> of the island of <unk> , requiring them to furnish him with a number of persons acquainted with the route to <unk> and with the ethiopian language , that he might send them as an embassy .
he also provided some presents to be sent as a token of friendship to the ethiopian king .
the presents were , however , only a pretext , to enable the embassadors , who were , in fact , spies , to go to the capital and court of the ethiopian monarch in safety , and bring back to cambyses all the information which they should be able to obtain .
the presents consisted of such toys and ornaments as they thought would most please the fancy of a savage king .
there were some purple <unk> of a very <name> and splendid dye , and a golden chain for the neck , golden bracelets for the wrists , an <unk> box of very precious perfumes , and other similar trinkets and toys .
there was also a large vessel filled with wine .
the <unk> took these presents , and set out on their expedition .
after a long and <unk> voyage and journey , they came to the country of the <unk> , and delivered their presents , together with the message which cambyses had intrusted to them .
the presents , they said , had been sent by cambyses as a token of his <name> to become the friend and ally of the ethiopian king .
the king , instead of being deceived by this hypocrisy , detected the imposture at once .
he knew very well , he said , what was the motive of cambyses in sending such an embassage to him , and he should advise cambyses to be content with his own dominions , instead of planning aggressions of violence , and schemes and stratagems of deceit against his neighbors , in order to get possession of theirs .
he then began to look at the presents which the embassadors had brought , which , however , he appeared very soon to despise .
the purple vest first attracted his attention .
he asked whether that was the true , natural color of the stuff , or a false one .
the messengers told him that the linen was dyed , and began to explain the process to him .
the mind of the savage potentate , however , instead of being impressed , as the messengers supposed he would have been through their description , with a high idea of the excellence and superiority of persian <name> , only despised the false show of what he considered an artificial and fictitious beauty .
" the beauty of cambyses 's dresses , " said he , " is as deceitful , it seems , as the fair show of his professions of friendship . "
as to the golden bracelets and <unk> , the king looked upon them with contempt .
he thought that they were intended for fetters and chains , and said that , however well they might answer among the <unk> persians , they were wholly insufficient to confine such <unk> as he had to deal with .
the wine , however , he liked .
he drank it with great pleasure , and told the <unk> that it was the only article among all their presents that was worth receiving .
in return for the presents which cambyses had sent him , the king of the <unk> , who was a man of prodigious size and strength , took down his bow and gave it to the <unk> , telling them to <name> it to cambyses as a token of his defiance , and to ask him to see if he could find a man in all his army who could bend it .
" tell cambyses , " he added , " that when his soldiers are able to bend such bows as that , it <name> be time for him to think of invading the territories of the <unk> ; and that , in the mean time , he ought to consider himself very fortunate that the <unk> were not grasping and ambitious enough to attempt the invasion of his . "
when the <unk> returned to cambyses with this message , the strongest men in the persian camp were of course greatly interested in examining and trying the bow .
smerdis was the only one that could be found who was strong enough to bend it ; and he , by the superiority to the others which he thus evinced , gained great renown .
cambyses was filled with jealousy and anger .
he determined to send smerdis back again to persia .
" it <name> be better , " thought he to himself , " to incur whatever danger there may be of his exciting revolt at home , than to have him present in my court , subjecting me to continual mortification and chagrin by the perpetual parade of his superiority . "
his mind was , however , not at ease after his brother had gone .
jealousy and suspicion in respect to smerdis perplexed his waking thoughts and troubled his dreams .
at length , one night , he thought he saw smerdis seated on a <name> throne in persia , his form expanded <unk> to such a prodigious size that he touched the heavens with his head .
the next day , cambyses , supposing that the dream portended danger that smerdis would be one day in possession of the throne , determined to put a final and perpetual end to all these troubles and fears , and he sent for an officer of his court , prexaspes  the same whose son he shot through the heart with an arrow , as described in the last chapter  and commanded him to proceed immediately to persia , and there to find smerdis , and kill him .
the murder of prexaspes 's son , though related in the last chapter as an illustration of cambyses 's character , did not actually take place till after prexaspes returned from this expedition .
prexaspes went to persia , and executed the orders of the king by the assassination of smerdis .
there are different accounts of the mode which he adopted for accomplishing his purpose .
one is , that he contrived some way to drown him in the sea ; another , that he poisoned him ; and a third , that he killed him in the forests , when he was out on a hunting excursion .
at all events , the deed was done , and prexaspes went back to cambyses , and reported to him that he had nothing further to fear from his brother 's ambition .
in the mean time , cambyses went on from bad to worse in his government , growing every day more despotic and tyrannical , and abandoning himself to fits of cruelty and passion which became more and more excessive and insane .
at one time , on some slight provocation , he ordered twelve distinguished noblemen of his court to be buried alive .
it is astonishing that there can be institutions and arrangements in the social state which <name> give one man such an ascendency over others that such commands can be obeyed .
on another occasion , cambyses 's sister and wife , who had mourned the death of her brother smerdis , ventured a reproach to cambyses for having destroyed him .
she was sitting at table , with some plant or flower in her hand , which she slowly picked to pieces , putting the fragments on the table .
she asked cambyses whether he thought the flower looked fairest and best in fragments , or in its original and natural integrity .
" it looked best , certainly , " cambyses said , " when it was whole . "
" and yet , " said she , " you have begun to take to pieces and destroy our family , as i have destroyed this flower . "
cambyses sprang upon his unhappy sister , on hearing this reproof , with the ferocity of a tiger .
he threw her down and leaped upon her .
the attendants succeeded in rescuing her and bearing her away ; but she had received a fatal injury .
she fell immediately into a premature and unnatural sickness , and died .
these fits of sudden and terrible passion to which cambyses was subject , were often followed , when they had passed by , as is usual in such cases , with remorse and misery ; and sometimes the officers of cambyses , anticipating a change in their master 's feelings , did not execute his cruel orders , but concealed the object of his blind and <unk> vengeance until the paroxysm was over .
they did this once in the case of croesus .
croesus , who was now a venerable man , advanced in years , had been for a long time the friend and faithful counselor of cambyses 's father .
he had known cambyses himself from his boyhood , and had been charged by his father to watch over him and counsel him , and aid him , on all occasions which might require it , with his experience and wisdom .
cambyses , too , had been solemnly charged by his father <name> , at the last interview that he had with him before his death , to guard and protect croesus , as his father's ancient and faithful friend , and to treat him , as long as he lived , with the highest consideration and honor .
under these circumstances , croesus considered himself justified in <unk> one day with cambyses against his excesses and his cruelty .
he told him that he ought not to give himself up to the control of such violent and impetuous passions ; that , though his persian soldiers and subjects had borne with him thus far , he might , by excessive oppression and cruelty , exhaust their forbearance and provoke them to revolt against him , and that thus he might suddenly lose his power , through his intemperate and inconsiderate use of it .
croesus apologized for offering these counsels , saying that he felt bound to warn cambyses of his danger , in obedience to the injunctions of <name> , his father .
cambyses fell into a violent passion at hearing these words .
he told croesus that he was amazed at his presumption in daring to offer him advice , and then began to load his venerable counselor with the bitterest invectives and reproaches .
he <unk> him with his own misfortunes , in losing , as he had done , years before , his own kingdom of <name> , and then accused him of having been the means , through his foolish counsels , of leading his father , <name> , into the worst of the difficulties which befell him toward the close of his life .
at last , becoming more and more enraged by the reaction upon himself of his own angry utterance , he told croesus that he had hated him for a long time , and for a long time had wished to punish him ; " and now , " said he , " you have given me an opportunity . "
so saying , he seized his bow , and began to fit an arrow to the string .
croesus fled .
cambyses ordered his attendants to pursue him , and when they had taken him , to kill him .
the officers knew that cambyses would regret his rash and reckless command as soon as his anger should have subsided , and so , instead of slaying croesus , they concealed him .
a few days after , when the tyrant began to express his remorse and sorrow at having destroyed his venerable friend in the heat of passion , and to mourn his death , they told him that croesus was still alive .
they had ventured , they said , to save him , till they could ascertain whether it was the king 's real and deliberate determination that he must die .
the king was overjoyed to find croesus still alive , but he would not forgive those who had been instrumental in saving him .
he ordered every one of them to be executed .
cambyses was the more reckless and desperate in these tyrannical cruelties because he believed that he possessed a sort of charmed life .
he had consulted an oracle , it seems , in media , in respect to his prospects of life , and the oracle had informed him that he would die at <unk> .
now <unk> was one of the three great capitals of his empire , susa and babylon being the others .
<unk> was the most northerly of these cities , and the most remote from danger .
babylon and susa were the points where the great transactions of government chiefly centered , while <unk> was more particularly the private residence of the kings .
it was their refuge in danger , their retreat in sickness and age .
in a word , susa was their seat of government , babylon their great commercial <unk> , but <unk> was their home .
and thus as the oracle , when cambyses inquired in respect to the circumstances of his death , had said that it was decreed by the fates that he should die at <unk> , it meant , as he supposed , that he should die in peace , in his bed , at the close of the usual period allotted to the life of man .
considering thus that the fates had removed all danger of a sudden and violent death from his path , he abandoned himself to his career of vice and folly , remembering only the substance of the oracle , while the particular form of words in which it was expressed passed from his mind .
at length cambyses , after completing his conquests in egypt , returned to the northward along the shores of the mediterranean sea , until he came into syria .
the province of galilee , so often mentioned in the sacred scriptures , was a part of syria .
in traversing galilee at the head of the detachment of troops that was accompanying him , cambyses came , one day , to a small town , and encamped there .
the town itself was of so little importance that cambyses did not , at the time of his arriving at it , even know its name .
his encampment at the place , however , was marked by a very memorable event , namely , he met with a herald here , who was traveling through syria , saying that he had been sent from susa to proclaim to the people of syria that smerdis , the son of <name> , had assumed the throne , and to <unk> upon them all to obey no orders except such as should come from him !
cambyses had supposed that smerdis was dead .
prexaspes , when he had returned from susa , had reported that he had killed him .
he now , however , sent for prexaspes , and demanded of him what this proclamation could mean .
prexaspes renewed , and insisted upon , his declaration that smerdis was dead .
he had destroyed him with his own hands , and had seen him buried .
" if the dead can rise from the grave , " added prexaspes , " then smerdis may perhaps , raise a revolt and appear against you ; but not otherwise . "
prexaspes then recommended that the king should send and seize the herald , and inquire particularly of him in respect to the government in whose name he was acting .
cambyses did so .
the herald was taken and brought before the king .
on being questioned whether it was true that smerdis had really assumed the government and commissioned him to make proclamation of the fact , he replied that it was so .
he had not seen smerdis himself , he said , for he kept himself shut up very closely in his palace ; but he was informed of his accession by one of the <unk> whom cambyses had left in command .
it was by him , he said , that he had been commissioned to proclaim smerdis as king .
prexaspes then said that he had no doubt that the two <unk> whom cambyses had left in charge of the government had contrived to seize the throne .
he reminded cambyses that the name of one of them was smerdis , and that probably that was the smerdis who was usurping the supreme command .
cambyses said that he was convinced that this supposition was true .
his dream , in which he had seen a vision of smerdis , with his head reaching to the heavens , referred , he had no doubt , to the magian smerdis , and not to his brother .
he began bitterly to reproach himself for having caused his innocent brother to be put to death ; but the remorse which he thus felt for his crime , in <unk> an imaginary rival , soon gave way to rage and resentment against the real usurper .
he called for his horse , and began to mount him in hot haste , to give immediate orders , and make immediate preparations for marching to susa .
as he bounded into the saddle , with his mind in this state of reckless desperation , the sheath , by some accident or by some carelessness caused by his headlong haste , fell from his sword , and the naked point of the weapon pierced his thigh .
the attendants took him from his horse , and conveyed him again to his tent .
the wound , on examination , proved to be a very dangerous one , and the strong passions , the vexation , the disappointment , the impotent rage , which were agitating the mind of the patient , exerted an influence extremely unfavorable to recovery .
cambyses , terrified at the prospect of death , asked what was the name of the town where he was lying .
they told him it was <unk> .
he had never thought before of the possibility that there might be some other <unk> besides his splendid <name> retreat in media ; but now , when he learned that was the name of the place where he was then encamped , he felt sure that his hour was come , and he was overwhelmed with remorse and despair .
he suffered , too , inconceivable pain and anguish from his wound .
the sword had pierced to the bone , and the inflammation which had supervened was of the worst character .
after some days , the acuteness of the agony which he at first endured passed gradually away , though the extent of the injury resulting from the wound was growing every day greater and more hopeless .
the sufferer lay , pale , emaciated , and wretched , on his couch , his mind , in every interval of bodily agony , filling up the void with the more dreadful sufferings of horror and despair .
at length , on the twentieth day after his wound had been received , he called the leading nobles of his court and officers of his army about his bedside , and said to them that he was about to die , and that he was compelled , by the calamity which had befallen him , to declare to them what he would otherwise have continued to keep concealed .
the person who had usurped the throne under the name of smerdis , he now said , was not , and could not be , his brother smerdis , the son of <name> .
he then proceeded to give them an account of the manner in which his fears in respect to his brother had been excited by his dream , and of the desperate remedy that he had resorted to in ordering him to be killed .
he believed , he said , that the usurper was smerdis the magian , whom he had left as one of the <unk> when he set out on his egyptian campaign .
he urged them , therefore , not to submit to his sway , but to go back to media , and if they could not conquer him and put him down by open war , to destroy him by deceit and stratagem , or in any way whatever by which the end could be accomplished .
cambyses urged this with so much of the spirit of hatred and revenge beaming in his hollow and glassy eye as to show that sickness , pain , and the approach of death , which had made so total a change in the wretched sufferer 's outward condition , had altered nothing within .
very soon after making this communication to his nobles , cambyses expired .
it <name> well illustrate the estimate which those who knew him best , formed of this great hero 's character , to state , that those who heard this solemn declaration did not believe one word of it from beginning to end .
they supposed that the whole story which the dying tyrant had told them , although he had scarcely breath enough left to tell it , was a <unk> , dictated by his fraternal jealousy and hate .
they believed that it was really the true smerdis who had been proclaimed king , and that cambyses had invented , in his dying moments , the story of his having killed him , in order to prevent the persians from submitting peaceably to his reign .

cambyses and his friends had been right in their conjectures that it was smerdis the magian who had usurped the persian throne .
this smerdis resembled , it was said , the son of <name> in his personal appearance as well as in name .
the other magian who had been associated with him in the regency when cambyses set out from persia on his egyptian campaign was his brother .
his name was <unk> .
when <name> had been some time absent , these <unk> , having in the mean time , perhaps , heard unfavorable accounts of his conduct and character , and knowing the effect which such wanton tyranny must have in <unk> from him the allegiance of his subjects , conceived the design of taking possession of the empire in their own name .
the great distance of cambyses and his army from home , and his long-continued absence , favored this plan .
their own position , too , as they were already in possession of the capitals and the fortresses of the country , aided them ; and then the name of smerdis , being the same with that of the brother of cambyses , was a circumstance that greatly promoted the success of the undertaking .
in addition to all these general advantages , the cruelty of cambyses was the means of furnishing them with a most <unk> occasion for putting their plans into execution .
the reader <name> recollect that , as was related in the last chapter , cambyses first sent his brother smerdis home , and afterward , when alarmed by his dream , he sent prexaspes to murder him .
now the return of smerdis was publicly and generally known , while his assassination by prexaspes was kept a profound secret .
even the persians connected with cambyses 's court in egypt had not heard of the <unk> of this crime , until cambyses confessed it on his dying bed , and even then , as was stated in the last chapter , they did not believe it .
it is not probable that it was known in media and persia ; so that , after prexaspes accomplished his work , and returned to cambyses with the report of it , it was probably generally supposed that his brother was still alive , and was residing somewhere in one or another of the <name> palaces .
such <name> personages were often accustomed to live thus , in a state of great seclusion , spending their time in <unk> pleasures within the walls of their palaces , parks , and gardens .
when the <name> smerdis , therefore , secretly and suddenly disappeared , it would be very easy for the magian smerdis , with the collusion of a moderate number of courtiers and attendants , to take his place , especially if he continued to live in retirement , and exhibited himself as little as possible to public view .
thus it was that cambyses himself , by the very crimes which he committed to shield himself from all danger of a revolt , opened the way which specially invited it , and almost insured its success .
every particular step that he took , too , helped to promote the end .
his sending smerdis home ; his waiting an interval , and then sending prexaspes to destroy him ; his ordering his assassination to be secret  these , and all the other attendant circumstances , were only so many preliminary steps , preparing the way for the success of the revolution which was to accomplish his ruin .
he was , in a word , his own destroyer .
like other wicked men , he found , in the end , that the schemes of wickedness which he had <unk> aimed at the destruction of others , had been all the time slowly and surely working out his own .
the people of persia , therefore , were prepared by cambyses 's own acts to believe that the usurper smerdis was really <name> 's son , and , next to cambyses , the heir to the throne .
the army of cambyses , too , in egypt , believed the same .
it was natural that they should do so for they placed no confidence whatever in cambyses 's dying declarations ; and since intelligence , which seemed to be official , came from susa declaring that smerdis was still alive , and that he had actually taken possession of the throne , there was no apparent reason for doubting the fact .
besides , prexaspes , as soon as cambyses was dead , considered it safer for him to deny than to confess having murdered the <name> .
he therefore declared that cambyses 's story was false , and that he had no doubt that smerdis , the monarch in whose name the government was administered at susa , was the son of <name> , the true and rightful heir to the throne .
thus all parties throughout the empire acquiesced peaceably in what they supposed to be the legitimate succession .
in the mean time , the usurper had placed himself in an exceedingly dizzy and precarious situation , and one which it would require a great deal of address and skillful management to sustain .
the plan arranged between himself and his brother for a division of the advantages which they had secured by their joint and common cunning was , that smerdis was to enjoy the ease and pleasure , and <unk> the substantial power of the royalty which they had so stealthily seized .
this was the safest plan .
smerdis , by living secluded , and devoting himself to retired and private pleasures , was the more likely to escape public observation ; while <unk> , acting as his prime minister of state , could attend councils , issue orders , review troops , dispatch <unk> , and perform all the other outward functions of supreme command , with safety as well as pleasure .
<unk> seems to have been , in fact , the soul of the whole plan .
he was ambitious and aspiring in character , and if he could only himself enjoy the actual exercise of <name> power , he was willing that his brother should enjoy the honor of possessing it .
<unk> , therefore , governed the realm , acting , however , in all that he did , in smerdis 's name .
smerdis , on his part , was content to take possession of the palaces , the parks , and the gardens of media and persia , and to live in them in retired and quiet luxury and splendor .
he appeared seldom in public , and then only under such circumstances as should not expose him to any close observation on the part of the spectators .
his figure , air , and manner , and the general cast of his countenance , were very much like those of the <name> whom he was attempting to <unk> .
there was one <name> , however , by which he thought that there was danger that he might be betrayed , and that was , his ears had been cut off .
this had been done many years before , by command of <name> , on account of some offense of which he had been guilty .
the marks of the mutilation could , indeed , on public occasions , be concealed by the turban , or helmet , or other <unk> which he wore ; but in private there was great danger either that the loss of the ears , or the studied effort to conceal it , should be observed .
smerdis was , therefore , very careful to avoid being seen in private , by keeping himself closely secluded .
he shut himself up in the apartments of his palace at susa , within the citadel , and never invited the persian nobles to visit him there .
among the other means of luxury and pleasure which smerdis found in the <name> palaces , and which he appropriated to his own enjoyment , were cambyses 's wives .
in those times , oriental princes and potentates  as is , in fact , the case at the present day , in many oriental countries  possessed a great number of wives , who were bound to them by different sorts of matrimonial ties , more or less permanent , and bringing them into relations more or less intimate with their husband and sovereign .
these wives were in many respects in the condition of slaves : in one particular they were especially so , namely , that on the death of a sovereign they descended , like any other property , to the heir , who added as many of them as he pleased to his own <unk> .
until this was done , the unfortunate women were shut up in close seclusion on the death of their lord , like mourners who retire from the world when suffering any great and severe bereavement .
the wives of cambyses were appropriated by smerdis to himself on his taking possession of the throne and hearing of cambyses 's death .
among them was atossa , who has already been mentioned as the daughter of <name> , and , of course , the sister of cambyses as well as his wife .
in order to prevent these court ladies from being the means , in any way , of discovering the imposture which he was practicing , the magian continued to keep them all closely shut up in their several separate apartments , only allowing a favored few to visit him , one by one , in turn , while he prevented their having any communication with one another .
the name of one of these ladies was <unk> .
she was the daughter of a persian <name> of the highest rank and influence , named otanes .
otanes , as well as some other nobles of the court , had observed and reflected upon the extraordinary circumstances connected with the accession of smerdis to the throne , and the singular mode of life that he led in <unk> himself , in a manner so extraordinary for a persian monarch , from all intercourse with his nobles and his people .
the suspicions of otanes and his associates were excited , but no one dared to communicate his thoughts to the others .
at length , however , otanes , who was a man of great energy as well as sagacity and discretion , resolved that he would take some measures to ascertain the truth .
he first sent a messenger to <unk> , his daughter , asking of her whether it was really smerdis , the son of <name> , who received her when she went to visit the king .
<unk> , in return , sent her father word that she did not know , for she had never seen smerdis , the son of <name> , before the death of cambyses .
she therefore could not say , of her own personal knowledge , whether the king was the genuine smerdis or not .
otanes then sent to <unk> a second time , requesting her to ask the <name> atossa .
atossa was the sister of smerdis the <name> , and had known him from his childhood .
<unk> sent back word to her father that she could not speak to atossa , for she was kept closely shut up in her own apartments , without the opportunity to communicate with any one .
otanes then sent a third time to his daughter , telling her that there was one remaining mode by which she might ascertain the truth , and that was , the next time that she visited the king , to feel for his ears when he was asleep .
if it was smerdis the magian , she would find that he had none .
he urged his daughter to do this by saying that , if the pretended king was really an impostor , the imposture ought to be made known , and that she , being of <name> birth , ought to have the courage and energy to assist in discovering it .
to this <unk> replied that she would do as her father desired , though she knew that she hazarded her life in the attempt .
" if he has no ears , " said she , " and if i awaken him in attempting to feel for them , he <name> kill me ; i am sure that he <name> kill me on the spot . "
the next time that it came to <unk> 's turn to visit the king , she did as her father had requested .
she passed her hand very cautiously beneath the king 's turban , and found that his ears had been cut off close to his head .
early in the morning she communicated the knowledge of the fact to her father .
[ illustration : <unk> feeling for smerdis 's ears . ]
otanes immediately made the case known to two of his friends , persian nobles , who had , with him , suspected the imposture , and had consulted together before in respect to the means of detecting it .
the question was , what was now to be done .
after some deliberation , it was agreed that each of them should communicate the discovery which they had made to one other person , such as each should select from among the circle of his friends as the one on whose resolution , <name> , and fidelity he could most implicitly rely .
this was done , and the number admitted to the secret was thus increased to six .
at this juncture it happened that <name> , the son of hystaspes , the young man who has already been mentioned as the subject of <name> 's dream , came to susa .
<name> was a man of great prominence and popularity .
his father , hystaspes , was at that time the governor of the province of persia , and <name> had been residing with him in that country .
as soon as the six conspirators heard of his arrival , they admitted him to their councils , and thus their number was increased to seven .
they immediately began to hold secret consultations for the purpose of determining how it was best to proceed , first binding themselves by the most solemn oaths never to betray one another , however their undertaking might end .
<name> told them that he had himself discovered the imposture and usurpation of smerdis , and that he had come from persia for the purpose of slaying him ; and that now , since it appeared that the secret was known to so many , he was of opinion that they ought to act at once with the utmost decision .
he thought there would be great danger in delay .
otanes , on the other hand , thought that they were not yet ready for action .
they must first increase their <name> .
seven persons were too few to attempt to <unk> an empire .
he commended the courage and resolution which <name> displayed , but he thought that a more cautious and deliberate policy would be far more likely to conduct them to a safe result .
<name> replied that the course which otanes recommended would certainly ruin them .
" if we make many other persons acquainted with our plans , " said he , " there <name> be some , notwithstanding all our precautions , who <name> betray us , for the sake of the immense rewards which they well know they would receive in that case from the king .
no , " he added , " we must act ourselves , and alone .
we must do nothing to excite suspicion , but must go at once into the palace , penetrate boldly into smerdis 's presence , and slay him before he has time to suspect our designs . "
" but we can not get into his presence , " replied otanes .
" there are guards stationed at every gate and door , who <name> not allow us to pass .
if we attempt to kill them , a tumult <name> be immediately raised , and the alarm given , and all our designs <name> thus be baffled . "
" there <name> be little difficulty about the guards , " said <name> .
" they know us all , and , from deference to our rank and station , they <name> let us pass without suspicion , especially if we act boldly and promptly , and do not give them time to stop and consider what to do .
besides , i can say that i have just arrived from persia with important dispatches for the king , and that i must be admitted immediately into his presence .
if a falsehood must be told , so let it be .
the urgency of the crisis demands and sanctions it . "
it may seem strange to the reader , considering the ideas and habits of the times , that <name> should have even thought it necessary to apologize to his confederates for his proposal of employing falsehood in the accomplishment of their plans ; and it is , in fact , altogether probable that the apology which he is made to utter is his historian 's , and not his own .
the other conspirators had remained silent during this discussion between <name> and otanes ; but now a third , whose name was <unk> , expressed his opinion in favor of the course which <name> recommended .
he was aware , he said , that , in attempting to force their way into the king 's presence and kill him by a sudden assault , they exposed themselves to the most imminent danger ; but it was better for them to die in the manly attempt to bring back the imperial power again into persian hands , where it properly belonged , than to acquiesce any further in its continuance in the possession of the ignoble median priests who had so treacherously usurped it .
to this counsel they all finally agreed , and began to make arrangements for carrying their desperate enterprise into execution .
in the mean time , very extraordinary events were <unk> in another part of the city .
the two magi , smerdis the king and <unk> his brother , had some cause , it seems , to fear that the nobles about the court , and the officers of the persian army , were not without suspicions that the reigning monarch was not the real son of <name> .
rumors that smerdis had been killed by prexaspes , at the command of cambyses , were in circulation .
these rumors were contradicted , it is true , in private , by prexaspes , whenever he was forced to speak of the subject ; but he generally avoided it ; and he spoke , when he spoke at all , in that timid and undecided tone which men usually assume when they are <unk> in a lie .
in the mean time , the gloomy recollections of his past life , the memory of his murdered son , remorse for his own crime in the assassination of smerdis , and anxiety on account of the extremely dangerous position in which he had placed himself by his false denial of it , all conspired to harass his mind with perpetual restlessness and misery , and to make life a burden .
in order to do something to quiet the suspicions which the magi feared were prevailing , they did not know how extensively , they conceived the plan of inducing prexaspes to declare in a more public and formal manner what he had been asserting timidly in private , namely , that smerdis had not been killed .
they accordingly convened an assembly of the people in a court-yard of the palace , or perhaps took advantage of some gathering casually convened , and proposed that prexaspes should address them from a neighboring tower .
prexaspes was a man of high rank and of great influence , and the magi thought that his public <unk> of their cause , and his open and decided contradiction of the rumor that he had killed cambyses 's brother , would fully convince the persians that it was really the rightful monarch that had taken possession of the throne .
but the strength even of a strong man , when he has a lie to <name> , soon becomes very small .
that of prexaspes was already almost exhausted and gone .
he had been wavering and hesitating before , and this proposal , that he should commit himself so formally and solemnly , and in so public a manner , to statements wholly and absolutely untrue , brought him to a stand .
he decided , desperately , in his own mind , that he would go on in his course of falsehood , remorse , and wretchedness no longer .
he , however , pretended to accede to the propositions of the magi .
he ascended the tower , and began to address the people .
instead , however , of denying that he had murdered smerdis , he fully confessed to the astonished audience that he had really committed that crime ; he openly denounced the reigning smerdis as an impostor , and called upon all who heard him to rise at once , destroy the treacherous usurper , and vindicate the rights of the true persian line .
as he went on , with vehement voice and gestures , in this speech , the utterance of which he knew sealed his own destruction , he became more and more excited and reckless .
he denounced his hearers in the severest language if they failed to obey his injunctions , and <unk> upon them , in that event , all the curses of heaven .
the people listened to this strange and sudden phrensy of eloquence in utter amazement , motionless and silent ; and before they or the officers of the king 's household who were present had time even to consider what to do , prexaspes , coming abruptly to the conclusion of his harangue , threw himself headlong from the parapet of the tower , and came down among them , lifeless and mangled , on the pavement below .
of course , all was now tumult and commotion in the court-yard , and it happened to be just at this juncture that the seven conspirators came from the place of their consultation to the palace , with a view of executing their plans .
they were soon informed of what had taken place .
otanes was now again disposed to postpone their attempt upon the life of the king .
the event which had occurred changed , he said , the aspect of the subject , and they must wait until the tumult and excitement should have somewhat subsided .
but <name> was more eager than ever in favor of instantaneous action .
he said that there was not a moment to be lost ; for the magi , so soon as they should be informed of the declarations and of the death of prexaspes , would be alarmed , and would take at once the most effectual precautions to guard against any sudden assault or surprise .
these arguments , at the very time in which <name> was offering them with so much vehemence and earnestness , were strengthened by a very singular sort of confirmation ; for while the conspirators stood <unk> , they saw a flock of birds moving across the sky , which , on their more attentively regarding them , proved to be seven hawks pursuing two vultures .
this they regarded an omen , intended to signify to them , by a divine intimation , that they ought to proceed .
they hesitated , therefore , no longer .
they went together to the outer gates of the palace .
the action of the guards who were stationed there was just what <name> had predicted that it would be .
awed by the imposing spectacle of the approach of seven nobles of the highest distinction , who were advancing , too , with an <name> and confident air , as if expecting no obstacle to their admission , they gave way at once , and allowed them to enter .
the conspirators went on until they came to the inner apartments , where they found <unk> in attendance at the doors .
the <unk> resisted , and demanded angrily why the guards had let the strangers in .
" kill them , " said the conspirators , and immediately began to cut them down .
the magi were within , already in consternation at the <unk> of prexaspes , of which they had just been informed .
they heard the tumult and the outcries of the <unk> at the doors , and seized their arms , the one a bow and the other a spear .
the conspirators rushed in .
the bow was useless in the close combat which ensued , and the magian who had taken it turned and fled .
the other defended himself with his spear for a moment , and wounded severely two of his assailants .
the wounded conspirators fell .
three others of the number continued the unequal combat with the armed magian , while <name> and <unk> rushed in pursuit of the other .
the flying magian ran from one apartment to another until he reached a dark room , into which the blind instinct of fear prompted him to rush , in the vain <name> of concealment .
<unk> was foremost ; he seized the wretched fugitive by the waist , and struggled to hold him , while the magian struggled to get free .
<unk> called upon <name> , who was close behind him , to strike .
<name> , brandishing his sword , looked earnestly into the obscure retreat , that he might see where to strike .
" strike ! "
exclaimed <unk> .
" why do you not strike ? "
" i can not see , " said <name> , " and i am afraid of wounding you . "
" no matter , " said <unk> , struggling desperately all the time with his frantic victim .
" strike quick , if you kill us both . "
<name> struck .
<unk> loosened his hold , and the magian fell upon the floor , and there , stabbed again through the heart by <name> 's sword , almost immediately ceased to breathe .
they dragged the body to the light , and cut off the head .
they did the same with the other magian , whom they found that their confederates had killed when they returned to the apartments where they had left them contending .
the whole body of the conspirators then , except the two who were wounded , exulting in their success , and wild with the excitement which such deeds always awaken , went forth into the streets of the city , bearing the heads upon pikes as the trophies of their victory .
they summoned the persian soldiers to arms , and announced every where that they had ascertained that the king was a priest and an impostor , and not their legitimate sovereign , and that they had consequently killed him .
they called upon the people to kill the <unk> wherever they could find them , as if the whole class were implicated in the guilt of the usurping brothers .
the populace in all countries are easily excited by such denunciations and appeals as these .
the persians armed themselves , and ran to and fro every where in pursuit of the unhappy <unk> , and before night vast <name> of them were slain .

for several days after the assassination of the magi the city was filled with excitement , <unk> , and confusion .
there was no heir , of the family of <name> , entitled to succeed to the vacant throne , for neither cambyses , nor smerdis his brother , had left any sons .
there was , indeed , a daughter of smerdis , named <unk> , and there were also still living two daughters of <name> .
one was atossa , whom we have already mentioned as having been married to cambyses , her brother , and as having been afterward taken by smerdis the magian as one of his wives .
these princesses , though of <name> lineage , seem neither of them to have been disposed to assert any claims to the throne at such a crisis .
the mass of the community were stupefied with astonishment at the sudden revolution which had occurred .
no movement was made toward determining the succession .
for five days nothing was done .
during this period , all the subordinate functions of government in the provinces , cities , and towns , and among the various garrisons and encampments of the army , went on , of course , as usual , but the general administration of the government had no head .
the seven confederates had been regarded , for the time being , as a sort of provisional government , the army and the country in general , so far as appears , looking to them for the means of <unk> from the political difficulties in which this sudden revolution had involved them , and submitting , in the mean time , to their direction and control .
such a state of things , it was obvious , could not long last ; and after five days , when the commotion had somewhat subsided , they began to consider it necessary to make some arrangements of a more permanent character , the power to make such arrangements as they thought best resting with them alone .
they accordingly met for consultation .
herodotus the historian , [ c ] on whose narrative of these events we have mainly to rely for all the information respecting them which is now to be attained , gives a very minute and dramatic account of the deliberations of the conspirators on this occasion .
the account is , in fact , too dramatic to be probably true .
[ footnote c : an account of herodotus , and of the circumstances under which he wrote his history , which <name> aid the reader very much in forming an opinion in respect to the kind and degree of confidence which it is proper to place in his statements , <name> be found in the first chapter of our history of <name> the great . ]
otanes , in this discussion , was in favor of establishing a republic .
he did not think it safe or wise to intrust the supreme power again to any single individual .
it was proved , he said , by universal experience , that when any one person was raised to such an elevation above his fellow-men , he became suspicious , jealous , insolent , and cruel .
he lost all regard for the welfare and happiness of others , and became supremely devoted to the preservation of his own greatness and power by any means , however tyrannical , and to the accomplishment of the purposes of his own despotic <name> .
the best and most valuable citizens were as likely to become the victims of his oppression as the worst .
in fact , tyrants generally chose their favorites , he said , from among the most abandoned men and women in their realms , such characters being the <unk> instruments of their guilty pleasures and their crimes .
otanes referred very particularly to the case of cambyses as an example of the extreme lengths to which the despotic insolence and cruelty of a tyrant could go .
he reminded his <unk> of the sufferings and terrors which they had endured while under his sway , and urged them very strongly not to expose themselves to such terrible evils and dangers again .
he proposed , therefore , that they should establish a republic , under which the officers of government should be elected , and questions of public policy be determined , in assemblies of the people .
it must be understood , however , by the reader , that a republic , as contemplated and intended by otanes in this speech , was entirely different from the mode of government which that word denotes at the present day .
they had little idea , in those times , of the principle of representation , by which the thousand separate and detached communities of a great empire can choose delegates , who are to deliberate , speak , and act for them in the assemblies where the great governmental decisions are ultimately made .
by this principle of representation , the people can really all share in the exercise of power .
without it they can not , for it is impossible that the people of a great state can ever be brought together in one assembly ; nor , even if it were practicable to bring them thus together , would it be possible for such a concourse to deliberate or act .
the action of any assembly which goes beyond a very few hundred in <name> , is always , in fact , the action exclusively of the small knot of leaders who call and manage it .
otanes , therefore , as well as all other advocates of republican government in ancient times , meant that the supreme power should be exercised , not by the great mass of the people included within the jurisdiction in question , but by such a portion of certain privileged classes as could be brought together in the capital .
it was such a sort of republic as would be formed in this country if the affairs of the country at large , and the municipal and domestic institutions of all the states , were regulated and controlled by laws enacted , and by governors appointed , at great municipal meetings held in the city of new york .
this was , in fact , the nature of all the republics of ancient times .
they were generally small , and the city in whose free citizens the supreme power resided , constituted by far the most important portion of the body politic .
the <name> republic , however , became at one period very large .
it overspread almost the whole of europe ; but , widely extended as it was in territory , and comprising innumerable states and kingdoms within its jurisdiction , the vast concentration of power by which the whole was governed , vested entirely and exclusively in noisy and tumultuous assemblies convened in the <name> forum .
even if the idea of a representative system of government , such as is adopted in modern times , and by means of which the people of a great and extended empire can exercise , conveniently and efficiently , a general sovereignty held in common by them all , had been understood in ancient times , it is very doubtful whether it could , in those times , have been carried into effect , for want of certain facilities which are enjoyed in the present age , and which seem essential for the safe and easy action of so vast and complicated a system as a great representative government must necessarily be .
the regular transaction of business at public meetings , and the orderly and successful management of any extended system of elections , requires a great deal of writing ; and the general circulation of newspapers , or something exercising the great function which it is the object of newspapers to fulfill , that of keeping the people at large in some degree informed in respect to the progress of public affairs , seems essential to the successful working of a system of representative government comprising any considerable extent of territory .
however this may be , whether a great representative system would or would not have been practicable in ancient times if it had been tried , it is certain that it was never tried .
in all ancient republics , the sovereignty resided , essentially , in a privileged class of the people of the capital .
the territories governed were provinces , held in subjection as <unk> , and compelled to pay tribute ; and this was the plan which otanes meant to advocate when recommending a republic , in the persian council .
the name of the second speaker in this celebrated consultation was megabyzus .
he opposed the plan of otanes .
he concurred fully , he said , in all that otanes had advanced in respect to the evils of a monarchy , and to the oppression and tyranny to which a people were exposed whose liberties and lives were subject to the despotic control of a single human <name> .
but in order to avoid one extreme , it was not necessary to run into the evils of the other .
the disadvantages and dangers of popular control in the management of the affairs of state were scarcely less than those of a despotism .
popular assemblies were always , he said , turbulent , passionate , capricious .
their decisions were controlled by artful and designing <unk> .
it was not possible that masses of the common people could have either the sagacity to form wise counsels , or the energy and steadiness to execute them .
there could be no deliberation , no calmness , no secrecy in their consultations .
a populace was always governed by excitements , which spread among them by a common sympathy ; and they would give way impetuously to the most senseless impulses , as they were urged by their fear , their resentment , their exultation , their hate , or by any other passing emotion of the hour .
megabyzus therefore disapproved of both a monarchy and a republic .
he recommended an <unk> .
" we are now , " said he , " already seven .
let us select from the leading nobles in the court and officers of the army a small number of men , eminent for talents and virtue , and thus form a select and competent body of men , which shall be the <unk> of the supreme power .
such a plan <unk> the evils and inconveniences of both the other systems .
there can be no tyranny or oppression under such a system ; for , if any one of so large a number should be inclined to abuse his power , he <name> be restrained by the rest .
on the other hand , the number <name> not be so large as to <unk> <name> and deliberation in counsel , and the highest efficiency and energy in carrying counsels into effect . "
when megabyzus had completed his speech , <name> expressed his opinion .
he said that the arguments of those who had already spoken appeared plausible , but that the speakers had not dealt quite fairly by the different systems whose merits they had discussed , since they had compared a good administration of one form of government with a bad administration of another .
every thing human was , he admitted , subject to imperfection and liable to abuse ; but on the supposition that each of the three forms which had been proposed were equally well administered , the advantage , he thought , would be strongly on the side of monarchy .
control exercised by a single mind and <name> was far more concentrated and efficient than that proceeding from any conceivable combination .
the forming of plans could be , in that case , more secret and wary , and the execution of them more immediate and prompt .
where power was lodged in many hands , all energetic exercise of it was paralyzed by the dissensions , the animosities and the contending struggles of envious and jealous rivals .
these struggles , in fact , usually resulted in the predominance of some one , more energetic or more successful than the rest , the aristocracy or the democracy running thus , of its own accord , to a despotism in the end , showing that there were natural causes always tending to the subjection of nations of men to the control of one single <name> .
besides all this , <name> added , in conclusion , that the persians had always been accustomed to a monarchy , and it would be a very dangerous experiment to attempt to introduce a new system , which would require so great a change in all the habits and usages of the people .
thus the consultation went on .
at the end of it , it appeared that four out of the seven agreed with <name> in preferring a monarchy .
this was a majority , and thus the question seemed to be settled .
otanes said that he would make no opposition to any measures which they might adopt to <name> their decision into effect , but that he would not himself be subject to the monarchy which they might establish .
" i do not wish , " he added , " either to govern others or to have others govern me .
you may establish a kingdom , therefore , if you choose , and designate the monarch in any mode that you see fit to adopt , but he must not consider me as one of his subjects .
i myself , and all my family and <unk> , must be wholly free from his control . "
this was a very unreasonable proposition , unless , indeed , otanes was willing to withdraw altogether from the community to which he thus refused to be subject ; for , by residing within it , he necessarily enjoyed its protection , and ought , therefore , to bear his portion of its burdens , and to be amenable to its laws .
notwithstanding this , however , the conspirators acceded to the proposal , and otanes withdrew .
the remaining six of the confederates then proceeded with their arrangements for the establishment of a monarchy .
they first agreed that one of their own number should be the king , and that on <unk> the choice should fall , the other five , while they submitted to his dominion , should always enjoy peculiar privileges and honors at his court .
they were at all times to have free access to the palaces and to the presence of the king , and it was from among their daughters alone that the king was to choose his wives .
these and some other similar points having been arranged , the manner of deciding which of the six should be the king remained to be determined .
the plan which they adopted , and the circumstances connected with the execution of it , constitute , certainly , one of the most extraordinary of all the strange transactions recorded in ancient times .
it is gravely related by herodotus as sober truth .
how far it is to be considered as by any possibility credible , the reader must judge , after knowing what the story is .
they agreed , then , that on the following morning they would all meet on horseback at a place agreed upon beyond the walls of the city , and that the one whose horse should <unk> first should be the king !
the time when this ridiculous ceremony was to be performed was sunrise .
as soon as this arrangement was made the parties separated , and each went to his own home .
<name> called his groom , whose name was <unk> , and ordered him to have his horse ready at sunrise on the next morning , explaining to him , at the same time , the plan which had been formed for <unk> the king .
" if that is the mode which is to be adopted , " said <unk> , " you need have no concern , for i can arrange it very easily so as to have the lot fall upon you . "
<name> expressed a strong <name> to have this accomplished , if it were possible , and <unk> went away .
the method which <unk> adopted was to lead <name> 's horse out to the ground that evening , in company with another , the favorite companion , it seems , of the animal .
now the attachment of the horse to his companion is very strong , and his recollection of localities very vivid , and <unk> expected that when the horse should approach the ground on the following morning , he would be reminded of the company which he enjoyed there the night before , and <unk> .
the result was as he anticipated .
as the horsemen rode up to the appointed place , the horse of <name> <unk> the first , and <name> was unanimously acknowledged king .
in respect to the <unk> of this famous story , the first thought which arises in the mind is , that it is utterly impossible that sane men , acting in so momentous a crisis , and where interests so vast and extended were at stake , could have resorted to a plan so childish and ridiculous as this .
such a mode of <unk> a leader , seriously adopted , would have done discredit to a troop of boys making arrangements for a holiday ; and yet here was an empire extending for thousands of miles through the heart of a vast continent , comprising , probably , fifty nations and many millions of people , with capitals , palaces , armies , fleets , and all the other appointments and machinery of an immense dominion , to be appropriated and disposed of absolutely , and , so far as they could see , forever .
it seems incredible that men possessing such intelligence , and information , and extent of view as we should suppose that officers of their rank and station would necessarily acquire , could have attempted to decide such a momentous question in so ridiculous and trivial a manner .
and yet the account is seriously recorded by herodotus as sober history , and the story has been related again and again , from that day to this , by every successive generation of historians , without any particular question of its truth .
and it may possibly be that it is true .
it is a case in which the apparent improbability is far greater than the real .
in the first place , it would seem that , in all ages of the world , the acts and decisions of men occupying positions of the most absolute and exalted power have been controlled , to a much greater degree , by <name> and by momentary impulse , than mankind have generally supposed .
looking up as we do to these vast elevations from below , they seem invested with a certain sublimity and grandeur which we imagine must continually impress the minds of those who occupy them , and expand and strengthen their powers , and lead them to act , in all respects , with the <unk> , the deliberation , and the far-reaching sagacity which the emergencies continually arising seem to require .
and this is , in fact , in some degree the case with the statesmen and political leaders raised to power under the constitutional governments of modern times .
such statesmen are clothed with their high authority , in one way or another , by the combined and deliberate action of vast masses of men , and every step which they take is watched , in reference to its influence on the condition and welfare of these masses , by many millions ; so that such men live and act under a continual sense of responsibility , and they appreciate , in some degree , the momentous importance of their doings .
but the absolute and independent sovereigns of the old world , who held their power by conquest or by inheritance , though raised sometimes to very vast and giddy elevations , seem to have been unconscious , in many instances , of the dignity and grandeur of their standing , and to have considered their acts only as they affected their own personal and temporary interests .
thus , though placed on a great elevation , they took only very narrow and circumscribed views ; they saw nothing but the objects immediately around them ; and they often acted , accordingly , in the most frivolous and capricious manner .
it was so , undoubtedly , with these six conspirators .
in deciding which of their number should be king , they thought nothing of the interests of the vast realms , and of the countless millions of people whose government was to be provided for .
the question , as they considered it , was doubtless merely which of them should have possession of the <name> palaces , and be the center and the object of <name> pomp and parade in the festivities and celebrations of the capital .
and in the mode of decision which they adopted , it may be that some degree of superstitious feeling mingled .
the action and the voices of animals were considered , in those days , as supernatural omens , indicating the <name> of heaven .
these conspirators may have expected , accordingly , in the neighing of the horse , a sort of divine intimation in respect to the disposition of the crown .
this idea is confirmed by the statement which the account of this transaction contains , that immediately after the neighing of <name> 's horse , it thundered , although there were no clouds in the sky from which the thunder could be supposed naturally to come .
the conspirators , at all events , considered it solemnly decided that <name> was to be king .
they all dismounted from their horses and knelt around him , in acknowledgment of their allegiance and subjection .
it seems that <name> , after he became established on his throne , considered the contrivance by which , through the assistance of his groom , he had obtained the prize , not as an act of fraud which it was incumbent on him to conceal , but as one of brilliant sagacity which he was to <unk> and <name> in .
he caused a magnificent <unk> statue to be sculptured , representing himself mounted on his neighing horse .
this statue he set up in a public place with this inscription : <name> , son of hystaspes , obtained the sovereignty of persia by the sagacity of his horse and the ingenious contrivance of <unk> his groom .

several of the events and incidents which occurred immediately after the accession of <name> to the throne , illustrate in a striking manner the degree in which the princes and potentates of ancient days were governed by <name> and passionate impulse even in their public acts .
one of the most remarkable of these was the case of <unk> .
<unk> was one of the seven conspirators who combined to depose the magian and place <name> on the throne .
by the agreement which they made with each other before it was decided which should be the king , each of them was to have free access to the king 's presence at all times .
one evening , soon after <name> became established on his throne , <unk> went to the palace , and was proceeding to enter the apartment of the king without ceremony , when he was stopped by two officers , who told him that the king had retired .
<unk> was incensed at the officers ' insolence , as he called it .
he <name> his sword , and cut off their noses and their ears .
then he took the bridle off from his horse at the palace gate , and tied the officers together ; and then , leaving them in this helpless and miserable condition , he went away .
the officers immediately repaired to the king , and presented themselves to him , a frightful spectacle , wounded and bleeding , and complaining bitterly of <unk> as the author of the injuries which they had received .
the king was at first alarmed for his own safety .
he feared that the conspirators had all combined together to rebel against his authority , and that this daring insult offered to his personal attendants , in his very palace , was the first outbreak of it .
he accordingly sent for the conspirators one by one , to ask of them whether they approved of what <unk> had done .
they promptly <unk> all connection with <unk> in the act , and all approval of it , and declared their determination to adhere to the decision that they had made , by which <name> had been placed on the throne .
<name> then , after taking proper precautions to guard against any possible attempts at resistance , sent soldiers to seize <unk> , and also his son , and all of his family , relatives , and friends who were capable of bearing arms ; for he suspected that <unk> had meditated a rebellion , and he thought that , if so , these men would most probably be his accomplices .
the prisoners were brought before him .
there was , indeed , no proof that they were engaged in any plan of rebellion , nor even that any plan of rebellion whatever had been formed ; but this circumstance afforded them no protection .
the liberties and the lives of all subjects were at the supreme and absolute disposal of these ancient kings .
<name> thought it possible that the prisoners had entertained , or might entertain , some treasonable designs , and he conceived that he should , accordingly , feel safer if they were removed out of the way .
he decreed , therefore , that they must all die .
while the preparations were making for the execution , the wife of <unk> came continually to the palace of <name> , begging for an audience , that she might <unk> for the lives of her friends .
<name> was informed of this , and at last , pretending to be moved with compassion for her distress , he sent her word that he would pardon one of the criminals for her sake , and that she might decide which one it should be .
his real motive in making this proposal seems to have been to enjoy the perplexity and anguish which the heart of a woman must suffer in being compelled thus to decide , in a question of life and death , between a husband and a son .
the wife of <unk> did not decide in favor of either of these .
she gave the preference , on the other hand , to a brother .
<name> was very much surprised at this result , and sent a messenger to her to inquire how it happened that she could pass over and abandon to their fate her husband and her son , in order to save the life of her brother , who was certainly to be presumed less near and dear to her .
to which she gave this extraordinary reply , that the loss of her husband and her son might perhaps be repaired , since it was not impossible that she might be married again , and that she might have another son ; but that , inasmuch as both her father and mother were dead , she could never have another brother .
the death of her present brother would , therefore , be an irreparable loss .
the king was so much pleased with the novelty and <unk> of this turn of thought , that he gave her the life of her son in addition to that of her brother .
all the rest of the family circle of relatives and friends , together with <unk> himself , he ordered to be slain .
<name> had occasion to be so much displeased , too , shortly after his accession to the throne , with the governor of one of his provinces , that he was induced to order him to be put to death .
the circumstances connected with this governor 's crime , and the manner of his execution , illustrate very forcibly the kind of government which was administered by these military despots in ancient times .
it must be <unk> that great empires , like that over which <name> had been called to rule , were generally divided into provinces .
the inhabitants of these provinces , each community within its own borders , went on , from year to year , in their various pursuits of peaceful industry , governed mainly , in their relations to each other , by the natural sense of justice instinctive in man , and by those thousand local institutions and usages which are always springing up in all human communities under the influence of this principle .
there were governors stationed over these provinces , whose main duty it was to collect and <unk> to the king the tribute which the province was required to furnish him .
these governors were , of course , also to suppress any domestic outbreak of violence , and to repel any foreign invasion which might occur .
a sufficient military force was placed at their disposal to enable them to fulfill these functions .
they paid these troops , of course , from sums which they collected in their provinces under the same system by which they collected the tribute .
this made them , in a great measure , independent of the king in the maintenance of their armies .
they thus intrenched themselves in their various capitals at the head of these troops , and reigned over their respective dominions almost as if they were kings themselves .
they had , in fact , very little connection with the supreme monarch , except to send him the annual tribute which they had collected from their people , and to furnish , also , their <unk> of troops in case of a national war .
in the time of our savior , <unk> was such a governor , intrusted by the romans with the charge of judea , and <name> was one of the tax <unk> employed to collect the tribute .
of course , the governors of such provinces , as we have already said , were , in a great measure , independent of the king .
he had , ordinarily , no officers of justice whose jurisdiction could control , peacefully , such powerful vassals .
the only remedy in most cases , when they were disobedient and rebellious , was to raise an army and go forth to make war upon them , as in the case of any foreign state .
this was attended with great expense , and trouble , and hazard .
the governors , when ambitious and aspiring , sometimes managed their resources with so much energy and military skill as to get the victory over their sovereign in the contests in which they engaged with them , and then they would gain vast <unk> to the privileges and powers which they exercised in their own departments ; and they would sometimes overthrow their discomfited sovereign entirely , and take possession of his throne themselves in his stead .
oretes was the name of one of these governors in the time of <name> .
he had been placed by <name> , some years before , in charge of one of the provinces into which the kingdom of <name> had been divided .
the seat of government was sardis .
[ d ] he was a capricious and cruel tyrant , as , in fact , almost all such governors were .
we <name> relate an account of one of the deeds which he performed some time before <name> ascended the throne , and which sufficiently illustrates his character .
[ footnote d : for the position of sardis , and of other places mentioned in this chapter , see the map at the commencement of the volume , and also that at the commencement of chapter xi . ]
he was one day sitting at the gates of his palace in sardis , in conversation with the governor of a neighboring territory who had come to visit him .
the name of this guest was <unk> .
as the two friends were boasting to one another , as such warriors are accustomed to do , of the deeds of valor and prowess which they had respectively performed , <unk> said that oretes could not make any great pretensions to enterprise and bravery so long as he allowed the greek island of samos , which was <unk> at a short distance from the lydian coast , to remain independent , when it would be so easy to annex it to the persian empire .
" you are afraid of polycrates , i suppose , " said he .
polycrates was the king of samos .
oretes was stung by this taunt , but , instead of <unk> himself on <unk> , the author of it , he resolved on destroying polycrates , though he had no reason other than this for any feeling of enmity toward him .
polycrates , although the seat of his dominion was a small island in the Ã¦gean sea , was a very wealthy , and powerful , and prosperous <name> .
all his plans and enterprises had been remarkably successful .
he had built and equipped a powerful fleet , and had conquered many islands in the neighborhood of his own .
he was projecting still wider schemes of conquests , and hoped , in fact , to make himself the master of all the seas .
a very curious incident is related of polycrates , which illustrates very strikingly the childish superstition which governed the minds of men in those ancient days .
it seems that in the midst of his prosperity , his friend and ally , the king of egypt  for these events , though narrated here , occurred before the invasion of egypt by cambyses  sent to him a letter , of which the following is the purport .
" amasis , king of egypt , to <unk> " it always gives me great satisfaction and pleasure to hear of the prosperity of a friend and ally , unless it is too absolutely continuous and uninterrupted .
something like an alternation of good and ill fortune is best for man ; i have never known an instance of a very long-continued course of <unk> and uninterrupted success that did not end , at last , in overwhelming and terrible calamity .
i am anxious , therefore , for you , and my anxiety <name> greatly increase if this extraordinary and unbroken prosperity should continue much longer .
i counsel you , therefore , to break the current yourself , if fortune <name> not break it .
bring upon yourself some calamity , or loss , or suffering , as a means of <unk> the heavier evils which <name> otherwise inevitably befall you .
it is a general and substantial welfare only that can be permanent and final . "
polycrates seemed to think there was good sense in this suggestion .
he began to look around him to see in what way he could bring upon himself some moderate calamity or loss , and at length decided on the destruction of a very valuable <unk> ring which he kept among his treasures .
the ring was made with very costly jewels set in gold , and was much celebrated both for its exquisite workmanship and also for its intrinsic value .
the loss of this ring would be , he thought , a sufficient calamity to break the evil charm of an excessive and <unk> current of good fortune .
polycrates , therefore , ordered one of the largest vessels in his navy , a <unk> galley , to be equipped and manned , and , embarking in it with a large company of attendants , he put to sea .
when he was at some distance from the island , he took the ring , and in the presence of all his attendants , he threw it forth into the water , and saw it sink , to rise , as he supposed , no more .
but fortune , it seems , was not to be thus <unk> .
a few days after polycrates had returned , a certain fisherman on the coast took , in his nets , a fish of very extraordinary size and beauty ; so extraordinary , in fact , that he felt it incumbent on him to make a present of it to the king .
the servants of polycrates , on opening the fish for the purpose of preparing it for the table , to their great astonishment and gratification , found the ring within .
the king was overjoyed at thus recovering his lost treasure ; he had , in fact , repented of his rashness in throwing it away , and had been bitterly lamenting its loss .
his satisfaction and pleasure were , therefore , very great in regaining it ; and he immediately sent to amasis an account of the whole transaction , expecting that amasis would share in his <name> .
amasis , however , sent word back to him in reply , that he considered the return of the ring in that almost miraculous manner as an extremely unfavorable omen .
" i fear , " said he , " that it is decreed by the fates that you must be overwhelmed , at last , by some dreadful calamity , and that no measures of precaution which you can adopt <name> avail to avert it .
it seems to me , too , " he added , " that it is incumbent on me to withdraw from all alliance and connection with you , lest i should also , at last , be involved in your destined destruction . "
whether this extraordinary story was true , or whether it was all <unk> after the fall of polycrates , as a dramatic embellishment of his history , we can not now know .
the result , however , corresponded with these predictions of amasis , if they were really made ; for it was soon after these events that the conversation took place at sardis between oretes and <unk> , at the gates of the palace , which led oretes to determine on effecting polycrates 's destruction .
in executing the plans which he thus formed , oretes had not the courage and energy necessary for an open attack on polycrates , and he consequently resolved on attempting to accomplish his end by treachery and stratagem .
the plan which he devised was this : he sent a messenger to polycrates with a letter of the following purport : " oretes , governor of sardis , to polycrates of <unk> " i am aware , sire , of the plans which you have long been entertaining for extending your power among the islands and over the waters of the mediterranean , until you shall have acquired the supreme and absolute dominion of the seas .
i should like to join you in this enterprise .
you have ships and men , and i have money .
let us enter into an alliance with each other .
i have accumulated in my <unk> a large supply of gold and silver , which i <name> furnish for the expenses of the undertaking .
if you have any doubt of my sincerity in making these offers , and of my ability to fulfill them , send some messenger in whom you have confidence , and i <name> lay the evidence before him . "
polycrates was much pleased at the prospect of a large accession to his funds , and he sent the messenger , as oretes had proposed .
oretes prepared to receive him by filling a large number of boxes nearly full with heavy stones , and then placing a shallow layer of gold or silver coin at the top .
these boxes were then <unk> covered and secured , with the fastenings usually adopted in those days , and placed away in the <name> <unk> .
when the messenger arrived , the boxes were brought out and opened , and were seen by the messenger to be full , as he supposed , of gold and silver treasure .
the messenger went back to polycrates , and reported that all which oretes had said was true ; and polycrates then determined to go to the main land himself to pay oretes a visit , that they might mature together their plans for the intended campaigns .
he ordered a <unk> galley to be prepared to convey him .
his daughter felt a presentiment , it seems , that some calamity was impending .
she earnestly entreated her father not to go .
she had had a dream , she said , about him , which had frightened her excessively , and which she was convinced portended some terrible danger .
polycrates paid no attention to his daughter 's warnings .
she urged them more and more earnestly , until , at last , she made her father angry , and then she desisted .
polycrates then embarked on board his splendid galley , and sailed away .
as soon as he landed in the dominions of oretes , the monster seized him and put him to death , and then ordered his body to be nailed to a cross , for exhibition to all <unk> by , as a public spectacle .
the train of attendants and servants that accompanied polycrates on this expedition were all made slaves , except a few persons of distinction , who were sent home in a shameful and disgraceful manner .
among the attendants who were detained in captivity by oretes was a celebrated family physician , named democedes , whose remarkable and romantic adventures <name> be the subject of the next chapter .
oretes committed several other murders and <unk> in this treacherous manner , without any just ground for provocation .
in these deeds of violence and cruelty , he seems to have acted purely under the influence of that wanton and capricious malignity which the possession of absolute and irresponsible power so often <unk> in the minds of bad men .
it is doubtful , however , whether these cruelties and crimes would have particularly attracted the attention of <name> , so long as he was not himself directly affected by them .
the central government , in these ancient empires , generally interested itself very little in the contentions and quarrels of the governors of the provinces , provided that the tribute was efficiently collected and regularly paid .
a case , however , soon occurred , in oretes 's treacherous and bloody career , which arrested the attention of <name> and aroused his ire .
<name> had sent a messenger to oretes , with certain orders , which , it seems , oretes did not like to obey .
after delivering his dispatches the bearer set out on his return , and was never afterward heard of .
<name> ascertained , to his own satisfaction at least , that oretes had caused his messenger to be waylaid and killed , and that the bodies both of horse and rider had been buried , secretly , in the solitudes of the mountains , in order to conceal the evidences of the deed .
<name> determined on punishing this crime .
some consideration was , however , required , in order to determine in what way his object could best be effected .
the province of oretes was at a great distance from susa , and oretes was strongly established there , at the head of a great force .
his guards were bound , it is true , to obey the orders of <name> , but it was questionable whether they would do so .
to raise an army and march against the rebellious governor would be an expensive and hazardous undertaking , and perhaps , too , it would prove that such a measure was not necessary .
all things considered , <name> determined to try the experiment of acting , by his own direct orders , upon the troops and guards in oretes 's capital , with the intention of resorting subsequently to an armed force of his own , if that should be at last required .
he accordingly called together a number of his officers and nobles , selecting those on whose resolution and fidelity he could most confidently rely , and made the following address to them : " i have an enterprise which i wish to commit to the charge of some one of your number who is willing to undertake it , which requires no military force , and no violent measures of any kind , but only wisdom , sagacity , and courage .
i wish to have oretes , the governor of sardis , brought to me , dead or alive .
he has perpetrated innumerable crimes , and now , in addition to all his other deeds of treacherous violence , he has had the intolerable insolence to put to death one of my messengers .
which of you <name> volunteer to bring him , dead or alive , to me ? "
this proposal awakened a great enthusiasm among the nobles to whom it was addressed .
nearly thirty of them volunteered their services to execute the order .
<name> concluded to decide between these competitors by lot .
the lot fell upon a certain man named <unk> , and he immediately began to form his plans and make his arrangements for the expedition .
he caused a number of different orders to be prepared , beginning with directions of little moment , and proceeding to commands of more and more weighty importance , all addressed to the officers of <unk> army and to his guards .
these orders were all drawn up in writing with great formality , and were signed by the name of <name> , and sealed with his seal ; they , moreover , named <unk> as the officer selected by the king to superintend the execution of them .
provided with these documents , <unk> proceeded to sardis , and presented himself at the court of oretes .
he presented his own personal credentials , and with them some of his most insignificant orders .
neither oretes nor his guards felt any disposition to disobey them .
<unk> , being thus received and recognized as the <unk> of the king , continued to present new decrees and <unk> , from time to time , as occasions occurred in which he thought the guards would be ready to obey them , until he found the habit , on their part , of looking to him as the representative of the supreme power sufficiently established ; for their disposition to obey him was not merely tested , it was strengthened by every new act of obedience .
when he found , at length , that his hold upon the guards was sufficiently strong , he produced his two final decrees , one ordering the guards to depose oretes from his power , and the other to <unk> him .
both the commands were obeyed .
the events and incidents which have been described in this chapter were of no great importance in themselves , but they illustrate , more forcibly than any general description would do the nature and the operation of the government exercised by <name> throughout the vast empire over which he found himself presiding .
such personal and individual contests and transactions were not all that occupied his attention .
he devoted a great deal of thought and of time to the work of arranging , in a distinct and systematic manner , the division of his dominions into provinces , and to regulating precisely the amount of tribute to be required of each , and the modes of collecting it .
he divided his empire into twenty great districts , each of which was governed by a ruler called a <unk> .
he fixed the amount of tribute which each of these districts was to pay , making it greater or less as the soil and the productions of the country varied in fertility and abundance .
in some cases this tribute was to be paid in gold , in others in silver , and in others in peculiar commodities , natural to the country of which they were required .
for example , one <unk> , which comprised a country famous for its horses , was obliged to furnish one white horse for every day in the year .
this made three hundred and sixty annually , that being the number of days in the persian year .
such a supply , furnished yearly , enabled the king soon to have a very large troop of white horses ; and as the horses were beautifully caparisoned , and the riders magnificently armed , the body of cavalry thus formed was one of the most splendid in the world .
the <unk> were numbered from the west toward the east .
the western portion of <name> minor constituted the first , and the east indian nations the twelfth and last .
the east indians had to pay their tribute in <unk> of gold .
their country produced gold .
as it is now forever too late to separate the facts from the fiction of ancient history , and determine what is to be rejected as false and what received as true , our only resource is to tell the whole story just as it comes down to us , leaving it to each reader to decide for himself what he <name> believe .
in this view of the subject , we <name> conclude this chapter by relating the manner in which it was said in ancient times that these indian nations obtained their gold .
the gold country was situated in remote and dreary deserts , inhabited only by wild beasts and vermin , among which last there was , it seems , a species of ants , which were of enormous size , and wonderful fierceness and <unk> , and which could run faster than the fleetest horse or camel .
these ants , in making their excavations , would bring up from beneath the surface of the ground all the particles of gold which came in their way , and throw them out around their hills .
the indians then would penetrate into these deserts , mounted on the fleetest camels that they could procure , and leading other camels , not so fleet , by their sides .
they were provided , also , with bags for containing the golden sands .
when they arrived at the ant hills , they would dismount , and , gathering up the gold which the ants had discarded , would fill their bags with the utmost possible dispatch , and then mount their camels and ride away .
the ants , in the mean time , would take the alarm , and begin to assemble to attack them ; but as their instinct prompted them to wait until considerable <name> were collected before they commenced their attack , the indians had time to fill their bags and begin their flight before their enemies were ready .
then commenced the <name> , the camels running at their full speed , and the swarms of ants following , and gradually drawing nearer and nearer .
at length , when nearly overtaken , the indians would abandon the camels that they were leading , and fly on , more swiftly , upon those which they rode .
while the ants were busy in devouring the victims thus given up to them , the authors of all the mischief would make good their escape , and thus <name> off their gold to a place of safety .
these famous ants were bigger than foxes !

the great event in the history of <name>  the one , in fact , on account of which it was , mainly , that his name and his career have been so widely celebrated among mankind , was an attempt which he made , on a very magnificent scale , for the invasion and conquest of greece .
before commencing active operations in this grand undertaking , he sent a reconnoitering party to examine and explore the ground .
this reconnoitering party met with a variety of extraordinary adventures in the course of its progress , and the history of it <name> accordingly form the subject of this chapter .
the guide to this celebrated reconnoitering party was a certain greek physician named democedes .
though democedes was called a greek , he was , really , an italian by birth .
his native town was <unk> , which may be found exactly at the ball of the foot on the map of italy .
it was by a very singular series of adventures that he passed from this remote village in the west , over thousands of miles by land and sea , to susa , <name> 's capital .
he began by running away from his father while he was still a boy .
he said that he was driven to this step by the intolerable strictness and cruelty of his father 's government .
this , however , is always the pretext of turbulent and ungovernable young men , who abandon their parents and their homes when the favors and the protection necessary during their long and helpless infancy have been all received , and the time is beginning to arrive for making some return .
democedes was ingenious and cunning , and fond of roving adventure .
in running away from home , he embarked on board a ship , as such characters generally do at the present day , and went to sea .
after meeting with various adventures , he established himself in the island of Ã¦gina , in the Ã¦gean sea , where he began to practice as a physician , though he had had no regular education in that <name> .
in his practice he evinced so much medical skill , or , at least , exercised so much adroitness in leading people to believe that he possessed it , as to give him very soon a wide and exalted reputation .
the people of Ã¦gina appointed him their physician , and assigned him a large salary for his services in attending upon the sick throughout the island .
this was the usual practice in those days .
a town , or an island , or any circumscribed district of country , would appoint a physician as a public officer , who was to devote his attention , at a fixed annual salary , to any cases of sickness which might arise in the community , wherever his services were needed , precisely as physicians serve in hospitals and public institutions in modern times .
democedes remained at Ã¦gina two years , during which time his celebrity increased and extended more and more , until , at length , he received an appointment from the city of athens , with the offer of a greatly increased salary .
he accepted the appointment , and remained in athens one year , when he received still more advantageous offers from polycrates , the king of samos , whose history was given so fully in the last chapter .
democedes remained for some time in the court of polycrates , where he was raised to the highest distinction , and loaded with many honors .
he was a member of the household of the king , enjoyed his confidence in a high degree , and attended him , personally , on all his expeditions .
at last , when polycrates went to sardis , as is related in the last chapter , to receive the treasures of oretes , and concert with him the plans for their proposed campaigns , democedes accompanied him as usual ; and when polycrates was slain , and his attendants and followers were made captive by oretes , the unfortunate physician was among the number .
by this reverse , he found that he had suddenly fallen from affluence , ease , and honor , to the condition of a neglected and wretched captive in the hands of a malignant and merciless tyrant .
democedes pined in this confinement for a long time ; when , at length , oretes himself was killed by the order of <name> , it might have been expected that the hour of his deliverance had arrived .
but it was not so ; his condition was , in fact , made worse , and not better by it ; for <unk> , the commissioner of <name> , instead of inquiring into the circumstances relating to the various members of oretes 's family , and <unk> the wrongs which any of them might be suffering , simply seized the whole company , and brought them all to <name> in susa , as trophies of his triumph , and tokens of the faithfulness and efficiency with which he had executed the work that <name> had committed to his charge .
thus democedes was borne away , in hopeless bondage , thousands of miles farther from his native land than before , and with very little prospect of being ever able to return .
he arrived at susa , destitute , squalid , and miserable .
his language was foreign , his rank and his professional skill unknown , and all the marks which might indicate the refinement and delicacy of the modes of life to which he had been accustomed were wholly disguised by his present destitution and wretchedness .
he was sent with the other captives to the prisons , where he was secured , like them , with fetters and chains , and was soon almost entirely forgotten .
he might have taken some measures for making his character , and his past celebrity and fame as a physician known ; but he did not dare to do this , for fear that <name> might learn to value his medical skill , and so detain him as a slave for the sake of his services .
he thought that the chance was greater that some turn of fortune , or some accidental change in the arrangements of government might take place , by which he might be set at <name> , as an insignificant and worthless captive , whom there was no particular motive for <unk> , than if he were transferred to the king 's household as a slave , and his value as an <unk>  for medical practice was , in those days , simply an <name>  were once known .
he made no effort , therefore , to bring his true character to light , but pined silently in his dungeon , in rags and wretchedness , and in a mental despondency which was gradually sinking into despair .
about this time , it happened that <name> was one day riding furiously in a <name> , and coming upon some sudden danger , he attempted to leap from his horse .
he fell and sprained his ankle .
he was taken up by the attendants , and carried home .
his physicians were immediately called to attend to the case .
they were egyptians .
egypt was , in fact , considered the great seat and centre of learning and of the arts in those days , and no <name> household was complete without egyptian physicians .
the learning and skill , however , of the egyptians in <name> 's court were entirely baffled by the sprain .
they thought that the joint was dislocated , and they turned and twisted the foot with so much violence , in their attempts to restore the bones to their proper position , as greatly to increase the pain and the inflammation .
<name> spent a week in extreme and excruciating suffering .
he could not sleep day nor night , but tossed in continual restlessness and anguish on his couch , made constantly worse instead of better by every effort of his physicians to relieve him .
at length somebody informed him that there was a greek physician among the captives that came from sardis , and recommended that <name> should send for him .
the king , in his impatience and pain , was ready for any experiment which promised the least <name> of relief , and he ordered that democedes should be immediately summoned .
the officers accordingly went to the prison and brought out the astonished captive , without any notice or preparation , and conducted him , just as he was , ragged and wretched , and <unk> with iron fetters upon his feet , into the presence of the king .
the fetters which such captives wore were intended to allow them to walk , slowly and with difficulty , while they impeded the movements of the feet so as effectually to prevent any long or rapid flight , or any escape at all from free pursuers .
democedes , when questioned by <name> , denied at first that he possessed any medical knowledge or skill .
<name> was , however , not deceived by these protestations .
it was very customary , in those days of <name> tyranny , for those who possessed any thing valuable to conceal the possession of it : concealment was often their only protection .
<name> , who was well aware of this tendency , did not believe the assurances of democedes , and in the irritation and impatience caused by his pain , he ordered the captive to be taken out and put to the torture , in order to make him confess that he was really a physician .
democedes yielded without waiting to be actually put to the test .
he acknowledged at once , for fear of the torture , that he had had some experience in medical practice , and the sprained ankle was immediately committed to his charge .
on examining the case , he thought that the harsh and violent operations which the egyptian physicians had attempted were not required .
he treated the inflamed and swollen joint in the gentlest manner .
he made <unk> and <unk> applications , which soothed the pain , subdued the inflammation , and allayed the restlessness and the fever .
the <name> sufferer became quiet and calm , and in a short time fell asleep .
in a word , the king rapidly recovered ; and , overwhelmed with gratitude toward the benefactor whose skill had saved him from such suffering , he ordered that , in place of his single pair of iron fetters , he should have two pairs of fetters of gold !
it might at first be imagined that such a strange token of regard as this could be intended only as a jest and an insult ; but there is no doubt that <name> meant it seriously as a compliment and an honor .
he supposed that democedes , of course , considered his condition of captivity as a fixed and permanent one ; and that his fetters were not , in themselves , an injustice or disgrace , but the necessary and unavoidable <unk> of his lot , so that the sending of golden fetters to a slave was very naturally , in his view , like presenting a golden crutch to a cripple .
democedes received the equivocal <unk> with great good nature .
he even ventured upon a joke on the subject to the convalescent king .
" it seems , sire , " said he " that in return for my saving your limb and your life , you double my <unk> .
you have given me two chains instead of one . "
the king , who was now in a much better humor to be pleased than when , writhing in anguish , he had ordered democedes to be put to the torture , laughed at this reply , and released the captive from the bonds entirely .
he ordered him to be conducted by the attendants to the apartments of the palace , where the wives of <name> and the other ladies of the court resided , that they might see him and express their gratitude .
" this is the physician , " said the <unk> , who introduced him , " that cured the king . "
the ladies welcomed him with the utmost cordiality , and loaded him with presents of gold and silver as he passed through their apartments .
the king made arrangements , too , immediately , for providing him with a magnificent house in susa , and established him there in great luxury and splendor , with costly furniture and many attendants , and all other marks of distinction and honor .
in a word , democedes found himself , by means of another unexpected change of fortune , suddenly elevated to a height as lofty as his misery and degradation had been low .
he was , however , a captive still .
the <name> atossa , the daughter of <name> , who has already been mentioned as the wife of cambyses and of smerdis the magian , was one of the wives of <name> .
her sister <unk> was another .
a third was <unk> , the daughter of otanes , the <name> who had been so instrumental , in connection with atossa , in the discovery of the magian imposture .
it happened that , some time after the curing of <name> 's sprain , atossa herself was sick .
her malady was of such a nature , that for some time she kept it concealed , from a feeling of delicacy .
[ e ] at length , terrified by the danger which threatened her , she sent for democedes , and made her case known to him .
he said that he could cure her , but she must first promise to <name> him , if he did so , a certain favor which he should ask .
she must promise beforehand to <name> it , whatever it might be .
it was nothing , he said , that should in any way compromise her honor .
[ footnote e : it was a <unk> of the breast , which became , at length , an open <unk> , and began to spread and enlarge in a very formidable manner . ]
atossa agreed to these conditions , and democedes undertook her case .
her malady was soon cured ; and when she asked him what was the favor which he wished to demand , he replied , " persuade <name> to form a plan for the invasion of greece , and to send me , with a small company of attendants , to explore the country , and obtain for him all the necessary preliminary information .
in this way i shall see my native land once more . "
atossa was faithful in her promise .
she availed herself of the first favorable opportunity , when it became her turn to visit the king , to direct his mind , by a dexterous conversation , toward the subject of the enlargement of his empire .
he had vast forces and resources , she said , at his command , and might easily enter upon a career of conquest which would attract the admiration of the world .
<name> replied that he had been entertaining some views of that nature .
he had thought , he said , of attacking the scythians : these scythians were a group of <unk> nations on the north of his dominions .
atossa represented to him that subduing the scythians would be too easy a conquest , and that it would be a far nobler enterprise , and more worthy of his talents and his vast resources , to undertake an expedition into europe , and attempt the conquest of greece .
" you have all the means at your command essential for the success of such an undertaking , and you have in your court a man who can give you , or can obtain for you , all the necessary information in respect to the country , to enable you to form the plan of your campaigns . "
the ambition of <name> was fired by these suggestions .
he began immediately to form projects and schemes .
in a day or two he organized a small party of persian officers of distinction , in whom he had great confidence , to go on an exploring tour into greece .
they were provided with a suitable company of attendants , and with every thing necessary for their journey , and democedes was directed to prepare to go with them as their guide .
they were to travel simply as a party of persian noblemen , on an excursion of curiosity and pleasure , concealing their true design ; and as democedes their guide , though born in italy , was in all important points a greek , and was well acquainted with the countries through which they were to pass , they supposed that they could travel every where without suspicion .
<name> charged the persians to keep a diligent watch over democedes , and not to allow him , on any account to leave them , but to bring him back to susa safely with them on their return .
as for democedes , he had no intention whatever of returning to persia , though he kept his designs of making his escape entirely concealed .
<name> , with seeming generosity , said to him , while he was making his preparations , " i recommend to you to take with you all your private wealth and treasures , to distribute , for presents , among your friends in greece and italy .
i <name> bestow more upon you here on your return . "
democedes regarded this counsel with great suspicion .
he imagined that the king , in giving him this permission , wished to ascertain , by observing whether he would really take with him all his possessions , the existence of any secret determination in his mind not to come back to susa .
if this were <name> 's plan , it was defeated by the sagacious vigilance and cunning of the physician .
he told the king , in reply , that he preferred to leave his effects in persia , that they might be ready for his use on his return .
the king then ordered a variety of costly articles to be provided and given to democedes , to be taken with him and presented to his friends in greece and italy .
they consisted of vessels of gold and silver , pieces of persian armor of beautiful workmanship , and articles of dress , expensive and splendid .
these were all carefully packed , and the various other necessary preparations were made for the long journey .
at length the expedition set out .
they traveled by land westward , across the continent , till they reached the eastern shores of the mediterranean sea .
the port at which they arrived was <unk> , the city so often mentioned in the scriptures as a great pagan <unk> of commerce .
the city of <unk> was in the height of its <name> at this time , being one of the most important ports of the mediterranean for all the western part of <name> .
caravans of travelers came to it by land , bringing on the backs of camels the productions of arabia , persia , and all the east ; and fleets of ships by sea , loaded with the corn , and wine , and oil of the western nations .
at <unk> the land journey of the expedition was ended .
here they bought two large and splendid ships , galleys of three banks of oars , to convey them to greece .
these galleys were for their own personal accommodation .
there was a third vessel , called a transport , for the conveyance of their baggage , which consisted mainly of the packages of <name> and costly presents which <name> had prepared .
some of these presents were for the friends of democedes , as has been already explained , and others had been provided as gifts and offerings from the king himself to such distinguished personages as the travelers might visit on their route .
when the vessels were ready , and the costly cargo was on board , the company of travelers embarked , and the little fleet put to sea .
the grecian territories are <unk> divided and indented by the seas , whose irregular and winding shores form promontories , <unk> , and islands without number , which are accessible in every part by water .
the persian explorers <unk> about among these coasts under democedes 's guidance , examining every thing , and noting carefully all the information which they could obtain , either by personal observation or by inquiring of others , which might be of service to <name> in his intended invasion .
democedes allowed them to take their own time , directing their course , however , steadily , though slowly , toward his own native town of <unk> .
the expedition landed in various places , and were every where well received .
it was not for the interest of democedes that they should yet be intercepted .
in fact , the name and power of <name> were very much feared , or , at least , very highly respected in all the grecian territory , and the people were little inclined to molest a peaceful party of persians traveling like ordinary tourists , and under the guidance , too , of a distinguished countryman of their own , whose name was , in some degree , a guarantee for the honesty and innocence of their intentions .
at length , however , after spending some time in the grecian seas , the little squadron moved still farther west , toward the coast of italy , and arrived finally at tarentum .
tarentum was the great port on the grecian side of italy .
it was at the head of the spacious bay which sets up between the heel and the ball of the foot of the <unk> peninsula .
<unk> , democedes 's native town , to which he was now desirous to return , was southwest of tarentum , about two hundred miles along the shore .
[ f ] [ footnote f : for the situation of these places , see the map at the commencement of chapter xi . ]
it was a very curious and extraordinary circumstance that , though the expedition had been thus far allowed to go and come as its leaders pleased , without any <unk> or suspicion , yet now , the moment that they touched a point from which democedes could easily reach his home , the authorities on shore , in some way or other , obtained some intimation of the true character of their enterprise .
the <name> of tarentum seized the ships .
he made the persians themselves prisoners also , and shut them up ; and , in order effectually to confine the ships , he took away the <unk> from them , so that they could not be steered , and were thus entirely disabled .
the expedition being thus , for the time at least , broken up , democedes said , coolly , that he would take the opportunity to make a little excursion along the coast , and visit his friends at <unk> !
it was another equally suspicious circumstance in respect to the probability that this seizure was the result of <unk> management , that , as soon as he was safely away , the <name> of tarentum set his prisoners at <name> , releasing , at the same time , the ships from the seizure , and sending the <unk> on board .
the persians were indignant at the treatment which they had received , and set sail immediately along the coast toward <unk> in pursuit of democedes .
they found him in the market-place in <unk> , <unk> the people , and exciting , by his appearance and his discourse , a great and general curiosity .
they attempted to seize him as a fugitive , and called upon the people of <unk> to aid them , threatening them with the vengeance of <name> if they refused .
a part of the people were disposed to comply with this demand , while others rallied to defend their <unk> .
a great tumult ensued ; but , in the end , the party of democedes was victorious .
he was not only thus personally rescued , but , as he informed the people that the transport vessel which accompanied the expedition contained property that belonged to him , they seized that too , and gave it up to democedes , saying to the persians that , though they must give up the transport , the galleys remained at their service to convey them back to their own country whenever they wished to go .
the persians had now no other alternative but to return home .
they had , it is true , pretty nearly accomplished the object of their undertaking ; but , if any thing remained to be done , they could not now attempt it with any advantage , as they had lost their guide , and a great portion of the effects which had been provided by <name> to enable them to propitiate the favor of the princes and potentates into whose power they might fall .
they accordingly began to make preparations for sailing back again to <unk> , while democedes established himself in great magnificence and splendor in <unk> .
when , at length , the persians were ready to sail , democedes wished them a very pleasant voyage , and desired them to give his best respects to <name> , and inform him that he could not return at present to persia , as he was making arrangements to be married !
the disasters which had befallen these persian <unk> thus far were only the beginning of their troubles .
their ships were driven by contrary winds out of their course , and they were thrown at last upon the coast of <unk> , a country occupying the heel of italy .
here they were seized by the inhabitants and made slaves .
it happened that there was living in this wild country at that time a man of wealth and of cultivation , who had been exiled from tarentum on account of some political offenses .
his name was <unk> .
he heard the story of these unhappy foreigners , and interested himself in their fate .
he thought that , by rescuing them from their captivity and sending them home , he should make <name> his friend , and secure , perhaps , his aid in effecting his own restoration to his native land .
he accordingly paid the ransom which was demanded for the captives , and set them free .
he then aided them in making arrangements for their return to persia , and the unfortunate messengers found their way back at last to the court of <name> , without their guide , without any of the splendid appointments with which they had gone forth , but stripped of every thing , and glad to escape with their lives .
they had some cause to fear , too , the anger of <name> , for the <unk> wrath of a tyrant is awakened as often by calamity as by crime .
<name> , however , was in this instance graciously disposed .
he received the unfortunate commissioners in a favorable manner .
he took immediate measures for <unk> <unk> for having <unk> them .
he treasured up , too , the information which they had obtained respecting greece , though he was prevented by circumstances , which we <name> proceed to describe , from immediately putting into execution his plans of invasion and conquest there .

the city of babylon , originally the capital of the assyrian empire , was conquered by <name> , the founder of the persian monarchy , when he annexed the assyrian empire to his dominions .
it was a vast and a very magnificent and wealthy city ; and <name> made it , for a time , one of his capitals .
when <name> made this conquest of babylon , he found the jews in captivity there .
they had been made captive by <unk> , a previous king of babylon , as is related in the scriptures .
the holy prophets of judea had predicted that after seventy years the captives should return , and that babylon itself should afterward be destroyed .
the first prediction was fulfilled by the victory of <name> .
it devolved on <name> to execute the second of these solemn and <unk> decrees of heaven .
although <name> was thus the instrument of divine providence in the destruction of babylon , he was unintentionally and unconsciously so .
in the terrible scenes connected with the siege and the storming of the ill-fated city , it was the impulse of his own hatred and revenge that he was directly obeying ; he was not at all aware that he was , at the same time , the messenger of the divine displeasure .
the wretched babylonians , in the storming and destruction of their city , were <unk> a double <unk> .
their pride , their wickedness , their wanton cruelty toward the jews , had brought upon them the condemnation of god , while their political treason and rebellion , or , at least , what was considered treason and rebellion aroused the implacable resentment of their king .
the babylonians had been disposed to revolt even in the days of <name> .
they had been accustomed to consider their city as the most <name> and magnificent capital in the world , and they were displeased that <name> did not make it the seat and center of his empire .
<name> preferred susa ; and babylon , accordingly , though he called it one of his capitals , soon fell to the rank of a provincial city .
the nobles and provincial leaders that remained there began accordingly to form plans for revolting from the persian dominion , with a view of restoring their city to its ancient position and renown .
they had a very favorable opportunity for maturing their plans , and making their preparations for the execution of them during the time of the magian usurpation ; for while the false smerdis was on the throne , being shut up and concealed in his palace at susa , the affairs of the provinces were neglected ; and when <name> and his accomplices discovered the imposture and put smerdis to death , there was necessarily required , after so violent a revolution , a considerable time before the affairs of the empire demanding attention at the capital could be settled , so as to allow the government to turn their thoughts at all toward the distant <unk> .
the babylonians availed themselves of all these opportunities to put their city in the best condition for resisting the persian power .
they strengthened their defenses , and accumulated great stores of provisions , and took measures for diminishing that part of the population which would be useless in war .
these measures were all concerted and carried into effect in the most covert and secret manner ; and the tidings came at last to susa that babylon had openly revolted , before the government of <name> was aware even of the existence of any disaffection .
the time which the babylonians chose for their rebellion at last was one when the movable forces which <name> had at command were at the west , engaged in a campaign on the shores of <name> minor .
<name> had sent them there for the purpose of restoring a certain exile and wanderer named syloson to samos , and making him the monarch of it .
<name> had been induced thus to interpose in syloson 's behalf by the following very extraordinary circumstances .
syloson was the brother of polycrates , whose unhappy history has already been given .
he was exiled from samos some time before <name> ascended the throne , and he became , consequently , a sort of soldier of fortune , serving , like other such adventurers , wherever there was the greatest prospect of <name> and pay .
in this capacity he followed the army of cambyses into egypt in the memorable campaign described in the first chapter of this volume .
it happened , also , that <name> himself , who was then a young <name> in the persian court , and yet of no particular distinction , as there was then no reason to imagine that he would ever be elevated to the throne , was also in cambyses 's army , and the two young men became acquainted with one another there .
while the army was at memphis , an incident occurred in which these two personages were actors , which , though it seemed unimportant at the time , led , in the end , to vast and momentous results .
the incident was this : syloson had a very handsome red cloak , which , as he appeared in it one day , walking in the great square at memphis , strongly attracted the admiration of <name> .
<name> asked syloson if he would sell him the cloak .
syloson said that he would not sell it , but would give it to him .
he thought , probably , that <name> would decline receiving it as a present .
if he did entertain that idea , it seems he was mistaken .
<name> praised him for his generosity , and accepted the gift .
syloson was then sorry that he had made so inconsiderate an offer , and regretted very much the loss of his cloak .
in process of time , the campaign of cambyses in egypt was ended , and <name> returned to persia , leaving syloson in the west .
at length the conspiracy was formed for <unk> smerdis the magian , as has already been described , and <name> was designated to reign in his stead .
as the news of the young <name> 's elevation spread into the western world , it reached syloson .
he was much pleased at receiving the intelligence , and he saw immediately that there was a prospect of his being able to derive some advantage , himself , from the accession of his old <unk> to the throne .
he immediately proceeded to susa .
he applied at the gates of the palace for admission to the presence of the king .
the <name> asked him who he was .
he replied that he was a greek who had formerly done <name> a service , and he wished to see him .
the <name> carried the message to the king .
the king could not imagine who the stranger should be .
he endeavored in vain to recall to mind any instance in which he had received a favor from a greek .
at length he ordered the attendant to call the visitor in .
syloson was accordingly conducted into the king 's presence .
<name> looked upon him , but did not know him .
he directed the interpreters to inquire what the service was which he had rendered the king , and when he had rendered it .
the greek replied by relating the circumstance of the cloak .
<name> recollected the cloak , though he had forgotten the giver .
" are you , indeed , " said he , " the man who made me that present ?
i thought then that you were very generous to me , and you shall see that i do not <unk> the obligation now .
i am at length , fortunately , in a situation to <unk> the favor , and i <name> give you such an abundance of gold and silver as shall effectually prevent your being sorry for having shown a kindness to <name> hystaspes . "
syloson thanked the king in reply , but said that he did not wish for gold and silver .
<name> asked him what reward he did <name> .
he replied that he wished samos to be restored to him : " samos , " said he , " was the possession of my brother .
when he went away from the island , he left it temporarily in the hands of <unk> , an officer of his household .
it still remains in the possession of this family , while i , the rightful heir , am a homeless wanderer and exile , excluded from my brother 's dominions by one of his slaves . "
<name> immediately determined to accede to syloson 's request .
he raised an army and put it under the command of otanes , who , it <name> be recollected , was one of the seven conspirators that combined to <unk> smerdis the magian .
he directed otanes to accompany syloson to samos , and to put him in possession of the island .
syloson was particularly <name> in his request that no unnecessary violence should be used , and no blood shed , or vindictive measures of any kind adopted .
<name> promised to comply with these desires , and gave his orders to otanes accordingly .
notwithstanding this , however , the expedition resulted in the almost total destruction of the <unk> population , in the following manner .
there was a citadel at samos , to which the inhabitants retired when they learned that otanes had embarked his troops in ships on the coast , and was advancing toward the island .
<unk> was vexed and angry at the prospect of being deprived of his possessions and his power ; and , as the people hated him on account of his extortion and tyranny , he hated them in return , and cared not how much suffering his measures might be the means of bringing upon them .
he had a subterranean and secret passage from the citadel to the shore of the sea , where , in a secluded cove , were boats or vessels ready to take him away .
having made these arrangements to secure his own safety , he proceeded to take such a course and adopt such measures as should tend most effectually to <unk> and offend the persians , intending to escape , himself , at the last moment , by this subterranean retreat , and to leave the inhabitants of the island at the <name> of their infuriated enemies .
he had a brother whom he had shut up in a dungeon , and whose mind , naturally depraved , and irritated by his injuries , was in a state of malignant and furious despair .
<unk> had pretended to be willing to give up the island to the persians .
he had entered into negotiations with them for this purpose , and the persians considered the treaty as in fact concluded .
the leaders and officers of the army had assembled , accordingly , before the citadel in a peaceful attitude , waiting merely for the completion of the forms of surrender , when <unk> , <unk> 's captive brother , saw them , by looking out between the bars of his window , in the tower in which he was confined .
he sent an urgent message to <unk> , requesting to speak to him .
<unk> ordered the prisoner to be brought before him .
the haggard and <unk> captive , rendered half insane by the combined influence of the confinement he had endured , and of the wild excitement produced by the universal panic and confusion which reigned around him , broke forth against his brother in the boldest and most violent invectives .
he reproached him in the most bitter terms for being willing to yield so <unk> , and without a struggle , to an invading foe , whom he might easily repel .
" you have courage and energy enough , it seems , " said he , " to make war upon an innocent and defenseless brother , and to keep him for years in chains and in a dungeon , but when an actual enemy appears , though he comes to <unk> you of all your possessions , and to send you into hopeless exile , and though , if you had the ordinary courage and spirit of a man , you could easily drive him away , yet you dare not face him .
if you are too cowardly and mean to do your duty yourself , give me your soldiers , and i <name> do it for you .
i <name> drive these persians back into the sea with as much pleasure as it would give me to drive you there ! "
such a nature as that of <unk> can not be stung into a proper sense of duty by reproaches like these .
there seem to have been in his heart no moral <unk> of any kind , and there could be , of course , no <unk> for the past , and no awakening of new and better desires for the future .
all the effect which was produced upon his mind by these bitter denunciations was to convince him that to comply with his brother 's request would be to do the best thing now in his power for widening , and extending , and making sure the misery and mischief which were impending .
he placed his troops , therefore , under his brother 's orders ; and while the infuriated madman sallied forth at the head of them to attack the astonished persians on one side of the citadel , <unk> made his escape through the <unk> passage on the other .
the persians were so exasperated at what appeared to them the <unk> treachery , that , as soon as they could recover their arms and get once more into battle array , they commenced a universal slaughter of the <unk> .
they spared neither age , sex , nor condition ; and when , at last , their vengeance was satisfied , and they put the island into syloson 's hands , and withdrew , he found himself in possession of an almost absolute solitude .
[ illustration : the babylonians <unk> <name> . ]
it was while otanes was absent on this enterprise , having with him a large part of the <unk> forces of the king , that the babylonians revolted .
<name> was greatly incensed at hearing the tidings .
sovereigns are always greatly incensed at a revolt on the part of their subjects .
the circumstances of the case , whatever they may be , always seem to them to constitute a peculiar <unk> of the offense .
<name> was indignant that the babylonians had attempted to take advantage of his weakness by <unk> when his armies were away .
if they had risen when his armies were around him , he would have been equally indignant with them for having dared to brave his power .
he assembled all the forces at his disposal , and advanced to babylon .
the people of the city shut their gates against him , and derided him .
they danced and capered on the walls , making all sorts of gestures expressive of contempt and defiance , accompanied with shouts and outcries of ridicule and scorn .
they had great confidence in the strength of their defenses , and then , besides this , they probably regarded <name> as a sort of usurper , who had no legitimate title to the throne , and who would never be able to subdue any serious resistance which might be offered to the establishment of his power .
it was from these considerations that they were emboldened to be guilty of the folly of <unk> and insulting their foes from the city walls .
such incidents as this , of personal communications between masses of enemies on the <name> of a battle , were very common in ancient warfare , though impossible in modern times .
in those days , when the missiles employed were thrown chiefly by the strength of the human arm alone , the combatants could safely draw near enough together for each side to hear the voices and to see the gesticulations of the other .
besiegers could advance sufficiently close to a castle or citadel to parley <unk> with the garrison upon the walls , and yet be safe from the showers of darts and arrows which were projected toward them in return .
but all this is now changed .
the reach of cannon , and even of musketry , is so long , that combatants , approaching a conflict , are kept at a very respectful distance apart , until the time arrives in which the actual engagement is to begin .
they reconnoiter each other with <unk> from watch-towers on the walls , or from <unk> in the field , but they can hold no communication except by a formal embassy , protected by a flag of truce , which , with its white and distant fluttering , as it slowly advances over the green fields , warns the gunners at the battery or on the <unk> to point their artillery another way .
the babylonians , on the walls of their city , reproached and <unk> their foes incessantly .
" take our advice , " said they , " and go back where you came from .
you <name> only lose your time in besieging babylon .
when mules have foals , you <name> take the city , and not till then . "
the expression " when mules have foals " was equivalent in those days to our proverbial phrase , " when the sky falls , " being used to denote any thing impossible or absurd , inasmuch as mules , like other hybrid animals , do not produce young .
it was thought in those times absolutely impossible that they should do so ; but it is now well known that the case is not impossible , though very rare .
it seems to have added very much to the interest of an historical narrative in the minds of the ancient greeks , to have some prodigy connected with every great event ; and , in order to gratify this feeling , the writers appear in some instances to have <unk> a prodigy for the occasion , and in others to have elevated some unusual , though by no means supernatural circumstance , to the rank and importance of one .
the prodigy connected with this siege of babylon was the <unk> of a mule .
the mule belonged to a general in the army of <name> , named zopyrus .
it was after <name> had been prosecuting the siege of the city for a year and a half , without any progress whatever toward the accomplishment of his end .
the army began to despair of success .
zopyrus , with the rest , was expecting that the siege would be indefinitely prolonged , or , perhaps , absolutely abandoned , when his attention was strongly attracted to the phenomenon which had happened in respect to the mule .
he remembered the taunt of the <unk> on the wall , and it seemed to him that the whole occurrence portended that the time had now arrived when some way might be devised for the capture of the city .
<unk> and prophecies are often the causes of their own fulfillment , and this <unk> led zopyrus to endeavor to devise some means to accomplish the end in view .
he went first , however , to <name> , to converse with him upon the subject , with a view of ascertaining how far he was really desirous of bringing the siege to a termination .
he wished to know whether the object was of sufficient importance in <name> 's mind to warrant any great sacrifice on his own part to effect it .
he found that it was so .
<name> was extremely impatient to end the siege and to capture the city ; and zopyrus saw at once that , if he could in any way be the means of accomplishing the work , he should entitle himself , in the highest possible degree , to the gratitude of the king .
he determined to go himself into babylon as a pretended deserter from <name> , with a view to obtaining an influence and a command within the city , which should enable him afterward to deliver it up to the besiegers ; and , in order to convince the babylonians that his desertion was real , he resolved to <unk> himself in a manner so dreadful as would effectually prevent their imagining that the injuries which he suffered were inflicted by any contrivance of his own .
he accordingly cut off his hair and his ears , and mutilated his face in a manner too shocking to be here detailed , inflicting injuries which could never be repaired .
he caused himself to be scourged , also , until his whole body was covered with cuts and <unk> .
he then went , wounded and bleeding as he was , into the presence of <name> , to make known his plans .
<name> expressed amazement and consternation at the terrible spectacle .
he leaped from his throne and rushed toward zopyrus , demanding who had dared to <unk> one of his generals in such a manner .
when zopyrus replied that he had himself done the deed , the king 's astonishment was greater than before .
he told zopyrus that he was insane .
some sudden paroxysm of madness had come over him .
zopyrus replied that he was not insane ; and he explained his design .
his plan , he said , was deliberately and calmly formed , and it should be steadily and faithfully executed .
" i did not make known my design to you , " said he , " before i had taken the preliminary steps , for i knew that you would prevent my taking them .
it is now too late for that , and nothing remains but to reap , if possible , the advantage which may be derived from what i have done . "
he then arranged with <name> the plans which he had formed , so far as he needed the co-operation of the king in the execution of them .
if he could gain a partial command in the <unk> army , he was to make a <name> from the city gates on a certain day , and attack a portion of the persian army , which <name> was to leave purposely exposed , in order that he might gain credit with the babylonians by destroying them .
from this he supposed that the confidence which the babylonians would repose in him would increase , and he might consequently receive a greater command .
thus he might , by acting in concert with <name> without , gradually gain such an ascendency within the city as finally to have power to open the gates and let the besiegers in .
<name> was to station a detachment of a thousand men near a certain gate , leaving them imperfectly armed , on the tenth day after zopyrus entered the city .
these zopyrus was to destroy .
seven days afterward , two thousand more were to be stationed in a similar manner at another point ; and these were also to be destroyed by a second <name> .
twenty days after this , four thousand more were to be similarly exposed .
thus seven thousand innocent and defenseless men would be slaughtered , but that , as zopyrus said , would be " of no consequence . "
the lives of men were estimated by heroes and conquerors in those days only at their numerical value in swelling the army roll .
these things being all arranged , zopyrus took leave of the king to go to babylon .
as he left the persian camp , he began to run , looking round behind him continually , as if in flight .
some men , too , pretended to pursue him .
he fled toward one of the gates of the city .
the sentinels on the walls saw him coming .
when he reached the gate , the <name> inside of it talked with him through a small opening , and heard his story .
the <name> then reported the case to the superior officers , and they commanded that the fugitive should be admitted .
when conducted into the presence of the magistrates , he related a piteous story of the cruel treatment which he had received from <name> , and of the difficulty which he had experienced in making his escape from the tyrant 's hands .
he uttered , too , dreadful imprecations against <name> , and expressed the most eager determination to be revenged .
he informed the babylonians , moreover , that he was well acquainted with all <name> 's plans and designs , and with the disposition which he had made of his army ; and that , if they would , in a few days , when his wounds should have in some measure healed , give him a small command , he would show them , by actual trial , what he could do to aid their cause .
they acceded to this proposition , and furnished zopyrus , at the end of ten days , with a moderate force .
zopyrus , at the head of this force , sallied forth from the gate which had been previously agreed upon between him and <name> , and fell upon the unfortunate thousand that had been stationed there for the purpose of being destroyed .
they were nearly defenseless , and zopyrus , though his force was inferior , cut them all to pieces before they could be <unk> or protected , and then retreated safely into the city again .
he was received by the babylonians with the utmost exultation and <name> .
he had no difficulty in obtaining , seven days afterward , the command of a larger force , when , <unk> forth from another gate , as had been agreed upon by <name> , he gained another victory , destroying , on this occasion , twice as many persians as before .
these exploits gained the pretended deserter unbounded fame and honor within the city .
the populace applauded him with continual acclamations ; and the magistrates invited him to their councils , offered him high command , and governed their own plans and measures by his advice .
at length , on the twentieth day , he made his third <name> , at which time he destroyed and captured a still greater number than before .
this gave him such an influence and position within the city , in respect to its defense , that he had no difficulty in getting intrusted with the keys of certain gates  those , namely , by which he had agreed that the army of <name> should be admitted .
when the time arrived , the persians advanced to the attack of the city in that quarter , and the babylonians rallied as usual on the walls to repel them .
the contest had scarcely begun before they found that the gates were open , and that the columns of the enemy were pouring in .
the city was thus soon wholly at the <name> of the conqueror .
<name> dismantled the walls , carried off the brazen gates , and crucified three thousand of the most distinguished inhabitants ; then establishing over the rest a government of his own , he withdrew his troops and returned to susa .
he bestowed upon zopyrus , at susa , all possible rewards and honors .
the marks of his wounds and mutilations could never be effaced , but <name> often said that he would gladly give up twenty <unk> to be able to efface them .

in the reigns of ancient monarchs and conquerors , it often happened that the first great transaction which called forth their energies was the suppression of a rebellion within their dominions , and the second , an expedition against some ferocious and half-savage nations beyond their frontiers .
<name> followed this general example .
the suppression of the <unk> revolt established his authority throughout the whole interior of his empire .
if that vast , and populous , and wealthy city was found unable to resist his power , no other smaller province or capital could <name> to succeed in the attempt .
the whole empire of <name> , therefore , from the capital at susa , out to the extreme limits and bounds to which <name> had extended it , yielded without any further opposition to his sway .
he felt strong in his position , and being young and ardent in temperament , he experienced a <name> to exercise his strength .
for some reason or other , he seems to have been not quite prepared yet to grapple with the greeks , and he concluded , accordingly , first to test his powers in respect to foreign invasion by a war upon the scythians .
this was an undertaking which required some courage and resolution ; for it was while making an incursion into the country of the scythians that <name> , his renowned predecessor , and the founder of the persian empire , had fallen .
the term scythians seems to have been a generic designation , applied indiscriminately to vast hordes of half-savage tribes occupying those wild and inhospitable regions of the north , that extended along the shores of the black and caspian seas , and the banks of the danube .
the accounts which are given by the ancient historians of the manners and customs of these people , are very inconsistent and contradictory ; as , in fact , the accounts of the characters of savages , and of the habits and usages of savage life , have always been in every age .
it is very little that any one cultivated observer can really know , in respect to the phases of character , the thoughts and feelings , the sentiments , the principles and the <name> , and even the modes of life , that prevail among <unk> aborigines living in forests , or roaming wildly over <unk> and trackless plains .
of those who have the opportunity to observe them , accordingly , some <unk> , in the highest degree , their rude but charming simplicity , their truth and faithfulness , the strength of their filial and conjugal affection , and their superiority of spirit in rising above the sordid sentiments and gross vices of civilization .
they are not the slaves , these writers say , of appetite and passion .
they have no inordinate love of gain ; they are patient in enduring suffering , grateful for kindness received , and <unk> firm in their <unk> to the principles of honor and duty .
others , on the other hand , see in savage life nothing but treachery , cruelty , brutality , and crime .
man in his native state , as they imagine , is but a beast , with just intelligence enough to give effect to his depravity .
without natural affection , without truth , without a sense of justice , or the means of making law a substitute for it , he lives in a scene of continual conflict , in which the rights of the weak and the defenseless are always overborne by brutal and tyrannical power .
the explanation of this diversity is doubtless this , that in savage life , as well as in every other state of human society , all the varieties of human conduct and character are exhibited ; and the attention of each observer is attracted to the one or to the other class of phenomena , according to the circumstances in which he is placed when he makes his observations , or the mood of mind which prevails within him when he records them .
there must be the usual virtues of social life , existing in a greater or less degree , in all human communities ; for such principles as a knowledge of the distinction of right and wrong , the idea of property and of individual rights , the obligation resting on every one to respect them , the sense of justice , and of the ill desert of violence and cruelty , are all universal instincts of the human soul , as universal and as essential to humanity as maternal or filial affection , or the principle of conjugal love .
they were established by the great author of nature as constituent elements in the formation of man .
man could not continue to exist , as a gregarious animal , without them .
it would accordingly be as impossible to find a community of men without these moral sentiments generally prevalent among them , as to find vultures or tigers that did not like to pursue and take their prey , or deer without a propensity to fly from danger .
the laws and usages of civilized society are the expression and the result of these sentiments , not the origin and foundation of them ; and violence , cruelty , and crime are the exceptions to their operation , very few , in all communities , savage or civilized , in comparison with the vast preponderance of cases in which they are obeyed .
this view of the native constitution of the human character , which it is obvious , on very slight reflection , must be true , is not at all opposed , as it might at first appear to be , by the doctrine of the theological writers in the <name> church in respect to the native depravity of man ; for the depravity here referred to is a religious depravity , an <unk> of the heart from god , and a rebellious and <unk> spirit in respect to his law .
neither the scriptures nor the theological writers who interpret them ever call in question the universal existence and prevalence of those instincts that are essential to the social welfare of man .
but we must return to the scythians .
the tribes which <name> proposed to attack occupied the countries north of the danube .
his route , therefore , for the invasion of their territories would lead him through <name> minor , thence across the hellespont or the bosporus into thrace , and from thrace across the danube .
it was a distant and dangerous expedition .
<name> had a brother named artabanus .
artabanus was of opinion that the enterprise which the king was contemplating was not only distant and dangerous , but that the country of the scythians was of so little value that the end to be obtained by success would be wholly inadequate to compensate for the exertions , the costs , and the hazards which he must necessarily incur in the prosecution of it .
but <name> was not to be <unk> .
he thanked his brother for his advice , but ordered the preparations for the expedition to go on .
he sent emissaries forward , in advance , over the route that his army was destined to take , transmitting orders to the several provinces which were situated on the line of his march to prepare the way for the passage of his troops .
among other preparations , they were to construct a bridge of boats across the bosporus at <unk> .
this work was intrusted to the charge and superintendence of an engineer of samos named <unk> .
the people of the provinces were also to furnish bodies of troops , both infantry and cavalry , to join the army on its march .
the soldiers that were enlisted to go on this remote and dangerous expedition joined the army , as is usual in such cases , some willingly , from love of adventure , or the <name> of opportunities for plunder , and for that unbridled indulgence of appetite and passion which soldiers so often look forward to as a part of their reward ; others from hard compulsion , being required to leave friends and home , and all that they held dear , under the terror of a stern and despotic edict which they dared not disobey .
it was even dangerous to ask for <unk> .
as an instance of this , it is said that there was a persian named <unk> , who had three sons that had been drafted into the army .
<unk> , desirous of not being left wholly alone in his old age , made a request to the king that he would allow one of the sons to remain at home with his father .
<name> appeared to receive this petition favorably .
he told <unk> that the request was so very modest and considerate that he would <name> more than he asked .
he would allow all three of his sons to remain with him .
<unk> retired from the king 's presence overjoyed at the thought that his family was not to be separated at all .
<name> ordered his guards to kill the three young men , and to send the dead bodies home , with a message to their father that his sons were restored to him , released forever from all obligation to serve the king .
the place of general rendezvous for the various forces which were to join in the expedition , consisting of the army which marched with <name> from susa , and also of the troops and ships which the maritime provinces of <name> minor were to supply on the way , was on the shores of the bosporus , at the point where <unk> had constructed the bridge .
[ g ] the people of <unk> , a region situated in <name> minor , on the shores of the Ã¦gean sea , had been ordered to furnish a fleet of galleys , which they were to build and equip , and then send to the bridge .
the destination of this fleet was to the danube .
it was to pass up the bosporus into the <unk> sea , now called the black sea , and thence into the mouth of the river .
after ascending the danube to a certain point , the men were to land and build a bridge across that river , using , very probably , their galleys for this purpose .
in the mean time , the army was to cross the bosporus by the bridge which had been erected there by <unk> , and pursue their way toward the danube by land , through the kingdom of thrace .
by this arrangement , it was supposed that the bridge across the danube would be ready by the time that the main body of the army arrived on the banks of the river .
the idea of thus building in <name> minor a bridge for the danube , in the form of a vast fleet of galleys , to be sent round through the black sea to the mouths of the river , and thence up the river to its place of destination , was original and grand .
it strikingly marks the military genius and skill which gave the greeks so extended a fame , for it was by the greeks that the exploit was to be performed .
[ footnote g : for the track of <name> on this expedition , see the map at the commencement of this volume . ]
<name> marched magnificently through <name> minor , on his way to the bosporus , at the head of an army of seventy thousand men .
he moved slowly , and the engineers and architects that accompanied him built columns and monuments here and there , as he advanced , to commemorate his progress .
these structures were covered with inscriptions , which ascribed to <name> , as the leader of the enterprise , the most extravagant praise .
at length the splendid array arrived at the place of rendezvous on the bosporus , where there was soon presented to view a very grand and imposing scene .
the bridge of boats was completed , and the ionian fleet , consisting of six hundred galleys , was at anchor near it in the stream .
long lines of tents were pitched upon the shore , and thousands of horsemen and of foot soldiers were drawn up in array , their banners flying , and their armor glittering in the sun , and all eager to see and to welcome the illustrious sovereign who had come , with so much pomp and splendor , to take them under his command .
the banks of the bosporus were picturesque and high , and all the <unk> were crowded with spectators , to witness the imposing magnificence of the spectacle .
<name> encamped his army on the shore , and began to make the preparations necessary for the final departure of the expedition .
he had been thus far within his own dominions .
he was now , however , to pass into another quarter of the globe , to plunge into new and unknown dangers , among hostile , savage , and ferocious tribes .
it was right that he should pause until he had considered well his plans , and secured attention to every point which could influence success .
he first examined the bridge of boats .
he was very much pleased with the construction of it .
he commended <unk> for his skill and fidelity in the highest terms , and loaded him with rewards and honors .
<unk> used the money which <name> thus gave him in employing an artist to form a piece of statuary which should at once commemorate the building of the bridge and give to <name> the <name> of it .
the group represented the bosporus with the bridge thrown over it , and the king on his throne reviewing his troops as they passed over the structure .
this statuary was placed , when finished , in a <name> in greece , where it was universally admired .
<name> was very much pleased both with the idea of this sculpture on the part of <unk> , and with the execution of it by the artist .
he gave the bridge builder new rewards ; he <unk> the artist , also , with similar <unk> .
he was pleased that they had contrived so happy a way of at the same time <unk> the <unk> of the bosporus and rendering exalted honor to him .
the bridge was situated about the middle of the bosporus ; and as the strait itself is about eighteen miles long , it was nine miles from the bridge to the <unk> sea .
there is a small group of islands near the mouth of this strait , where it opens into the sea , which were called in those days the <unk> islands .
they were famed in the time of <name> for having once been floating islands , and enchanted .
their supernatural properties had disappeared , but there was one attraction which still pertained to them .
they were situated beyond the limits of the strait , and the visitor who landed upon them could take his station on some picturesque <name> or smiling hill , and extend his view far and wide over the blue waters of the <unk> sea .
<name> determined to make an excursion to these islands while the fleet and the army were completing their preparations at the bridge .
he embarked , accordingly , on board a splendid galley , and , sailing along the bosporus till he reached the sea , he landed on one of the islands .
there was a <name> there , consecrated to one of the grecian deities .
<name> , accompanied by his attendants and followers , ascended to this <name> , and , taking a seat which had been provided for him there , he surveyed the broad expanse of water which extended like an ocean before him , and contemplated the grandeur of the scene with the greatest admiration and delight .
at length he returned to the bridge , where he found the preparations for the movement of the fleet and of the army nearly completed .
he determined , before leaving the asiatic shores , to erect a monument to commemorate his expedition , on the spot from which he was to take his final departure .
he accordingly directed two columns of white marble to be reared , and inscriptions to be cut upon them , giving such particulars in respect to the expedition as it was desirable thus to preserve .
these inscriptions contained his own name in very conspicuous characters as the leader of the enterprise ; also an enumeration of the various nations that had contributed to form his army , with the <name> which each had furnished .
there was a record of corresponding particulars , too , in respect to the fleet .
the inscriptions were the same upon the two columns , except that upon the one it was written in the assyrian tongue , which was the general language of the persian empire , and upon the other in the greek .
thus the two monuments were intended , the one for the asiatic , and the other for the european world .
at length the day of departure arrived .
the fleet set sail , and the immense train of the army put itself in motion to cross the bridge .
[ h ] the fleet went on through the bosporus to the <unk> , and thence along the western coast of that sea till it reached the mouths of the danube .
the ships entered the river by one of the branches which form the <name> of the stream , and ascended for two days .
this carried them above the ramifications into which the river divides itself at its mouth , to a spot where the current was confined to a single channel , and where the banks were firm .
here they landed , and while one part of the force which they had brought were occupied in organizing guards and providing defenses to protect the ground , the remainder commenced the work of arranging the vessels of the fleet , side by side , across the stream , to form the bridge .
[ footnote h : see frontispiece . ]
in the mean time , <name> , leading the great body of the army , advanced from the bosporus by land .
the country which the troops thus traversed was thrace .
they met with various adventures as they proceeded , and saw , as the accounts of the expedition state , many strange and marvelous phenomena .
they came , for example , to the sources of a very wonderful river , which flows west and south toward the Ã¦gean sea .
the name of the river was the <unk> .
it came from thirty-eight springs , all issuing from the same rock , some hot and some cold .
the waters of the stream which was produced by the mingling of these fountains were pure , limpid , and delicious , and were possessed of remarkable medicinal properties , being <unk> for the cure of various diseases .
<name> was so much pleased with this river , that his army halted to refresh themselves with its waters , and he caused one of his monuments to be erected on the spot , the inscription of which contained not only the usual memorials of the march , but also a tribute to the <unk> of the waters of this magical stream .
at one point in the course of the march through thrace , <name> conceived the idea of varying the construction of his line of monuments by building a <unk> .
a <unk> is a heap of stones , such as is reared in the mountains of scotland and of switzerland by the voluntary additions of every passer by , to commemorate a spot marked as the scene of some accident or disaster .
as each guide finishes the story of the incident in the hearing of the party which he conducts , each tourist who has listened to it adds his stone to the heap , until the rude structure attains sometimes to a very considerable size .
<name> , fixing upon a suitable spot near one of his encampments , commanded every soldier in the army to bring a stone and place it on the pile .
a vast mound rose rapidly from these contributions , which , when completed , not only <unk> the march of the army , but denoted , also , by the immense number of the stones entering into the composition of the pile , the countless multitude of soldiers that formed the expedition .
there was a story told to <name> , as he was traversing these regions , of a certain king , reigning over some one of the nations that occupied them , who wished to make an enumeration of the inhabitants of his realm .
the mode which he adopted was to require every man in his dominions to send him an arrow head .
when all the arrow heads were in , the vast collection was counted by the official <unk> , and the total of the population was thus attained .
the arrow heads were then laid together in a sort of monumental pile .
it was , perhaps , this primitive mode of <unk> which suggested to <name> the idea of his <unk> .
there was a tribe of barbarians through whose dominions <name> passed on his way from the bosporus to the danube , that observed a custom in their religious worship , which , though in itself of a shocking character , suggests reflections of salutary influence for our own minds .
there is a universal instinct in the human heart , leading it strongly to feel the need of help from an unseen and supernatural world in its sorrows and trials ; and it is almost always the case that rude and savage nations , in their attempts to obtain this spiritual aid , connect the idea of personal privation and suffering on their part , self inflicted if necessary , as a means of seeking it .
it seems as if the instinctive conviction of personal guilt , which associates itself so naturally and so strongly in the minds of men with all conceptions of the unseen world and of divine power , demands something like an <unk> as an essential <unk> to obtaining audience and acceptance with the king of heaven .
the tribe of savages above referred to manifested this feeling by a dreadful observance .
once in every five years they were accustomed to choose by lot , with solemn ceremonies , one of their number , to be sent as a <unk> or embassador to their god .
the victim , when chosen , was laid down upon the ground in the midst of the vast assembly convened to witness the rite , while officers designated for the purpose stood by , armed with javelins .
other men , selected for their great personal strength , then took the man from the ground by the hands and feet , and swinging him to and fro three times to gain momentum , they threw him with all their force into the air , and the armed men , when he came down , caught him on the points of their javelins .
if he was killed by this dreadful <unk> , all was right .
he would bear the message of the wants and necessities of the tribe to their god , and they might reasonably expect a favorable reception .
if , on the other hand , he did not die , he was thought to be rejected by the god as a wicked man and an unsuitable messenger .
the unfortunate convalescent was , in such cases , dismissed in disgrace , and another messenger chosen .
the army of <name> reached the banks of the danube at last , and they found that the fleet of the <unk> had attained the point agreed upon before them , and were awaiting their arrival .
the vessels were soon arranged in the form of a bridge across the stream , and as there was no enemy at hand to embarrass them , the army soon accomplished the passage .
they were now fairly in the scythian country , and immediately began their preparations to advance and meet the foe .
<name> gave orders to have the bridge broken up , and the galleys abandoned and destroyed , as he chose rather to take with him the whole of his force , than to leave a guard behind sufficient to protect this shipping .
these orders were about to be executed , when a grecian general , who was attached to one of the bodies of troops which were furnished from the provinces of <name> minor , asked leave to speak to the king .
the king granted him an audience , when he expressed his opinion as follows : " it seems to me to be more prudent , sire , to leave the bridge as it is , under the care of those who have constructed it , as it may be that we shall have occasion to use it on our return .
i do not recommend the preservation of it as a means of securing a retreat , for , in case we meet the scythians at all , i am confident of victory ; but our enemy consists of wandering hordes who have no fixed habitation , and their country is entirely without cities or posts of any kind which they <name> feel any strong interest in defending , and thus it is possible that we may not be able to find any enemy to combat .
besides , if we succeed in our enterprise as completely as we can <name> , it <name> be important , on many accounts , to preserve an open and free communication with the countries behind us . "
the king approved of this counsel , and <unk> his orders for the destruction of the bridge .
he directed that the ionian forces that had accompanied the fleet should remain at the river to guard the bridge .
they were to remain thus on guard for two months , and then , if <name> did not return , and if they heard no tidings of him , they were at <name> to leave their post , and to go back , with their galleys , to their own land again .
two months would seem to be a very short time to await the return of an army going on such an expedition into boundless and trackless wilds .
there can , however , scarcely be any accidental error in the statement of the time , as the mode which <name> adopted to enable the guard thus left at the bridge to keep their reckoning was a very singular one , and it is very particularly described .
he took a cord , it is said , and tied sixty knots in it .
this cord he delivered to the ionian chiefs who were to be left in charge of the bridge , directing them to untie one of the knots every day .
when the cord should become , by this process , wholly free , the detachment were also at <name> .
they might thereafter , at any time , abandon the post intrusted to them , and return to their homes .
we can not suppose that military men , capable of organizing a force of seventy thousand troops for so distant an expedition , and possessed of sufficient science and skill to bridge the bosporus and the danube , could have been under any necessity of adopting so childish a method as this as a real reliance in regulating their operations .
it must be recollected , however , that , though the commanders in these ancient days were intelligent and <unk> men , the common soldiers were but children both in intellect and in ideas ; and it was the custom of all great commanders to employ outward and visible symbols to influence and govern them .
the sense of loneliness and desertion which such soldiers would naturally feel in being left in solitude on the banks of the river , would be much diminished by seeing before them a marked and definite termination to the period of their stay , and to have , in the cord hanging up in their camp , a visible token that the remnant of time that remained was steadily diminishing day by day ; while , in the mean time , <name> was fully determined that , long before the knots should be all untied , he would return to the river .

the motive which dictated <name> 's invasion of <unk> seems to have been purely a selfish and domineering love of power .
the attempts of a stronger and more highly civilized state to extend its dominion over a weaker and more lawless one , are not , however , necessarily and always of this character .
divine providence , in making men gregarious in nature , has given them an instinct of organization , which is as intrinsic and as essential a characteristic of the human soul as maternal love or the principle of self-preservation .
the right , therefore , of organizations of men to establish law and order among themselves , and to extend these principles to other communities around them , so far as such <unk> are really <unk> of the interests and welfare of those affected by them , rests on precisely the same foundation as the right of the father to govern the child .
this foundation is the existence and universality of an instinctive principle implanted by the creator in the human heart ; a principle which we are bound to submit to , both because it is a fundamental and constituent element in the very structure of man , and because its recognition and the acknowledgment of its authority are absolutely essential to his continued existence .
wherever law and order , therefore , among men do not exist , it may be properly established and enforced by any neighboring organization that has power to do it , just as wherever there is a group of children they may be justly controlled and governed by their father .
it seems equally unnecessary to invent a fictitious and wholly imaginary compact to justify the jurisdiction in the one case as in the other .
if the scythians , therefore , had been in a state of confusion and anarchy , <name> might justly have extended his own <unk> and settled government over them , and , in so doing , would have promoted the general good of mankind .
but he had no such design .
it was a <name> for personal aggrandizement , and a love of fame and power , which prompted him .
he offered it as a pretext to justify his invasion , that the scythians , in former years , had made incursions into the persian dominions ; but this was only a pretext .
the expedition was a wanton attack upon neighbors whom he supposed unable to resist him , simply for the purpose of adding to his own already gigantic power .
when <name> commenced his march from the river , the scythians had heard rumors of his approach .
they sent , as soon as they were aware of the impending danger , to all the nations and tribes around them , in order to secure their alliance and aid .
these people were all wandering and half-savage tribes , like the scythians themselves , though each seems to have possessed its own special and distinctive <name> of <unk> .
one tribe were accustomed to <name> home the heads of the enemies which they had slain in battle , and each one , <unk> his own dreadful trophy upon a stake , would set it up upon his <unk> , over the chimney , where they imagined that it would have the effect of a charm , and serve as a protection for the family .
another tribe lived in habits of promiscuous intercourse , like the lower orders of animals ; and so , as the historian absurdly states , being , in consequence of this mode of life , all connected together by the ties of <unk> , they lived in perpetual peace and good <name> , without any envy , or jealousy , or other evil passion .
a third occupied a region so infested with serpents that they were once driven wholly out of the country by them .
it was said of these people that , once in every year , they were all metamorphosed into wolves , and , after remaining for a few days in this form , they were transformed again into men .
a fourth tribe painted their bodies blue and red , and a fifth were cannibals .
the most remarkable , however , of all the tales related about these northern savages was the story of the <unk> and their <unk> wives .
the amazons were a nation of masculine and ferocious women , who often figure in ancient histories and legends .
they rode on horseback astride like men , and their courage and strength in battle were such that scarcely any troops could subdue them .
it happened , however , upon one time , that some greeks conquered a body of them somewhere upon the shores of the <unk> sea , and took a large number of them prisoners .
they placed these prisoners on board of three ships , and put to sea .
the amazons rose upon their captors and threw them overboard , and thus obtained possession of the ships .
they immediately proceeded toward the shore , and landed , not knowing where they were .
it happened to be on the northwestern coast of the sea that they landed .
here they roamed up and down the country , until presently they fell in with a troop of horses .
these they seized and mounted , arming themselves , at the same time , either with the weapons which they had procured on board the ships , or <unk> , themselves , on the shore .
thus organized and equipped , they began to make excursions for plunder , and soon became a most formidable band of marauders .
the scythians of the country supposed that they were men , but they could learn nothing certain respecting them .
their language , their appearance , their manners , and their dress were totally new , and the inhabitants were utterly unable to conceive who they were , and from what place they could so suddenly and mysteriously have come .
at last , in one of the encounters which took place , the scythians took two of these strange invaders prisoners .
to their utter amazement , they found that they were women .
on making this discovery , they changed their mode of dealing with them , and resolved upon a plan based on the supposed universality of the instincts of their sex .
they enlisted a corps of the most handsome and vigorous young men that could be obtained , and after giving them instructions , the nature of which <name> be learned by the result , they sent them forth to meet the amazons .
the corps of scythian cavaliers went out to seek their female antagonists with designs any thing but <unk> .
they advanced to the encampment of the amazons , and hovered about for some time in their vicinity , without , however , making any warlike demonstrations .
they had been instructed to show themselves as much as possible to the enemy , but by no means to fight them .
they would , accordingly , draw as near to the amazons as was safe , and linger there , gazing upon them , as if under the influence of some sort of fascination .
if the amazons advanced toward them , they would fall back , and if the advance continued , they would retreat fast enough to keep effectually out of the way .
then , when the amazons turned , they would turn too , follow them back , and linger near them , around their encampment , as before .
the <unk> were for a time puzzled with this strange demeanor , and they gradually learned to look upon the handsome horsemen at first without fear , and finally even without hostility .
at length , one day , one of the young horsemen , observing an amazon who had strayed away from the rest , followed and joined her .
she did not repel him .
they were not able to converse together , as neither knew the language of the other .
they established a friendly intercourse , however , by looks and signs , and after a time they separated , each agreeing to bring one of their companions to the place of rendezvous on the following day .
a friendly intercommunication being thus commenced , the example spread very rapidly ; matrimonial alliances began to be formed , and , in a word , a short time only elapsed before the two camps were united and intermingled , the scythians and the amazons being all paired together in the most intimate relations of domestic life .
thus , true to the instincts of their sex , the rude and terrible maidens decided , when the alternative was fairly presented to them , in favor of husbands and homes , rather than continuing the life they had led , of independence , conflict , and plunder .
it is curious to observe that the means by which they were won , namely , a persevering display of admiration and attentions , steadily continued , but not too eagerly and impatiently pressed , and varied with an adroit and artful alternation of advances and retreats , were precisely the same as those by which , in every age , the attempt is usually made to win the heart of woman from hatred and hostility to love .
we speak of the <unk> as having been won ; but they were , in fact , themselves the conquerors of their captors , after all ; for it appeared , in the end , that in the future plans and arrangements of the united body , they ruled their scythian husbands , and not the scythians them .
the husbands wished to return home with their wives , whom , they said , they would protect and maintain in the midst of their countrymen in honor and in peace .
the amazons , however , were in favor of another plan .
their habits and manners were such , they said , that they should not be respected and beloved among any other people .
they wished that their husbands , therefore , would go home and settle their affairs , and afterward return and join their wives again , and then that all together should move to the eastward , until they should find a suitable place to settle in by themselves .
this plan was acceded to by the husbands , and was carried into execution ; and the result was the planting of a new nation , called the <unk> , who thenceforth took their place among the other barbarous tribes that dwelt upon the northern shores of the <unk> sea .
such was the character of the tribes and nations that dwelt in the neighborhood of the scythian country .
as soon as <name> had passed the river , the scythians sent embassadors to all their people , proposing to them to form a general alliance against the invader .
" we ought to make common cause against him , " said they ; " for if he <unk> one nation , it <name> only open the way for an attack upon the rest .
some of us are , it is true , more remote than others from the immediate danger , but it threatens us all equally in the end . "
the embassadors delivered their message , and some of the tribes acceded to the scythian proposals .
others , however , refused .
the quarrel , they said , was a quarrel between <name> and the scythians alone , and they were not inclined to bring upon themselves the hostility of so powerful a sovereign by interfering .
the scythians were very indignant at this refusal ; but there was no remedy , and they accordingly began to prepare to defend themselves as well as they could , with the help of those nations that had expressed a willingness to join them .
the habits of the scythians were nomadic and wandering , and their country was one vast region of verdant and beautiful , and yet , in a great measure , of uncultivated and trackless wilds .
they had few towns and villages , and those few were of little value .
they adopted , therefore , the mode of warfare which , in such a country and for such a people , is always the wisest to be pursued .
they retreated slowly before <name> 's advancing army , carrying off or destroying all such property as might aid the king in respect to his supplies .
they organized and equipped a body of swift horsemen , who were ordered to hover around <name> 's camp , and bring intelligence to the scythian generals of every movement .
these horsemen , too , were to harass the flanks and the rear of the army , and to capture or destroy every man whom they should find <unk> away from the camp .
by this means they kept the invading army continually on the alert , allowing them no peace and no repose , while yet they thwarted and counteracted all the plans and efforts which the enemy made to bring on a general battle .
as the persians advanced in pursuit of the enemy , the scythians retreated , and in this retreat they directed their course toward the countries occupied by those nations that had refused to join in the alliance .
by this artful management they transferred the calamity and the burden of the war to the territories of their neighbors .
<name> soon found that he was making no progress toward gaining his end .
at length he concluded to try the effect of a direct and open challenge .
he accordingly sent embassadors to the scythian chief , whose name was <unk> , with a message somewhat as follows : " foolish man !
how long <name> you continue to act in this absurd and preposterous manner ?
it is incumbent on you to make a decision in favor of one thing or the other .
if you think that you are able to contend with me , stop , and let us engage .
if not , then acknowledge me as your superior , and submit to my authority . "
the scythian chief sent back the following reply : " we have no inducement to contend with you in open battle on the field , because you are not doing us any injury , nor is it at present in your power to do us any .
we have no cities and no cultivated fields that you can seize or plunder .
your roaming about our country , therefore , does us no harm , and you are at <name> to continue it as long as it gives you any pleasure .
there is nothing on our soil that you can injure , except one spot , and that is the place where the <unk> of our fathers lie .
if you were to attack that spot  which you may perhaps do , if you can find it  you may rely upon a battle .
in the mean time , you may go elsewhere , wherever you please .
as to acknowledging your superiority , we shall do nothing of the kind .
we defy you . "
notwithstanding the refusal of the scythians to give the persians battle , they yet made , from time to time , partial and unexpected <unk> upon their camp , seizing occasions when they hoped to find their enemies off their guard .
the scythians had troops of cavalry which were very efficient and successful in these attacks .
these horsemen were , however , sometimes thrown into confusion and driven back by a very singular means of defense .
it seems that the persians had brought with them from europe , in their train , a great number of asses , as beasts of burden , to transport the tents and the baggage of the army .
these asses were accustomed , in times of excitement and danger , to set up a very terrific braying .
it was , in fact , all that they could do .
braying at a danger seems to be a very ridiculous mode of attempting to avert it , but it was a tolerably effectual mode , nevertheless , in this case at least ; for the scythian horses , who would have faced spears and javelins , and the loudest shouts and <unk> of human adversaries without any fear , were appalled and put to flight at hearing the unearthly noises which issued from the persian camp whenever they approached it .
thus the mighty monarch of the whole asiatic world seemed to depend for protection against the <unk> of these rude and savage troops on the braying of his asses !
* * * * * while these things were going on in the interior of the country , the scythians sent down a detachment of their forces to the banks of the danube , to see if they could not , in some way or other , obtain possession of the bridge .
they learned here what the orders were which <name> had given to the <unk> who had been left in charge , in respect to the time of their remaining at their post .
the scythians told them that if they would govern themselves strictly by those orders , and so break up the bridge and go down the river with their boats as soon as the two months should have expired , they should not be molested in the mean time .
the <unk> agreed to this .
the time was then already nearly gone , and they promised that , so soon as it should be fully expired , they would withdraw .
the scythian detachment sent back word to the main army <unk> them with these facts , and the army accordingly resolved on a change in their policy .
instead of harassing and distressing the persians as they had done , to hasten their departure , they now determined to improve the situation of their enemies , and encourage them in their hopes , so as to <unk> their stay .
they accordingly allowed the persians to gain the advantage over them in small skirmishes , and they managed , also , to have droves of cattle fall into their hands , from time to time , so as to supply them with food .
the persians were quite elated with these indications that the tide of fortune was about to turn in their favor .
while things were in this state , there appeared one day at the persian camp a messenger from the scythians , who said that he had some presents from the scythian chief for <name> .
the messenger was admitted , and allowed to deliver his gifts .
the gifts proved to be a bird , a mouse , a frog , and five arrows .
the persians asked the bearer of these strange offerings what the scythians meant by them .
he replied that he had no explanations to give .
his orders were , he said , to deliver the presents and then return ; and that they must , accordingly , find out the meaning intended by the exercise of their own ingenuity .
when the messenger had retired , <name> and the persians consulted together , to determine what so strange a communication could mean .
they could not , however , come to any satisfactory decision .
<name> said that he thought the three animals might probably be intended to denote the three kingdoms of nature to which the said animals respectively belonged , viz. , the earth , the air , and the water ; and as the giving up of weapons was a token of submission , the whole might mean that the scythians were now ready to give up the contest , and acknowledge the right of the persians to supreme and universal dominion .
the officers , however , did not generally concur in this opinion .
they saw no indications , they said , of any disposition on the part of the scythians to surrender .
they thought it quite as probable that the communication was meant to announce to those who received it threats and defiance , as to express <unk> and submission .
" it may mean , " said one of them , " that , unless you can fly like a bird into the air , or hide like a mouse in the ground , or bury yourselves , like the frog , in morasses and fens , you can not escape our arrows . "
there was no means of deciding positively between these contradictory interpretations , but it soon became evident that the former of the two was very far from being correct ; for , soon after the present was received , the scythians were seen to be drawing up their forces in array , as if preparing for battle .
the two months had expired , and they had reason to suppose that the party at the bridge had withdrawn , as they had promised to do .
<name> had been so far weakened by his harassing marches , and the manifold privations and sufferings of his men , that he felt some solicitude in respect to the result of a battle , now that it seemed to be drawing near , although such a trial of strength had been the object which he had been , from the beginning , most eager to secure .
the two armies were encamped at a moderate distance from each other , with a plain , partly wooded , between them .
while in this position , and before any hostile action was commenced by either party , it was observed from the camp of <name> that suddenly a great tumult arose from the scythian lines .
men were seen rushing in dense crowds this way and that over the plain , with shouts and outcries , which , however , had in them no expression of anger or fear , but rather one of gayety and pleasure .
<name> demanded what the strange tumult meant .
some messengers were sent out to ascertain the cause , and on their return they reported that the scythians were hunting a hare , which had suddenly made its appearance .
the hare had issued from a thicket , and a considerable portion of the army , officers and soldiers , had abandoned their ranks to enjoy the sport of pursuing it , and were running impetuously , here and there , across the plain , filling the air with shouts of hilarity .
" they do indeed despise us , " said <name> , " since , on the <name> of a battle , they can lose all thoughts of us and of their danger , and abandon their posts to hunt a hare ! "
that evening a council of war was held .
it was concluded that the scythians must be very confident and strong in their position , and that , if a general battle were to be hazarded , it would be very doubtful what would be the result .
the persians concluded unanimously , therefore , that the wisest plan would be for them to give up the intended conquest , and retire from the country .
<name> accordingly proceeded to make his preparations for a secret retreat .
he separated all the infirm and feeble portion of the army from the rest , and informed them that he was going that night on a short expedition with the main body of the troops , and that , while he was gone , they were to remain and defend the camp .
he ordered the men to build the camp fires , and to make them larger and more numerous than common , and then had the asses tied together in an unusual situation , so that they should keep up a continual braying .
these sounds , heard all the night , and the light of the camp fires , were to lead the scythians to believe that the whole body of the persians remained , as usual , at the encampment , and thus to prevent all suspicion of their flight .
toward midnight , <name> marched forth in silence and secrecy , with all the vigorous and able-bodied forces under his command , leaving the weary , the sick , and the infirm to the <name> of their enemies .
the long column succeeded in making good their retreat , without exciting the suspicions of the scythians .
they took the route which they supposed would conduct them most directly to the river .
when the troops which remained in the camp found , on the following morning , that they had been deceived and abandoned , they made signals to the scythians to come to them , and , when they came , the invalids surrendered themselves and the camp to their possession .
the scythians then , immediately , leaving a proper guard to defend the camp , set out to follow the persian army .
instead , however , of keeping directly upon their track , they took a shorter course , which would lead them more speedily to the river .
the persians , being unacquainted with the country , got involved in fens and morasses , and other difficulties of the way , and their progress was thus so much impeded that the scythians reached the river before them .
they found the <unk> still there , although the two months had fully expired .
it is possible that the chiefs had received secret orders from <name> not to hasten their departure , even after the knots had all been untied ; or perhaps they chose , of their own accord , to await their sovereign 's return .
the scythians immediately urged them to be gone .
" the time has expired , " they said , " and you are no longer under any obligation to wait .
return to your own country , and assert your own independence and freedom , which you can safely do if you leave <name> and his armies here . "
the <unk> consulted together on the subject , doubtful , at first , what to do .
they concluded that they would not comply with the scythian proposals , while yet they determined to pretend to comply with them , in order to avoid the danger of being attacked .
they accordingly began to take the bridge to pieces , commencing on the scythian side of the stream .
the scythians , seeing the work thus going on , left the ground , and marched back to meet the persians .
the armies , however , fortunately for <name> , missed each other , and the persians arrived safely at the river , after the scythians had left it .
they arrived in the night , and the advanced guard , seeing no appearance of the bridge on the scythian side , supposed that the <unk> had gone .
they shouted long and loud on the shore , and at length an egyptian , who was celebrated for the power of his voice , succeeded in making the <unk> hear .
the boats were immediately brought back to their positions , the bridge was <unk> , and <name> 's army recrossed the stream .
the danube being thus safely crossed , the army made the best of its way back through thrace , and across the bosporus into <name> , and thus ended <name> 's great expedition against the scythians .

the nature of the government which was exercised in ancient times by a <name> despot like <name> , and the character of the measures and management to which he was accustomed to resort to gain his political ends , are , in many points , very strikingly illustrated by the story of histiÃ¦us .
histiÃ¦us was the ionian chieftain who had been left in charge of the bridge of boats across the danube when <name> made his incursion into <unk> .
when , on the failure of the expedition , <name> returned to the river , knowing , as he did , that the two months had expired , he naturally felt a considerable degree of solicitude lest he should find the bridge broken up and the vessels gone , in which case his situation would be very desperate , hemmed in , as he would have been , between the scythians and the river .
his anxiety was changed into terror when his advanced guard arrived at the bank and found that no signs of the bridge were to be seen .
it is easy to imagine what , under these circumstances , must have been the relief and <name> of all the army , when they heard friendly answers to their shouts , coming , through the darkness of the night , over the waters of the river , assuring them that their faithful allies were still at their posts , and that they themselves would soon be in safety .
<name> , though he was governed by no firm and steady principles of justice , was still a man of many generous impulses .
he was grateful for favors , though somewhat capricious in his modes of <unk> them .
he declared to histiÃ¦us that he felt under infinite obligations to him for his persevering fidelity , and that , as soon as the army should have safely arrived in <name> , he would confer upon him such rewards as would evince the reality of his gratitude .
on his return from <unk> , <name> brought back the whole of his army over the danube , thus abandoning entirely the country of the scythians ; but he did not transport the whole body across the bosporus .
he left a considerable detachment of troops , under the command of one of his generals , named megabyzus , in thrace , on the european side , ordering megabyzus to establish himself there , and to reduce all the countries in that neighborhood to his sway .
<name> then proceeded to sardis , which was the most powerful and wealthy of his capitals in that quarter of the world .
at sardis , he was , as it were , at home again , and he accordingly took an early opportunity to send for histiÃ¦us , as well as some others who had rendered him special services in his late campaign , in order that he might agree with them in respect to their reward .
he asked histiÃ¦us what favor he wished to receive .
histiÃ¦us replied that he was satisfied , on the whole , with the position which he already enjoyed , which was that of king or governor of miletus , an ionian city , south of sardis , and on the shores of the Ã¦gean sea .
[ i ] he should be pleased , however , he said , if the king would assign him a certain small territory in thrace , or , rather , on the borders between thrace and macedonia , near the mouth of the river <unk> .
he wished to build a city there .
the king immediately granted this request , which was obviously very moderate and reasonable .
he did not , perhaps , consider that this territory , being in thrace , or in its immediate vicinity , came within the jurisdiction of megabyzus , whom he had left in command there , and that the <name> might lead to some conflict between the two generals .
there was special danger of jealousy and disagreement between them , for megabyzus was a persian , and histiÃ¦us was a greek .
[ footnote i : for these places , see the map at the commencement of the next chapter . ]
histiÃ¦us organized a colony , and , leaving a temporary and provisional government at miletus , he proceeded along the shores of the Ã¦gean sea to the spot assigned him , and began to build his city .
as the locality was beyond the <unk> frontier , and at a considerable distance from the head-quarters of megabyzus , it is very probable that the operations of histiÃ¦us would not have attracted the persian <unk> attention for a considerable time , had it not been for a very extraordinary and peculiar train of circumstances , which led him to discover them .
the circumstances were these : there was a nation or tribe called the <unk> , who inhabited the valley of the <unk> , which river came down from the interior of the country , and fell into the sea near the place where histiÃ¦us was building his city .
among the <unk> chieftains there were two who wished to obtain the government of the country , but they were not quite strong enough to effect their object .
in order to weaken the force which was opposed to them , they conceived the base design of betraying their tribe to <name> , and inducing him to make them captives .
if their plan should succeed , a considerable portion of the population would be taken away , and they could easily , they supposed , obtain ascendency over the rest .
in order to call the attention of <name> to the subject , and induce him to act as they desired , they resorted to the following stratagem .
their object seems to have been to lead <name> to undertake a campaign against their countrymen , by showing him what excellent and valuable slaves they would make .
these two chieftains were brothers , and they had a very beautiful sister ; her form was graceful and elegant , and her countenance lovely .
they brought this sister with them to sardis when <name> was there .
they dressed and decorated her in a very careful manner , but yet in a style appropriate to the condition of a servant ; and then , one day , when the king was sitting in some public place in the city , as was customary with oriental sovereigns , they sent her to pass along the street before him , equipped in such a manner as to show that she was engaged in servile occupations .
she had a jar , such as was then used for carrying water , poised upon her head , and she was leading a horse by means of a bridle <name> over her arm .
her hands , being thus not required either for the horse or for the vessel , were employed in spinning , as she walked along , by means of a <unk> and spindle .
the attention of <name> was strongly attracted to the spectacle .
the beauty of the maiden , the novelty and strangeness of her costume , the multiplicity of her avocations , and the ease and <name> with which she performed them , all conspired to awaken the monarch 's curiosity .
he directed one of his attendants to follow her and see where she should go .
the attendant did so .
the girl went to the river .
she watered her horse , filled her jar and placed it on her head , and then , hanging the bridle on her arm again , she returned through the same streets , and passed the king 's palace as before , spinning as she walked along .
the interest and curiosity of the king was excited more than ever by the reappearance of the girl and by the report of his messenger .
he directed that she should be stopped and brought into his presence .
she came ; and her brothers , who had been watching the whole scene from a convenient spot near at hand , joined her and came too .
the king asked them who they were .
they replied that they were <unk> .
he wished to know where they lived .
" on the banks of the river <unk> , " they replied , " near the confines of thrace . "
he next asked whether all the women of their country were accustomed to labor , and were as ingenious , and dexterous , and beautiful as their sister .
the brothers replied that they were .
<name> immediately determined to make the whole people slaves .
he accordingly dispatched a courier with the orders .
the courier crossed the hellespont , and proceeded to the encampment of megabyzus in thrace .
he delivered his dispatches to the persian general , commanding him to proceed immediately to <unk> , and there to take the whole community prisoners , and bring them to <name> in sardis .
megabyzus , until this time , had known nothing of the people whom he was thus commanded to seize .
he , however , found some <unk> guides who undertook to conduct him to their territory ; and then , taking with him a sufficient force , he set out on the expedition .
the <unk> heard of his approach .
some prepared to defend themselves ; others fled to the mountains .
the fugitives escaped , but those who attempted to resist were taken .
megabyzus collected the unfortunate captives , together with their wives and children , and brought them down to the coast to embark them for sardis .
in doing this , he had occasion to pass by the spot where histiÃ¦us was building his city , and it was then , for the first time , that megabyzus became acquainted with the plan .
histiÃ¦us was building a wall to defend his little territory on the side of the land .
ships and galleys were going and coming on the side of the sea .
every thing indicated that the work was rapidly and prosperously advancing .
megabyzus did not interfere with the work ; but , as soon as he arrived at sardis with his captives , and had delivered them to the king , he introduced the subject of histiÃ¦us 's city , and represented to <name> that it would be dangerous to the persian interests to allow such an enterprise to go on .
" he <name> establish a strong post there , " said megabyzus , " by means of which he <name> exercise a great ascendency over all the neighboring seas .
the place is admirably situated for a naval station , as the country in the vicinity abounds with all the materials for building and <unk> ships .
there are also mines of silver in the mountains near , from which he <name> obtain a great supply of treasure .
by these means he <name> become so strong in a short period of time , that , after you have returned to <name> , he <name> revolt from your authority , carrying with him , perhaps , in his rebellion , all the greeks of <name> minor . "
the king said that he was sorry that he had made the <name> , and that he would <unk> it without delay .
megabyzus recommended that the king should not do this in an open or violent manner , but that he should contrive some way to arrest the progress of the undertaking without any appearance of suspicion or displeasure .
<name> accordingly sent for histiÃ¦us to come to him at sardis , saying that there was a service of great importance on which he wished to employ him .
histiÃ¦us , of course , obeyed such a summons with eager alacrity .
when he arrived , <name> expressed great pleasure at seeing him once more , and said that he had constant need of his presence and his counsels .
he valued , above all price , the services of so faithful a friend , and so sagacious and trusty an adviser .
he was now , he said , going to susa , and he wished histiÃ¦us to accompany him as his privy counselor and confidential friend .
it would be necessary , <name> added , that he should give up his government of miletus , and also the city in thrace which he had begun to build ; but he should be exalted to higher honors and dignities at susa in their stead .
he should have apartments in the king 's palace , and live in great luxury and splendor .
histiÃ¦us was extremely disappointed and chagrined at this announcement .
he was obliged , however , to conceal his vexation and submit to his fate .
in a few days after this , he set out , with the rest of <name> 's court , for the persian capital , leaving a nephew , whose name was aristagoras , as governor of miletus in his stead .
<name> , on the other hand , committed the general charge of the whole coast of <name> minor to artaphernes , one of his generals .
artaphernes was to make sardis his capital .
he had not only the general command of all the provinces extending along the shore , but also of all the ships , and galleys , and other naval <unk> which belonged to <name> on the neighboring seas .
aristagoras , as governor of miletus , was under his general jurisdiction .
the two officers were , moreover , excellent friends .
aristagoras was , of course , a greek , and artaphernes a persian .
among the greek islands situated in the Ã¦gean sea , one of the most wealthy , important , and powerful at that time , was <unk> .
it was situated in the southern part of the sea , and about midway between the shores of <name> minor and greece .
it happened that , soon after <name> had returned from <name> minor to persia , a civil war broke out in that island , in which the common people were on one side and the nobles on the other .
the nobles were overcome in the contest , and fled from the island .
a party of them landed at miletus , and called upon aristagoras to aid them in regaining possession of the island .
aristagoras replied that he would very gladly do it if he had the power , but that the persian forces on the whole coast , both naval and military , were under the command of artaphernes at sardis .
he said , however , that he was on very friendly terms with artaphernes , and that he would , if the <unk> desired it , apply to him for his aid .
the <unk> seemed very grateful for the interest which aristagoras took in their cause , and said that they would commit the whole affair to his charge .
there was , however , much less occasion for gratitude than there seemed , for aristagoras was very far from being honest and sincere in his offers of aid .
he perceived , immediately on hearing the <unk> story , that a very favorable opportunity was opening for him to add <unk> , and perhaps even the neighboring islands , to his own government .
it is always a favorable opportunity to <unk> a people when their power of defense and of resistance is neutralized by dissensions with one another .
it is a device as old as the history of mankind , and one resorted to now as often as ever , for ambitious neighbors to interpose in behalf of the weaker party , in a civil war waged in a country which they wish to make their own , and , beginning with a war against a part , to end by <unk> the whole .
this was aristagoras 's plan .
he proposed it to artaphernes , representing to him that a very favorable occasion had occurred for bringing the greek islands of the Ã¦gean sea under the persian dominion .
<unk> once possessed , all the other islands around it would follow , he said , and a hundred ships would make the conquest sure .
artaphernes entered very readily and very warmly into the plan .
he said that he would furnish two hundred instead of one hundred galleys .
he thought it was necessary , however , first to consult <name> , since the affair was one of such importance ; and besides , it was not best to commence the undertaking until the spring .
he would immediately send a messenger to <name> to ascertain his pleasure , and , in the mean time , as he did not doubt that <name> would fully approve of the plan , he would have all necessary preparations made , so that every thing should be in readiness as soon as the proper season for active operations should arrive .
artaphernes was right in anticipating his brother 's approval of the design .
the messenger returned from susa with full authority from the king for the execution of the project .
the ships were built and equipped , and every thing was made ready for the expedition .
the intended destination of the armament was , however , kept a profound secret , as the invaders wished to surprise the people of <unk> when off their guard .
aristagoras was to accompany the expedition as its general leader , while an officer named <unk> , appointed by artaphernes for this purpose , was to take command of the fleet as a sort of admiral .
thus there were two commanders  an arrangement which almost always , in such cases , leads to a quarrel .
it is a maxim in war that one bad general is better than two good ones .
the expedition sailed from miletus ; and , in order to prevent the people of <unk> from being <unk> of their danger , the report had been circulated that its destination was to be the hellespont .
accordingly , when the fleet sailed , it turned its course to the northward , as if it were really going to the hellespont .
the plan of the commander was to stop after proceeding a short distance , and then to seize the first opportunity afforded by a wind from the north to come down suddenly upon <unk> , before the population should have time to prepare for defense .
accordingly , when they arrived opposite the island of <unk> , the whole fleet came to anchor near the land .
the ships were all ordered to be ready , at a moment 's warning , for setting sail ; and , thus situated , the commanders were waiting for the wind to change .
<unk> , in going his rounds among the fleet while things were in this condition , found one vessel entirely abandoned .
the captain and crew had all left it , and had gone ashore .
they were not aware , probably , how urgent was the necessity that they should be every moment at their posts .
the captain of this galley was a native of a small town called <unk> , and , as it happened , was a particular friend of aristagoras .
his name was <unk> .
<unk> , as the commander of the fleet , was very much incensed at finding one of his subordinate officers so derelict in duty .
he sent his guards in pursuit of him ; and when <unk> was brought to his ship , <unk> ordered his head to be thrust out through one of the small <unk> intended for the oars , in the side of the ship , and then bound him in that position  his head appearing thus to view , in the sight of all the fleet , while his body remained within the vessel .
" i am going to keep him at his post , " said <unk> , " and in such a way that every one can see that he is there . "
aristagoras was much distressed at seeing his friend suffering so severe and disgraceful a punishment .
he went to <unk> and requested the release of the prisoner , giving , at the same time , what he considered satisfactory reasons for his having been absent from his vessel .
<unk> , however , was not satisfied , and refused to set <unk> at <name> .
aristagoras then told <unk> that he mistook his position in supposing that he was master of the expedition , and could <unk> over the men in that manner , as he pleased .
" i <name> have you understand , " said he , " that i am the commander in this campaign , and that artaphernes , in making you the <unk> of the fleet , had no intention that you should set up your authority over mine . "
so saying , he went away in a rage , and released <unk> from his <unk> with his own hands .
it was now the turn of <unk> to be enraged .
he determined to defeat the expedition .
he sent immediately a secret messenger to warn the <unk> of their enemies ' approach .
the <unk> immediately made effectual preparations to defend themselves .
the end of it was , that when the fleet arrived , the island was prepared to receive it , and nothing could be done .
aristagoras continued the siege four months ; but inasmuch as , during all this time , <unk> did every thing in his power to circumvent and thwart every plan that aristagoras formed , nothing was accomplished .
finally , the expedition was broken up , and aristagoras returned home , disappointed and chagrined , all his hopes blasted , and his own private finances thrown into confusion by the great pecuniary losses which he himself had sustained .
he had contributed very largely , from his own private funds , in fitting out the expedition , fully confident of success , and of ample <unk> for his expenses as the consequence of it .
he was angry with himself , and angry with <unk> , and angry with artaphernes .
he presumed , too , that <unk> would denounce him to artaphernes , and , through him , to <name> , as the cause of the failure of the expedition .
a sudden order might come at any moment , directing that he should be beheaded .
he began to consider the expediency of revolting from the persian power , and making common cause with the greeks against <name> .
the danger of such a step was scarcely less than that of remaining as he was .
while he was pondering these momentous questions in his mind , he was led suddenly to a decision by a very singular circumstance , the proper explaining of which requires the story to return , for a time , to histiÃ¦us at susa .
histiÃ¦us was very ill at ease in the possession of his forced elevation and grandeur at susa .
he enjoyed great distinction there , it is true , and a life of ease and luxury , but he wished for independence and authority .
he was , accordingly , very desirous to get back to his former sphere of activity and power in <name> minor .
after revolving in his mind the various plans which occurred to him for accomplishing this purpose , he at last decided on inducing aristagoras to revolt in <unk> , and then attempting to persuade <name> to send him on to quell the revolt .
when once in <name> minor , he would join the rebellion , and bid <name> defiance .
the first thing to be done was to contrive some safe and secret way to communicate with aristagoras .
this he effected in the following manner : there was a man in his court who was afflicted with some malady of the eyes .
histiÃ¦us told him that if he would put himself under his charge he could effect a cure .
it would be necessary , he said , that the man should have his head shaved and <unk> ; that is , punctured with a sharp instrument , previously dipped in some medicinal compound .
then , after some further applications should have been made , it would be necessary for the patient to go to <unk> , in <name> minor , where there was a physician who would complete the cure .
the patient consented to this proposal .
the head was shaved , and histiÃ¦us , while pretending to <unk> it , pricked into the skin  as sailors tattoo anchors on their arms  by means of a needle and a species of ink which had probably no great medicinal virtue , the words of a letter to aristagoras , in which he communicated to him fully , though very <unk> , the particulars of his plan .
he urged aristagoras to revolt , and promised that , if he would do so , he would come on , himself , as soon as possible , and , under pretense of marching to suppress the rebellion , he would really join and aid it .
as soon as he had finished pricking this treasonable communication into the patient 's skin , he carefully enveloped the head in bandages , which , he said , must on no account be disturbed .
he kept the man shut up , besides , in the palace , until the hair had grown , so as effectually to conceal the writing , and then sent him to <unk> to have the cure perfected .
on his arrival at <unk> he was to find aristagoras , who would do what further was necessary .
histiÃ¦us contrived , in the mean time , to send word to aristagoras by another messenger , that , as soon as such a patient should present himself , aristagoras was to shave his head .
he did so , and the communication appeared .
we must suppose that the operations on the part of aristagoras for the purpose of completing the cure consisted , probably , in pricking in more ink , so as to confuse and obliterate the writing .
aristagoras was on the <name> of throwing off the persian authority when he received this communication .
it at once decided him to proceed .
he organized his forces and commenced his revolt .
as soon as the news of this rebellion reached susa , histiÃ¦us feigned great indignation , and earnestly entreated <name> to commission him to go and suppress it .
he was confident , he said , that he could do it in a very prompt and effectual manner .
<name> was at first inclined to suspect that histiÃ¦us was in some way or other implicated in the movement ; but these suspicions were removed by the protestations which histiÃ¦us made , and at length he gave him leave to proceed to miletus , commanding him , however , to return to susa again as soon as he should have suppressed the revolt .
when histiÃ¦us arrived in <unk> he joined aristagoras , and the two generals , <unk> with them various princes and states of greece , organized a very extended and dangerous rebellion , which it gave the troops of <name> infinite trouble to subdue .
we can not here give an account of the incidents and particulars of this war .
for a time the rebels prospered , and their cause seemed likely to succeed ; but at length the tide turned against them .
their towns were captured , their ships were taken and destroyed , their armies cut to pieces .
histiÃ¦us retreated from place to place , a wretched fugitive , growing more and more distressed and destitute every day .
at length , as he was flying from a battle field , he arrested the arm of a persian , who was pursuing him with his weapon upraised , by crying out that he was histiÃ¦us the <unk> .
the persian , hearing this , spared his life , but took him prisoner , and delivered him to artaphernes .
histiÃ¦us begged very earnestly that artaphernes would send him to <name> alive , in hopes that <name> would pardon him in consideration of his former services at the bridge of the danube .
this was , however , exactly what artaphernes wished to prevent ; so he crucified the wretched histiÃ¦us at sardis , and then packed his head in salt and sent it to <name> .

in the history of a great military conqueror , there seems to be often some one great battle which in importance and renown <unk> all the rest .
in the case of hannibal it was the battle of <unk> , in that of <name> the battle of <unk> .
cÃ¦sar 's great conflict was at <unk> , <name> 's at waterloo .
marathon was , in some respects , <name> 's waterloo .
the place is a beautiful plain , about twelve miles north of the great city of athens .
the battle was the great final contest between <name> and the greeks , which , both on account of the awful magnitude of the conflict , and the very extraordinary circumstances which attended it , has always been greatly celebrated among mankind .
the whole progress of the persian empire , from the time of the first accession of <name> to the throne , was toward the westward , till it reached the confines of <name> on the shores of the Ã¦gean sea .
all the shores and islands of this sea were occupied by the states and the cities of greece .
the population of the whole region , both on the european and asiatic shores , spoke the same language , and possessed the same vigorous , intellectual , and elevated character .
those on the asiatic side had been conquered by <name> , and their countries had been annexed to the persian empire .
<name> had wished very strongly , at the commencement of his reign , to go on in this work of <unk> , and had sent his party of commissioners to explore the ground , as is related in a preceding chapter .
he had , however , postponed the execution of his plans , in order first to conquer the scythian countries north of greece , thinking , probably , that this would make the subsequent conquest of greece itself more easy .
by getting a firm foothold in <unk> , he would , as it were , turn the flank of the grecian territories , which would tend to make his final descent upon them more effectual and sure .
this plan , however , failed ; and yet , on his retreat from <unk> , <name> did not withdraw his armies wholly from the european side of the water .
he kept a large force in thrace , and his generals there were gradually extending and strengthening their power , and preparing for still greater conquests .
they attempted to extend their dominion , sometimes by negotiations , and sometimes by force , and they were successful and unsuccessful by turns , whichever mode they employed .
one very extraordinary story is told of an attempted negotiation with macedon , made with a view of bringing that kingdom , if possible , under the persian dominion , without the necessity of a resort to force .
the commanding general of <name> 's armies in thrace , whose name , as was stated in the last chapter , was megabyzus , sent seven persian officers into macedon , not exactly to summon the macedonians , in a peremptory manner , to surrender to the persians , nor , on the other hand , to propose a voluntary alliance , but for something between the two .
the communication was to be in the form of a proposal , and yet it was to be made in the domineering and overbearing manner with which the tyrannical and the strong often make proposals to the weak and defenseless .
the seven persians went to macedon , which , as <name> be seen from the map , was west of thrace , and to the northward of the other grecian countries .
<unk> , the king of macedon , gave them a very honorable reception .
at length , one day , at a feast to which they were invited in the palace of <unk> , they became somewhat excited with wine , and asked to have the ladies of the court brought into the apartment .
they wished " to see them , " they said .
<unk> replied that such a procedure was entirely contrary to the usages and customs of their court ; but still , as he stood somewhat in awe of his visitors , or , rather , of the terrible power which the delegation represented , and wished by every possible means to avoid provoking a quarrel with them , he consented to comply with their request .
the ladies were sent for .
they came in , reluctant and blushing , their minds excited by mingled feelings of indignation and shame .
the persians , becoming more and more excited and imperious under the increasing influence of the wine , soon began to praise the beauty of these new guests in a coarse and free manner , which overwhelmed the ladies with confusion , and then to accost them familiarly and rudely , and to behave toward them , in other respects , with so much impropriety as to produce great alarm and indignation among all the king's household .
the king himself was much distressed , but he was afraid to act decidedly .
his son , a young man of great energy and spirit , approached his father with a countenance and manner expressive of high excitement , and begged him to retire from the feast , and leave him , the son , to manage the affair .
<unk> reluctantly allowed himself to be persuaded to go , giving his son many charges , as he went away , to do nothing rashly or violently .
as soon as the king was gone , the <name> made an excuse for having the ladies retire for a short time , saying that they should soon return .
the <name> conducted them to their apartment , and then selecting an equal number of tall and <unk> boys , he disguised them to represent the ladies , and gave each one a dagger , directing him to conceal it beneath his robe .
these counterfeit females were then introduced to the assembly in the place of those who had retired .
the persians did not detect the deception .
it was evening , and , besides , their faculties were confused with the effects of the wine .
they approached the supposed ladies as they had done before , with rude familiarity ; and the boys , at a signal made by the <name> when the persians were wholly off their guard , stabbed and killed every one of them on the spot .
megabyzus sent an embassador to inquire what became of his seven messengers ; but the macedonian <name> contrived to buy this messenger off by large rewards , and to induce him to send back some false but plausible story to satisfy megabyzus .
perhaps megabyzus would not have been so easily satisfied had it not been that the great ionian rebellion , under aristagoras and histiÃ¦us , as described in the last chapter , broke out soon after , and demanded his attention in another quarter of the realm .
the ionian rebellion postponed , for a time , <name> 's designs on greece , but the effect of it was to make the invasion more certain and more terrible in the end ; for athens , which was at that time one of the most important and powerful of the grecian cities , took a part in that rebellion against the persians .
the athenians sent forces to aid those of aristagoras and histiÃ¦us , and , in the course of the war , the combined army took and burned the city of sardis .
when this news reached <name> , he was excited to a perfect phrensy of resentment and indignation against the athenians for coming thus into his own dominions to assist rebels , and there destroying one of his most important capitals .
he uttered the most violent and terrible threats against them , and , to prevent his anger from getting cool before the preparations should be completed for <unk> it , he made an arrangement , it was said , for having a slave call out to him every day at table , " remember the athenians ! "
it was a circumstance favorable to <name> 's designs against the states of greece that they were not united among themselves .
there was no general government under which the whole naval and military force of that country could be efficiently combined , so as to be directed , in a concentrated and energetic form , against a common enemy .
on the other hand , the several cities formed , with the territories adjoining them , so many separate states , more or less connected , it is true , by <unk> and alliances , but still virtually independent , and often hostile to each other .
then , besides these external and international quarrels , there was a great deal of internal dissension .
the monarchical and the democratic principle were all the time struggling for the mastery .
military despots were continually rising to power in the various cities , and after they had ruled , for a time , over their subjects with a <name> of iron , the people would rise in rebellion and expel them from their thrones .
these revolutions were continually taking place , attended , often , by the strangest and most romantic incidents , which evinced , on the part of the actors in them , that extraordinary combination of mental sagacity and <unk> with childish and senseless superstition so characteristic of the times .
it is not surprising that the populace often rebelled against the power of these <name> despots , for they seem to have exercised their power , when their interests or their passions excited them to do it , in the most tyrannical and cruel manner .
one of them , it was said , a king of corinth , whose name was <unk> , sent a messenger , on one occasion , to a neighboring potentate  with whom he had gradually come to entertain very friendly relations  to inquire by what means he could most certainly and permanently secure the continuance of his power .
the king thus applied to gave no direct reply , but took the messenger out into his garden , talking with him by the way about the incidents of his journey , and other indifferent topics .
he came , at length , to a field where grain was growing , and as he walked along , he occupied himself in cutting off , with his sword , every head of the grain which raised itself above the level of the rest .
after a short time he returned to the house , and finally dismissed the messenger without giving him any answer whatever to the application that he had made .
the messenger returned to <unk> , and related what had occurred .
" i understand his meaning , " said <unk> .
" i must contrive some way to remove all those who , by their talents , their influence , or their power , rise above the general level of the citizens . "
<unk> began immediately to act on this recommendation .
whoever , among the people of corinth , distinguished himself above the rest , was marked for destruction .
some were banished , some were slain , and some were deprived of their influence , and so reduced to the ordinary level , by the <unk> of their property , the lives and fortunes of all the citizens of the state being wholly in the despot 's hands .
this same <unk> had a wife whose name was <name> .
a very extraordinary tale is related respecting her , which , though mainly fictitious , had a foundation , doubtless , in fact , and illustrates very remarkably the despotic tyranny and the dark superstition of the times .
<name> died and was buried ; but her garments , for some reason or other , were not burned , as was usual in such cases .
now , among the other oracles of greece , there was one where departed spirits could be consulted .
it was called the oracle of the dead .
<unk> , having occasion to consult an oracle in order to find the means of recovering a certain article of value which was lost , sent to this place to call up and consult the ghost of <name> .
the ghost appeared , but refused to answer the question put to her , saying , with frightful solemnity , " i am cold ; i am cold ; i am naked and cold .
my clothes were not burned ; i am naked and cold . "
when this answer was reported to <unk> , he determined to make a great sacrifice and offering , such as should at once appease the restless spirit .
he invited , therefore , a general assembly of the women of corinth to witness some spectacle in a <name> , and when they were convened , he surrounded them with his guards , seized them , stripped them of most of their clothing , and then let them go free .
the clothes thus taken were then all solemnly burned , as an <unk> offering , with <unk> to the shade of <name> .
the account adds , that when this was done , a second messenger was dispatched to the oracle of the dead , and the spirit , now clothed and comfortable in its grave , answered the inquiry , informing <unk> where the lost article might be found .
the rude violence which <unk> resorted to in this case seems not to have been dictated by any particular <name> to insult or injure the women of corinth , but was resorted to simply as the easiest and most convenient way of obtaining what he needed .
he wanted a supply of valuable and costly female apparel , and the <unk> mode of obtaining it was to bring together an assembly of females dressed for a public occasion , and then <unk> them .
the case only shows to what an extreme and absolute supremacy the lofty and domineering spirit of ancient despotism attained .
it ought , however , to be related , in justice to these abominable tyrants , that they often evinced feelings of commiseration and kindness ; sometimes , in fact , in very singular ways .
there was , for example , in one of the cities , a certain family that had obtained the ascendency over the rest of the people , and had held it for some time as an established aristocracy , taking care to preserve their rank and power from generation to generation , by <unk> only with one another .
at length , in one branch of the family , there grew up a young girl named <unk> , who had been a cripple from her birth , and , on account of her deformity , none of the nobles would marry her .
a man of obscure birth , however , one of the common people , at length took her for his wife .
his name was <unk> .
one day , <unk> went to delphi to consult an oracle , and as he was entering the <name> , the <unk> [ j ] called out to him , saying that a stone should proceed from <unk> which should overwhelm tyrants and <unk> , and free the state .
the nobles , when they heard of this , understood the prediction to mean that the destruction of their power was , in some way or other , to be effected by means of <unk> 's child , and they determined to prevent the fulfillment of the prophecy by destroying the babe itself so soon as it should be born .
[ footnote j : for a full account of these oracles , see the history of <name> the great . ]
they accordingly appointed ten of their number to go to the place where <unk> lived and kill the child .
the method which they were to adopt was this : they were to ask to see the infant on their arrival at the house , and then it was agreed that whichever of the ten it was to whom the babe was handed , he should dash it down upon the stone floor with all his force , by which means it would , as they supposed , certainly be killed .
this plan being arranged , the men went to the house , inquired , with hypocritical civility , after the health of the mother , and desired to see the child .
it was accordingly brought to them .
the mother put it into the hands of one of the conspirators , and the babe looked up into his face and smiled .
this mute expression of defenseless and confiding innocence touched the murderer 's heart .
he could not be such a monster as to dash such an image of trusting and happy helplessness upon the stones .
he looked upon the child , and then gave it into the hands of the one next to him , and he gave it to the next , and thus it passed through the hands of all the ten .
no one was found stern and determined enough to murder it , and at last they gave the babe back to its mother and went away .
the sequel of this story was , that the conspirators , when they reached the gate , stopped to consult together , and after many mutual <unk> and recriminations , each <unk> the courage and resolution of the rest , and all joining in special condemnation of the man to whom the child had at first been given , they went back again , determined , in some way or other , to accomplish their purpose .
but <unk> had , in the mean time , been alarmed at their extraordinary behavior , and had listened , when they stopped at the gate , to hear their conversation .
she hastily hid the babe in a corn measure ; and the conspirators , after looking in every part of the house in vain , gave up the search , supposing that their intended victim had been hastily sent away .
they went home , and not being willing to acknowledge that their resolution had failed at the time of trial , they agreed to say that their undertaking had succeeded , and that the child had been destroyed .
the babe lived , however , and grew up to manhood , and then , in fulfillment of the prediction announced by the oracle , he headed a rebellion against the nobles , deposed them from their power , and reigned in their stead .
one of the worst and most reckless of the greek tyrants of whom we have been speaking was <unk> of athens .
his father , <unk> , had been hated all his life for his cruelties and his crimes ; and when he died , leaving two sons , <unk> and <unk> , a conspiracy was formed to kill the sons , and thus put an end to the dynasty .
<unk> was killed , but <unk> escaped the danger , and seized the government himself alone .
he began to exercise his power in the most cruel and wanton manner , partly under the influence of resentment and passion , and partly because he thought his proper policy was to strike terror into the hearts of the people as a means of retaining his dominion .
one of the conspirators by whom his brother had been slain , accused <unk> 's warmest and best friends as his accomplices in that deed , in order to revenge himself on <unk> by inducing him to destroy his own adherents and supporters .
<unk> fell into the snare ; he condemned to death all whom the conspirator accused , and his reckless soldiers executed his friends and foes together .
when any protested their innocence , he put them to the torture to make them confess their guilt .
such <unk> cruelty only had the effect to league the whole population of athens against the <unk> of it .
there was at length a general insurrection against him , and he was <unk> .
he made his escape to sardis , and there tendered his services to artaphernes , offering to conduct the persian armies to greece , and aid them in getting possession of the country , on condition that , if they succeeded , the persians would make him the governor of athens .
artaphernes made known these offers to <name> , and they were eagerly accepted .
it was , however , very <unk> to accept them .
the aid which the invaders could derive from the services of such a guide , were far more than counterbalanced by the influence which his <unk> and the <unk> of his cause by the persians would produce in greece .
it banded the athenians and their allies together in the most enthusiastic and determined spirit of resistance , against a man who had now added the baseness of treason to the wanton wickedness of tyranny .
besides these internal dissensions between the people of the several grecian states and their kings , there were contests between one state and another , which <name> proposed to take advantage of in his attempts to conquer the country .
there was one such war in particular , between athens and the island of Ã¦gina , on the effects of which , in aiding him in his operations against the athenians , <name> placed great reliance .
Ã¦gina was a large and populous island not far from athens .
in accounting for the origin of the quarrel between the two states , the greek historians relate the following marvelous story : Ã¦gina , as <name> be seen from the map , was situated in the middle of a bay , southwest from athens .
on the other side of the bay , opposite from athens , there was a city , near the shore , called <unk> .
it happened that the people of <unk> were at one time suffering from famine , and they sent a messenger to the oracle at delphi to inquire what they should do to obtain relief .
the <unk> answered that they must erect two statues to certain goddesses , named <unk> and <unk> , and that then the famine would abate .
they asked whether they were to make the statues of brass or of marble .
the priestess replied , " of neither , but of wood . "
they were , she said , to use for the purpose the wood of the garden <name> .
this species of <name> was a sacred tree , and it happened that , at this time , there were no trees of the kind that were of sufficient size for the purpose intended except at athens ; and the <unk> , accordingly , sent to athens to obtain leave to supply themselves with wood for the sculptor by cutting down one of the trees from the sacred grove .
the athenians consented to this , on condition that the <unk> would offer a certain yearly sacrifice at two temples in athens , which they named .
this sacrifice , they seemed to imagine , would make good to the city whatever of injury their religious interests might suffer from the loss of the sacred tree .
the <unk> agreed to the condition ; the tree was felled ; blocks from it , of proper size , were taken to <unk> , and the statues were carved .
they were set up in the city with the usual solemnities , and the famine soon after disappeared .
not many years after this , a war , for some cause or other , broke out between <unk> and Ã¦gina .
the people of Ã¦gina crossed the water in a fleet of galleys , landed at <unk> , and , after committing various ravages , they seized these images , and bore them away in triumph as trophies of their victory .
they set them up in a public place in the middle of their own island , and instituted games and spectacles around them , which they celebrated with great festivity and parade .
the <unk> , having thus lost their statues , ceased to make the annual offering at athens which they had stipulated for , in return for receiving the wood from which the statues were carved .
the athenians complained .
the <unk> replied that they had continued to make the offering as long as they had kept the statues ; but that now , the statues being in other hands , they were <unk> from the obligation .
the athenians next demanded the statues themselves of the people of Ã¦gina .
they refused to surrender them .
the athenians then invaded the island , and proceeded to the spot where the statues had been erected .
they had been set up on massive and heavy <unk> .
the athenians attempted to get them down , but could not separate them from their fastenings .
they then changed their plan , and undertook to move the <unk> too , by dragging them with ropes .
they were arrested in this undertaking by an earthquake , accompanied by a solemn and terrible sound of thunder , which warned them that they were provoking the anger of heaven .
the statues , too , miraculously fell on their knees , and remained fixed in that posture !
the athenians , terrified at these portentous signs , abandoned their undertaking and fled toward the shore .
they were , however , intercepted by the people of Ã¦gina , and some allies whom they had hastily summoned to their aid , and the whole party was destroyed except one single man .
he escaped .
this single fugitive , however , met with a worse fate than that of his comrades .
he went to athens , and there the wives and sisters of the men who had been killed thronged around him to hear his story .
they were incensed that he alone had escaped , as if his flight had been a sort of betrayal and desertion of his companions .
they fell upon him , therefore , with one accord , and pierced and wounded him on all sides with a sort of pin , or clasp , which they used as a fastening for their dress .
they finally killed him .
the athenian magistrates were unable to bring any of the <unk> of this crime to conviction and punishment ; but a law was made , in consequence of the occurrence , forbidding the use of that sort of fastening for the dress to all the athenian women forever after .
the people of Ã¦gina , on the other hand , rejoiced and gloried in the deed of the athenian women , and they made the <unk> which were worn upon their island of double size , in honor of it .
the war , thus commenced between athens and Ã¦gina , went on for a long time , increasing in bitterness and cruelty as the injuries increased in number and magnitude which the <unk> parties inflicted on each other .
such was the state of things in greece when <name> organized his great expedition for the invasion of the country .
he assembled an immense armament , though he did not go forth himself to command it .
he placed the whole force under the charge of a persian general named datis .
a considerable part of the army which datis was to command was raised in persia ; but orders had been sent on that large <unk> to the army , consisting of cavalry , foot soldiers , ships , and seamen , and every other species of military force , should be raised in all the provinces of <name> minor , and be ready to join it at various places of rendezvous .
<name> commenced his march at susa with the troops which had been collected there , and proceeded westward till he reached the mediterranean at <unk> , which is at the northeast corner of that sea .
here large re-enforcements joined him ; and there was also assembled at this point an immense fleet of galleys , which had been provided to convey the troops to the grecian seas .
the troops embarked , and the fleet advanced along the southern shores of <name> minor to the Ã¦gean sea , where they turned to the northward toward the island of samos , which had been appointed as a rendezvous .
at samos they were joined by still greater <name> coming from <unk> , and the various provinces and islands on that coast that were already under the persian dominion .
when they were ready for their final departure , the immense fleet , probably one of the greatest and most powerful which had then ever been assembled , set sail , and steered their course to the northwest , among the islands of the Ã¦gean sea .
as they moved slowly on , they stopped to take possession of such islands as came in their way .
the islanders , in some cases , submitted to them without a struggle .
in others , they made vigorous but perfectly futile attempts to resist .
in others still , the terrified inhabitants abandoned their homes , and fled in dismay to the fastnesses of the mountains .
the persians destroyed the cities and towns whose inhabitants they could not conquer , and took the children from the most influential families of the islands which they did subdue , as hostages to hold their parents to their promises when their conquerors should have gone .
[ illustration : the invasion of greece . ]
the mighty fleet advanced thus , by slow degrees , from conquest to conquest , toward the athenian shores .
the vast multitude of galleys covered the whole surface of the water , and as they advanced , propelled each by a triple row of oars , they exhibited to the fugitives who had gained the summits of the mountains the appearance of an immense swarm of insects , creeping , by an almost imperceptible advance , over the smooth expanse of the sea .
the fleet , guided all the time by <unk> , passed on , and finally entered the strait between the island of euboea and the main land to the northward of athens .
here , after some operations on the island , the persians finally brought their ships into a port on the athenian side , and landed .
<unk> made all the arrangements , and superintended the <unk> .
in the mean time , all was confusion and dismay in the city of athens .
the government , as soon as they heard of the approach of this terrible danger , had sent an express to the city of sparta , asking for aid .
the aid had been promised , but it had not yet arrived .
the athenians gathered together all the forces at their command on the northern side of the city , and were debating the question , with great anxiety and earnestness , whether they should shut themselves up within the walls , and await the onset of their enemies there , or go forth to meet them on the way .
the whole force which the greeks could muster consisted of but about ten thousand men , while the persian host contained over a hundred thousand .
it seemed madness to engage in a contest on an open field against such an overwhelming <unk> of <name> .
a majority of voices were , accordingly , in favor of remaining within the fortifications of the city , and awaiting an attack .
the command of the army had been intrusted , not to one man , but to a commission of three generals , a sort of <unk> , on whose joint action the decision of such a question devolved .
two of the three were in favor of taking a defensive position ; but the third , the celebrated miltiades , was so <name> and so decided in favor of attacking the enemy themselves , instead of waiting to be attacked , that his opinion finally carried the day , and the other generals resigned their portion of authority into his hands , consenting that he should lead the greek army into battle , if he dared to take the responsibility of doing so .
the two armies were at this time encamped in sight of each other on the plain of marathon , between the mountain and the sea .
they were nearly a mile apart .
the countless multitude of the persians extended as far as the eye could reach , with long lines of tents in the distance , and thousands of horsemen on the plain , all ready for the charge .
the greeks , on the other hand , occupied a small and isolated spot , in a compact form , without cavalry , without archers , without , in fact , any weapons suitable either for attack or defense , except in a close encounter hand to hand .
their only <name> of success depended on the desperate violence of the onset they were to make upon the vast masses of men spread out before them .
on the one side were immense <name> , whose force , vast as it was , must necessarily be more or less impeded in its operations , and slow .
it was to be overpowered , therefore , if overpowered at all , by the utmost fierceness and rapidity of action  by sudden <unk> , unexpected and furious assaults , and heavy , vigorous , and rapid blows .
miltiades , therefore , made all his arrangements with reference to that mode of warfare .
such soldiers as the greeks , too , were admirably adapted to execute such designs , and the immense and heterogeneous mass of asiatic nations which covered the plain before them was exactly the body for such an experiment to be made upon .
<unk> in their <name> and confident of victory , they were slowly advancing , without the least idea that the little band before them could possibly do them any serious harm .
they had actually brought with them , in the train of the army , some blocks of marble , with which they were going to erect a monument of their victory , on the field of battle , as soon as the conflict was over !
at length the greeks began to put themselves in motion .
as they advanced , they accelerated their march more and more , until just before reaching the persian lines , when they began to run .
the astonishment of the persians at this unexpected and daring onset soon gave place , first to the excitement of personal conflict , and then to universal terror and dismay ; for the headlong impetuosity of the greeks bore down all opposition , and the desperate <unk> cut their way through the vast masses of the enemy with a fierce and desperate fury that nothing could withstand .
something like a contest continued for some hours ; but , at the end of that time , the persians were flying in all directions , every one endeavoring , by the track which he found most practicable for himself , to make his way to the ships on the shore .
vast multitudes were killed in this headlong flight ; others became entangled in the morasses and fens , and others still strayed away , and sought , in their terror , a hopeless refuge in the defiles of the mountains .
those who escaped crowded in confusion on board their ships , and pushed off from the shore , leaving the whole plain covered with their dead and dying companions .
the greeks captured an immense amount of stores and baggage , which were of great cost and value .
they took possession , too , of the marble blocks which the persians had brought to <unk> their victory , and built with them a monument , instead , to commemorate their defeat .
they counted the dead .
six thousand persians , and only two hundred greeks , were found .
the bodies of the greeks were collected together , and buried on the field , and an immense mound was raised over the grave .
this mound has continued to stand at marathon to the present day .
the battle of marathon was one of those great events in the history of the human race which continue to attract , from age to age , the admiration of mankind .
they who look upon war , in all its forms , as only the <unk> of an unnatural and atrocious crime , which rises to dignity and grandeur only by the very enormity of its guilt , can not but respect the courage , the energy , and the cool and determined resolution with which the little band of greeks went forth to stop the torrent of foes which all the nations of a whole continent had combined to pour upon them .
the field has been visited in every age by thousands of travelers , who have upon the spot offered their tribute of admiration to the ancient heroes that triumphed there .
the plain is found now , as of old , overlooking the sea , and the mountains inland , towering above the plain .
the mound , too , still remains , which was reared to <unk> the memory of the greeks who fell .
they who visit it stand and survey the now silent and solitary scene , and derive from the influence and spirit of the spot new strength and energy to meet the great difficulties and dangers of life which they themselves have to encounter .
the greeks themselves , of the present day , notwithstanding the many sources of discouragement and depression with which they have to contend , must feel at marathon some rising spirit of emulation in contemplating the lofty mental powers and the undaunted spirit of their <unk> .
<name> makes one of them sing , " the mountains look on marathon , and marathon looks on the sea ; and musing there an hour alone , i dreamed that greece might still be free ; for , standing on the persians ' grave , i could not deem myself a slave . "

the city of athens and the plain of marathon are situated upon a peninsula .
the principal port by which the city was ordinarily approached was on the southern shore of the peninsula , though the persians had landed on the northern side .
of course , in their retreat from the field of battle , they fled to the north .
when they were beyond the reach of their enemies and fairly at sea , they were at first somewhat perplexed to determine what to do .
datis was extremely unwilling to return to <name> with the news of such a defeat .
on the other hand , there seemed but little <name> of any other result if he were to attempt a second landing .
<unk> , their greek guide , was killed in the battle .
he expected to be killed , for his mind , on the morning of the battle , was in a state of great despondency and dejection .
until that time he had felt a strong and confident expectation of success , but his feelings had then been very suddenly changed .
his confidence had arisen from the influence of a dream , his dejection from a cause more frivolous still ; so that he was equally irrational in his <name> and in his despair .
the omen which seemed to him to portend success to the enterprise in which he had undertaken to act as guide , was merely that he dreamed one night that he saw , and spent some time in company with , his mother .
in attempting to interpret this dream in the morning , it seemed to him that athens , his native city , was represented by his mother , and that the vision denoted that he was about to be restored to athens again .
he was extremely elated at this supernatural confirmation of his hopes , and would have gone into the battle certain of victory , had it not been that another circumstance occurred at the time of the landing to blast his hopes .
he had , himself , the general charge of the <unk> .
he stationed the ships at their proper places near the shore , and formed the men upon the beach as they landed .
while he was thus engaged , standing on the sand , he suddenly sneezed .
he was an old man , and his teeth  those that remained  were loose .
one of them was thrown out in the act of sneezing , and it fell into the sand .
<unk> was alarmed at this occurrence , considering it a bad omen .
he looked a long time for the tooth in vain , and then exclaimed that all was over .
the joining of his tooth to his mother earth was the event to which his dream referred , and there was now no <name> of any further fulfillment of it .
he went on mechanically , after this , in <unk> his men and preparing for battle , but his mind was oppressed with gloomy forebodings .
he acted , in consequence , feebly and with indecision ; and when the greeks explored the field on the morning after the battle , his body was found among the other mutilated and ghastly remains which covered the ground .
as the persian fleet moved , therefore , along the coast of attica , they had no longer their former guide .
they were still , however , very reluctant to leave the country .
they followed the shore of the peninsula until they came to the promontory of <unk> , which forms the southeastern extremity of it .
they doubled this cape , and then followed the southern shore of the peninsula until they arrived at the point opposite to athens on that side .
in the mean time , however , the spartan troops which had been sent for to aid the athenians in the contest , but which had not arrived in time to take part in the battle , reached the ground ; and the indications which the persians observed , from the decks of their galleys , that the country was thoroughly aroused , and was every where ready to receive them , deterred them from making any further attempts to land .
after lingering , therefore , a short time near the shore , the fleet directed its course again toward the coasts of <name> .
the mind of datis was necessarily very ill at ease .
he dreaded the wrath of <name> ; for despots are very prone to consider military failures as the worst of crimes .
the expedition had not , however , been entirely a failure .
datis had conquered many of the greek islands , and he had with him , on board his galleys , great <name> of prisoners , and a vast amount of plunder which he had obtained from them .
still , the greatest and most important of the objects which <name> had commissioned him to accomplish had been entirely defeated , and he felt , accordingly , no little anxiety in respect to the reception which he was to expect at susa .
one night he had a dream which greatly disturbed him .
he awoke in the morning with an impression upon his mind , which he had derived from the dream , that some <name> had been robbed by his soldiers in the course of his expedition , and that the sacrilegious booty which had been obtained was concealed somewhere in the fleet .
he immediately ordered a careful search to be instituted , in which every ship was examined .
at length they found , concealed in one of the galleys , a golden statue of apollo .
datis inquired what city it had been taken from .
they answered from <unk> .
<unk> was on the coast of attica , near the place where the persians had landed , at the time of their advance on marathon .
datis could not safely or conveniently go back there to restore it to its place .
he determined , therefore , to deposit it at <unk> for safe keeping , until it could be returned to its proper home .
<unk> was a small but very celebrated island near the center of the Ã¦gean sea , and but a short distance from the spot where the persian fleet was lying when datis made this discovery .
it was a sacred island , devoted to religious rites , and all contention , and violence , and , so far as was possible , all suffering and death , were excluded from it .
the sick were removed from it ; the dead were not buried there ; armed ships and armed men laid aside their hostility to each other when they approached it .
<unk> fleets rode at anchor , side by side , in peace , upon the smooth waters of its little port , and an enchanting picture of peace , tranquillity , and happiness was seen upon its shores .
a large natural fountain , or spring , thirty feet in diameter , and inclosed partly by natural rocks and partly by an artificial wall , issued from the ground in the center of the island , and sent forth a beautiful and <unk> rill into a <name> and happy valley , through which it <unk> , <unk> , for several miles , seeking the sea .
there was a large and populous city near the port , and the whole island was adorned with temples , palaces , colonnades , and other splendid architectural structures , which made it the admiration of all mankind .
all this magnificence and beauty have , however , long since passed away .
the island is now silent , deserted , and desolate , a dreary pasture , where cattle browse and feed , with stupid indifference , among the ancient ruins .
nothing living remains of the ancient scene of grandeur and beauty but the fountain .
that still continues to pour up its clear and <unk> waters with a ceaseless and eternal flow .
it was to this <unk> that datis determined to restore the golden statue .
he took it on board his own galley , and proceeded with it , himself , to the sacred island .
he deposited it in the great <name> of apollo , charging the priests to convey it , as soon as a convenient opportunity should occur , to its proper destination at <unk> .
the persian fleet , after this business was disposed of , set sail again , and pursued its course toward the coasts of <name> , where at length the expedition landed in safety .
the various divisions of the army were then distributed in the different provinces where they respectively belonged , and datis commenced his march with the persian portion of the troops , and with his prisoners and plunder , for susa , feeling , however , very uncertain how he should be received on his arrival there .
despotic power is always capricious ; and the character of <name> , which seems to have been naturally generous and kind , and was rendered cruel and tyrannical only through the influence of the position in which he had been placed , was continually presenting the most opposite and contradictory phases .
the generous elements of it , fortunately for datis , seemed to be in the ascendency when the remnant of the persian army arrived at susa .
<name> received the returning general without anger , and even treated the prisoners with humanity .
before finally leaving the subject of this celebrated invasion , which was brought to an end in so remarkable a manner by the great battle of marathon , it may be well to relate the extraordinary circumstances which attended the subsequent history of miltiades , the great commander in that battle on the greek side .
before the conflict , he seems to have had no official superiority over the other generals , but , by the resolute decision with which he urged the plan of giving the persians battle , and the confidence and courage which he manifested in expressing his readiness to take the responsibility of the measure , he placed himself virtually at the head of the greek command .
the rest of the officers acquiesced in his <unk> , and , <unk> their claims to an equal share of the authority , they allowed him to go forward and direct the operations of the day .
if the day had been lost , miltiades , even though he had escaped death upon the field , would have been totally and irretrievably ruined ; but as it was won , the result of the transaction was that he was raised to the highest pinnacle of <name> and renown .
and yet in this , as in all similar cases , the question of success or of failure depended upon causes wholly beyond the reach of human foresight or control .
the military commander who acts in such contingencies is compelled to stake every thing dear to him on results which are often as purely hazardous as the casting of a die .
the influence of miltiades in athens after the persian troops were withdrawn was paramount and supreme .
finding himself in possession of this ascendency , he began to form plans for other military undertakings .
it proved , in the end , that it would have been far better for him to have been satisfied with the fame which he had already acquired .
some of the islands in the Ã¦gean sea he considered as having taken part with the persians in the invasion , to such an extent , at least , as to furnish him with a pretext for making war upon them .
the one which he had specially in view , in the first instance , was <unk> .
<unk> is a large and important island situated near the center of the southern portion of the Ã¦gean sea .
it is of an oval form , and is about twelve miles long .
the surface of the land is beautifully diversified and very picturesque , while , at the same time , the soil is very fertile .
in the days of miltiades , it was very wealthy and populous , and there was a large city , called also <unk> , on the western coast of the island , near the sea .
there is a modern town built upon the site of the former city , which presents a very extraordinary appearance , as the dwellings are formed , in a great measure , of materials obtained from the ancient ruins .
marble columns , sculptured capitals , and fragments of what were once magnificent <unk> , have been used to construct plain walls , or laid in obscure and neglected pavements  all , however , still retaining , notwithstanding their present degradation , unequivocal marks of the nobleness of their origin .
the <unk> where the ancient <unk> marble was obtained were situated on this island , not very far from the town .
they remain to the present day in the same state in which the ancient workmen left them .
in the time of miltiades the island and the city of <unk> were both very wealthy and very powerful .
miltiades conceived the design of making a descent upon the island , and <unk> an immense contribution upon the people , in the form of a fine , for what he considered their treason in taking part with the enemies of their countrymen .
in order to prevent the people of <unk> from preparing for defense , miltiades intended to keep the object of his expedition secret for a time .
he therefore simply proposed to the athenians that they should equip a fleet and put it under his command .
he had an enterprise in view , he said , the nature of which he could not particularly explain , but he was very confident of its success , and , if successful , he should return , in a short time , laden with spoils which would enrich the city , and amply <unk> the people for the expenses they would have incurred .
the force which he asked for was a fleet of seventy vessels .
so great was the popularity and influence which miltiades had acquired by his victory at marathon , that this somewhat extraordinary proposition was readily complied with .
the fleet was equipped , and crews were provided , and the whole armament was placed under miltiades 's command .
the men themselves who were embarked on board of the galleys did not know whither they were going .
miltiades promised them victory and an abundance of gold as their reward ; for the rest , they must trust , he said , to him , as he could not explain the actual destination of the enterprise without <unk> its success .
the men were all satisfied with these conditions , and the fleet set sail .
when it arrived on the coast of <unk> , the <unk> were , of course , taken by surprise , but they made immediate preparations for a very vigorous resistance .
miltiades commenced a siege , and sent a herald to the city , demanding of them , as the price of their ransom , an immense sum of money , saying , at the same time , that , unless they delivered up that sum , or , at least , gave security for the payment of it , he would not leave the place until the city was captured , and , when captured , it should be wholly destroyed .
the <unk> rejected the demand , and engaged energetically in the work of completing and strengthening their defenses .
they organized companies of workmen to labor during the night , when their operations would not be observed , in building new walls , and <unk> every weak or unguarded point in the line of the fortifications .
it soon appeared that the <unk> were making far more rapid progress in securing their position than miltiades was in his assaults upon it .
miltiades found that an attack upon a fortified island in the Ã¦gean sea was a different thing from encountering the <unk> hordes of persians on the open plains of marathon .
there it was a contest between concentrated courage and discipline on the one hand , and a vast expansion of pomp and parade on the other ; whereas now he found that the courage and discipline on his part were met by an equally indomitable resolution on the part of his opponents , guided , too , by an equally <unk> experience and skill .
in a word , it was greek against greek at <unk> , and miltiades began at length to perceive that his prospect of success was growing very doubtful and dim .
this state of things , of course , filled the mind of miltiades with great anxiety and distress ; for , after the promises which he had made to the athenians , and the blind confidence which he had asked of them in proposing that they should commit the fleet so unconditionally to his command , he could not return discomfited to athens without involving himself in the most absolute disgrace .
while he was in this perplexity , it happened that some of his soldiers took captive a <unk> female , one day , among other prisoners .
she proved to be a priestess , from one of the <unk> temples .
her name was <unk> .
the thought occurred to miltiades that , since all human means at his command had proved inadequate to accomplish his end , he might , perhaps , through this captive priestess , obtain some superhuman aid .
as she had been in the service of a <unk> <name> , she would naturally have an influence with the divinities of the place , or , at least , she would be acquainted with the proper means of <unk> their favor .
miltiades , accordingly , held a private interview with <unk> , and asked her what he should do to propitiate the divinities of <unk> so far as to enable him to gain possession of the city .
she replied that she could easily point out the way , if he would but follow her instructions .
miltiades , overjoyed , promised readily that he would do so .
she then gave him her instructions secretly .
what they were is not known , except so far as they were revealed by the occurrences that followed .
there was a <name> consecrated to the goddess ceres near to the city , and so connected with it , it seems , as to be in some measure included within the defenses .
the approach to this <name> was guarded by a palisade .
there were , however , gates which afforded access , except when they were fastened from within .
miltiades , in obedience to <unk> instructions , went privately , in the night , perhaps , and with very few attendants , to this <name> .
he attempted to enter by the gates , which he had expected , it seems , to find open .
they were , however , fastened against him .
he then undertook to scale the palisade .
he succeeded in doing this , not , however , without difficulty , and then advanced toward the <name> , in obedience to the instructions which he had received from <unk> .
the account states that the act , whatever it was , that <unk> had directed him to perform , instead of being , as he supposed , a means of <unk> the favor of the divinity , was sacrilegious and impious ; and miltiades , as he approached the <name> , was struck suddenly with a mysterious and dreadful horror of mind , which wholly overwhelmed him .
rendered almost insane by this supernatural remorse and terror , he turned to fly .
he reached the palisade , and , in endeavoring to climb over it , his precipitation and haste caused him to fall .
his attendants ran to take him up .
he was helpless and in great pain .
they found he had dislocated a joint in one of his limbs .
he received , of course , every possible attention ; but , instead of recovering from the injury , he found that the consequences of it became more and more serious every day .
in a word , the great conqueror of the persians was now wholly overthrown , and lay moaning on his couch as helpless as a child .
he soon determined to abandon the siege of <unk> and return to athens .
he had been about a month upon the island , and had laid waste the rural districts , but , as the city had made good its defense against him , he returned without any of the <name> spoil which he had promised .
the disappointment which the people of athens experienced on his arrival , turned soon into a feeling of hostility against the author of the calamity .
miltiades found that the fame and honor which he had gained at marathon were gone .
they had been lost almost as suddenly as they had been acquired .
the rivals and enemies who had been silenced by his former success were now brought out and made clamorous against him by his present failure .
they attributed the failure to his own <unk> of the expedition , and one orator , at length , advanced articles of impeachment against him , on a charge of having been bribed by the persians to make his siege of <unk> only a <unk> .
miltiades could not defend himself from these <unk> , for he was lying , at the time , in utter helplessness , upon his couch of pain .
the dislocation of the limb had ended in an open wound , which at length , having resisted all the attempts of the physicians to stop its progress , had begun to <unk> , and the life of the sufferer was fast ebbing away .
his son <unk> did all in his power to save his father from both the dangers that threatened him .
he defended his character in the public <unk> , and he watched over his person in the cell in the prison .
these filial efforts were , however , in both cases unavailing .
miltiades was condemned by the tribunal , and he died of his wound .
the penalty exacted of him by the sentence was a very heavy fine .
the sum demanded was the amount which the expedition to <unk> had cost the city , and which , as it had been lost through the agency of miltiades , it was <unk> that he should <unk> .
this sentence , as well as the treatment in general which miltiades received from his countrymen , has been since considered by mankind as very unjust and cruel .
it was , however , only following out , somewhat rigidly , it is true , the essential terms and conditions of a military career .
it results from principles inherent in the very nature of war , that we are never to look for the ascendency of justice and humanity in any thing pertaining to it .
it is always power , and not right , that determines possession ; it is success , not merit , that gains honors and rewards ; and they who assent to the genius and spirit of military rule thus far , must not complain if they find that , on the same principle , it is failure and not crime which brings condemnation and destruction .
when miltiades was dead , <unk> found that he could not receive his father 's body for honorable interment unless he paid the fine .
he had no means , himself , of doing this .
he succeeded , however , at length , in raising the amount , by <unk> contributions from the family friends of his father .
he paid the fine into the city treasury , and then the body of the hero was deposited in its long home .
the <unk> were at first greatly incensed against the priestess <unk> , as it seemed to them that she had intended to betray the city to miltiades .
they wished to put her to death , but they did not dare to do it .
it might be considered an impious sacrilege to punish a priestess .
they accordingly sent to the oracle at delphi to state the circumstances of the case , and to inquire if they might lawfully put the priestess to death .
she had been guilty , they said , of pointing out to an enemy the mode by which he might gain possession of their city ; and , what was worse , she had , in doing so , attempted to admit him to those solemn scenes and mysteries in the <name> which it was not lawful for any man to behold .
the oracle replied that the priestess must not be punished , for she had done no wrong .
it had been decreed by the gods that miltiades should be destroyed , and <unk> had been employed by them as the involuntary instrument of conducting him to his fate .
the people of <unk> acquiesced in this decision , and <unk> was set free .
* * * * * but to return to <name> .
his <name> to subdue the greeks and to add their country to his dominions , and his determination to accomplish his purpose , were increased and strengthened , not diminished , by the repulse which his army had met with at the first invasion .
he was greatly incensed against the athenians , as if he considered their courage and energy in defending their country an audacious outrage against himself , and a crime .
he resolved to organize a new expedition , still greater and more powerful than the other .
of this armament he determined to take the command himself in person , and to make the preparations for it on a scale of such magnitude as that the expedition should be worthy to be led by the great sovereign of half the world .
he accordingly transmitted orders to all the peoples , nations , languages , and realms , in all his dominions , to raise their respective <unk> of troops , horses , ships , and munitions of war , and prepare to assemble at such place of rendezvous as he should designate when all should be ready .
some years elapsed before these arrangements were matured , and when at last the time seemed to have arrived for carrying his plans into effect , he deemed it necessary , before he commenced his march , to settle the succession of his kingdom ; for he had several sons , who might each claim the throne , and involve the empire in disastrous civil wars in attempting to enforce their claims , in case he should never return .
the historians say that there was a law of persia forbidding the sovereign to leave the realm without previously fixing upon a successor .
it is difficult to see , however , by what power or authority such a law could have been enacted , or to believe that monarchs like <name> would recognize an abstract obligation to law of any kind , in respect to their own political action .
there is a species of law regulating the ordinary dealings between man and man , that springs up in all communities , whether savage or civilized , from custom , and from the action of judicial <unk> , which the most despotic and absolute sovereigns feel themselves bound , so far as relates to the private affairs of their subjects , to respect and uphold ; but , in regard to their own personal and governmental acts and measures , they very seldom know any other authority than the impulses of their own sovereign <name> .
<name> had several sons , among whom there were two who claimed the right to succeed their father on the throne .
one was the oldest son of a wife whom <name> had married before he became king .
his name was <unk> .
the other was the son of atossa , the daughter of <name> , whom <name> had married after his accession to the throne .
his name was xerxes .
<unk> claimed that he was entitled to be his father 's heir , since he was his oldest son .
xerxes , on the other hand , maintained that , at the period of the birth of <unk> , <name> was not a king .
he was then in a private station , and sons could properly inherit only what their fathers possessed at the time when they were born .
he himself , on the other hand , was the oldest son which his father had had , being a king , and he was , consequently , the true <unk> of the kingdom .
besides , being the son of atossa , he was the grandson of <name> , and the hereditary rights , therefore , of that great founder of the empire had descended to him .
<name> decided the question in favor of xerxes , and then made arrangements for commencing his march , with a mind full of the elation and pride which were awakened by the grandeur of his position and the magnificence of his schemes .
these schemes , however , he did not live to execute .
he suddenly fell sick and died , just as he was ready to set out upon his expedition , and xerxes , his son , reigned in his stead .
xerxes immediately took command of the vast preparations which his father had made , and went on with the prosecution of the enterprise .
the expedition which followed deserves , probably , in respect to the <name> engaged in it , the distance which it traversed , the <unk> of the expenses involved , and the magnitude of its results , to be considered the greatest military undertaking which human ambition and power have ever attempted to effect .
the narrative , however , both of its splendid adventures and of its ultimate fate , belongs to the history of xerxes .
the greatness of <name> was the greatness of position and not of character .
he was the absolute sovereign of nearly half the world , and , as such , was held up very conspicuously to the attention of mankind , who gaze with a strong feeling of admiration and awe upon these vast elevations of power , as they do upon the summits of mountains , simply because they are high .
<name> performed no great exploit , and he accomplished no great object while he lived ; and he did not even leave behind him any strong impressions of personal character .
there is in his history , and in the position which he occupies in the minds of men , greatness without dignity , success without merit , vast and long-continued power without effects accomplished or objects gained , and universal and perpetual renown without honor or applause .
the world admire cÃ¦sar , hannibal , <name> , <name> , and <name> for the deeds which they performed .
they admire <name> only on account of the elevation on which he stood .
in the same lofty position , they would have admired , probably , just as much , the very horse whose neighing placed him there .

preface .
the design of the series of volumes , which it is intended to issue under the general title of <name> <name> 's adventures in the pursuit of knowledge , is not merely to entertain the reader with a narrative of juvenile adventures , but also to communicate , in connexion with them , as extensive and varied information as possible , in respect to the geography , the scenery , the customs and the institutions of this country , as they present themselves to the observation of the little traveller , who makes his excursions under the guidance of an intelligent and well-informed companion , qualified to assist him in the acquisition of knowledge and in the formation of character .
the author <name> endeavor to <unk> his narrative , and to <unk> into it elements of a salutary moral influence , by means of personal incidents <unk> the actors in the story .
these incidents are , of course , imaginary  but the reader may rely upon the strict and exact truth and fidelity of all the descriptions of places , institutions and scenes , which are brought before his mind in the progress of the narrative .
thus , though the author hopes that the readers , who may honor these volumes with their perusal , <name> be amused and interested by them , his design throughout <name> be to instruct rather than to entertain .
<name> <name> in the forests of maine .
chapter i .
the mouth of the <unk> .
one summer , forester and <name> <name> formed a plan for going to quebec .
<name> was very much interested in going to quebec , as he wanted to see the fortifications .
forester had told him that quebec was a <unk> city , being a military post of great importance , belonging to the british government .
<name> was very much pleased at the idea of seeing the fortifications , and the soldiers that he supposed must be placed there to defend them .
on their way to quebec , they had to sail up the <unk> in a steamboat .
as they were passing along , <name> and forester sat upon the deck .
it was a pleasant summer morning .
they had been sailing all night upon the sea , on the route from boston to the mouth of the <unk> .
they entered the mouth of the <unk> very early in the morning , just before forester and <name> got up .
and thus it happened that when they came up upon the deck , they found that they were sailing in a river .
the water was smooth and glassy , shining brilliantly under the rays of the morning sun , which was just beginning to rise .
the shores of the river were <name> and barren .
here and there , in the <unk> and eddies , were what appeared to <name> to be little fences in the water .
forester told him that they were for catching fish .
the steamboat moved very slowly , and every moment the little <name> would ring , and the engine would stop .
then the boat would move more slowly still , until the <name> sounded again for the engine to be put in motion , and then the boat would go on a little faster .
" what makes them keep stopping ? "
said <name> .
" the water is very low this morning , " said forester , " and they have to proceed very carefully , or else they <name> get aground . "
" what makes the water so low now ? "
asked <name> .
" there are two reasons , " replied forester .
" it is late in the summer , and the streams and springs are all low ; so that there is but little water to come down from the country above .
then , besides , the tide is low this morning in the sea , and that causes what water there is in the bed of the river to run off into the sea . "
" is not there any tide in the river ? "
asked <name> .
" no , " said forester , " i suppose there is not , strictly speaking .
that is , the moon , which attracts the waters of the ocean , and makes them rise and fall in succession , produces no sensible effect upon the waters of a river .
but then the rise and fall of the sea itself causes all rivers to rise and fall near their mouths , and as far up as the influence of the sea extends .
you see , in fact , that it must be so . "
" not exactly , " said <name> .
" why , when the water in the sea , " continued forester , " at the mouth of the river is very low , the water in the river can flow off more readily , and this makes the water fall in the river itself .
on the other hand , when the water in the sea is high , the water can not run out from the river , and so it rises .
sometimes , in fact , the sea rises so much that the water from the sea flows up into the river , and makes it salt for a considerable distance from its mouth . "
" i wonder whether the water is salt here , " said <name> .
" i do n't know , " said forester .
" if we had a pail with a long rope to it , " said <name> , " we could let it down and get some , and try it . "
" we could let the pail down , but i doubt very much whether we could get any water , " said forester .
" it is quite difficult to drop the pail in such a manner as to get any water when the vessel is under way . "
" i should like to try , " said <name> .
" you can find out whether the water is salt easier than that , " said forester .
" you can let a twine string down , and wet the end .
that <name> take up enough for a taste . "
" well , " said <name> , " if i 've got a string long enough . "
so saying , he began to feel in his pockets for a string .
he found a piece of twine , which he thought would be long enough , but , on trial , it appeared that it would not reach quite to the water .
forester then tied it to the end of his cane , and allowed <name> to take the cane , and hold it over the side of the vessel ; and by this means he succeeded in reaching the water , and wetting the end of the string .
he could , after all , succeed in wetting only a small part of the string , for it was drawn along so rapidly by the motion of the boat , that it skipped upon the surface of the water without sinking in .
at length , however , after he had got the end a little wetted , he <name> it up and put it in his mouth .
" how does it taste ? "
said forester .
the question was hardly necessary , for the faces which <name> made showed sufficiently plain that the water was bitter and salt .
" yes , it is salt , " said he .
then , suddenly casting his eye upon a long <unk> substance , which just then came floating by , he called out , " why , forester , what is that ? "
" a log , " said forester .
the log was round and straight , and the ends were square .
the log glided rapidly by , and soon disappeared .
" it is a pine log , " said forester .
" there are vast forests of pine trees in this state .
they cut down the trees , and then cut the trunks into pieces of moderate length , and draw them on the snow to the rivers .
then , in the spring , the waters rise and float the logs down .
this is one of these logs floating down .
sometimes the river is quite full of them . "
" where do they go ? "
asked <name> .
" oh , men stop them all along the river , and put them into booms , and then fasten them together in rafts . "
" how do they fasten them together ? "
asked <name> .
" they drive a pin into the middle of each log , and then extend a rope along , fastening it to each pin .
in this manner , the rope holds the logs together , and they form a long raft .
when they catch the logs in booms , they afterwards form them into rafts , and so float them down the river to the mills , where they are to be sawed . "
" can men stand upon the rafts ? "
said <name> .
" yes , " replied forester , " very well . "
" they make a floor of boards , i suppose , " said <name> .
" no , " replied forester ; " they stand directly upon the logs . "
" i should think the logs would sink under them , " replied <name> , " or at least roll about . "
" they sink a little , " replied forester ; " just about as much as the bulk of the man who stands upon them . "
" i do n't know what you mean by that , exactly , " said <name> .
" why , the rule of floating bodies is this , " rejoined forester .
" when any substance , like a cake of ice , or a log of wood , or a boat , is floating upon the water , a part of it being above the water and a part under the water , if a man steps upon it , he makes it sink enough deeper to <unk> a part of the wood or ice as large as he is himself .
if there is just as much of the wood or ice above the water as is equal to the bulk of the man , then the man , in stepping upon it , <name> sink it just to the water 's edge . "
" but perhaps one man would be heavier than another man , " said <name> .
" yes , " replied forester ; " but then he would be larger , and so , according to the principle , he would make more wood sink before the equilibrium was reached . "
" what is equilibrium ? "
asked <name> .
" equilibrium is an equality between two forces , " replied forester .
" i do n't see what two forces there are , " said <name> .
" there is the weight of the man pressing downwards , " said forester , " for one , and the buoyant power of the water , that is , its upward pressure , for the other .
the weight of the man remains constantly the same .
but the upward pressure of the water increases in proportion as the log sinks into it .
for the deeper the log sinks into the water , the more of it is submerged , and it is more acted upon and pressed upward by the water .
now , as one of these forces remains constant , and the other increases , they must at length come to be equal , that is , in equilibrium ; and then the log <name> not sink any farther .
that 's the philosophy of it , <name> . "
<name> did not reply , but sat looking at the barren and <name> shores of the river , as the boat glided by them .
presently another log came into view .
" there , " said forester , " look at that log , and see whether you think that you could float upon it . "
" yes , " said <name> , " i think i could . "
" it depends , " said forester , " on the question whether the part of it which is out of water is as big as you are . "
" i think it is , " said <name> .
" yes , " added forester , " i have no doubt that it is . "
" only i should roll off , " said <name> .
" true , " replied forester ; " but the <unk> , who work about the logs , acquire astonishing dexterity in standing upon them .
if there is only enough of the log above water to equal their bulk , so that it has buoyant power enough to float them , they <name> keep it steady with their feet , and sail about upon it very safely . "
" i should like to try , " said <name> .
" perhaps we shall have an opportunity at some place on the river , " said forester .
here <name> suddenly interrupted the conversation by pointing up the river to a column of smoke and steam which he saw rising beyond a point of land which was just before them .
" here comes another steamboat , " said he .
" see , forester . "
" no , " said forester , " i believe that is a steam mill . "
" a steam mill ! "
repeated <name> .
" yes , " replied forester .
" they have steam mills and tide mills to saw up the logs in this part of the river .
farther up , where there are waterfalls on the river , or on the streams which empty into it , they build mills which are carried by water .
i presume that that is a steam mill . "
at this moment , <name> 's attention was diverted from the steam mill by a boat which came gliding into the field of view .
there was one man in the boat rowing it .
another sat in the stern , with a pole in his hand .
the pole had an iron hook in the end of it .
a short distance before the boat was a log floating upon the water .
the oarsman was rowing the boat towards the log .
he brought it up to it in such a manner that the other man could strike his hook into it .
when this was done , the oarsman began to pull the boat towards the shore , drawing the log with it .
by this time the whole group disappeared from <name> 's view , behind a boat which was hanging on the quarter of the steamer .
<name> , who wished to watch the whole proceeding , left forester , and ran aft , in hopes that he could get another view of the men in the boat .
he found , however , that the steamboat was proceeding so rapidly up the river , that he was fast losing sight of them ; and then he concluded to go forward to the bows of the steamboat , thinking that , perhaps , there might be other logs coming down the river , with men after them in boats .
when he reached the bows , <name> found the deck encumbered with cables and anchors , and heavy boxes of freight , which made it difficult for him to find his way to a good place for a view .
he finally reached a place where , by standing upon an anchor , he could look over the bulwarks , and get a view of the expanse of water before him .
it was smooth , and its glassy surface was bright with the reflection of the rays of the morning sun .
<name> admired the beauty of the river and of its banks , but he could see no boats , or even logs coming .
he saw some large sand banks before him , which had been left bare by the <unk> of the tide .
he wished that the steamboat would stop , and let him land upon one of them .
he also looked down over the bows , and admired the graceful form and beautiful smoothness of the ripple , or rather wave , which was formed by the <unk> of the boat as it urged its way rapidly through the water .
after gazing upon this for some time , <name> turned to go away in pursuit of forester , when an occurrence took place , which being somewhat important in its consequences , the account of it must be deferred to the next chapter .
chapter ii .
the lost bucket .
as <name> was stepping down from the position which he had taken upon the anchor , his eye fell upon a small bucket , with a long rope tied to the handle , which he immediately recognised as one of those buckets which the sailors fit up in that way , in order to draw up water from alongside the ship .
" there 's a bucket , now , " said <name> to himself .
" i declare , i believe i 'll draw up some water .
forester said that it was hard , but i think it <name> be easy .
i 'll draw up a bucket full , and <name> to him and show him . "
so saying , <name> took up the bucket , lifted it gently over the side , and let it down slowly by the rope into the water .
there was a knot in the end of the rope ; and <name> held the knot firmly in his hand , so as to draw up the bucket by means of it , as soon as he should get it full .
he found , however , that , although he could let the pail down easily enough , it was no easy matter to dip up any water into it ; for the rope , being fastened to the bail or handle , kept the handle , and of course the open part of the pail , upwards , so that the water could not run in .
if <name> let the rope down more , the pail , being light , would not sink , but skipped along upon the surface of the water , drawn by the motion of the steamboat .
while <name> was making these fruitless attempts , another boy , dressed in sailor 's clothes , whom <name> had seen several times before about the boat , came up to him , and asked him what he was doing .
" i 'm trying to get some water , " said <name> .
" that is n't the way to get it , " said the sailor boy .
" let me have the bucket .
i 'll show you the way . "
" no , " said <name> , " i want to get it myself . "
" you never can get any that way , " said the boy .
" you must swing it back and forth , and when it is swinging well , let it drop suddenly and catch the water . "
so <name> began to swing the bucket back and forth , and after he had got it well <unk> , he let down the rope suddenly , at the moment when the bucket was at the extent of its oscillation .
the bucket filled instantly ; but , as the boat was advancing rapidly , it was caught by the water with such force that the rope was twitched out of <name> 's hand with great force .
" hold on ! "
exclaimed the sailor boy .
but it was too late .
the rope fell down into the water , and the bucket , rope and all , sailed back upon the surface of the water , until they floated under the paddle wheel of the boat , which dashed them down beneath the surface of the water , and they disappeared finally from view .
" why did not you hold on ? "
said the boy .
<name> was silent .
the boy looked round to see if anybody had observed what had taken place .
he found that all the seamen were busy here and there , and that nobody had noticed what the two boys had been doing .
" nobody has seen you , " said the sailor boy ; " so you say nothing , and i 'll say nothing . "
" but suppose they ask you what has become of that bucket , " said <name> ; " what <name> you tell them ? "
" oh , i 'll tell them i do n't know where it is , " he replied ; " and i do n't .
i am sure i do n't know where it is now : do you ?
hush , here comes <name> . "
<name> looked up at these words , and saw the sailor approaching whom the boy called <name> ; and the boy himself immediately stepped down from the anchor , where he and <name> had been standing , and began <unk> a rope upon the deck .
<name> walked sorrowfully away towards the stern of the vessel , where he had left forester .
there was something wrong and something right in the boy 's proposal to <name> , to conceal the loss of the bucket .
his object was to befriend and help <name> in his distress .
this was right .
the means by which he proposed to accomplish the object were secrecy and fraud .
this was wrong .
thus , the end which he had in view was a good one , and it evinced a good feeling in him ; but the means for promoting it were criminal .
some persons have maintained that if the end is only right , it is of no consequence by what means we seek to promote it .
hence , they have had this maxim , viz. , " the end <unk> the means . "
but this maxim is not sound .
the contrary principle is correct .
it is sometimes expressed by this saying : " we must not do evil that good may come ; " which is a much safer proverb to be guided by .
<name> 's first impulse was , to go at once and tell the captain of the steamboat that he had lost his bucket .
but he did not know exactly where he could find him .
he looked at his office window , and found that it was shut .
he asked one of the waiters , whom he met coming up stairs from the cabin , if he knew where the captain was .
but the waiter did not know .
presently , he saw a gentleman walking back and forth upon that part of the deck which is in front of the door of the ladies ' cabin .
he thought that he was the captain .
<name> walked up to him , and accosted him by saying : " are you the captain of this boat , sir ? "
" am i the captain ? "
asked the man .
" why ?
what do you want to know for ? "
" because , if you are , " said <name> , " i have lost your bucket . "
" lost my bucket ! "
repeated the gentleman .
" how did you lose it ? "
" i lost it overboard , " said <name> .
here the gentleman laughed , and said , " no , i 'm not captain ; but you seem to be an honest sort of boy .
i do n't know where the captain is . "
all this , though it has taken some time to describe it , took place in a very few minutes ; and the boat had now advanced only so far as to be opposite the steam mill which <name> had seen just before he had left forester .
<name> happened to see the mill as the boat moved by it , and he went immediately to the side of the boat to get a better view of it .
there was a chimney for the smoke , and a pipe for the waste steam , at the mill .
from the <unk> there issued a dense column of vapor , which came up , however , not in a regular current , like the smoke from the chimney , but it was puffed up in regular strokes , making a sort of <unk> .
while <name> was looking at it , forester came along , and stood looking at it too .
there were a great many logs lying about the shore , and enormous piles of boards , which had been sawed , and which were ready for the vessels that were to come and take them away .
" what makes the steam come up in puffs ? "
asked <name> .
" because , it is what they call a high pressure engine , " said forester .
" it works against the pressure of the atmosphere .
all such engines throw out the steam in puffs . "
" why do they ? "
asked <name> .
" do you know what the cylinder of a steam engine is ? "
said forester .
" not exactly ; i do n't remember it very well , " replied <name> .
" come with me , then , " said forester , " and i <name> show it to you . "
so saying , he took <name> to the engine of the boat , and showed him , in the midst of the machinery , a large iron vessel , shaped like a hogshead , only it had straight sides .
<name> could not see much more than the top of it .
" that is the cylinder , " said forester .
" it is the heart of the steam engine , as i may say  the seat of its power .
all the other machinery is only to aid the cylinder , and to convey the power to the point where it is wanted to do the work .
thus , the place where the steam exerts its power , and on which the whole movement of the machinery depends , is the cylinder . "
<name> observed that a long iron <name> , large and solid , and very bright , kept ascending and descending through the top of the cylinder , as if pushed up and drawn down again by some force within .
forester told him that that was the piston <name> .
" the piston <name> , " said forester , " is fastened , at its lower end , to the piston , which is a flat plate of iron , made to fit the inside of the cylinder exactly . "
" first , " said forester , " the steam comes in below the piston , and drives it up ; and then it is stopped from coming in below , and is forced in above , and so drives it down . "
" and how does the other steam get out ? "
asked <name> .
" there are two ways of getting rid of the steam that is below the piston when the piston is coming down , " said forester .
" one way is , to open a passage to let it out into the air .
on this plan , when the piston has been driven up , the steam is cut off from coming in below the piston , and is admitted above .
at the same instant , the passage is opened to let the lower steam out .
of course , the steam that comes in above , drives the piston down , and forces the steam that is below , out into the air .
they generally have a pipe to convey it away , and as the piston goes up and down , the steam comes out in puffs , as you saw it in that mill . "
" yes , " said <name> , " i understand that ; and now what is the other way ? "
" that kind of engine is called a high pressure engine , " said forester , " because the piston , in coming down , has to drive out the steam from below , against the pressure of the atmosphere ; for the atmosphere above passes into the pipe , and <unk> the movement of the steam in coming out .
it requires a greater force of steam to work the piston on this plan than it does upon the other . "
" what is the plan of the other ? "
asked <name> .
" on the other plan , " said forester , " the steam under the piston is condensed , that is , turned suddenly into water ; and this leaves a vacancy or void below the piston , so that the piston can be forced down much more easily than if it had to drive the steam out before it , against the pressure of the atmosphere . "
forester was going on to explain to <name> how it was that the steam was condensed in the cylinder , when the conversation was suddenly interrupted by the sound of the engine <name> , which was the signal for the engine to stop .
the thumping sound of the machinery and of the paddle wheels accordingly ceased , and the boat began to move more slowly .
presently , the <name> sounded once more , and the piston <name> slowly rose out of the cylinder , and then slowly descended again .
" they are going very slowly , " said <name> .
" yes , " replied forester , " the water is low , and i suppose that the channel is narrow . "
just at this moment , they perceived a strange sensation , as if the steamboat had been suddenly pushed backwards .
<name> was startled .
he did not know what it meant .
" there we are , " said forester .
" what ? "
said <name> .
" what is it ? "
" aground , " said forester .
" aground ? "
repeated <name> .
" yes , " said forester ; " that 's the sensation produced when a ship goes aground upon sand or soft mud . "
so saying , forester left the engine , and went up to the upper deck , followed by <name> .
there were several persons there , looking out upon the water .
" yes , " said forester , " we are aground .
you see by the trees upon the bank that we are not moving . "
<name> saw that they were at rest .
he asked forester what they were going to do .
just at this moment the little <name> sounded , and the engine , which had been stopped when the boat went aground , was put in motion again .
" they are going to back the engine , i suppose , " said forester , " to try to draw her off . "
but the boat would not move .
the engine did not seem to have power to release her from her confinement .
" what shall we do now ? "
asked <name> .
" why , whenever a ship is aground , " said forester , " the first question is , what is the state of the tide ? "
" because , " continued forester , after a moment 's pause , " if the tide is rising , it soon lifts the vessel off , and enables her to go back , or , perhaps , forward , if the water is not very shallow .
but , if the tide is falling , it leaves her to rest more and more upon the sand , and she can not get off until the water has gone entirely down , and then rises again .
she can not get off , in fact , until the water has risen higher than it was when she first grounded . "
" and how is it now ? "
asked <name> .
" i presume the tide is going down , " said forester ; " and if so , we must wait here until it rises again . "
so saying , he began to look about for somebody of whom he could inquire .
he soon heard a gentleman say to another that the tide was falling , and that they should have to stay here three hours .
" that 's rather provoking , " said <name> .
" oh , no , " said forester .
" perhaps we can go ashore . "
" well , " said <name> , with an expression of gratification at the proposal .
" and perhaps we can borrow some fishing lines , and go a fishing . "
" yes , " said <name> , " that <name> be an excellent plan . "
" at any rate , " said forester , " when accidents of this sort occur upon our travels , we should not allow ourselves to be provoked by them , but make ourselves contented by the best means within our reach . "
at this time , they began to hear the loud , hissing sound , produced by the blowing off of the steam from the engine , which forester said was an additional indication that they were going to remain there for some time .
presently , a man came up the stairs from the deck below  for forester and <name> were at this time on the upper deck  and told the passengers that the boat would have to remain there three or four hours , and that if any of them wished to go ashore to amuse themselves , he would send them in his boat , after breakfast .
quite a number of the passengers seemed disposed to accept this offer , and the boat was accordingly lowered ; and <name> , with two other sailors , were despatched to row it ashore .
they were all safely landed upon a raft of logs , just above the mill .
chapter iii .
a raft .
forester and <name> did not take breakfast on board the steamboat , but waited until they got on shore .
they had inquired of a <unk> , who seemed acquainted with the country , and were told that there was a very good tavern about a quarter of a mile from the mill .
when they landed upon the logs , <name> , whose curiosity seemed to be stronger than his appetite , wanted to ramble about for a little time along the shore and among the piles of boards , but forester thought it would be best first to go and get their breakfast .
" because , " said he , " we can then amuse ourselves by rambling about here , and shall be ready to return to the steamboat whenever they send for us . "
so they went to the tavern .
forester seemed to have little appetite for his breakfast .
he complained of feeling fatigued , and yet he had nothing to fatigue him .
<name> ate , and talked fast all the time ; but forester seemed silent and dejected .
" come , cousin forester , what is the matter with you ? "
said <name> at last .
forester said that he felt somewhat unwell , and as there was a sofa in the room , he concluded to lie down upon it , and not go out .
<name> was , at first , disposed to stay and take care of him , but forester said that he did not need anything , and he wished <name> to go out and amuse himself .
" you may go and see the mill , " said he , " and the logs along the shore ; only be careful not to go where there is any danger ; and come and let me know when the boat is coming from the steamer to take us on board again . "
so <name> left forester upon the sofa , and went away .
he was sorry that he was sick , and he was particularly sorry that he had to go himself without company .
but , concluding that he would adopt <unk> principle of making the best of everything , in the events which occur in travelling , he walked along the road , singing a tune which he had learned at a juvenile singing school in new york , and watching the <unk> of the steam , as it issued from the pipe at the mill .
as <name> walked along , it occurred to him that he had not , after all , succeeded in acknowledging to the captain of the steamboat that he had lost the bucket .
and , since the first occasion for doing so had gone by , he began to doubt whether it would be best for him to trouble himself any farther about it .
" the bucket was not worth much , " said he to himself .
" nobody knows it is lost , except that boy , and he <name> not tell .
i 've a great mind not to say anything about it . "
in fact , <name> found that he was much less inclined to make his acknowledgment now , than he was when the circumstance first occurred .
he wished that he had at once stated the facts to forester , which would have been his wisest course ; but now , that the first occasion for doing so had passed away , he began to feel disinclined to do it at all .
<name> soon reached the mill , and he amused himself , for half an hour , in watching the movement of the engine , the strokes of the saw , and the drawing up of the logs from the water to the floor of the mill .
there was a steep , sloping platform from the mill down to the river , and a long chain extended down to the water .
this chain was fastened to one end of one of the logs , which lay floating there , and then , by means of the machinery , it was drawn slowly up , bringing the ponderous log with it .
the way in which the machinery <name> up the chain was this : the end of the chain , which was within the mill , was wound around an axle , which was made to revolve by the machinery .
the axle , thus revolving , wound up the chain , and , in this manner , <name> it gradually in , by which means the log , which was attached to the lower end of it , was drawn up .
presently , <name> 's attention was attracted towards some men , who seemed to be sailing about upon some logs , in a cove , just below the mill .
he went down immediately to see what they were doing .
they had long poles in their hands , with iron points in the ends of them , and were pushing the logs about with these poles , to choose out such as they wished to saw in the mill .
just as <name> came down , one of the men stepped upon the end of a log which was floating very near him .
the log sank a little , but not much , under him , and the man walked along towards the other end of it .
<name> wondered how he could keep his balance .
when the millman reached the farther end of the log , he extended his long pole very <unk> , and struck the point of it into the corner of a sort of wharf , which was built upon the bank ; and then , pulling gently , he <name> himself along , together with the log upon which he was floating .
<name> was surprised at this , and he wondered that the man did not fall off the log .
he thought that if the log were to roll in the least degree , the man would be rolled off into the water .
he ran down to the little wharf , so that he could see better .
" well , my boy , " said the millman , " do you belong on board the steamboat ? "
" yes , sir , " said <name> ; " we got aground .
you 'll fall off of that log if you do n't take care . "
" no , " said the millman , " there 's no danger . "
" why , if the log should roll the least atom , away you 'd go , " said <name> , " though the water is not very deep . "
here the man began to step upon the log in a peculiar manner , so as to make it roll .
it rolled slowly , but the man continued stepping until he had rolled it completely over .
the side which had been under water appeared of a dark color , and was very slippery , being covered with a sort of slime ; but the man did not slip .
after he had thus rolled the log completely over , he looked up to <name> , and said , " there , you see that there is no danger . "
when the man had drawn this log up to the shore , he went for another ; and he had to sail upon this second one a long distance , in bringing it to its place .
he pushed himself along by running his pole down to the bottom , and pushing against the sand .
" could i sail upon a log ? "
asked <name> .
" no , " replied the millman ; " you 'd roll off . "
" how did you learn to do it ? "
asked <name> .
" oh , i learned when i was a boy , " replied the millman .
" did you roll off when you were learning ? "
asked <name> .
" yes , " said the man .
" i 've been off the log into the water many a time . "
" and how did you get out again ? "
said <name> .
" oh , i could swim , " he replied ; " and as soon as i came up , i would paddle back to the log , and climb up upon it .
once , however , i came very near being drowned . "
" how was it ? "
said <name> .
" why , i was on the upper side of a boom "   " a boom ? "
said <name> , " what is that ? "
" a boom ! "
repeated the millman ; " do n't you know what a boom is ?
it is a place to catch logs .
they go to some cove or <name> , where the water is pretty still , and chain logs together , end to end , so as to form a long line on the lower side of the <name> , and then along up the middle of the river a little way , so as to enclose a space to catch the logs . "
" what do they fasten the boom to ? "
asked <name> .
" why , the lower end , " said the millman , " is fastened to the shore , by means of a very strong post , or an iron staple set into the rocks .
the other end , which is out in the middle of the stream , is fastened to some island , if there is one , or , if not , to a pier built up from the bottom . "
" well , " said <name> , " tell on about your getting in . "
" the boom was full of logs , and i was upon the upper side of it , at work with some other men .
i was on a log trying to find the <name> , and i fell in . "
" what made you fall off ? "
asked <name> .
" i do n't know , " replied the millman .
" i was not much use to logs then .
i was trying to find the <name> . "
" what <name> ? "
asked <name> .
" the owner 's <name> , " said the millman .
" the owners all <name> their logs , when they get them out in the <name> , and then we separate or sort them in the booms .
sometimes the <name> is on the under side of the log , and so we have to turn it over in the water to find it . "
while all this conversation had been going on , the millman had been moving about over the water with the various logs , <name> accompanying him , and keeping as near to him as possible , walking along the shore , and sometimes on the logs which were resting by one end on the shore .
as the millman was describing the system of marking the logs , he was sailing along very near to <name> , and he immediately began to turn the log over under him , saying  " for instance , look here , and see me turn up the <name> of this log . "
<name> watched the log , as it slowly revolved , until presently there came a sort of <unk> <name> upon one end , made by crosses and lines cut into the wood .
" every owner has his particular <name> , " said the millman .
" whose <name> is that ? "
asked <name> .
" i do n't know , " said the man , " but they know at the mill .
they have a register of them all at the mill . "
" i wish i could turn over a log , standing on it , in that way , " said <name> .
" you could n't , " said the millman .
" the only way by which you can sail safely on logs , would be to put two together , and make a sort of raft . "
" how ? "
asked <name> .
" by <unk> short pieces of boards across from one log to another .
then they would not roll . "
" well , " said <name> , " if i could only get a hammer and some nails . "
the millman told him that perhaps they would let him have a hammer and some nails at the mill ; and <name> , accordingly , went up to inquire .
they told him they had a hammer , but they had no nails to spare .
so <name> failed of getting the means of making a raft .
he forgot to go back to the millman to get the rest of his story , but , instead of it , he rambled down the bank of the river , until he came to a place where there was an old fence , which had fallen down , and the nails were sticking out of the boards .
he now wished that he had borrowed the hammer at the mill , and he tried to persuade a boy , who was standing there , to go and borrow it for him .
the boy told him that a stone would do very well for a hammer .
" so it <name> , " said <name> ; " find me a good one , and bring it to this old fence . "
the boy brought <name> a stone , and <name> began to knock out the nails .
very soon , however , he set the boy at work upon the nails , while he went in pursuit of some short boards , to nail across from one log to the other .
he found some , which he thought would answer , without much difficulty , and collected them together near the logs ; and , soon afterwards , the boy brought him the nails .
the logs were lying side by side , with two ends resting upon the shore , the two other ends being out towards the stream .
<name> concluded to nail first the two ends which were towards the shore , they being nearest , and being also more steady than the others .
he accordingly laid one of his short pieces across , and nailed it as well as he could , using the stone for a hammer .
" now , " said he to the boy , " i 'll put another board across at the middle , and one more at the other end , and then , if i can find something for a pole , i 'll take a little sail .
look about a little , my boy , wo n't you , " continued he , " and see if you ca n't find a pole , while i am <unk> the other boards . "
the boy accordingly went away in pursuit of a pole , while <name> nailed first the middle board , and then the end one .
he came back just after <name> had got the first nail of the end board driven in , and as soon as he came in sight of the logs and of <name> , he exclaimed  " you 're adrift !
you 're adrift ! "
<name> got up immediately , and looked around .
he was indeed adrift .
his weight , pressing upon the outer ends of the logs , had lifted the other ends off the shore , and the raft was slowly floating up the stream .
the reason why it floated up was , that there was at this place what they call an <name> , which is a current near the shore , flowing up the stream .
such eddies are caused , generally , by curves in the banks .
as soon as <name> perceived that he was afloat , he said  " throw me the pole . "
the boy threw the pole , and it just reached the raft .
<name> took it in , and , thrusting the end hastily down into the water , he endeavored to push himself back by pushing against the bottom .
but it was too late .
he had got already into such deep water that he could scarcely reach the bottom , and he could not push the raft back .
in the mean time , the raft slowly moved up the river .
" never mind , " said <name> .
" i 'm going right for the mill , and when i get there , they 'll come out for me in a boat .
in the mean time , i 'd better finish my raft . "
so saying , he kneeled down and finished <unk> on the last board .
when he rose again , he found that he had advanced considerably , and the boy had accompanied him , walking along by the shore .
he perceived , however , that he was gradually getting away from the shore , and , looking forward , he saw , to his consternation , that the <name> did not extend to the mill ; but that , at a short distance above him , it swept out into the main current of the river , which was running by a point of land at the upper part of the <name> , with great speed .
the raft advanced slowly till it came to this current , when it turned around , and began to glide swiftly down the stream .
" boy , " cried <name> , in great distress , " run to the mill as fast as you can go , and tell them that i have gone down the river , adrift .
tell them to send a boat after me as quick as they can .
my cousin forester <name> pay them well . "
so the boy ran off towards the mill , while <name> floated away helplessly down the current .
chapter iv .
the desert island .
after <name> had sailed on for a few minutes , he cast his eyes up the river , and saw the steamboat .
she was still lying in an inclined position , as she had been left grounded by the tide .
he shouted and waved his hat , in the endeavor to attract the attention of the people on board , and lead them to send a boat to rescue him .
but all his efforts were vain .
he could not make them hear .
the current soon bore him beyond a point of land which hid the steamboat from his view , and he began to fear that he should be actually carried out to sea .
he was calculating , in fact , how many miles it was to the mouth of the river , when it suddenly occurred to him that , though he could not push with his pole , he might perhaps paddle with it .
he accordingly took up the pole , which he had laid down upon the raft , and began to use it as a paddle .
<name> found , to his great relief , that he could produce considerable effect upon his raft by using his pole as a paddle .
he contrived to get the head of his raft round towards the shore , and , by working hard , he succeeded in urging it along through the current , very slowly , indeed , but still perceptibly , so that he began to have some <name> that he might succeed in reaching land .
before he had made much progress , however , he suddenly saw before him , at a short distance , a little <name> island , with some grass and a few trees on the lower end of it .
the island was very small , being not much longer than <name> 's raft .
it lay almost directly in his course  so nearly , that he perceived that by working a little more with his pole , he thought he could bring himself into such a position as to be thrown by the current directly upon it .
this he did .
he paddled , with all his strength , to get into a line with the upper end of the island , the current , all the time , bearing him down directly towards it .
in a few minutes , he had the satisfaction of seeing that he was going directly upon it .
" all right , " said he to himself ; " now i 'm safe . "
as he said these words , the end of the raft struck the rock , and he leaped off upon it .
the raft swung round , and was going away , but <name> seized it , and dragged it up a little way upon the shore , so as to secure it .
he then sat down upon the rock , and began to consider what was next to be done .
he was certainly at a loss to know what was to be done .
he waited an hour , and then , getting very tired of his situation , he began to consider whether it would not be best for him to <unk> himself once more to his raft , and endeavor to get to the shore by means of his paddle .
while he was sitting on a point of the rock , in this perplexity , looking towards the shore that was nearest to him , he suddenly saw a boy coming upon a horse , along a winding road , which led to the river .
he was driving the horse down to water .
the horse advanced to the brink of the river , when <name> began to call out in his loudest voice , " halloo ! "
" halloo ! "
answered the boy .
" ca n't you get a boat , and come and take me off this island ? "
cried <name> .
the boy paused a moment , and gazed earnestly at <name> , while the horse continued drinking .
" how came you on that island ? "
said the boy , calling out again in a loud voice .
" i got adrift on some logs , " said <name> , " and floated down the river .
ca n't you get a boat , and come and take me off ? "
" i have not got any boat , " said the boy .
" there a n't any boats about here . "
" i wish you would go and get one , " said <name> .
" i 'll pay you well for it . "
the boy did not answer .
he seemed to be hesitating .
in the mean time , the horse , having nearly finished his drinking , lifted up his head and looked at <name> .
" there is not any boat within a mile , " said the boy .
" but i should think you might <name> ashore .
the water is not deep between here and the island . "
" then <name> out here with your horse , " said <name> , " and take me on behind you . "
the boy hesitated a moment , but he finally decided to comply with <name> 's proposal , and accordingly began to advance his horse into the water .
<name> watched his progress with intense interest .
as the water grew deeper , he began to fear that the boy would get discouraged , and turn back .
but the boy kept on .
he turned his steps somewhat below the island , where there was an extensive shoal ; the water grew <unk> and <unk> , until at last the horse emerged entirely , and stood upon a little dry sand bank at the lower side of the island .
" i 'm very much obliged to you , indeed , " said <name> , " for coming for me  besides the pay .
i <name> pay you for it as soon as we get on shore . "
" oh , no , " said the boy , " i do n't need any pay just for wading my horse out here .
i <name> him out here very often , when i come down to water ; that is , in the summer , when the water is low . "
<name> mounted behind the boy , and the boy turned his horse 's head towards the shore .
" how far is it back to the mill ? "
asked <name> .
" to the steam mill ?  four miles , " answered the boy .
" four miles ! "
exclaimed <name> ; " is it possible that i have floated down four miles ?
how shall i ever get back again ? "
" how did you happen to get adrift ? "
asked the boy .
<name> proceeded to give the boy an account of his getting adrift , but in a short time the water began to grow so deep that he was afraid .
the boy , however , told him that there was no danger .
the bottom of the river , at this place , was a great bed of pebble stones , and the current ran very swiftly over them , and curled in sharp ripples about the horse 's legs .
presently , however , the water became more shallow , and they soon safely reached the shore .
" now , " said <name> , " i want to get back to the mill just as quick as i can  before the steamboat goes . "
" the steamboat ? "
said the boy , " she has gone long ago .
she went by early this morning . "
" yes , " said <name> , " she went by here , but she got stopped . "
so <name> told the boy the story of their having got aground , and of his going ashore ; and of all his adventures , in fact , down to the time of his being cast upon the desert island .
the boy told him that he had better make haste ; " for , " said he , " the tide has risen a great deal already .
when the tide is at the lowest , we can go out to that island almost on bare ground . "
" but i ca n't walk back four miles , " said <name> .
" could you not <name> me in a wagon ? "
he continued .
" we have got a wagon , " said the boy , " if my father <name> let me go . "
" let us go right up and ask him , " said <name> they accordingly began to advance up the road , the boy putting his horse to a rapid trot .
<name> , who was not accustomed to riding in this style  behind another boy , and without a saddle  was much jolted , and , in fact , he found it very difficult to keep his seat .
he began to feel so much anxiety , however , about getting back again , that he did not complain .
in a short time , the boy reached the house .
it was a small , plain farm-house .
there was a shed at one side of it , with a wagon standing in the shed  the shafts resting upon a <unk> .
" my father is not at home , now , " said the boy , " but he <name> be at home very soon . "
" oh , do n't let us wait for him , " rejoined <name> .
" he 'll be willing to have you go , i know . "
" no , " said the boy , " i should not dare to go without his leave . "
" let us harness the horse into the wagon , then , at any rate , " said <name> , " and then we shall be all ready . "
" we can do that , " said the boy .
so they harnessed the horse into the wagon , and the boy led the horse around to the door .
<name> , who was quite impatient to go , got into the wagon , and sat waiting .
the man came in about twenty minutes , and when he heard a statement of the case , he said that his boy might go and take <name> back to the mill .
it was now so late that <name> began to be seriously afraid that the steamboat might have gone .
he was very impatient to have the horse go as fast as possible ; and he watched at every turn in the road which gave him a view of the river , hoping to get a glimpse at the boat .
he wondered whether forester was still at the tavern , or whether he had come out in pursuit of him .
after wearying himself with conjectures , which were all in vain , he suddenly came to a view of the river opposite the mill .
the steamboat , to his great <name> , was in its place ; but there was a black column of smoke issuing from the <unk> .
" they are firing up , " said <name> , " i verily believe . "
" what do you mean by that ? "
said the boy .
" why , building up the fires , " said <name> , " to set the engine a-going .
they call it firing up . "
just at this moment there broke forth a loud and hoarse hissing from the <unk> , and a dense column of white vapor began to ascend , which mingled its snowy volumes , in a beautiful manner , with the dark masses of the smoke .
" they are blowing off the steam , " said <name> .
" what does that mean ? "
asked the boy .
" why , that they have got the steam up , and are letting off a little of it , while they are waiting for something .
perhaps they are waiting for us .
drive on as fast as you can . "
a moment after this , the sound of the steam suddenly ceased , and the great paddle wheels , on the sides of the boat , began slowly to revolve .
" they are trying to get her off , " said <name> .
" i do <name> they can't start her .
drive on ; drive on as fast as you can . "
they were , at this time , upon the top of a hill which commanded a fine view of the river , and of the scenery upon its banks .
the mill was before them , too , in full view .
but <name> was too much engaged in watching the movements of the boat to regard the scenery .
the boy drove rapidly down the hill .
they reached the mill in a very few minutes , and drove down to the bank of the river , by a road which led to the water , a short distance above the mill .
but , in the mean time , unfortunately for <name> , the steamboat had regained its <name> , and when <name> and the boy came in view of it again , as their horse stopped at the edge of the water , they saw , to <name> 's dismay , that she was ploughing her way swiftly up the river , being just about to disappear behind a point of land which terminated the view of the water in that direction .
" they are gone , " said <name> , in a tone of despair , " they are gone ; and what shall i do ? "
" ca n't you go in the stage ? "
asked the boy , hoping thus to say a word of encouragement and consolation .
" no , " said <name> , " i do n't believe there is any stage from this old mill .
besides , i do n't know where to go .
i should not have thought that forester would have gone off and left me . "
" was he on board the steamboat ? "
asked the boy .
" yes , " said <name>  " that is , he was to go on board  but i left him at the tavern . "
" perhaps he is there now , " said the boy .
" let us go and see . "
<name> approved of this plan , and they turned the wagon , and rode towards the tavern .
as soon as the horse stopped in the yard , <name> leaped out of the wagon , and ran in .
he found forester reclining upon the sofa , where <name> had left him , asleep .
<name> advanced towards him , and took him by the shoulder , roughly , to wake him up , saying , " forester !
cousin forester !
wake up !
the boat has gone . "
forester opened his eyes  looked wildly at <name> , and then put his hands to his head , pressing his temples with the palms , but he did not speak .
" the boat has gone , cousin forester , " continued <name> .
" then what good does it do to wake me up so roughly ? "
asked forester .
" why  i  thought you 'd want to know it , " said <name> ; " but why did not you come down ? "
" because , " said forester , " you were to come and tell me , i thought , when they were ready to go . "
<name> had no reply to make to this suggestion , and he was silent .
he found , afterwards , on farther conversation with forester , that he was quite unwell .
his head ached , and his face was flushed , as if he was feverish .
<name> related to forester an account of his adventures on the raft of logs .
forester thought that he had had a very narrow escape .
<name> expected that forester would have rebuked him very sharply for his fault in going upon the logs at all .
but he did not .
after <name> had got through with his account , forester only said , " well , <name> , you evidently did wrong in getting upon the logs at all ; but the evil consequences to you <name> be punishment enough , and , in fact , more than enough . "
" evil consequences ? "
said <name>  " no ; there are no evil consequences , only that we have got left behind . "
" i do n't regard that , " said forester , " for i am too unwell to travel to-day ; but then you have suffered considerable pain and anxiety already , and , besides , there <name> be some money to pay . "
" what for ? "
said <name> .
" why , you have got to pay the boy for bringing you home , " replied forester .
" must i pay him , " said <name> , " out of my own money ? "
" who do you think ought to pay him ? "
said forester .
" why , i ought to , i suppose , " said <name> .
" but it wo n't be much .
i think a quarter of a dollar <name> be enough . "
" then , did not you say that you sent to the mill to have somebody go down after you in a boat ? "
asked forester .
" yes , " said <name> , " but i do n't think they went . "
" you had better go to the mill and see , " said forester .
so <name> went out and paid the boy a quarter of a dollar , with which he seemed to be satisfied .
then he went to the mill , and he found two men just returning , in a boat , from a long pull down the river in pursuit of him .
<name> paid them half a dollar .
thus his loss was three quarters of a dollar .
when he returned to the tavern , he found that forester had taken some medicine , and had gone to bed .
forester told him that he must amuse himself the best way he could , and that , after the experience that he had had that day , he hoped he would be careful not to put himself any more into dangerous situations .
chapter v. the benefit of the doubt .
<name> took dinner that day at the tavern alone , and , after dinner , he carried a cup of tea to forester ,  but forester was asleep , and so he did not disturb him .
in the afternoon he went out to play .
he amused himself , for half an hour , in rambling about the tavern yards and in the stables .
there was a <unk> bull in one of the yards , chained to a post , by means of a ring through his nose .
<name> looked at the bull a few minutes with great interest , and then began to look about for a long stick , or a pole , to poke him a little , through the fence , to see if he could not make him roar , when , instead of a pole , his eye fell upon a boy , who was at work , digging in a corner of a field near , behind the barn .
the boy 's name was <name> .
he was digging for worms for bait .
he was going a fishing .
<name> determined to go with him .
<name> furnished <name> with a hook and a piece of sheet lead to make a <unk> of , and <name> had some twine in his pocket already ; so that he was soon fitted with a line .
but he had no pole .
<name> said that he could cut one , on his way down to the river , as they would pass through a piece of woods which had plenty of tall and slender young trees in it .
he succeeded in getting a pole in this manner , which answered very well ; and then he and <name> went down to the river .
they stood upon a log on the shore , and caught several small fishes , but they got none of much value , for nearly half an hour .
at last , <name> , who was standing at a little distance from <name> , suddenly exclaimed : " oh , here comes a monstrous great perch .
he is coming directly towards my hook . "
" where ?
where ? "
exclaimed <name> .
and <name> immediately <name> out his hook from the place where he had been fishing , and walked along to the log on which <name> was standing .
" where is he ? "
said <name> , looking eagerly into the water .
" hush ! "
said <name> ; " do n't say a word .
there he is , swimming along towards my hook . "
" yes , " said <name> , " i see him .
now he 's turning away a little .
let me put my line in , too . "
<name> extended his pole and dropped his hook gently into the water .
he let it down until it was near the perch .
the poor fish , after loitering about a minute , gradually approached <name> 's hook and bit at it .
<name> , seeing that he was in danger of losing his fish , now called out to <name> to take his line out .
" it is not fair , " said he , " for you to come and take my fish , just as he was going to bite at my hook .
go away . "
but it was too late .
as <name> was saying these words , the fish bit , and <name> , drawing up the line , found the fish upon the end of it .
as the line came in , however , <name> reached out his hand to seize the fish , and <name> , to prevent him , dropped the pole and endeavored to seize it too .
" let go my fish , " said <name> .
" let alone my line , " said <name> .
neither would let go .
a struggle ensued , and <name> and <name> , in the midst of it , fell off into the water .
the water was not very deep , and they soon clambered up upon the log again , but the fish , which had been pulled off the line in the contention , fell into the water , and swam swiftly away into the deep and dark parts of the water , and was seen no more .
he was saved by the quarrels of his enemies .
<name> , who was not so much accustomed to a wetting as <name> was , became very angry , and immediately set off to go home to the tavern .
<name> coolly resumed his position on the log , and went to fishing again , paying no heed to <name> 's expressions of resentment .
<name> walked along , very uncomfortable both in body and mind .
his clothes were wet and muddy , and the water in his shoes made a chuckling sound at every step , until he stopped and took his shoes off , and poured the water out .
it was nearly sunset when he reached the tavern .
he found forester better .
he had left his bed , and had come down into the parlor .
he was reclining on the sofa , reading a book , when <name> came in .
<name> advanced towards him , and began to make bitter complaints against <name> .
in giving an account of the affair , he omitted all that part of the transaction which made against himself .
he said nothing , for instance , about his coming to put his line in where <name> was fishing , and while a fish was actually near <name> 's hook , but only said that he caught a fish , and that <name> came and took it away .
" but what claim had <name> to the fish ? "
asked forester .
" he had no claim at all , " said <name> .
" you mean , he had no right at all , " said forester .
" yes , " said <name> .
" he had a claim , certainly , " rejoined forester ; " that is , he claimed the fish .
he pretended that it was his .
now , on what was this claim or pretence founded ? "
" i do n't know , " said <name> , " i am sure .
i only know he had no right to it , for i caught the fish myself , and he was going to take it away . "
forester paused a moment , and then resumed : " i do n't think that you have given me a full and fair account of the transaction ; for i can not believe that <name> would have come and taken away the fish without any pretext whatever .
you must have omitted some important part of the account , i think . "
<name> then told forester that <name> said that the fish was just going to bite at his hook ; and , after several other questions from forester , he gradually acknowledged the whole truth .
still , he maintained that it was his fish .
he had a right to put in his line , he said , wherever he pleased , whether another boy was fishing or not ; the fish belonged to the one who caught him ; and , before he was caught , he did not belong to anybody .
it was absurd , he maintained , to suppose that the fish became <name> 's , just because he was swimming near his hook .
" sometimes one can judge better of a case , " said forester , " by reversing the condition of the parties .
suppose that you had been fishing , and a large fish had come swimming about your hook , and that <name> had then come to put his hook in at the same place , should you have thought it right ? "
" why , i do n't know , " said <name> .
" it is doubtful .
now , it is an excellent rule , " continued forester , " in all questions of right between ourselves and other persons , for us to give them the benefit of the doubt . "
" what does that mean ? "
asked <name> .
" why , if a man is tried in a court for any crime , " replied forester , " if it is clearly proved that he is innocent , of course he goes free .
if it is clearly proved that he is guilty , he is convicted .
but if neither the one nor the other can be proved , that is , if it is doubtful whether he is innocent or guilty , they give him the benefit of the doubt , as they term it , and let him go free . "
" i should think that , when it is doubtful , " said <name> , " they ought to send him back to prison again till they can find out certainly . "
" no , " said forester , " the jury are directed to acquit him , unless it is positively proved that he is guilty .
so that , if they think it is doubtful , they give him the benefit of the doubt , and let him go free .
now , in all questions of property between ourselves and others , we should all be willing to give to others the benefit of the doubt , and then the disputes would be very easily settled , or rather , disputes would never arise .
in this case , for instance , it is doubtful whether you had a right to come and interfere while the fish was near his hook ; it is doubtful whether he did or did not have a sort of right to try to catch the fish , without your interfering ; and you ought to have been willing to have given him the benefit of the doubt , and so have staid away , or have given up the fish to him after you had caught it . "
" but i do n't see , " said <name> , " why he should not have been willing to have given me the benefit of the doubt , as well as i to have given it to him . "
" certainly , " said forester ; " <name> ought to have considered that there was a doubt whether he was entitled to the fish or not , and to have been willing to have given you the benefit of the doubt ; and so have let you kept the fish .
each , in such a case , ought to be willing to give up to the other . "
" and then which of us should have it ? "
asked <name> .
" why , it generally happens , " said forester , in reply , " that only one of the parties adopts this principle , and so he yields to the other ; but if both adopt it , then there is sometimes a little discussion , each insisting on giving up to the other .
but such a dispute is a friendly dispute , not a hostile one , and it is very easily settled . "
" a friendly dispute ! "
exclaimed <name> ; " i never heard of such a thing . "
" yes , " said forester .
" suppose , for instance , that , when you had caught your fish , you had said , 'there , <name> , that fish is yours ; he was coming up to your hook , and would have bitten at it if i had not put my line in ; ' and , then , if <name> had said , 'no , it is not mine ; it is yours , for you caught it with your hook ; ' this would have been a friendly dispute .
it would have been very easily settled . "
" i am sorry that i left my pole down at the river , " said <name> .
" i cut a most excellent pole in the woods , on my way down , and i left it there across the log .
i mean to go down and get it early in the morning . "
" no , " said forester ; " we must be on our way up the river early to-morrow morning . "
" how shall we go ? "
asked <name> .
" i have engaged a wagon here to take us to bath , and there we shall find a stage . "
accordingly , early the next morning , forester and <name> got into a wagon to go up the river to bath , which is the first town of any considerable consequence which you meet in ascending the <unk> river .
<name> and forester sat on the seat of the wagon , and a boy , who was going with them for the purpose of bringing the wagon back , sat behind , on a box , which had been put in to make a seat for him .
<name> said that he was very sorry that he had not time to go and get his <unk> .
" it would not do any good , " said forester , " for you could not <name> it . "
" why , yes , " said <name> , " we might put it on the bottom of the wagon , and let the end run out behind .
it is pretty long . "
" true , " said forester , " we might possibly get it to bath , but what should we do with it then ? "
" why , then , " said <name> , " we might put it on the top of the stage , i suppose .
would not they let us ? "
" it would not be very convenient to <name> a long <unk> , in that way , to quebec , " replied forester , " through woods , too , half of the way , full of such poles .
you might stop and get a cane or staff , if we find a place where there are some good ones .
a cane would be of some service to you in walking up the hills , and that could be taken along with our baggage easily . "
<name> said that he should like this plan very much ; and , as they rode along , they looked out carefully for a place where there were slender saplings growing , suitable for canes .
" what kind of wood would you have ? "
asked forester .
" i do n't know , " replied <name> ; " which kind is the best ? "
" the different woods have different qualities , " replied forester .
" some are light and soft , which are good qualities for certain purposes .
some are hard .
some are stiff , and some flexible .
some are brittle , and others tough .
for a cane , now , do we want a hard wood or a soft one ? "
" hard , " said <name> .
" why ? "
asked forester .
" oh , so that it shall not get indented or bruised easily , " replied <name> .
" a light wood or a heavy one ? "
asked forester .
" light , " replied <name> , " so that it <name> be easy to <name> . "
" stiff or flexible ? "
asked forester .
" stiff , " replied <name> .
" yes , " said forester .
" some kinds of wood grow straight , and others crooked . "
" we want it straight , " said <name> .
" yes , " replied forester .
" the pine grows very straight .
if we could find some young pines , they would make us some <unk> canes . "
" and how is it with the other qualities ? "
asked <name> .
" pine is very light , " said forester .
" that is good , " said <name> .
" and soft , " said forester .
" that is not so well , " said <name> .
" and it is very weak and brittle . "
" then it <name> not do at all , " said <name> .
" i want a good strong cane . "
just at this time , they were ascending a hill , and , after passing over the summit of it , they came to a place where forester said he saw , in the woods , a number of young oaks and <unk> , which , he said , would make good canes .
the oak , he said , was very strong , and hard , and tough ; so was the beech .
" only there are two objections to them for canes , " said forester , as they were getting out of the wagon ; " they are not so light as the pine , and then , besides , they are apt to grow crooked .
we must look about carefully to find some that are straight . "
" which is the most valuable of all the kinds of wood ? "
asked <name> .
" the question is <unk> , " said forester .
" what do you mean by that ? "
asked <name> .
" i mean , that it has two <unk> , " replied forester ; " that is , the word valuable has two <unk> .
pine is the most valuable in one sense ; that is , pine is , on the whole , most useful to mankind .
but there are other kinds of wood which are far more costly . "
" i should not think that pine would be so valuable , " said <name> , " it is so weak and brittle . "
" it is valuable , " said forester , " because , for the purpose for which men want the greatest quantities of wood , strength is not required .
for boarding the <unk> of buildings , for example , and finishing them within , which uses , perhaps , consume more wood than all others put together , no great strength is required . "
" i think people want more wood to burn than to build houses with , " said <name> .
" yes , " said forester , " perhaps they do .
they do in this country , i think , but perhaps not in europe and other old countries .
but pine , although it has no great strength , is an excellent wood for building , it is so soft and easily worked . "
forester 's remarks , upon the different kinds of wood , were here interrupted by <name> 's finding what he considered an excellent stick for a cane .
when he had cut it , however , he found that it was not so straight as it had appeared to be while growing .
however , after some time spent in the selection , <name> and forester both procured excellent canes .
" this is good , hard wood , " said <name> , as he was trimming his cane , and cutting it to a proper length .
[ illustration ] " yes , " said forester ; " it is beech , and beech is very hard . "
after finishing their canes , they took their seats in the wagon again .
chapter <name> .
<name> and pine .
after riding along a short distance in silence , <name> introduced the subject of the different woods once more .
he asked forester which was the most costly of all the woods .
" costly is not an <unk> term , " said forester ; " that means , which has the greatest money value . "
" yes , " said <name> .
" i suppose it is mahogany . "
" o no , " said forester .
" rose wood , then , " said <name> .
" it must be rose wood .
my mother has a beautiful piano made of rose wood . "
" no , " said forester .
" <name> is more costly than either rose wood or mahogany .
they sell <name> by the pound . "
" where does <name> come from ? "
asked <name> .
" i do n't know , " replied forester .
" i should like to know , " said <name> .
" how much do they sell it for , by the pound ? "
" i do n't know that , either , " said forester .
" i know very little about it , only that it is a very costly wood , on account of some peculiar properties which it has , and its scarcity . "
" what are the peculiar properties ? "
asked <name> .
" one is , its great hardness , " said forester .
" it is very hard indeed .
another is , its color . "
" what color is it ? "
asked <name> .
" black , " replied forester ,  " black as jet ; at least , one kind is black as jet .
there is a kind which is brown .
it is called brown <name> . "
" i do n't think black is very pretty , " said <name> .
" no , " said forester ; " there does not seem to be much beauty in black , in itself considered ; but then , for certain purposes , it is much handsomer than any other color would be ; for a cane , for instance . "
<name> looked at the beech cane which he had before him , and began to consider how it would look if it were black .
" i suppose i could paint my cane black , " said he , after a moment's pause , " if you think it would be any better . "
" no , " said forester ; " i should prefer having it of its natural color .
the bark of the beech has beautiful colors , if they are only brought out by a coat of varnish . "
" brought out ? "
repeated <name> .
" yes , " said forester .
" there is a kind of fine dust , or something like that , which <unk> the bark ; but , when you put on oil or varnish , there is a sort of transparency given to the outside coating , which brings the natural color of the bark fully to view . "
" then i <name> get my cane varnished , when i get to bath , " said <name> .
" <name> , " said forester , " is used a great deal where a contrast with <name> is wanted .
<name> is hard and fine-grained , like <name> , and it takes a high polish .
so , whenever they want a contrast of black and white , they take <name> and <name> . "
" when do they want a contrast between black and white ? "
" one case , " replied forester , " is that of the keys of a piano <unk> .
they want the short keys , which <name> the <unk> , of a different color from the others , so that the eye <name> catch them as quick as possible .
so in a <unk> .
they sometimes make <unk> with alternate squares of <name> and <name> . "
" i think it would be just as well to take common wood and paint it black , " said <name> , " rather than pay so much money for <name> . "
" no , " said forester , " that would not do so well .
the paint would wear off ; or , if it did not wear off by handling , still , if it got a little knock or hard rub , a part would come off , and that would show a little spot which would be of the natural color of the wood .
this would look very badly . "
" then , besides , painted wood , " continued forester , " can not be finished off so smoothly , and polished up so highly , as a wood which is black by nature .
they have a way of <unk> wood , however , which is better than painting it . "
" how is that done ? "
asked <name> .
" why , they make a black stain , " said forester , " which they put upon the wood .
this <unk> <unk> in a little way , and <unk> the fibres of the wood itself , beneath the surface .
this , of course , <name> not wear off as easily as paint . "
" i should not think it would wear off at all , " said <name> .
" yes , " replied forester , " for , if a cane is made of any wood stained black , after a time the wood itself wears away farther than the <unk> had penetrated .
then the fresh wood <name> come to view .
so that , if you want anything black , it is much better to make it of a wood which is black all the way through .
" besides , " continued forester , " <name> is a very hard wood , and it <name> bear knocks and rough usages much better than other kinds of wood which are softer .
once i made a carpenter an <name> wedge , to split his <unk> with . "
" what are <unk> ? "
asked <name> .
" <unk> are the thin split boards which are nailed upon the sides of a room before the <unk> is put on .
sometimes <unk> are made very narrow , and are nailed on at a little distance from each other , so as to leave a crack between them .
then the <unk> , being soft when it is put on , works into the cracks , and thus clings to the wood when it is dry and hard .
if <unk> was put on to smooth boards , or a smooth wall , it would all fall off again very easily . "
" yes , " said <name> ; " i have seen the <unk> coming up through the cracks in the <name> at your house in vermont . "
" the lath boards , " continued forester , " are sometimes made narrow , and nailed on at a little distance from each other , and sometimes they are wide boards , split up , but not taken apart , and then the cracks , which are made in splitting them , are forced open when the boards are nailed on .
the way they do it , is this .
they put the wide lath board down upon a plank , and make a great many cracks in it with an axe .
then they put it upon the wall , or ceiling , and nail one edge .
then they take a wedge and drive into one of the cracks , and force it open far enough to let the <unk> in .
then they put in some more nails , in such a manner as to keep that crack open .
then they wedge open another crack , and nail again ; and so on , until they have nailed on the whole board , so as to leave the cracks all open . "
" and you made the carpenter an <name> wedge ? "
said <name> .
" yes , " said forester .
" he had had wedges made of the hardest wood that he could get , but they would soon become bruised , and battered , and worn out , with their hard rubbing against the sides of the cracks .
at last , i told him i had a very hard kind of wood , and i gave him a piece of <name> .
he made it into a wedge , and , after that , he had no more difficulty .
he said his <name> wedge was just like iron . "
" was it really as hard as iron ? "
asked <name> .
" oh , no , " said forester ,  " but it was much harder than any wood which he could get .
he thought it was a very curious wood .
he had never seen any like it before . "
" i should like some <name> , " said <name> .
" <name> would be an excellent wood to make a top of , " said forester , " it is so hard and heavy . "
" i should like to have a top hard , " said <name> , " but i do n't think it would be any better for being heavy . "
" yes , " said forester ; " the top would spin longer .
the heavier a top is , the longer it <name> spin . "
" then i should like a top made of lead , " said <name> .
" it would spin very long , " said forester , " if it was well made , though it would require more strength to set it a-going well .
but lead would be soft , and thus would easily get bruised and indented .
besides , black would be a prettier color for a top than lead color .
a jet black top , well polished , would be very handsome . "
" is black a color ? "
asked <name> .
" i read in a book once that black and white were not colors . "
" there are two meanings to the word color , " said forester .
" in one sense , black is a color , and in another sense , it is not .
for instance , if a <name> were to go into a shop , and ask for some morocco shoes for a little child , and they were to show her some black ones , she might say she did not want black ones ; she wanted colored ones .
in that sense , black would not be a color .
" on the other hand , " continued forester , " she might ask for silk stockings , and if the shopkeeper were to ask her what color she wanted , she might say black .
in that sense , black would be a color . "
" which is the right sense ? "
asked <name> .
" both are right , " said forester .
" when a word is commonly used in two senses , both are correct .
the philosophers generally consider black not to be a color ; that is , they generally use the word in the first sense . "
" why ? "
asked <name> .
" for this reason , " replied forester .
he was going on to explain the reason , when suddenly <name> 's attention was attracted by the sight of a long raft of logs , which was coming down the river .
they had been riding at some distance from the river , and out of sight of it , but now it came suddenly into view , just as this raft was passing by .
there were two men on the raft .
" see those men on the raft , " said <name> .
" they are paddling . "
" no , " replied forester ; " they are <unk> . "
" <unk> ? "
repeated <name> .
" yes , " replied forester .
" they always <unk> a raft .
it is a different motion from paddling . "
<name> watched the men attentively , examining the motion which they made in <unk> , and considering whether he might not have <unk> his raft to the shore in the same manner .
[ illustration ] " what straight logs ! "
said <name> .
" yes , " replied forester ; " the pine tree grows up tall and straight , and without branches , to a great height .
this is the source of some of its most valuable properties .
it makes the wood <unk> .
that is , the fibres run smooth and regularly , from one end of the stem to the other . "
just at this time , forester saw a large pine tree growing alone , by the side of the road they were travelling .
this solitary tree had a great many branches growing out from the stem , in every part , from the top to the bottom .
" that is because the tree grows by itself , " said forester , " in the open field .
those that grow in the forest do not throw out branches from the stem , but they ran up to a great height , with only a little tuft of branches on the top . "
" i do n't see why they do n't have branches in the woods , " said <name> .
" because , " replied forester , " where trees grow close together , the light and the air is excluded from the lower parts of the stems , and so branches can not grow there .
nothing can grow without light and air . "
" i 've seen monstrous long potato sprouts grow in a dark cellar , " said <name> .
" yes , " said forester ; " so have i. i did not think of that .
but they do n't grow very well . "
" they grow pretty long , sometimes , " replied <name> .
" at any rate , " said forester , " the branches of trees <name> not grow from the stems of the trees near the ground , in the woods ; and this is of great importance , for , whenever a branch grows out , it makes a knot , extending in to the very centre of the tree .
this would injure a pine log very much , as the knot would show in all the boards , and a knot is a great injury to a pine board , though it is of great benefit to a mahogany one . "
" why ? "
asked <name> .
" because it gives the wood a beautiful variegated appearance when they get it smoothed .
so that the more knotted and gnarled a log of mahogany is , the better .
it makes the more beautiful wood .
but in pine , it is not beauty , but facility of working , which is the great object .
so they always want to get pine as smooth and <unk> as possible .
so that one of these trees that grow detached , in the fields , would not be of much value for lumber .
it has so many branches , that the boards made from it would be full of knots . "
" that is the reason , i suppose , " said <name> , " why they do n't cut them down , and make them into boards . "
" perhaps it is , " replied forester .
" has pine any other very good qualities ? "
asked <name> .
" i believe it is quite a <unk> wood , " said forester .
" at any rate , the stumps last a very long time in the ground .
i have heard it said that there are some stumps in the state of maine with the old <name> of g. r. upon them . "
" what does g. r .
mean ? "
asked <name> .
" <unk> <name> , " replied forester ,  " that is , <name> , the king .
if there are any such , the <name> on them means that they belonged to the king of england , before this country was separated from england .
in those days , the king 's workmen went into the forests to select and <name> the trees which were to be cut down for the king 's use , and these marks were left upon the stumps . "
" and how long ago was that ? "
asked <name> .
" o , it must have been sixty or seventy years ago .
but i can hardly believe that the stumps would last as long as that . "
" i mean to ask some of the men , when i get up in the woods , how long the stumps do last , " said <name> .
" they last very long , i know , " said forester .
" the people , after getting tired of waiting to have them rot out , tear them up with machines , and make fences of them . "
" i do n't see how they can make fences of stumps , " said <name> .
" they put them in a row , with the roots in the air , " replied forester .
" they make a <unk> fence . "
just at this time <name> perceived a large town coming into view before them , which , forester told him , was bath .
there were several ships building along the shore of the river .
[ illustration ] chapter vii .
the bear in the mill .
<name> and forester found a small steamboat at bath , going up the river , and they took passage in it to hallowell .
at hallowell , they took the stage , and travelled along the banks of the river , sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other .
they crossed the river by means of bridges , which were erected in nearly all the principal towns .
they passed a number of waterfalls , where <unk> had been built for sawing the logs .
<name> was astonished at the number of these mills , the quantity of logs which lay in the booms , and the vast piles of boards which had accumulated in some of the sawing villages .
at one of these villages , where he and forester stopped to spend the night , they went out in the evening to see the mills .
the mills were lighted by little fires of <unk> knots , which made a bright flame and gave a fine light .
these little fires were built upon slabs , which <name> thought was very dangerous .
the slabs , however , though they looked dry , were really very wet , being thoroughly soaked with water within , having been sawed from logs which had been for a long time floating in the river .
the beam , to which the saw was attached in each mill , as it ascended and descended with the saw , passed across these lights with a rapid motion , which made the lights appear and disappear , in regular succession , in a very beautiful manner .
forester and <name> clambered into one of these mills .
they had to make their way over slabs , boards and heaps of rubbish of various kinds , and the floor of the mill seemed to be made of boards and planks , laid loosely and with many open places , in which , when <name> looked down , he saw dark and frightful abysses , where he could hear the water dashing , and , now and then , could get a glimpse of the foam .
of course , both forester and <name> advanced very carefully .
when they had entered , they found but one man tending the mill .
he was seated on a square block of wood , near the fire , eating some bread and cheese .
as forester and <name> advanced towards him , he looked up and bade them good evening .
" <name> you allow us to come in and see the mill ? "
said forester .
" by all means , " said the millman .
the millman here looked around at the log which he was then sawing , and he observed that it was time for him to attend to it .
so he put down his bread and cheese upon the block , and went towards the saw .
forester and <name> both turned to see what he was going to do .
the log was lying upon a long frame , which frame seemed to be mounted upon some sort of trucks , for it advanced slowly , by a steady motion , against the saw .
as the saw was constantly moving up and down with great force , the log was sawed as it advanced .
it had now advanced so far that the log had been sawed nearly through , from end to end .
when it had gone a little farther , the millman pulled a handle , and stopped the motion of the carriage and the log , and , in a moment afterwards , the log began to go back again ; the saw , all the time , ascending and descending as before , but without doing any work .
when the log had got back so far that the saw came out of the cleft which it had made , the man stopped it , and then , with an iron bar , he shifted the position of the log in such a manner that when the carriage should be put in motion , the saw would cut the log in a new place , at a little distance from the other ,  a distance just equal to the thickness of the board which they wished to make .
<name> watched all these movements with great interest .
forester , who had often seen them before , went back to the fire , and held his hands out to it , for , as it was a cold evening , the feeling of the warmth was pleasant .
he could see that <name> remained talking with the millman ; but the noise of the machinery was so great that he could not hear what they said .
the flashes of light from the fire illuminated <name> 's face , however , and forester could see that he was much interested in what the millman was telling him .
the millman sat down upon the log , and made gestures as if he was eating something .
then he took hold of <name> , and put him down upon the log in his place , and he took a seat himself beyond him  that is , between <name> and the saw .
all this time , the log , riding upon the great frame , was slowly advancing against the saw , carrying <name> and the millman along with it .
when it had carried them so far that the millman was getting to be very near the saw , he turned suddenly round , and made a gesture as if he was going to clasp the saw in his arms ,  laughing as he did it ,  and , immediately afterwards , he got up from the log , and <name> got up , too ,  beginning to laugh himself , also , though his countenance had expressed surprise and anxiety before .
a short time after this , when <name> came back to the place where forester was , forester asked him what the millman had been saying to him .
" he was telling me a story of a bear , " said <name> .
" of a bear ? "
said forester .
" yes , " said <name> , " of a bear in a <unk> . "
" i do n't see what a bear had to do in a <unk> , " replied forester .
" it was a great many years ago , when there were bears in the woods about here .
there was a man sawing in a mill , and he was sitting on the end of the log that he was sawing , eating his bread and cheese .
the bread and cheese were lying on the log , next to where the man was sitting .
" while the man was sitting there in this manner , eating his bread and cheese , a bear came walking into the mill ,  a great black bear .
he came up to the log , and when he saw that the man was eating bread and cheese , he thought he should like some too .
so he sat down on the log . "
" on which side of the man ? "
asked forester ,  " towards the saw or from it ? "
[ illustration ] " towards the saw , " said <name> .
" the man was on the end of the log farthest from the saw .
the bear sat a little beyond him , nearer to the saw , and the bread and cheese was between them .
the bear began to eat the bread and cheese . "
" how ? "
asked forester .
" why , he took it up in his paws , i suppose , " said <name> ,  " though i do n't know certainly about that .
at any rate , he began to eat the bread and cheese ,  sitting with his back towards the saw , and his face towards the man .
" and all this time , you must understand , " said <name> , " that the carriage was carrying the log , man , bear , and all , towards the saw , and the man saw that if the bear would only keep still , in his place , until he was carried to the saw , he would get sawed in two , and so killed .
at first , he thought it would be best for him to get hold of the iron bar , if he could , and beat the old bear 's brains out .
but he was afraid that he should not succeed in doing that , and so he concluded to wait and see what would happen .
" now , bears have a way , " continued <name> , " whenever they are angry with anything , of grasping it in their arms and hugging it tight .
the man did not think of this ; he only hoped that the saw would saw the bear in two .
the log moved on nearer and nearer , and at last brought the bear along so far that the next stroke cut right down his back .
he immediately turned around and seized the saw , and hugged it with all his strength , and it tore him all to pieces . "
" indeed , " said forester .
" that is quite a story . "
forester did not seem so much astonished at this account as <name> had expected , but farther conversation on the subject was prevented by the occurring of a new object of attention .
the millman began to make arrangements for drawing up more logs from the water of the river , by means of a long chain passing around a revolving axis , in the manner which has been already explained .
<name> watched the first log , as it came slowly up , and then he wanted to go down the inclined plane to the water below .
the moon was just rising , which gave them sufficient light , and so forester and <name> went down .
<name> wanted to ride up on the next log , but forester thought that that would be a very dangerous experiment .
there was , however , a boat lying there , which , forester said , perhaps they might get into , and take a little excursion upon the water , by moonlight .
<name> thought that he should like that very well , and so he went up into the mill again , to ask permission to take the boat .
the millman said that they might have the boat all night , if they wanted it .
<name> accordingly returned down the inclined plane , telling forester that they could have the boat .
but forester , who began to find the evening air too cold and chilly , said that he did not think it was worth while for them to set out on a voyage at so late an hour .
but <unk> imagination was so much taken with the idea of a voyage in a boat by moonlight , that he was very urgent to have forester go .
so forester consented , and they both got into the boat .
" which way shall we steer ? "
asked <name> .
" we must go up the stream , " said forester .
" why must we ? "
asked <name> .
" because there is a dam and a waterfall below us , " replied forester .
there was a dam across the river , at the mill , and the inclined plane , which led from the floor of the mill down to the shore of the river , terminated at the edge of the water just above the dam .
the water was so low that it did not fall over the dam near the shore , though forester and <name> could hear the roaring of the water , which fell over the dam nearer the middle of the river .
" we must take care , " said <name> , " or we shall get carried over the dam .
i read of an indian once , who was carried over the falls of niagara . "
" yes , " said forester ; " we must be careful . "
forester turned the head of the boat up the river , keeping near the shore , so as to avoid all possibility of being carried over the dam .
the boat shot along swiftly through the water .
" the boat goes very well , " said <name> .
" yes , " replied forester ; " and yet it is only a log canoe . "
" a log canoe , " said <name> .
" is this only a log canoe ? "
" that is all , " replied forester .
" it is made of a log , hollowed out .
they use a great many such boats on this river .
they go very easily with paddles . "
forester and <name> both had paddles .
<name> sat about in the middle of the boat , but forester sat in the stern , propelling the boat and steering it at the same time .
when they got up a little way above the dam , they went out farther towards the middle of the river .
forester soon became warm by the exercise of paddling , and had no disposition to return .
they both found it very romantic and delightful to glide smoothly over the glassy surface of the water , which was silvered by the <unk> .
they soon came to a turn in the river , which carried them away from the sight of the mills and the dam , and brought them under high banks , which , in some places , presented <name> cliffs to the view , and , in others , were covered with forests .
this scenery had a peculiarly sombre and solemn expression , seen thus , under the light of the moon .
<name> gazed at it in silence , and with a feeling of awe .
they went on in this manner for half an hour , until they found themselves approaching a <name> island , crowned with forests .
<name> wanted to land upon it .
" very well , " said forester ; " i have no objection ; but would you not rather go back ? "
" no , " said <name> .
" i want to explore this island . "
" but are you not cold ? "
asked forester .
" no , " said <name> , " not at all . "
" my hands and feet are a little cold , " said forester .
" then we <name> go back pretty soon , " said <name> , " but first just let us land a minute upon this island . "
so forester turned the head of the boat towards the shore , and <name> , as soon as it touched , scrambled out upon the rocks .
" oh , forester ! "
he exclaimed , at once , " here is plenty of drift-wood .
let us make a fire , and warm your hands and feet . "
" drift-wood ? "
rejoined forester .
" <name> drift-wood make a fire ? "
" why not ? "
asked <name> .
" i should think it would be too wet , " replied forester .
<name> said no more , but , at that instant , forester observed a little flash , and then a faint glimmer of light where <name> was .
he had lighted a match by rubbing it against some drift-wood .
he touched it to some dry bark , and soon had a pleasant little blaze upon the rocks , near the shore .
he piled on pieces of drift-wood , such as branches of trees , old slabs , & c. , which he found lying about there , and he soon had a very good fire .
forester sat down upon the rocks , and warmed his hands and feet .
" i wish i had a hatchet here , " said <name> , " or an axe . "
" why ? "
asked forester .
" why , we could make a camp , and lie here all night , " said <name> .
" o , no , " said forester .
" yes , " said <name> , " for the man said we might have his boat all night . "
" no , " replied forester .
" we <name> camp out when we get fairly into the forests on dead river . "
accordingly , after a little time , when the fire had burnt down somewhat , they threw the brands into the river , and then , embarking in their boat , they returned to the mill .
chapter viii .
the <unk> .
<name> and forester had an opportunity to encamp for the night , in the woods , in a manner different from what they expected .
it happened in this way .
in the course of their rambles among the forests which are about the lakes and the upper branches of the <unk> , they came , one night , to a farm-house , where they had to spend the night .
the house was built of logs .
it was in a small opening in the woods .
this opening was occupied with fields , which were divided from each other by log fences .
the fields were full of stumps .
the whole opening was bordered on every side by a perpendicular wall of forest ,  the tall stems forming a <unk> , which reminded <name> of the <unk> on the north river , just above new york .
there was but one room in this log house , and , at first , <name> did not know where he and forester were to sleep .
there was a great blazing fire in the fire-place , which was made of rough stones .
the hearth was made of great flat stones .
these stones were tolerably smooth on the upper side ; but , as they were not square , there were many spaces left between them , and at the corners , which were filled with earth .
but , though the fire-place was rough , the great fire blazed merrily in it ; and <name> thought that it was pleasanter than his father 's marble fire-place , in new york , with a grate in it , filled with a hard coal fire , looking like red-hot stones .
" i wish we had such a fire-place as this in new york , " said <name> .
" and wood to burn in it , " replied forester .
" o , we can get wood enough in new york , " said <name> .
" the <name> bring it along every morning .
we might have such a fire-place down in the basement , or in that little room in the stable , and then i would go and build fires in it . "
just then , the farmer 's wife came with a spider to the fire , to broil some chickens for their supper .
she pulled out the coals with a long-handled iron shovel , which she called a slice .
she cooked the young travellers a most excellent supper .
the farmer and his wife were both rather young .
they had one child .
he was asleep in the cradle .
this cradle was only a box , made of boards , and mounted on <unk> .
<name> asked the farmer if he made the cradle himself , and he said he did .
there was a boy living in this house , named <name> .
<name> was the farmer 's brother .
he worked hard all day on the farm , and at night he slept in a sort of <name> , which they called the loft .
the way to get up to the loft was by a ladder on one side of the room .
when <unk> came , forester and <name> climbed up this ladder , and went to bed .
they slept upon a straw bed , which was lying in a corner .
they had two clean but very coarse sheets , and a good warm <unk> .
<name> crept in well under the eaves of the house , but forester slept on the outer side of the bed , where the roof was higher .
<name> was <unk> in the night by a strange sound , which he heard , directly over his head .
he lifted up his head and listened .
it was the pattering of rain upon the roof .
the roof was , however , very tight , and none of the rain came in .
the roof was covered with shingles , which the farmer had made himself , in a little shop near his house .
<name> listened to the rain a few minutes , and then went to sleep again .
he was glad to hear it rain , because he wanted to stay at this house the next day , and he thought forester would not go away in the rain .
the next that he knew was that it was morning .
he spoke to forester , saying , " it rains , cousin forester . "
" does it ? "
said forester .
" then i do n't know what we shall do . "
" we must stay here , to-day , " said <name> .
" then i can see <name> make a shingle .
<name> can make a shingle .
did you know it ? "
" i do n't hear it rain , " said forester .
" i mean to get up and see , " said <name> .
there was no glass window in this <name> , but the light shone through the chinks between the logs .
there was a wooden window , as <name> called it ; that is , there was an opening in the wall , with a wooden shutter to close it .
<name> went to this window and opened it .
he looked out upon the wild and solitary scene which was before him with great interest .
at length he said , " no , cousin forester , it does not rain ,  but i wish you would stay here to-day . "
" very well , " said forester .
" i <name> stay here as long as you wish . "
<name> was rejoiced to hear this ; and he spent two hours , after breakfast , in rambling about the farmer 's house and grounds .
he went into the little shop , and amused himself for half an hour in seeing <name> make shingles .
<name> let him try to make one himself , and he succeeded pretty well .
he carried his shingle in to forester to show it to him .
forester said he thought it was a very good shingle .
" i should like to <name> it home , " said <name> ; " but i suppose you would think that that would be a foolish plan . "
" no , " said forester , " i do not think it would be foolish .
the shingle is flat , and <name> lie down in the bottom of your trunk ; and , after you get tired of it as a shingle , you can have a little box made of it , and keep it all your life , as a memorial of this expedition . "
this was a very good plan , for <name> had not shaved his shingle very thin .
in fact , it was of about equal thickness at the two ends .
this , though a very serious fault in a shingle , made it much more suitable as a material for making a box of .
<name> also amused himself for half an hour in going down to the spring , where the farmer 's wife went to get water , and playing there .
there was a pleasant little path leading from the house down to the spring .
he went down once alone , and brought up a pail half full of water , for the farmer 's wife , which seemed to please her very much .
while he was doing these things , forester remained in the house , writing letters .
before forester had finished his last letter , however , <name> had got tired of all his amusements , and began to think that they had better resume their journey .
" very well , " said forester ; " whenever you say the word . "
" how are you going ? "
asked <name> .
" i have made a bargain with the farmer , " said forester , " to let us have his wagon to go through the woods about twenty-five miles , and <name> is going with us , in order to drive the wagon back . "
<name> was much pleased with this arrangement , and forester asked him what time they should start .
" we are under your direction , you know , " said he .
" yes , " said <name> , " and i wish you would let me have the direction all day . "
" i have a great mind to do it , " said forester .
" do , " said <name> , " and see how well i 'll manage . "
" well , " said forester ; " i <name> give up the command to you till i resume it again . "
<name> was quite pleased with his new powers .
he said they must take a hatchet and a bag of provisions , for he meant to dine in the woods on the way .
<name> accordingly put a hatchet in the wagon .
they also took some bread and cheese , and some other articles of food , in a bag ; and also a tin dipper , to drink from .
when all was ready , <name> called forester , and they set off .
their trunk was put into the wagon behind .
they went on very well for ten miles .
the road led through thick forests for a large part of the way , and it was very stony and rough .
but the wilderness , and even the difficulties of the way , interested <name> very much .
he thought that it was much pleasanter travelling through those forest scenes , the wheels of the wagon sometimes jolting over roots , stones , logs , and sometimes sinking in the mire , than riding in a carriage , as he had often done with his mother , over the smooth and broad avenues leading into new york .
after they had gone about ten miles , they were brought to a sudden stop by a tree , which had been blown down , and had fallen directly across the road .
" what is to be done now ? "
said <name> .
nobody answered .
" what is to be done now , cousin forester ? "
repeated <name> .
" i do n't know , " said forester .
" i've nothing to do with it .
you are commander . "
" oh , very well , " said <name> .
" then i 'll decide what to do .
we 'll chop the tree off with our hatchet . "
<name> bustled about with an air of great importance , taking the hatchet from the back of the wagon , and advancing towards the tree , as if he expected to <unk> it at a single blow .
he looked towards <name> , and , seeing a lurking smile upon his countenance , he immediately perceived how absurd was the idea of chopping off such an enormous stem with a hatchet .
he accordingly turned suddenly about , saying , " no ; we ca n't cut it off with the hatchet .
it is too big ; or , rather , the hatchet is too little .
we 'll see if we ca n't find a way to get around it . "
so <name> asked forester to look on one side of the road , while he and <name> examined the other side .
they found that , by cutting down one or two small trees , they could get around very well .
so <name> directed to have these trees cut down , and then they led the horse around without much difficulty , excepting a slight obstruction from the bushes .
<name> was quite pleased with the successful result of his management in this first serious emergency .
they rode on five miles farther , and then <name> determined that it would be a good plan to look out for a place for their dinner .
he chose a place in a pleasant <name> , overshadowed by tall pines and hemlocks , and watered by a <name> which <unk> through the middle of it .
<name> directed <name> to drive the horse out to one side of the road , at a place where there was a pretty broad and level spot , which seemed to <name> a convenient place for the horse to stand .
<name> told forester that he and <name> might go and employ themselves in finding a good spot for them to make a fire , and in collecting some dry wood , while he fastened the horse .
<name> accordingly took the axe , and <name> was to bring the bag of provisions .
<name> <name> the horse out of the road , and brought his head up near to the stem of a little tree , which was growing there .
he then took out the bag , and made his way through the bushes , in the direction in which forester and <name> had gone , down a little cow path , which descended to the bank of the <name> .
he found forester and <name> very readily .
forester was seated upon a flat stone near the water , and <name> was gathering dry sticks for a fire .
it was a warm and pleasant day , and they wanted a fire , not so much for its warmth , as for the cheerful and pleasant aspect it gave to the place .
there was a gentle breeze blowing that day in the open ground .
this breeze was not felt among the trees , but it caused a gentle draft of air , which carried all the smoke away from them , and made their seat , on the great flat stone , very pleasant .
" have you fastened the horse ? "
said forester .
" yes , " replied <name> .
" you ought to fasten him pretty strong , " said <name> , " for he 's very apt to get away . "
" o , he wo n't get away , " said <name> ; " i fastened him to a good stout tree . "
[ illustration ] when the fire was burning well , <name> and <name> buried some potatoes , which they had brought with them , in the embers under it .
they also put some apples down to roast on a flat stone , which they placed near the fire .
" i wish we had some <name> potatoes , " said <name> .
" what kind of potatoes are they ? "
asked <name> .
" they are sweet .
they would be excellent to roast in the woods . "
" i never heard of a potato being sweet , " said <name> .
" yes , " said <name> .
" they have plenty of them in new york . "
" then why do n't they call them new york potatoes ? "
asked <name> .
" why , i believe they came from <name> first , " said <name> .
" and now i want a long stick for a <unk> . "
so <name> cut a long stick , and , after he had made the end sharp , he put a slice of bread upon it , and placed it before the fire , and thus toasted the bread .
it is remarkable that the business of cooking the food , which , in houses and cities , is considered a disagreeable drudgery , which is to be kept as much as possible out of sight , is always in the woods a very important part of the entertainment , in which all the guests are pleased to take a share .
chapter ix .
the encampment .
our party of travellers remained at the place of their <unk> more than an hour .
at the end of that time , having eaten all that they had cooked , they began to think of resuming their journey .
<name> was sitting upon the stone , wishing that he had put down one more potato to roast , when suddenly he perceived a large grey squirrel upon a log near him .
the squirrel ran along the log , and <name> immediately rose and went in pursuit of him .
the squirrel ascended a tree , running up the stem .
then he glided along one of the branches till he came to the end of it , when he leaped through the air and caught the end of another branch , which was growing from another tree .
this branch , which was very slender , bent down half way to the ground under the squirrel 's weight .
<name> ran up the branch , however , as easily as if it remained level .
thus he went along from tree to tree , following , generally , the direction of the path by which <name> had descended in coming from the wagon .
at length he emerged from the wood , just at the point where <name> had fastened the horse .
but all farther pursuit of him , on the part of <name> , was suddenly arrested by the astounding fact , which here burst suddenly upon <name> , that the horse and wagon were gone .
<name> looked all about , this way and that , to assure himself that it was the very same place where he had fastened the horse .
there could be no doubt of it .
there was the very tree to which he had tied him , and the marks of his feet , near it , upon the ground .
<name> was in consternation .
he looked all around , and then ran into the road and looked both ways , but no signs of the horse were to be seen .
he then hurried back to the edge of the woods and called out in a loud voice : " cousin forester !
<name> !
cousin forester !
our horse has got away . "
<name> sprang from the seat and ran , quicker than the squirrel had done , up the path .
as he came out to the place where <name> was standing , <name> began to say , " there 's where i tied him .
i fastened him strong to that tree . "
but <name> paid no attention to what he said , but ran directly to the road .
he did not stop to look both ways , but taking the road which led towards his home , he ran along as fast as he could go .
<name> followed him as far as into the road , and looked after him as long as he could see him .
<name> was , however , soon out of sight , and <name> went back to find forester .
forester was coming up the path very leisurely , bringing the bag , with the remaining provisions in it , in one hand , and the hatchet in the other .
" well , cousin forester , " said <name> , " we are in a fine condition .
our horse and wagon have run away , and now <name> has run away too . "
" i think <name> <name> come back pretty soon , " said forester .
" as to the horse and wagon , that is more doubtful . "
" and then what shall we do ? "
asked <name> .
" i do n't know , " said forester .
" we are ten miles from any house in one direction , and fifteen in another .
but i 'm not commander .
it 's nothing to me .
i 've only to obey orders .
i 'll do whatever you say . "
" yes , but i should think you might advise me , " said <name> .
" generals get advice from their captains and colonels in battle . "
" oh yes , " said forester ; " i 'll advise you .
i think we had better wait first till <name> comes back .
perhaps he 'll find the horse . "
they waited about fifteen minutes , and then <name> came back .
but he had no horse .
he said he went on until he reached the top of a hill where he could see the road for a long distance before him , but that the horse was not to be seen .
" he 'll get home before i should overtake him , " said <name> .
" yes , " said <name> , " unless he stopped where the tree fell across the road . "
" true , " said <name> ; " perhaps he has stopped there . "
" or would not he find his way round the tree through the woods ? "
asked <name> .
" i do n't know , " said <name> ; " perhaps he would . "
" is he a pretty sensible horse ? "
asked <name> .
" yes , " replied <name> ; " we have to keep the granary door locked , or else he <name> open the latch with his teeth , and go in and get the corn . "
" then , " said <name> , " i 've no doubt that he <name> find his way around the tree and go home ; and so we 've got nothing to do but to walk back fifteen miles . "
" or forward ten , " said forester .
" yes , " said <name> ; " we can go on , to be sure , if we only knew the way . "
here followed a long discussion as to what it was best to do .
<name> thought that , if there was any probability that the horse would have stopped at the tree , it would be better for him to go back and get him ; but that , if he had got by the tree , and had gone home , it would be better for <name> to go back and get him , while they went forward to the end of the day 's journey .
he said that the trunk might be sent on .
forester was himself very much at a loss to know what it was best to do .
as it was farther to go back than it was to go forward , it would be plainly best for them to keep on , were it not for the difficulty of finding their way .
but <name> told them he thought they would not have any difficulty on that account , as there were very few roads in such a new country .
he said that , if they kept the principal road , they could get along without any trouble .
so <name> and forester concluded to go on , while <name> returned .
<name> said that he was not afraid to return alone .
he said also that , if he found the horse at the tree , he would turn about and come and overtake them .
and if he did not find him there , he would walk on home , and come the next day with their trunk .
<name> and forester then went back to the place where they had dined , and collected together all the food which had been left , thinking that they might possibly have occasion to use it , before getting to the end of their journey .
they also took the hatchet with them , and bidding <name> good-by , they set forth upon their solitary journey .
the road , though rough and narrow for wheels , was very good for a <unk> , and the travellers went on for several miles without difficulty , and with good courage .
there was an unbroken forest on each side of the way , with here and there a solitary bird in the topmost branches , singing in melancholy notes , which echoed far and wide under the endless colonnades of trees .
after they had gone on about four miles , they met a man coming with a team , who told them that there was no road of any consequence to turn them off , and that they would , therefore , probably find their way without much trouble .
they were quite pleased to hear this .
in fact , it was some relief to them to know that they were right , so far .
<name> was , however , not much accustomed to walk , and forester , to accommodate him , advanced slowly .
when they had gone about five or six miles , the shades of evening began to draw on .
the days were getting shorter at this season of the year , and then , besides , it happened that , on this evening , there were some dark clouds in the west , and the sun was darkened behind them before the regular hour of his going down .
then , besides , the trees of the forest made it darker in the road in which <name> and forester were travelling .
now , just as it was thus beginning to grow dark , they happened to come to a place where the road divided , and <name> and forester were both puzzled to decide which was the one which they must take .
the roads seemed to be nearly equally travelled , though it was so dark that they could not see very well .
they examined both as carefully as they could , and finally decided according to the best of their judgment , and went on .
they had some doubt whether they were right , and forester thought , as they proceeded , that the road appeared somewhat different from the one in which they had been travelling .
however , they thought it best to go on .
after advancing about two miles , in a very circuitous direction , they came at last to a place where several trees seemed to have been cut away , and there were remains of several log huts .
<name> was very much interested in this discovery , and he wanted to examine the huts very particularly .
but forester , when he found that they were not inhabited , thought it best to lose no time , especially as it was now beginning to be quite dark , and he urged <name> to leave the huts and press on .
they went on for half a mile farther , when <name> , seeing a glimmer through the trees , exclaimed that they were coming to some water .
" so it is , " said forester .
" it looks like a pond or a river .
if it is a river , we 're lost . "
they walked on a short distance farther , and then they began to hear the rippling of the water .
in a few minutes , they were down upon the bank .
it was a small river , flowing rapidly along , between banks overhung with bushes .
<name> looked for a bridge , or for some place to cross , but they found none .
in fact , the road did not go down to the water , but seemed to lose itself among the trees , before reaching the bank .
" this is not our road , " said forester .
" we must go back . "
" what road can this be ? "
asked <name> .
" it seems to lead nowhere . "
" i presume it is a <unk> road , " replied forester .
" what do you mean by that ? "
asked <name> .
" why , i suppose that those huts must have been a <unk> camp , where the men lived in the <name> , when they came here to cut logs ; and this is the road that they <name> the logs by , down to the water .
but this summer it has been neglected .
they don't cut the logs in the summer . "
" and what shall we do ? "
asked <name> .
" we must go back to the place where the road branched off , " replied forester .
" or else go and stay in the huts all night , " said <name> .
" yes , " replied forester , " we can do that .
let us go back and see . "
they accordingly went back to the huts .
<name> asked forester whether he thought they had better stay there .
" i do n't know , " said forester , " let us strike a light , and see how the huts look . "
<name> took out his <unk> , and , after first gathering a few dry sticks , he struck a light , and soon made a little fire .
they found a birch tree growing near , and they stripped off some pieces of the bark .
these they laid upon the fire , holding the ends of two long sticks upon them , in such a manner , that , as the pieces of birch bark curled up under the influence of the heat , they curled around the ends of these sticks , thus making <unk> .
these <unk> , though of rude construction , gave a very excellent light , and <name> and forester walked about the huts , waving them in the air , and illuminating the whole scene in a very brilliant manner .
they found that the huts were in a ruinous state .
only one of them had a roof , and that had been originally made of hemlock branches , which had now become entirely dry by long exposure .
this covered hut was only a sort of booth , being entirely open on one side .
forester said that he recollected having heard of such huts , and that the men built their fire , not in them , but on the ground opposite the open side .
forester and <name> concluded to remain in this hut for the night .
they got together a great many hemlock branches , which they spread in the bottom of it for a bed , and they built a fire opposite the open part , to keep them warm .
<name> took a great interest in this fire .
he piled the dry sticks upon it until he had a very warm and cheerful blaze , and then he collected by the side of it a heap of fuel , to use during the night .
in fact , <name> raised his fire too high ; for , from the column of smoke and sparks , one little brilliant fragment lighted upon their roof ; and it was slowly burning and smoking there , while forester and <name> were opening their bag of provisions , to see what they could make out for supper .
<name> was counting out the potatoes , saying , " two for you , and two for me , " when his attention was arrested by a spark which , at that instant , fell into his lap .
he looked up to see where it came from , and saw that the fire , which had spread from the original spark which had fallen upon the roof , had burned a hole through , and the air , which was drawn up through the opening , was at that moment fanning it into a flame .
<name> ran out , calling out , " get some water !
get some water ! "
there was plenty of water in a <name> , which flowed with a murmuring sound down a little <name> behind the huts , but there were no buckets , and <name> called in vain .
it would have been equally useless to have raised an alarm of fire , as there was nobody within ten miles to hear the cry .
the flames spread rapidly , and forester and <name> soon saw that there was nothing to be done but for them to stand quietly by and witness the conflagration .
the flames rose very high and raged fiercely , and the light shone far into the forest , bringing into distinct view the whole scene around , which had been involved in deep obscurity .
the roof was soon consumed , but the logs , of which the walls had been built , were much longer in burning .
the fire made by these logs , when they fell in together upon the bed which forester and <name> had prepared , was so intensely hot that it could not be approached for a long time .
as soon as the intensity of this fire had a little declined , forester said that they must go to work and build themselves another hut .
they examined the ruins of those which remained , but they concluded that it would be better to build a new one than to attempt to repair one of these .
they accordingly determined to build one anew .
they found two young trees , growing pretty near each other , which had branches about six feet from the ground , so situated that they could place a strong pole across from one tree to the other , resting the ends upon the branches .
this , <name> called the <unk> .
they then cut other poles , which they placed with the end on one side upon the ground , and the other ends upon the <unk> .
these were rafters , and upon the rafters they placed a great many branches of hemlock , which formed a roof .
this roof , however , was only upon one side .
the other side of the hut was open , and they built a fire opposite this opening , feeling safe in regard to their roof , as it was made of green branches .
[ illustration ] this work occupied them an hour .
at the end of that time , they put their potatoes into the fire to roast , and then laid down upon the hemlock beds which they made , to rest themselves a little while , till the potatoes should be done .
wearied with their long walk and the labors of the evening , they fell asleep , and did not wake again till four o'clock the next morning .
chapter x .
lost in the woods .
when <name> awoke , he at first supposed that he had been asleep about an hour , and he was surprised to see how much the fire had burned down in that time .
he crept towards it , and began to put the brands together , when suddenly he recollected the potatoes .
so he began to feel for them in the ashes , by means of a long stick , which they had obtained for a poker .
the potatoes were all burnt to a cinder .
<name> then awoke forester , saying , " cousin forester !
cousin forester !
wake up .
the fire has gone out , and our potatoes are all burnt up . "
forester awoke , and , after looking at the fire , and at the charred and blackened remains of the potatoes a moment , he took out his watch , and said , " why , <name> , it is four o'clock .
it is almost morning . "
" is it ? "
said <name> .
" then we have not got much more time to sleep .
let us build up a good fire , and then lie down again . "
" yes , " replied forester .
" we must keep up a good fire , or we shall take cold , it is such a cool night .
it looks as if it were going to rain . "
" what shall we do in that case ? "
asked <name> .
" i do n't know , " replied forester .
" it would be rather a hard case for us . "
" we could stay here , i suppose , " said <name> .
" i do n't think the rain would come through our roof . "
" no , " said forester , " not much .
but then we have nothing to eat . "
" could not we get anything to eat about here ? "
asked <name> .
" not very well , " replied forester .
" we have got money enough , but this is a case where money does not seem to be of any use . "
" how do the men who come here in the <name> to cut down the trees , get anything to eat ? "
asked <name> .
" o , they bring it all with them , " said forester .
" the roads are better , in the <name> , for sleds and sleighs , than they are now for wheels ; for then all the stumps and <unk> are covered up with the snow .
so , wherever there is a camp , there is a road leading to it , and sleigh loads of provisions are brought up for the men , from time to time , all the <name> . "
" i wish one would come now , " said <name> , " to us . "
" i wish so too , " said forester .
" but it is of no use to wish , and so we may as well lie down and go to sleep again . "
" but , forester , " said <name> , " i do n't see what we are going to do if it rains . "
" nor do i , " said forester .
" but this is not the time for forming a plan .
this is the time for going to sleep .
i make it a rule , in all perplexities and troubles , when there is nothing to be done immediately in order to get out of them , to lie down and go to sleep . "
<name> said no more , and forester was soon asleep again .
<name> himself felt so much concern about his situation that he could not go to sleep for some time .
he lay watching the flames , which were creeping slowly around the logs which he and forester had put upon the fire ; for , while they had been holding the conversation above described , they had been employed in <unk> the fire .
<name> heard a sound , which , at first , he thought was a bear .
he was on the point of awakening forester , but , after listening a little longer , he concluded that it was only the roaring of the wind upon the tops of the trees .
after lifting his head from his pillow of hemlock branches for a moment , until he satisfied himself that it was no wild beast , he lay down again and went to sleep .
he was awakened again , about three hours afterwards , by a long rumbling clap of thunder .
" what is that ? "
said forester .
" thunder ? "
" i believe it is , " said <name> .
" and it rains , i believe , " said forester .
<name> raised his head , and looked out through the open part of the hut .
he saw the drops of rain descending , and he heard the murmuring sound which the rain makes when falling upon the leaves in a forest .
he saw , too , that everything was wet in the opening about the hut , although it seemed dry in the forest beyond , where the drops of rain had been intercepted by the leaves of the trees .
" we must get our wood under cover , " said <name> , " or it <name> get wet and wo n't burn , and then our fire <name> go out . "
" true , " said forester .
" there is room for some of it in this hut .
let us get up and put it in . "
so <name> and forester arose , and , as they were already dressed , they were soon at work , putting the logs into the hut .
<name> then proposed that they should go into the forest , where it did not rain , and get some more wood .
but forester said he thought that would be of no service , as they had no provisions , and , of course , could not stay there .
" we must go , " said he , " at any rate , whether it rains or not ; for it is better to get wet than to starve . "
" we have got something left in our bag , " said <name> .
" yes , " replied forester , " just enough for breakfast . "
" how i wish i had a bushel of potatoes , " said <name> .
" then we could stay here a week .
only we should want a little salt too . "
forester opened the bag and took out the provisions which were left .
they found about enough for a breakfast for them , but they concluded to eat but half of their supply , as forester thought it was best that they should put themselves upon short allowance .
" you see , it is possible , " said forester , " that we may be kept here in the woods a day or two ; so we must use our provisions <unk> . "
after breakfast , they went into the forest a little way , where they found that they were protected from the rain by the trees .
this proved , as forester said , that it had not been raining very long ; and he thought , from appearances , that it would soon clear up .
at a little distance from their encampment , they found another hut , which was in better condition than either of those which they had seen before .
it was covered with strips of birch bark , which made a very good roof .
some of these strips , or rather sheets , for they were quite large , had fallen down , and <name> ran and got one of them , exclaiming , " what a monstrous sheet of birch bark ! "
this sheet , which <name> lifted up from the ground where it was lying , was about four feet long and two feet wide .
<name> wondered that so large a sheet could be got from any tree .
" what a monstrous tree it must have been ! "
said he to forester .
" no , " said forester , " not very large .
this sheet is about four feet long , which would make the tree only about sixteen inches in diameter . "
" how do you prove that ? "
asked <name> .
" why , the distance through a tree is about one third the distance round it , " replied forester .
" now , this bark grew around the tree , and it is about four feet long .
four feet is forty-eight inches , and one-third of forty-eight is sixteen .
now , sixteen inches in diameter would not be a very large tree . "
" i mean to try this bark on some of these trees , " said <name> , " to see how big a tree it <name> fit . "
so <name> took up the sheet of bark .
it was white and clean , especially on the outside , having been blanched by the summer rains .
<name> , in order to <name> the sheet more easily , put it upon his shoulders , drawing it up around his neck like a shawl .
" cousin forester , " said he , " see my shawl .
it would do for an umbrella , if i only had a handle . "
so saying , <name> <name> the sheet of bark up higher , holding it in such a manner that it covered his cap , rising into a point above his head .
he held it in such a manner as to leave a little crevice open in front , to peep through , in order that he might see where he was going .
" see , forester , " said he ,  " see my umbrella . "
forester looked at <name> 's contrivance , and he immediately thought that such a sheet would be an important protection to the head and neck , in case they had to walk in the rain .
he accordingly went to the hut and selected a sheet for himself , saying , " this is not a bad plan .
the most important point is to protect the head and neck , and this <name> do it pretty well .
we can roll the sheets up and <name> them under our arms , unless it rains fast , and then we can wrap them around us . "
[ illustration ] having thus found a rude substitute for an umbrella , forester thought that it would be best for them to set out on their journey .
they accordingly returned to their encampment , and made preparations for resuming their march .
as it was raining but very little at that time , they rolled up their umbrellas and carried them under their arms .
<name> took the hatchet , and forester the bag of provisions .
<name> wanted to set fire to the hut which had sheltered them for the night .
he wanted forester to hear what a loud crackling the green hemlock branches , which they had put upon the roof , would make , when the flames from the wood below should envelop them .
but forester would not consent to this .
he said that some accident might possibly happen , by which they should be obliged to come back and spend another night there , though he hoped such a measure would not be necessary .
" i <name> so , too , " said <name> .
" we may lose our way again , " said forester .
" but then , " said <name> , " we shall not come back to this place . "
" why , i have heard , " said forester , " of people losing their way in the woods , and , after a great deal of wandering , getting back to the place they started from .
so that , possibly , we may wander about all day , and get back here at night . "
" i <name> not , i 'm sure , " said <name> .
" i am tired of this old hovel . "
" why , the <unk> stay in these places all <name> , " said forester .
" yes , " replied <name> , " but then they know that they can get out whenever they please .
we do n't know that we can ever get out . "
" that is true , " said forester , " and it makes a great difference . "
" do n't you feel concerned about our finding our way out ? "
asked <name> .
" no , " said forester .
" i make it a rule never to be concerned about anything . "
" oh , forester ! "
said <name> ,  " i think we ought to be concerned when we get lost in the woods . "
" no , " replied forester .
" we ought to do the best we can to get out , but not to be concerned .
to be concerned is to be anxious and unhappy .
this does no good .
being concerned would never help us find our way out of the woods . "
thus talking , the two unfortunate travellers walked on , with their rolls under their arms .
it was well that they took them , for , after they had been walking about half an hour , the sky grew dark , and , a short time afterwards , the rain began to come down in torrents .
forester and <name> unrolled their umbrellas , and wrapped them about their shoulders and heads ; and , at the same time , they fled for shelter under an enormous pine tree , which grew in such a spot that its branches extended in every direction , and formed a canopy above them , which kept off a great deal of the rain .
when the rain abated a little , they walked on .
their plan was to get back to the place where they had left the main road the day before .
but they were somewhat perplexed to find it .
in fact , they met with several roads which branched off from the one in which they were walking .
these were old tracks , made by the <unk> , and were partly grown up to bushes .
they wandered about among these paths for some time , and at last , to their great <name> , they came out into a good beaten road , which forester immediately thought was the one which they had been travelling in the day before .
notwithstanding forester 's philosophical resolution , never to be concerned , he could not help confessing that he felt somewhat relieved to find the right road again ; and , as the sun was just breaking through the clouds at this time , they both thought that their prospects were brightening considerably .
chapter xi .
the shingle weaver 's .
the travellers walked on with fresh strength and courage , now that they thought they were in the right road .
the road was , however , monotonous , being , for most of the way , through a dense forest ; and it was so very similar to the road by which they had come the day before that they were convinced they were now right .
they went on , without any special adventure , for nearly two hours , when they arrived at what had the appearance of being an old wood road , which branched off at right angles to the one in which they were travelling .
the trees were somewhat more open here .
this admitted the sun ; and there were several raspberry bushes growing at the entrance of the wood road , with ripe raspberries hanging upon them , for the season of raspberries had now arrived .
<name> seized this fruit with great avidity .
forester followed his example , and began gathering the berries .
the bushes were , however , not entirely dry , and they had to advance cautiously among them .
in fact , they found it better to keep along the wood road , gathering the berries as they advanced .
it was not a road , strictly speaking , for there were no marks of wheels upon it , or tracks of any sort , made by travelling .
it was only a space for a road , made by cutting away the trees and bushes .
along this opening , forester and <name> slowly advanced , eating the raspberries which grew by the side of the way .
after going on for a few rods in this manner , <name> suddenly exclaimed , " why , here is another camp ! "
forester looked up and saw , just before them , the remains of a sort of hut , somewhat similar to those which they had seen the evening before .
there was a large heap of chips and shavings about it .
" what can this be ? "
asked <name> .
" i presume , " said forester , " that it is an old shingle <unk> establishment . "
" what is a shingle weaver ? "
asked <name> .
" a man who makes shingles , " replied forester , " such as they use for covering houses .
they make them of clear <unk> pine , which <name> split easily and true . "
so saying , forester advanced towards the hut , and took up one of the pieces of pine , which had been split out for a shingle .
there were several of such pieces lying about among the chips and shavings .
it was somewhat browned by exposure to the weather , but it had a very smooth and glossy appearance , shining with a sort of silken lustre .
" this is a beautiful piece of pine , " said forester .
" let us <name> some of it home , " rejoined <name> .
" what good would it do us ? "
asked forester .
" why , we might make something of it , " said <name> .
" perhaps i could make a little box . "
" and that would serve as a souvenir of this expedition , " added forester .
" a souvenir ? "
said <name> ,  " what is that ? "
" why , something to remember it by , " replied forester .
" hereafter , whenever you should see the box , you would be reminded of our wanderings and perils in this wilderness . "
" well , " said <name> , " let us take it . "
the farther conversation of our adventurers was interrupted by a sound , like that of wagon wheels , coming along the main road , which they had just left .
" there comes some traveller , " exclaimed forester .
" let us go and enquire about our way . "
" hark ! "
said <name> .
at this instant , the sound of the wheels suddenly stopped , and <name> and forester heard the voice of a man calling out earnestly to his horse , " whoa !
whoa ! "
as if something had happened .
<name> and forester hastened to the spot , where they found that the horse had fallen down , and the man was trying in vain to get him up .
the harness was drawn so tight about the horse 's limbs , by the constrained position in which he was lying , that he could not get up , and the man could not extricate him .
the man had gone behind , and had drawn the wagon back , so as to loosen the pressure of the harness upon the horse , but , until forester and <name> came , there was no one to <unk> the straps when they were thus loosened ; and , if the man let go of the wagon , to go and <unk> the harness , it was drawn back again at once by the tension of the straps , and made as tight as before .
he was , therefore , very glad to see forester and <name> coming .
he asked them to come and help him .
forester and <name> were immediately going to attempt to <unk> the harness , but the man told them that there was danger of their getting kicked by the horse , in case he should suddenly begin to struggle .
" come here , " said the man , " and hold the wagon back and i <name> loosen the harness . "
by means of this plan of operations , the horse was soon liberated from his confinement , and he got up .
the man seemed very thankful to forester and <name> , and he asked them where they were going .
" we are going to no .
3 , " said forester .
" is this the right way ? "
the <unk> in a new country are numbered at first , not named .
the place to which <name> and forester were going had yet very few inhabitants , and it had no name but no .
3 .
" yes , " replied the man , " this is the right road .
i wish i was going that way , i would take you along in my wagon . "
this answer puzzled <name> a little , on two accounts .
first , the man was going the same way with them , but then <name> thought that , perhaps , he was going to turn off , pretty soon , into some other road .
then , secondly , he did not see how the man could possibly <name> him and forester , in any event , as the wagon seemed completely filled with bags , and <unk> , and <unk> , leaving scarcely room for the man himself to sit .
forester told the man that they could walk very well ; but he said that they were hungry , and if the man had anything to eat , in his wagon , they should be glad to buy something of him .
" yes , " replied the man , " i 've a loaf of bread that i can spare , and a jug of milk . "
" that <name> be just the thing , " said <name> .
at first , the man was not willing to receive anything for the bread and milk , but as forester insisted upon it , he consented to take a little pay .
he then told forester that he had some <name> in his wagon , and a few apples , and forester bought a supply of these .
at first , they thought they should not have anything to put the <name> in , but <name> ran to the shingle weaver 's hut , and got one of the thin pieces which had been split out for shingles , and it made a very good plate .
forester bought a pound of the <name> , and half a dozen apples .
they then bade the man good-by , and he resumed his journey .
forester and <name> went back to the hut , where they had a most excellent dinner .
they built a fire , and roasted the apples and toasted the bread .
they cut it into slices with <name> 's knife .
they made wooden spoons for the <name> out of pieces of pine , which answered very well indeed .
<name> said it was the very best dinner he ever ate in his life .
after dinner , they returned to the main road , and resumed their walk .
forester said he wished he had asked the man how far it was to no .
3 , but he thought it could not be very far , as they had been travelling nearly three hours , and it was only about ten miles in the morning .
as he was saying this , they were just ascending a hill , and when they reached the top of it , they had a prospect of the road for a considerable distance before them .
<name> thought he saw something coming , and he asked forester what it was .
" i think it is only a stump , or something like that , " said forester .
" no , it moves , " said <name> .
" it is another wagon , " said forester , " i really believe .
now we can find out how far it is to no .
3 . "
it was very soon quite evident that it was a wagon , and that it was coming on apace .
as it <name> nearer , it appeared that there was a boy in it .
" he is just about as big as <name> , " said <name> .
" yes , " said forester .
" and the horse looks very much like the horse <name> had . "
" i verily believe it is <name> , " said <name> .
this supposition was confirmed as the wagon <name> near .
the boy was <name> , but he stared at <name> and forester with a look of perplexity and wonder , as if he was very much surprised to see them .
" <name> ! "
said <name> , <unk> him , as soon as <name> <name> up the reins and stopped the horse opposite to them .
" what are you coming back for ? "
asked <name> .
" coming back ! "
repeated forester , not knowing exactly what <name> meant .
" yes , " said <name> .
" i thought you were going to stay at no .
3 , and i was going to <name> your trunk there . "
it immediately flashed upon forester 's mind that they had got turned about in their wanderings , and , instead of going on towards no .
3 , as they supposed , they were in reality , though in the right road , going the wrong way in it .
forester had a hearty laugh at this discovery , in which <name> joined , as soon as he fairly understood the case .
at first , he was very much perplexed .
he could not believe that they could have got their ideas of direction so completely reversed .
" besides , " said he , " that man told us that we were in the right way . "
" yes , " said forester , " but he did not tell us that we were going right in it . "
" i suppose he did not know which way we were going , " said <name> .
the question then arose , what was to be done .
forester proposed that they should get into the wagon and let <name> drive them to no .
3 , but <name> said that he was commander , and he was not going to try to get to no .
3 any more .
he had been travelling back and forth through those woods long enough , and he declared that he would not vote to go through them again , if he had to go round the world to get to the other side of them .
forester laughed and submitted to the decision ; so they all returned to <name> 's father 's .
the next morning they formed a different plan for pursuing their journey .
they wanted to get to the quebec road now , as soon as possible , and they found , by enquiry , that , by taking a boat upon a large pond or lake , a few miles distant , they could go about twenty miles by water , through a chain of ponds , which led in the direction in which they wished to go .
so forester hired a man to go with them and bring back the boat .
they went , in a wagon , to a place very near the landing , at the pond .
the landing was in a small cove , surrounded by forests .
the cove opened out into the pond by two points of land , <name> and precipitous , and crowned with evergreen trees .
the water was smooth , and the whole scene highly picturesque .
when <name> came in sight of it , he was much pleased with the prospect of a voyage on such a sheet of water .
there was considerable water in the boat when the party arrived on the beach , and forester undertook to bail it out .
the man who was going with them went and cut a bush , with a thick top , to use as a sail , in case there should be a fair wind .
while he was bringing the bush , and forester was bailing out the boat , <name> stood upon the beach , looking at the paddles .
" does she leak , cousin forester ? "
asked <name> .
[ illustration ] " no , " said forester , " i presume not .
this water all comes from the rain . "
" i 'm glad to hear that , " said <name> , " for i do n't want to go to sea in a leaky ship . "
there was a great basket of provisions on the beach , by the side of <name> , while these preparations were making , for they were resolved not to expose themselves , a second time , to the danger of famine .
when all was ready , the bush , the basket and the paddles were put on board , and our adventurers , after gliding smoothly through the water to the outlet of the cove , doubled one of the <name> points of land , and pushed boldly out upon the waters of the pond .
chapter xii .
a voyage on the pond .
as the boat moved on , propelled by the paddles , which forester and the man who accompanied them were plying , <name> sat upon a thwart , and gazed upon the picturesque and romantic scene around him .
the shores of the lake , or pond , formed many beautiful points and promontories , with deep bays between them .
there were a great many islands too , scattered over its surface .
<name> wanted to land upon some of these , but forester thought that they had better make the best of their way towards their destined port .
<name> contented himself , therefore , with gazing on the changing scenery , as they passed , in succession , one island and promontory after another .
the whole country was covered with forests , except that here and there was an opening , with the house and barn of a settler in the middle of it .
smokes were rising , too , in various directions , where new <unk> were in progress .
there was one in particular , on the side of a distant hill , which rose in such dense white volumes as especially to attract <name> 's attention .
when <name> had admired these objects long enough , he leaned a little over the side of the boat , and began to look down into the water .
the water was not deep , and the bottom was smooth and <name> .
they glided rapidly along over these sands .
<name> 's leaning caused the boat to incline a little to one side ; but forester , instead of asking him not to <name> over so , just moved himself a little in the contrary direction , and thus restored the equilibrium .
" there , forester , " said <name> , suddenly raising himself , " i forgot one thing . "
" what is that ? "
said forester .
" i forgot my piece of wood to make a box of . "
" i am very sorry , " said forester .
" but then you can get another piece , perhaps , before we get to the end of our journey . "
" but i wanted a piece from that very hut , so as to make the box a souvenir of our having got lost in the woods , " said <name> .
" yes , " rejoined forester , " that would have been very pleasant ,  but , perhaps , we shall meet with some other odd adventure , which <name> be as good as being lost in the woods . "
" i do n't think being lost in the woods is anything very good , " said <name> .
" it is not a very good thing at the time , but the recollection of such adventures and dangers is always pleasant afterwards .
you see you specially want a souvenir of it .
" but , <name> , " continued forester , " i have thought of something which <name> be , perhaps , better than a box .
at any rate , it <name> be more convenient to make . "
" what is it ? "
said <name> .
" a little press for pressing flowers , " replied forester .
" how could i make it ? "
asked <name> .
" have two pieces of pine wood , planed out thin , " said forester .
" they might be varnished , and that would make them look very neat and pretty . "
" how large must they be ? "
asked <name> .
" oh , about as large , " replied forester , " as the covers of a small book .
just large enough to make it convenient to <name> in the pocket .
then you must have some pieces of soft paper , of the same size and shape , to put between them .
you must also have a piece of cord or braid , or something of that kind , to tie around them , to keep them together .
then , when you are travelling , if you find any pretty flower , you can put it into this press , and put the press in your pocket .
thus , the press <name> not only be a souvenir itself , but it <name> procure for you a great many other souvenirs . "
" that 's an excellent plan , " said <name> .
" i like it very much .
that <name> be better than a box . "
" it <name> be easier to make , at any rate , " replied forester .
" any <unk> can plane out and square the boards for you . "
" yes , " said <name> .
" i mean to get a piece of pine to make them of , the first time i find any . "
<name> had an opportunity to get a piece of pine suitable for this purpose , and , at the same time , a souvenir itself of an adventure , sooner than he anticipated ; for , after having paddled many miles , towards noon a breeze sprung up , which , though really not against them , retarded them somewhat , as it tended to drive them out of their course .
their intention had been to have stopped upon the water , about noon , to eat their dinner ; but , as this breeze would prevent the boat from remaining at rest , they concluded to land upon an island , which was near where they were at the time , and take their dinner there .
<name> was particularly pleased with this plan , as it would enable him to build a fire , and he always wanted to build a fire on such occasions , whether there was anything to be cooked by it or not .
the island was <name> , and it was covered with trees .
on the sheltered side of it there was a beach , where the party landed .
although this beach was somewhat protected from the wind , still the waves which rolled in kept the water in a state of agitation .
they , however , landed here , running the head of the boat upon the sand .
there was a large tree lying here , with its top in the water , and <unk> upon the beach .
it was a tree which some settler had cut down at some place near the shore of the pond , and when the water was high it had been washed off , and , after drifting about the pond for some time , it had got lodged upon this beach , where it remained in the position in which our adventurers found it .
it had been lying there for more than a year , and the branches which were out of the water were dead and dry .
the foliage had long since disappeared .
the boatman brought the boat up alongside of this tree , so that forester and <name> stepped out upon the trunk , and walked to the land .
the boatman then tied the boat to one of the dead branches of the tree , and , taking the basket of provisions and the hatchet , they all walked along , in search of a place for their dinner .
they found a sheltered and pleasant place , at a little distance , under the trees .
<name> soon struck a light , and began to build a fire .
he found it somewhat difficult , however , to procure dry wood enough for the fire , until , at last , he thought of the branches of the tree to which the boat was fastened .
he accordingly went to the place and began to cut them off .
the boat was somewhat in the way while he was doing this , and he thought he would move it .
he could fasten it just as well , he thought , by a stake driven into the sand .
he therefore cut off one of the branches , and , after <unk> one end and sharpening the other , he drove it down as well as he could into the sand .
he then fastened the boat to this stake , thus removing it from the tree , and clearing the way so that he could conveniently cut off the branches .
this was not , however , a very wise operation , for it is very difficult to drive a stake securely into sand .
sand , even when wet , has so little tenacity that it yields to the slightest force , and the stake soon began to work loose , by the motion of the boat , agitated by the waves ; and , in fact , before <name> had finished carrying away the branches , the stake was entirely loosened from its bed , and was just ready to <unk> over .
as the boat continued to pull upon it , this way and that , as it was agitated by the <unk> of the water , it soon <name> it down , and the boat , being now entirely at <name> , began to move slowly off from the shore .
it soon drifted out where it was more fully exposed to the action of the wind , when it began to move much faster .
and thus , while our party of voyagers were eating their dinner , seated on a flat rock , by the side of a good fire , in fancied security , their boat was quietly drifting away , thus apparently cutting them off from all communication with the main land .
<name> made the discovery that the boat was gone , just after finishing his dinner , and he immediately gave the alarm .
forester and the boatman came at once to the spot .
they could just see the boat , half a mile distant , under a ledge of rocks , which formed the shore in that place .
this was the third time , on this journey , that <name> had found himself isolated in circumstances of difficulty and danger , and cut off , apparently , from all convenient means of retreat ; and , at first , he thought that this was the worst and the most dangerous of the three .
in fact , he did not see in what possible way they could escape .
" what shall we do ? "
asked forester .
" we must make a raft , somehow or other , " said the boatman .
" if i had a log , i could go after the boat on that . "
" wo n't this tree answer for a log ? "
asked <name> .
the boatman looked at the tree .
he said that , if he had an axe , he thought he could cut off the top , and roll the trunk into the water ; but it would take him a long time , he said , to hack it off with the hatchet .
there seemed to be , however , no alternative ; so he set himself at work , and in due time he cut off the stem of the tree , just where it entered the water .
they all three then took levers , which the boatman made with his hatchet , and , by making great exertion , they got the log out of the sand , and rolled it round into the water , where it floated .
the man then cut a long pole , and , mounting upon the log , he pushed himself out over the surface of the water .
forester and <name> watched his progress with great interest .
<name> thought that he would certainly roll off the log , but he seemed to stand and to walk upon it , perfectly at his ease .
he would advance to the forward end of the log , and then , planting the foot of his pole in the sand on the bottom , he would push , walking along as the log advanced , until he came to the stern end of the log , when he would draw out his pole , and walk back again .
in this way he propelled the log until the water became too deep for his pole to reach the bottom , and then he ceased these efforts , and , standing upright , he left himself to be driven along slowly by the wind .
[ illustration ] forester and <name> saw plainly that he would be gone for some time , and they amused themselves , during his absence , in wandering about the shores of the island .
in one place , <name> found , upon a rock a little above the water , a slab of pine wood , which was bleached by the sun and rain .
it had drifted down , the summer before , from some stream emptying into the pond .
in the <name> it had been frozen into the ice , and , when the ice broke up on the following spring , the cake to which the slab was attached , had been crowded up upon the shore , where the slab had been left when the ice melted .
<name> immediately thought that this slab would furnish him with a good piece of wood to make a flower press of , and he accordingly dragged it up where he could work upon it with his hatchet .
he soon cut off a piece , of the proper length , and <unk> it down so as to make it of a convenient shape to <name> .
when forester came to examine it , he said he thought it was a very good piece , and when it was planed smooth and varnished , he thought , from its appearance , that it would be of a very pretty color .
" you can get it made at the first shop we come to , " said forester , " and then you can collect and preserve a great many flowers in it , when we get to canada .
when you get home ; you can put them in a book , and call them the canadian <name> . "
" that 's just what i 'll do , " said <name> , " and then , when i get home , i'll give some of them to my cousins .
they <name> like them , because they came from canada .
but i ca n't put a great many into such a press . "
" no , " said forester .
" you only collect them in the press , which you always <name> with you in your pocket .
you put them all in a book , or in a larger press , as soon as you get home , and then you have the small press ready for use again . "
while they were talking thus , they watched the boatman , who had , by this time , reached the land and recovered the boat .
he came back quite rapidly , propelling the boat with the paddle .
<name> and forester embarked on board of her , and they finished their voyage without any further adventure .
the next day , they reached the quebec road , and , leaving the region of the <unk> , they went on their way towards canada .

preface .
the word khan is not a name , but a title .
it means chieftain or king .
it is a word used in various forms by the different tribes and nations that from time immemorial have inhabited central <name> , and has been applied to a great number of potentates and rulers that have from time to time arisen among them .
genghis khan was the greatest of these princes .
he was , in fact , one of the most renowned conquerors whose exploits history records .
as in all other cases occurring in the series of histories to which this work belongs , where the events narrated took place at such a period or in such a part of the world that positively reliable and authentic information in respect to them can now no longer be obtained , the author is not responsible for the actual truth of the narrative which he offers , but only for the honesty and fidelity with which he has compiled it from the best sources of information now within reach .

chapter i. pastoral life in <name> .
four different modes of life <unk>  northern and southern <unk>  animal food in arctic <unk>  tropical <unk>  appetite changes with <unk>  first steps toward <unk>  interior of <unk>  pastoral habits of the people.  picture of pastoral life.  large families <unk>  rise of <unk> <unk>  origin of the <unk>  great <unk>  genghis khan .
there are four several methods by which the various communities into which the human race is divided obtain their subsistence from the productions of the earth , each of which leads to its own peculiar system of social organization , distinct in its leading characteristics from those of all the rest .
each tends to its own peculiar form of government , gives rise to its own manners and customs , and forms , in a word , a distinctive and characteristic type of life .
these methods are the following : 1 .
by hunting wild animals in a state of nature .
2 .
by rearing tame animals in pasturages .
3 .
by gathering fruits and vegetables which grow spontaneously in a state of nature .
4 .
by rearing fruits and grains and other vegetables by artificial tillage in cultivated ground .
by the two former methods man subsists on animal food .
by the two latter on vegetable food .
as we go north , from the temperate regions toward the poles , man is found to subsist more and more on animal food .
this seems to be the intention of providence .
in the arctic regions scarcely any vegetables grow that are fit for human food , but animals whose flesh is nutritious and adapted to the use of man are abundant .
as we go south , from temperate regions toward the equator , man is found to subsist more and more on vegetable food .
this , too , seems to be the intention of nature .
within the tropics scarcely any animals live that are fit for human food ; while fruits , roots , and other vegetable productions which are nutritious and adapted to the use of man are abundant .
in accordance with this difference in the productions of the different regions of the earth , there seems to be a difference in the constitutions of the races of men formed to inhabit them .
the tribes that inhabit greenland and <unk> can not preserve their accustomed health and vigor on any other than animal food .
if put upon a diet of vegetables they soon begin to pine away .
the reverse is true of the <unk> of the tropics .
they preserve their health and strength well on a diet of rice , or <unk> , or bananas , and would undoubtedly be made sick by being fed on the flesh of walruses , seals , and white bears .
in the temperate regions the productions of the above-mentioned extremes are mingled .
here many animals whose flesh is fit for human food live and thrive , and here grows , too , a vast variety of nutritious fruits , and roots , and seeds .
the physical constitution of the various races of men that inhabit these regions is modified accordingly .
in the temperate climes men can live on vegetable food , or on animal food , or on both .
the constitution differs , too , in different individuals , and it changes at different periods of the year .
some persons require more of animal , and others more of vegetable food , to preserve their bodily and mental powers in the best condition , and each one observes a change in himself in passing from <name> to summer .
in the summer the <name> for a diet of fruits and vegetables seems to come northward with the sun , and in the <name> the appetite for flesh comes southward from the arctic regions with the cold .
when we consider the different conditions in which the different regions of the earth are placed in respect to their capacity of production for animal and vegetable food , we shall see that this adjustment of the constitution of man , both to the differences of climate and to the changes of the seasons , is a very wise and beneficent arrangement of divine providence .
to confine man absolutely either to animal or vegetable food would be to <unk> a large part of the earth .
it results from these general facts in respect to the distribution of the supplies of animal and vegetable food for man in different latitudes that , in all northern climes in our hemisphere , men living in a savage state must be hunters , while those that live near the equator must depend for their subsistence on fruits and roots growing wild .
when , moreover , any tribe or race of men in either of these localities take the first steps toward civilization , they begin , in the one case , by taming animals , and rearing them in flocks and herds ; and , in the other case , by saving the seeds of <unk> plants , and cultivating them by artificial tillage in inclosed and private fields .
this last is the condition of all the <unk> tribes of the tropical regions of the earth , whereas the former prevails in all the northern temperate and arctic regions , as far to the northward as domesticated animals can live .
from time immemorial , the whole interior of the continent of <name> has been inhabited by tribes and nations that have taken this one step in the advance toward civilization , but have gone no farther .
they live , not , like the indians in north <name> , by hunting wild beasts , but by rearing and <unk> flocks and herds of animals that they have tamed .
these animals feed , of course , on grass and herbage ; and , as grass and herbage can only grow on open ground , the forests have gradually disappeared , and the country has for ages consisted of great grassy plains , or of smooth hill-sides covered with verdure .
over these plains , or along the river valleys , wander the different tribes of which these pastoral nations are composed , living in tents , or in frail huts almost equally movable , and driving their flocks and herds before them from one <unk> to another , according as the condition of the grass , or that of the springs and streams of water , may require .
we obtain a pretty distinct idea of the nature of this pastoral life , and of the manners and customs , and the domestic constitution to which it gives rise , in the accounts given us in the old testament of <name> and lot , and of their wanderings with their flocks and herds over the country lying between the euphrates and the mediterranean sea .
they lived in tents , in order that they might remove their habitations the more easily from place to place in following their flocks and herds to different <unk> .
their wealth consisted almost wholly in these flocks and herds , the land being almost every where common .
sometimes , when two parties traveling together came to a fertile and <unk> district , their herdsmen and followers were disposed to contend for the privilege of feeding their flocks upon it , and the contention would often lead to a quarrel and combat , if it had not been settled by an amicable agreement on the part of the chieftains .
[ illustration : encampment of a patriarch . ]
the father of a family was the <unk> and ruler of it , and his sons , with their wives , and his son 's sons , remained with him , sometimes for many years , sharing his means of subsistence , submitting to his authority , and going with him from place to place , with all his flocks and herds .
they employed , too , so many herdsmen , and other servants and followers , as to form , in many cases , quite an extended community , and sometimes , in case of hostilities with any other wandering tribe , a single patriarch could send forth from his own domestic circle a force of several hundred armed men .
such a company as this , when moving across the country on its way from one region of pasturage to another , appeared like an immense caravan on its march , and when settled at an encampment the tents formed quite a little town .
whenever the head of one of these wandering families died , the tendency was not for the members of the community to separate , but to keep together , and allow the oldest son to take the father 's place as chieftain and ruler .
this was necessary for defense , as , of course , such communities as these were in perpetual danger of coming into collision with other communities roaming about like themselves over the same regions .
it would necessarily result , too , from the circumstances of the case , that a strong and <unk> party , with an able and sagacious chieftain at the head of it , would attract other and weaker parties to join it ; or , on the arising of some pretext for a quarrel , would make war upon it and conquer it .
thus , in process of time , small nations , as it were , would be formed , which would continue united and strong as long as the able leadership continued ; and then they would separate into their original elements , which elements would be formed again into other combinations .
such , substantially , was pastoral life in the beginning .
in process of time , of course , the tribes banded together became larger and larger .
some few towns and cities were built as places for the manufacture of implements and arms , or as <unk> for the caravans of merchants in conveying from place to place such articles as were bought and sold .
but these places were comparatively few and unimportant .
a pastoral and roaming life continued to be the <name> of the great mass of the people .
and this state of things , which was commenced on the banks of the euphrates before the time of <name> , spread through the whole breadth of <name> , from the mediterranean sea to the pacific ocean , and has continued with very little change from those early periods to the present time .
of the various chieftains that have from time to time risen to command among these shepherd nations but little is known , for very few and very scanty records have been kept of the history of any of them .
some of them have been famous as conquerors , and have acquired very extended dominions .
the most celebrated of all is perhaps genghis khan , the hero of this history .
he came upon the stage more than three thousand years after the time of the great prototype of his class , the patriarch <name> .
chapter ii .
the monguls .
<unk>  origin of the <unk>  a mongul family.  their <unk>  animals of the <unk>  their towns and <unk>  mode of building their <unk>  bad <unk>  comfortless <unk>  movable houses built at <unk>  the <unk>  account of a large movable <unk>  the traveling <unk>  necessity of such an <unk>  houses in the <unk>  roads over the <unk>  tribes and <unk>  influence of diversity of <unk>  tribes and <unk>  mode of making war.  <unk>  the bow and <unk>  the flying <unk>  nature of the bow and <unk>  superiority of <unk>  sources of <unk>  <unk> and <unk>  <unk>  adventures of <unk> and his party.  the wonderful <unk>  great bolts and <unk>  the <unk>  travelers ' <unk>  progress of intelligence .
three thousand years is a period of time long enough to produce great changes , and in the course of that time a great many different nations and <unk> of nations were formed in the regions of central <name> .
the term tartars has been employed <unk> to denote almost the whole race .
the monguls are a portion of this people , who are said to derive their name from <unk> khan , one of their earliest and most powerful chieftains .
the descendants of this khan called themselves by his name , just as the descendants of the twelve sons of <name> called themselves israelites , or children of <name> , from the name <name> , which was one of the <unk> of the great patriarch from whose twelve sons the twelve tribes of the jews descended .
the country inhabited by the monguls was called <unk> .
to obtain a clear <name> of a single mongul family , you must imagine , first , a rather small , short , <unk> man , with long black hair , a flat face , and a dark <name> complexion .
his wife , if her face were not so flat and her nose so broad , would be quite a brilliant little beauty , her eyes are so black and sparkling .
the children have much the appearance of young indians as they run shouting among the cattle on the hill-sides , or , if young , playing <unk> about the door of the hut , their long black hair streaming in the wind .
like all the rest of the inhabitants of central <name> , these people depended almost entirely for their subsistence on the products of their flocks and herds .
of course , their great occupation consisted in watching their animals while feeding by day , and in putting them in places of security by night , in taking care of and rearing the young , in making butter and cheese from the milk , and clothing from the skins , in driving the cattle to and fro in search of pasturage , and , finally , in making war on the people of other tribes to settle disputes arising out of conflicting claims to territory , or to <unk> their stock of sheep and oxen by seizing and driving off the flocks of their neighbors .
the animals which the monguls most prized were camels , oxen and cows , sheep , goats , and horses .
they were very proud of their horses , and they rode them with great courage and spirit .
they always went mounted in going to war .
their arms were bows and arrows , pikes or spears , and a sort of sword or sabre , which was manufactured in some of the towns toward the west , and supplied to them in the course of trade by great traveling caravans .
although the mass of the people lived in the open country with their flocks and herds , there were , notwithstanding , a great many towns and villages , though such centres of population were much fewer and less important among them than they are in countries the inhabitants of which live by <unk> the ground .
some of these towns were the residences of the khans and of the heads of tribes .
others were places of manufacture or centres of commerce , and many of them were fortified with embankments of earth or walls of stone .
the habitations of the common people , even those built in the towns , were rude huts made so as to be easily taken down and removed .
the tents were made by means of poles set in a circle in the ground , and brought nearly together at the top , so as to form a frame similar to that of an indian wigwam .
a hoop was placed near the top of these poles , so as to preserve a round opening there for the smoke to go out .
the frame was then covered with sheets of a sort of thick gray felt , so placed as to leave the opening within the hoop free .
the felt , too , was arranged below in such a manner that the corner of one of the sheets could be raised and let down again to form a sort of door .
the edges of the sheets in other places were fastened together very carefully , especially in <name> , to keep out the cold air .
within the tent , on the ground in the centre , the family built their fire , which was made of sticks , leaves , grass , and dried <unk> of all sorts , gathered from the ground , for the country produced scarcely any wood .
countries roamed over by herds of animals that gain their living by <unk> on the grass and herbage are almost always destitute of trees .
trees in such a case have no opportunity to grow .
the tents of the monguls thus made were , of course , very comfortless homes .
they could not be kept warm , there was so much cold air coming continually in through the crevices , notwithstanding all the people's contrivances to make them tight .
the smoke , too , did not all escape through the <unk> above .
much of it remained in the tent and mingled with the atmosphere .
this evil was aggravated by the kind of fuel which they used , which was of such a nature that it made only a sort of smouldering fire instead of burning , like good dry wood , with a bright and clear flame .
the discomforts of these huts and tents were increased by the custom which prevailed among the people of allowing the animals to come into them , especially those that were young and feeble , and to live there with the family .
in process of time , as the people increased in riches and in mechanical skill , some of the more wealthy chieftains began to build houses so large and so handsome that they could not be conveniently taken down to be removed , and then they contrived a way of mounting them upon trucks placed at the four corners , and moving them bodily in this way across the plains , as a table is moved across a floor upon its <unk> .
it was necessary , of course , that the houses should be made very light in order to be managed in this way .
they were , in fact , still tents rather than houses , being made of the same materials , only they were put together in a more substantial and ornamental manner .
the frame was made of very light poles , though these poles were fitted together in permanent <unk> .
the covering was , like that of the tents , made of felt , but the sheets were joined together by close and strong seams , and the whole was coated with a species of paint , which not only closed all the pores and interstices and made the structure very tight , but also served to ornament it ; for they were accustomed , in painting these houses , to adorn the covering with pictures of birds , beasts , and trees , represented in such a manner as doubtless , in their eyes , produced a very beautiful effect .
these movable houses were sometimes very large .
a certain traveler who visited the country not far from the time of genghis khan says that he saw one of these structures in motion which was thirty feet in diameter .
it was drawn by twenty-two oxen .
it was so large that it extended five feet on each side beyond the wheels .
the oxen , in drawing it , were not attached , as with us , to the centre of the forward <unk> , but to the ends of the <unk> , which projected beyond the wheels on each side .
there were eleven oxen on each side drawing upon the <unk> .
there were , of course , many drivers .
the one who was chief in command stood in the door of the tent or house which looked forward , and there , with many loud shouts and flourishing gesticulations , issued his orders to the oxen and to the other men .
the household goods of this traveling chieftain were packed in chests made for the purpose , the house itself , of course , in order to be made as light as possible , having been emptied of all its contents .
these chests were large , and were made of wicker or <unk> , covered , like the house , with felt .
the covers were made of a rounded form , so as to throw off the rain , and the felt was painted over with a certain composition which made it impervious to the water .
these chests were not intended to be unpacked at the end of the journey , but to remain as they were , as permanent <unk> of utensils , clothing , and provisions .
they were placed in rows , each on its own cart , near the tent , where they could be resorted to conveniently from time to time by the servants and attendants , as occasion might require .
the tent placed in the centre , with these great chests on their carts near it , formed , as it were , a house with one great room standing by itself , and all the little rooms and closets arranged in rows by the side of it .
some such arrangement as this is obviously necessary in case of a great deal of furniture or baggage belonging to a man who lives in a tent , and who desires to be at <name> to remove his whole establishment from place to place at short notice ; for a tent , from the very principle of its construction , is incapable of being divided into rooms , or of accommodating extensive stores of furniture or goods .
of course , a special contrivance is required for the accommodation of this species of property .
this was especially the case with the monguls , among whom there were many <name> and great men who often accumulated a large amount of movable property .
there was one <name> mongul , it was said , who had two hundred such <unk> , which were arranged in two rows around and behind his tent , so that his establishment , when he was encamped , looked like quite a little village .
the style of building adopted among the monguls for tents and movable houses seemed to set the fashion for all their houses , even for those that were built in the towns , and were meant to stand permanently where they were first set up .
these permanent houses were little better than tents .
they consisted each of one single room without any subdivisions whatever .
they were made round , too , like the tents , only the top , instead of running up to a point , was rounded like a dome .
there were no floors above that formed on the ground , and no windows .
such was the general character of the dwellings of the monguls in the days of genghis khan .
they took their character evidently from the wandering and pastoral life that the people led .
one would have thought that very excellent roads would have been necessary to have enabled them to draw the ponderous carts containing their dwellings and household goods .
but this was less necessary than might have been supposed on account of the nature of the country , which consisted chiefly of immense grassy plains and smooth river valleys , over which , in many places , wheels would travel tolerably well in any direction without much making of roadway .
then , again , in all such countries , the people who journey from place to place , and the herds of cattle that move to and fro , naturally fall into the same lines of travel , and thus , in time , wear great trails , as cows make paths in a pasture .
these , with a little artificial improvement at certain points , make very good summer roads , and in the <name> it is not necessary to use them at all .
the monguls , like the ancient jews , were divided into tribes , and these were subdivided into families ; a family meaning in this connection not one household , but a large <unk> of households , including all those that were of known relationship to each other .
these groups of relatives had each its head , and the tribe to which they pertained had also its general head .
there were , it is said , three sets of these tribes , forming three grand divisions of the mongul people , each of which was ruled by its own khan ; and then , to complete the system , there was the grand khan , who ruled over all .
a constitution of society like this almost always prevails in pastoral countries , and we shall see , on a little reflection , that it is natural that it should do so .
in a country like ours , where the pursuits of men are so infinitely diversified , the descendants of different families become mingled together in the most promiscuous manner .
the son of a farmer in one state goes off , as soon as he is of age , to some other state , to find a place among merchants or manufacturers , because he wishes to be a merchant or a manufacturer himself , while his father supplies his place on the farm perhaps by hiring a man who likes farming , and has come hundreds of miles in search of work .
thus the descendants of one american grandfather and grandmother <name> be found , after a lapse of a few years , scattered in every direction all over the land , and , indeed , sometimes all over the world .
it is the diversity of pursuits which prevails in such a country as ours , taken in connection with the diversity of capacity and of taste in different individuals , that produces this dispersion .
among a people devoted wholly to pastoral pursuits , all this is different .
the young men , as they grow up , can have generally no inducement to leave their homes .
they continue to live with their parents and relatives , sharing the care of the flocks and herds , and making common cause with them in every thing that is of common interest .
it is thus that those great family groups are formed which exist in all pastoral countries under the name of tribes or clans , and form the constituent elements of the whole social and political organization of the people .
in case of general war , each tribe of the monguls furnished , of course , a certain <unk> of armed men , in proportion to its <name> and strength .
these men always went to war , as has already been said , on horseback , and the spectacle which these troops presented in galloping in squadrons over the plains was sometimes very imposing .
the shock of the onset when they charged in this way upon the enemy was tremendous .
they were armed with bows and arrows , and also with sabres .
as they approached the enemy , they discharged first a shower of arrows upon him , while they were in the act of advancing at the top of their speed .
then , dropping their bows by their side , they would draw their sabres , and be ready , as soon as the horses fell upon the enemy , to cut down all opposed to them with the most furious and deadly blows .
if they were repulsed , and compelled by a superior force to retreat , they would gallop at full speed over the plains , turning at the same time in their saddles , and shooting at their pursuers with their arrows as coolly , and with as correct an aim , almost , as if they were still .
while thus retreating the trooper would guide and control his horse by his voice , and by the pressure of his heels upon his sides , so as to have both his arms free for fighting his pursuers .
these arrows were very formidable weapons , it is said .
one of the travelers who visited the country in those days says that they could be shot with so much force as to pierce the body of a man entirely through .
[ illustration : shooting at pursuers . ]
it must be remembered , however , in respect to all such statements relating to the efficiency of the bow and arrow , that the force with which an arrow can be thrown depends not upon any independent action of the bow , but altogether upon the strength of the man who draws it .
the bow , in straightening itself for the <unk> of the arrow , <unk> only the force which the man has imparted to it by bending it ; so that the real power by which the arrow is propelled is , after all , the muscular strength of the archer .
it is true , a great deal depends on the qualities of the bow , and also on the skill of the man in using it , to make all this muscular strength effective .
with a poor bow , or with <unk> management , a great deal of it would be wasted .
but with the best possible bow , and with the most consummate skill of the archer , it is the strength of the archer 's arm which throws the arrow , after all .
it is very different in this respect with a bullet thrown by the force of gunpowder from the barrel of a gun .
the force in this case is the explosive force of the powder , and the bullet is thrown to the same distance whether it is a very weak man or a very strong man that pulls the trigger .
but to return to the monguls .
all the information which we can obtain in respect to the condition of the people before the time of genghis khan comes to us from the reports of travelers who , either as merchants , or as embassadors from <unk> or kings , made long journeys into these distant regions , and have left records , more or less complete , of their adventures , and accounts of what they saw , in writings which have been preserved by the learned men of the east .
it is very doubtful how far these accounts are to be believed .
one of these travelers , a learned man named <unk> , who made a journey far into the interior of <name> by order of the calif <name> <unk> <unk> , some time before the reign of genghis khan , says that , among other objects of research and investigation which occupied his mind , he was directed to ascertain the truth in respect to the two famous nations <unk> and <unk> , or , as they are designated in his account , <unk> and <unk> .
the story that had been told of these two nations by the arabian writers , and which was extensively believed , was , that the people of <unk> were of the ordinary size of men , but those of <unk> were only about two feet high .
these people had made war upon the neighboring nations , and had destroyed many cities and towns , but had at last been overpowered and shut up in prison .
<unk> , the traveler whom the calif sent to ascertain whether their accounts were true , traveled at the head of a caravan containing fifty men , and with camels bearing stores and provisions for a year .
he was gone a long time .
when he came back he gave an account of his travels ; and in respect to <unk> and <unk> , he said that he had found that the accounts which had been heard respecting them were true .
he traveled on , he said , from the country of one chieftain to another till he reached the caspian sea , and then went on beyond that sea for thirty or forty days more .
in one place the party came to a tract of low black land , which <unk> an odor so offensive that they were obliged to use perfumes all the way to <unk> the <unk> smells .
they were ten days in crossing this fetid territory .
after this they went on a month longer through a desert country , and at length came to a fertile land which was covered with the ruins of cities that the people of <unk> and <unk> had destroyed .
in six days more they reached the country of the nation by which the people of <unk> and <unk> had been conquered and shut up in prison .
here they found a great many strong castles .
there was a large city here too , containing temples and academies of learning , and also the residence of the king .
the travelers took up their abode in this city for a time , and while they were there they made an excursion of two days ' journey into the country to see the place where the people of <unk> and <unk> were confined .
when they arrived at the place they found a lofty mountain .
there was a great opening made in the face of this mountain two or three hundred feet wide .
the opening was protected on each side by enormous buttresses , between which was placed an immense double gate , the buttresses and the gate being all of iron .
the buttresses were surmounted with an iron bulwark , and with lofty towers also of iron , which were carried up as high as to the top of the mountain itself .
the gates were of the width of the opening cut in the mountain , and were seventy-five feet high ; and the valves , <unk> , and threshold , and also the bolts , the lock , and the key , were all of proportional size .
<unk> , on arriving at the place , saw all these wonderful structures with his own eyes , and he was told by the people there that it was the custom of the governor of the castles already mentioned to take horse every friday with ten others , and , coming to the gate , to strike the great bolt three times with a ponderous hammer weighing five pounds , when there would be heard a murmuring noise within , which were the groans of the <unk> and <unk> people confined in the mountain .
indeed , <unk> was told that the poor captives often appeared on the battlements above .
thus the real existence of this people was , in his opinion , fully proved ; and even the story in respect to the diminutive size of the <unk> was <unk> , for <unk> was told that once , in a high wind , three of them were blown off from the battlements to the ground , and that , on being measured , they were found but three <unk> high .
this is a specimen of the tales brought home from remote countries by the most learned and accomplished travelers of those times .
in comparing these absurd and ridiculous tales with the reports which are brought back from distant regions in our days by such travelers as humboldt , livingstone , and kane , we shall perceive what an immense progress in intelligence and information the human mind has made since those days .

the name of the father of genghis khan is a word which can not be pronounced exactly in english .
it sounded something like this , yezonkai <unk> , with the accent on the last syllable , <unk> , and the a sounded like a in hark .
this is as near as we can come to it ; but the name , as it was really pronounced by the mongul people , can not be written in english letters nor spoken with english sounds .
indeed , in all languages so entirely distinct from each other as the mongul language was from ours , the sounds are different , and the letters by which the sounds are represented are different too .
some of the sounds are so utterly unlike any sounds that we have in english that it is as impossible to write them in english characters as it is for us to write in english letters the sound that a man makes when he <unk> to his horse or his dog , or when he whistles .
sometimes writers attempt to represent the latter sound by the word whew ; and when , in reading a dialogue , we come to the word whew , inserted to express a part of what one of the speakers uttered , we understand by it that he whistled ; but how different , after all , is the sound of the spoken word whew from the whistling sound that it is intended to represent !
now , in all the languages of <name> , there are many sounds as impossible to be rendered by the european letters as this , and in making the attempt every different writer falls into a different mode .
thus the first name of genghis khan 's father is spelled by different travelers and historians , yezonkai , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and in several other ways .
the real sound was undoubtedly as different from any of these as they were all different from each other .
in this narrative i shall adopt the first of these methods , and call him yezonkai <unk> .
[ illustration : map of the empire of genghis khan . ]
yezonkai was a great khan , and he descended in a direct line through ten generations , so it was said , from a deity .
great sovereigns in those countries and times were very fond of tracing back their descent to some divine origin , by way of establishing more fully in the minds of the people their divine right to the throne .
yezonkai 's residence was at a great palace in the country , called by a name , the sound of which , as nearly as it can be represented in english letters , was <unk> .
from this , his capital , he used to make warlike excursions at the head of hordes of monguls into the surrounding countries , in the prosecution of quarrels which he made with them under various pretexts ; and as he was a skillful commander , and had great influence in inducing all the inferior khans to bring large troops of men from their various tribes to add to his army , he was usually victorious , and in this way he extended his empire very considerably while he lived , and thus made a very good preparation for the subsequent exploits of his son .
the northern part of <name> was at that time entirely separated from the southern part , and was under a different government .
it constituted an entirely distinct country , and was called <unk> .
[ a ] this country was under the dominion of a chieftain called the khan of <unk> .
this khan was very jealous of the increasing power of yezonkai , and took part against him in all his wars with the tribes around him , and assisted them in their attempts to resist him ; but he did not succeed .
yezonkai was too powerful for them , and went on extending his conquests far and wide .
[ footnote a : spelled variously <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and in other ways . ]
at last , under the pretense of some affront which he had received from them , yezonkai made war upon a powerful tribe of tartars that lived in his neighborhood .
he invaded their territories at the head of an immense horde of mongul troops , and began seizing and driving off their cattle .
the name of the khan who ruled over these people was temujin .
temujin assembled his forces as soon as he could , and went to meet the invaders .
a great battle was fought , and yezonkai was victorious .
temujin was defeated and put to flight .
yezonkai encamped after the battle on the banks of the river <unk> , near a mountain .
he had all his family with him , for it was often the custom , in these enterprises , for the chieftain to take with him not only all his household , but a large portion of his household goods .
yezonkai had several wives , and almost immediately after the battle , one of them , named <unk> <unk> , gave birth to a son .
yezonkai , fresh from the battle , determined to commemorate his victory by giving his new-born son the name of his vanquished enemy .
so he named him temujin .
[ b ] his birth took place , as nearly as can now be ascertained , in the year of our lord <unk> .
[ footnote b : the name is intended to be pronounced <unk> . ]
such were the circumstances of our hero 's birth , for it was this temujin who afterward became renowned throughout all <name> under the name of genghis khan .
through all the early part of his life , however , he was always known by the name which his father gave him in the tent by the river side where he was born .
among the other grand personages in yezonkai 's train at this time , there was a certain old astrologer named <unk> .
he was a relative of yezonkai , and also his principal minister of state .
this man , by his skill in <unk> , which he applied to the peculiar circumstances of the child , foretold for him at once a wonderful career .
he would grow up , the astrologer said , to be a great warrior .
he would conquer all his enemies , and extend his conquests so far that he would , in the end , become the khan of all <unk> .
young temujin 's parents were , of course , greatly pleased with these predictions , and when , not long after this time , the astrologer died , they appointed his son , whose name was <unk> , to be the guardian and instructor of the boy .
they trusted , it seems , to the son to give the young <name> such a training in early life as should prepare him to realize the grand <name> which the father had foretold for him .
there would be something remarkable in the fact that these predictions were uttered at the birth of genghis khan , since they were afterward so completely fulfilled , were it not that similar <unk> of greatness and <name> were almost always offered to the fathers and mothers of young princes in those days by the <unk> and soothsayers of their courts .
such promises were , of course , very flattering to these parents at the time , and brought those who made them into great favor .
then , in the end , if the result verified them , they were remembered and recorded as something wonderful ; if not , they were forgotten .
<unk> , the astrologer 's son , who had been appointed young <unk> tutor , took his pupil under his charge , and began to form plans for <unk> him .
<unk> was a man of great talents and of considerable attainments in learning , so far as there could be any thing like learning in such a country and among such a people .
he taught him the names of the various tribes that lived in the countries around , and the names of the principal chieftains that ruled over them .
he also gave him such information as he possessed in respect to the countries themselves , describing the situation of the mountains , the lakes , and the rivers , and the great deserts which here and there intervened between the fertile regions .
he taught him , moreover , to ride , and trained him in all such athletic exercises as were practiced by the youth of those times .
he instructed him also in the use of arms , teaching him how to shoot with a bow and arrow , and how to hold and handle his sabre , both when on horseback and when on foot .
he particularly instructed him in the <name> of shooting his arrow in any direction when riding at a gallop upon his horse , behind as well as before , and to the right side as well as to the left .
to do this coolly , skillfully , and with a true aim , required great practice as well as much courage and presence of mind .
young temujin entered into all these things with great spirit .
indeed , he very soon ceased to feel any interest in any thing else , so that by the time that he was nine years of age it was said that he thought of nothing but exercising himself in the use of arms .
nine years of age , however , with him was more than it would be with a young man among us , for the <unk> arrive at maturity much earlier than the nations of western europe and <name> .
indeed , by the time that temujin was thirteen years old , his father considered him a man  at least he considered him old enough to be married .
he was married , in fact , and had two children before he was fifteen , if the accounts which the historians have given us respecting him are true .
just before temujin was thirteen , his father , in one of his campaigns in <unk> , was defeated in a battle , and , although a great many of his followers escaped , he himself was surrounded and overpowered by the horsemen of the enemy , and was made prisoner .
he was put under the care of a guard ; for , of course , among people living almost altogether on horseback and in tents , there could be very few prisons .
yezonkai followed the camp of his conqueror for some time under the custody of his guard ; but at length he succeeded in bribing his keeper to let him escape , and so contrived , after encountering many difficulties and suffering many hardships , to make his way back to his own country .
he was determined now to make a new incursion into <unk> , and that with a larger force than he had had before .
so he made an alliance with the chieftain of a neighboring tribe , called the <unk> ; and , in order to seal and establish this alliance , he contracted that his son should marry the daughter of his ally .
this was the time when temujin was but thirteen years old .
the name of this his first wife was <unk>  at least that was one of her names .
her father 's name was tayian .
before yezonkai had time to mature his plans for his new invasion of <unk> , he fell sick and died .
he left five sons and a daughter , it is said ; but temujin seems to have been the oldest of them all , for by his <name> his father left his kingdom , if the command of the group of tribes which were under his sway can be called a kingdom , to him , notwithstanding that he was yet only thirteen years old .

in the language of the monguls and of their neighbors the tartars , a collection of tribes banded together under one chieftain was designated by a name which sounded like the word <unk> .
this is the origin , it is said , of the english word horde .
the <unk> over which yezonkai had ruled , and the command of which , at his death , he left to his son , consisted of a great number of separate tribes , each of which had its own particular chieftain .
all these subordinate chieftains were content to be under yezonkai 's rule and leadership while he lived .
he was competent , they thought , to direct their movements and to lead them into battle against their enemies .
but when he died , leaving only a young man thirteen years of age to succeed him , several of them were disposed to rebel .
there were two of them , in particular , who thought that they were themselves better qualified to reign over the nation than such a boy ; so they formed an alliance with each other , and with such other tribes as were disposed to join them , and advanced to make war upon temujin at the head of a great number of squadrons of troops , amounting in all to thirty thousand men .
the names of the two leaders of this rebellion were <unk> and <unk> .
young temujin depended chiefly on his mother for guidance and direction in this emergency .
he was himself very brave and spirited ; but bravery and spirit , though they are of such vital importance in a commander on the field of battle , when the contest actually comes on , are by no means the principal qualities that are required in making the preliminary arrangements .
accordingly , temujin left the forming of the plans to his mother , while he thought only of his horses , of his arms and <unk> , and of the fury with which he would gallop in among the enemy when the time should arrive for the battle to begin .
his mother , in connection with the chief officers of the army and counselors of state who were around her , and on whom her husband yezonkai , during his lifetime , had been most accustomed to rely , arranged all the plans .
they sent off messengers to the heads of all the tribes that they supposed would be friendly to temujin , and appointed places of rendezvous for the troops that they were to send .
they made arrangements for the stores of provisions which would be required , settled questions of precedence among the different clans , regulated the order of march , and attended to all other necessary details .
in the mean time , temujin thought only of the approaching battle .
he was engaged continually in riding up and down upon spirited horses , and shooting in all directions , backward and forward , and both to the right side and to the left , with his bow and arrow .
nor was all this exhibition of ardor on his part a mere useless display .
it had great influence in awakening a corresponding ardor among the chieftains of the troops , and among the troops themselves .
they felt proud of the spirit and energy which their young <name> displayed , and were more and more resolved to exert themselves to the utmost in defending his cause .
there was another young <name> , of the name of porgie , of about temujin 's age , who was also full of ardor for the fight .
he was the chieftain of one of the tribes that remained faithful to temujin , and he was equally <name> with temujin for the battle to begin .
at length the troops were ready , and , with temujin and his mother at the head of them , they went forth to attack the rebels .
the rebels were ready to receive them .
they were thirty thousand strong , according to the statements of the historians .
this number is probably exaggerated , as all <name> were in those days , when there was no regular <unk> of troops and no strict system of enumeration .
at any rate , there was a very great battle .
immense troops of horsemen coming at full speed in opposite directions shot showers of arrows at each other when they arrived at the proper distance for the arrows to take effect , and then , throwing down their bows and drawing their sabres , rushed madly on , until they came together with an awful shock , the dreadful confusion and terror of which no person can describe .
the air was filled with the most terrific outcries , in which yells of fury , shrieks of agony , and shouts of triumph were equally mingled .
some of the troops maintained their position through the shock , and rode on , bearing down all before them .
others were overthrown and trampled in the dust ; while all , both those who were up and those who were down , were cutting in every direction with their sabres , killing men and <unk> the horses to redoubled fury by the wounds which they gave them .
in the midst of such scenes as these temujin and porgie fought furiously with the rest .
temujin distinguished himself greatly .
it is probable that those who were immediately around him felt that he was under their charge , and that they must do all in their power to protect him from danger .
this they could do much more easily and effectually under the mode of fighting which prevailed in those days than would be possible now , when gunpowder is the principal agent of destruction .
temujin 's attendants and followers could gather around him and defend him from assailants .
they could prevent him from charging any squadron which was likely to be strong enough to <unk> him , and they could keep his enemies so much at bay that they could not reach him with their sabres .
but upon a modern field of battle there is much less opportunity to protect a young <name> or general 's son , or other personage whose life may be considered as peculiarly valuable .
no precautions of his attendants can prevent a bomb 's bursting at his feet , or shield him from the rifle balls that come whistling from such great distances through the air .
at any rate , whether protected by his attendants or only by the fortune of war , temujin passed through the battle without being hurt , and the courage and energy which he displayed were greatly commended by all who witnessed them .
his mother was in the battle too , though , perhaps , not personally involved in the actual conflicts of it .
she directed the manoeuvres , however , and by her presence and her activity greatly encouraged and animated the men .
in consequence of the spirit and energy infused into the troops by her presence , and by the extraordinary ardor and bravery of temujin , the battle was gained .
the army of the enemy was put to flight .
one of the leaders , <unk> , was slain .
the other made his escape , and temujin and his mother were left in possession of the field .
of course , after having fought with so much energy and effect on such a field , temujin was now no longer considered as a boy , but took his place at once as a man among men , and was immediately recognized by all the army as their <name> and sovereign , and as fully entitled , by his capacity if not by his years , to rule in his own name .
he assumed and exercised his powers with as much calmness and self-possession as if he had been accustomed to them for many years .
he made addresses to his officers and soldiers , and distributed honors and rewards to them with a combined majesty and <name> which , in their opinion , denoted much grandeur of soul .
the rewards and honors were characteristic of the customs of the country and the times .
they consisted of horses , arms , splendid articles of dress , and personal ornaments .
of course , among a people who lived , as it were , always on horseback , such objects as these were the ones most highly prized .
the consequence of this victory was , that nearly the whole country occupied by the rebels submitted without any farther resistance to temujin 's sway .
other tribes , who lived on the borders of his dominions , sent in to propose treaties of alliance .
the khan of one of these tribes demanded of temujin the hand of his sister in marriage to seal and confirm the alliance which he proposed to make .
in a word , the fame of temujin 's prowess spread rapidly after the battle over all the surrounding countries , and high anticipations began to be formed of the greatness and <name> of his reign .
in the course of the next year temujin was married to his second wife , although he was at this time only fourteen years old .
the name of his bride was <unk> <unk> .
by this wife , who was probably of about his own age , he had a daughter , who was born before the close of the year after the marriage .
in his journeys about the country temujin sometimes took his wives with him , and sometimes he left them temporarily in some place of supposed security .
toward the end of the second year <unk> was again about to become a mother , and temujin , who at that time had occasion to go off on some military expedition , fearing that the fatigue and exposure would be more than she could well bear , left her at home .
while he was gone a troop of horsemen , from a tribe of his enemies , came suddenly into the district on a marauding expedition .
they overpowered the troops temujin had left to guard the place , and seized and carried off every thing that they could find that was valuable .
they made prisoner of <unk> , too , and carried her away a captive .
the plunder they divided among themselves , but <unk> they sent as a present to a certain khan who reigned over a neighboring country , and whose favor they wished to secure .
the name of this chieftain was vang khan .
as this vang khan figures somewhat conspicuously in the subsequent history of temujin , a full account of him <name> be given in the next chapter .
all that is necessary to say here is , that the intention of the captors of <unk> , in sending her to him as a present , was that he should make her his wife .
it was the custom of these khans to have as many wives as they could obtain , so that when prisoners of high rank were taken in war , if there were any young and beautiful women among them , they were considered as charming presents to send to any great <name> or potentate near , whom the captors were desirous of pleasing .
it made no difference , in such cases , whether the person who was to receive the present were young or old .
sometimes the older he was the more highly he would prize such a gift .
vang khan , it happened , was old .
he was old enough to be <unk> father .
indeed , he had been in the habit of calling temujin his son .
he had been in alliance with yezonkai , temujin 's father , some years before , when temujin was quite a boy , and it was at that time that he began to call him his son .
[ illustration : <unk> in the tent of vang khan . ]
accordingly , when <unk> was brought to him by the messengers who had been sent in charge of her , and presented to him in his tent , he said , " she is very beautiful , but i can not take her for my wife , for she is the wife of my son .
i can not marry the wife of my son . "
vang khan , however , received <unk> under his charge , gave her a place in his household , and took good care of her .
when temujin returned home from his expedition , and learned what had happened during his absence , he was greatly distressed at the loss of his wife .
not long afterward he ascertained where she was , and he immediately sent a deputation to vang khan asking him to send her home .
with this request vang khan immediately complied , and <unk> set out on her return .
she was stopped on the way , however , by the birth of her child .
it was a son .
as soon as the child was born it was determined to continue the journey , for there was danger , if they delayed , that some new troop of enemies might come up , in which case <unk> would perhaps be made captive again .
so <unk> , it is said , wrapped up the tender limbs of the infant in some sort of paste or dough , to save them from the effects of the jolting produced by the rough sort of cart in which she was compelled to ride , and in that condition she held the babe in her lap all the way home .
she arrived at her husband 's residence in safety .
temujin was overjoyed at seeing her again ; and he was particularly pleased with his little son , who came out of his packing safe and sound .
in commemoration of his safe arrival after so strange and dangerous a journey , his father named him <unk> ; that is , he gave him for a name the word in their language that means that .
the word itself was jughi .
the commencement of temujin 's career was thus , on the whole , quite prosperous , and every thing seemed to promise well .
he was himself full of ambition and of <name> , and began to feel dissatisfied with the empire which his father had left him , and to form plans for extending it .
he dreamed one night that his arms grew out to an enormous length , and that he took a sword in each of them , and stretched them out to see how far they would reach , pointing one to the eastward and the other to the westward .
in the morning he related his dream to his mother .
she interpreted it to him .
she told him it meant undoubtedly that he was destined to become a great conqueror , and that the directions in which his kingdom would be extended were toward the eastward and toward the westward .
temujin continued for about two years after this in prosperity , and then his good fortune began to <unk> .
there came a reaction .
some of the tribes under his dominion began to grow discontented .
the subordinate khans began to form plots and conspiracies .
even his own tribe turned against him .
rebellions broke out in various parts of his dominions ; and he was obliged to make many hurried expeditions here and there , and to fight many desperate battles to suppress them .
in one of these contests he was taken prisoner .
he , however , contrived to make his escape .
he then made proposals to the disaffected khans , which he hoped would satisfy them , and bring them once more to submit to him , since what he thus offered to do in these proposals was pretty much all that they had professed to require .
but the proposals did not satisfy them .
what they really intended to do was to depose temujin altogether , and then either divide his dominions among themselves , or select some one of their number to reign in his stead .
at last , temujin , finding that he could not <unk> his enemies , and that they were , moreover , growing stronger every day , while those that adhered to him were growing fewer in <name> and diminishing in strength , became discouraged .
he began to think that perhaps he really was too young to rule over a kingdom composed of wandering hordes of men so warlike and wild , and he concluded for a time to give up the attempt , and wait until times should change , or , at least , until he should be grown somewhat older .
accordingly , in conjunction with his mother , he formed a plan for retiring temporarily from the field ; unless , indeed , as we might reasonably suspect , his mother formed the plan herself , and by her influence over him induced him to adopt it .
the plan was this : that temujin should send an embassador to the court of vang khan to ask vang khan to receive him , and protect him for a time in his dominions , until the affairs of his own kingdom should become settled .
then , if vang khan should accede to this proposal , temujin was to appoint his uncle to act as regent during his absence .
his mother , too , was to be married to a certain <unk> , or <name> , named <unk> , who was to be made prime minister under the regent , and was to take precedence of all the other princes or khans in the kingdom .
the government was to be managed by the regent and the minister until such time as it should be deemed expedient for temujin to return .
this plan was carried into effect .
vang khan readily consented to receive temujin into his dominions , and to protect him there .
he was very ready to do this , he said , on account of the friendship which he had borne for temujin 's father .
temujin 's mother was married to the <unk> , and the <unk> was made the first <name> of the realm .
finally , temujin 's uncle was proclaimed regent , and duly invested with all necessary authority for governing the country until temujin 's return .
these things being all satisfactorily arranged , temujin set out for the country of vang khan at the head of an armed escort , to protect him on the way , of six thousand men .
he took with him all his family , and a considerable suite of servants and attendants .
among them was his old tutor and guardian <unk> , the person who had been appointed by his father to take charge of him , and to teach and train him when he was a boy .
being protected by so powerful an escort , temujin 's party were not molested on their journey , and they all arrived safely at the court of vang khan .

the country over which vang khan ruled was called <unk> .
it bordered upon the country of <unk> , which has already been mentioned as forming the northern part of what is now <name> .
indeed , as its name imports , it was considered in some sense as a portion of the same general district of country .
it was that part of <unk> which was inhabited by tartars .
vang khan 's name at first was <unk> .
the name vang khan , which was , in fact , a title rather than a name , was given him long afterward , when he had attained to the height of his power .
to avoid confusion , however , we shall drop the name <unk> , and call him vang khan from the beginning .
vang khan was descended from a powerful line of khans who had reigned over <unk> for many generations .
these khans were a wild and lawless race of men , continually fighting with each other , both for mastery , and also for the plunder of each other 's flocks and herds .
in this way most furious and cruel wars were often fought between near relatives .
vang khan 's grandfather , whose name was mergus , was taken prisoner in one of these quarrels by another khan , who , though he was a relative , was so much exasperated by something that mergus had done that he sent him away to a great distance to the king of a certain country which is called <unk> , to be disposed of there .
the king of <unk> put him into a sack , sewed up the mouth of it , and then laid him across the wooden image of an ass , and left him there to die of hunger and suffocation .
the wife of mergus was greatly enraged when she heard of the cruel fate of her husband .
she determined to be revenged .
it seems that the relative of her husband who had taken him prisoner , and had sent him to the king of <unk> , had been her lover in former times before her marriage ; so she sent him a message , in which she <unk> her grief for the loss of her husband , and only blamed the king of <unk> for his cruel death , and then said that she had long felt an affection for him , and that , if he continued of the same mind as when he had formally addressed her , she was now willing to become his wife , and offered , if he would come to a certain place , which she specified , to meet her , she would join him there .
<unk> , for that was the chieftain 's name , fell at once into the snare which the beautiful widow thus laid for him .
he immediately accepted her proposals , and proceeded to the place of rendezvous .
he went , of course , attended by a suitable guard , though his guard was small , and consisted chiefly of friends and personal attendants .
the <name> was attended also by a guard , not large enough , however , to excite any suspicion .
she also took with her in her train a large number of carts , which were to be drawn by bullocks , and which were laden with stores of provisions , clothing , and other such valuables , intended as a present for her new husband .
among these , however , there were a large number of great barrels , or rounded receptacles of some sort , in which she had concealed a considerable force of armed men .
these receptacles were so arranged that the men concealed in them could open them from within in an instant , at a given signal , and issue forth suddenly all armed and ready for action .
among the other stores which the <name> had provided , there was a large supply of a certain intoxicating drink which the monguls and tartars were accustomed to make in those days .
as soon as the two parties met at the place of rendezvous the <name> gave <unk> a very cordial greeting , and invited him and all his party to a feast , to be partaken on the spot .
the invitation was accepted , the stores of provisions were opened , and many of the presents were unpacked and displayed .
at the feast <unk> and his party were all supplied abundantly with the intoxicating liquor , which , as is usual in such cases , they were easily led to drink to excess ; while , on the other hand , the <name> 's party , who knew what was coming , took good care to keep themselves sober .
at length , when the proper moment arrived , the <name> made the signal .
in an instant the men who had been placed in ambuscade in the barrels burst forth from their concealment and rushed upon the guests at the feast .
the <name> herself , who was all ready for action , <name> a dagger from her girdle and stabbed <unk> to the heart .
her guards , assisted by the <unk> which had so suddenly appeared , slew or secured all his attendants , who were so totally <unk> , partly by the drink which they had taken , and partly by their astonishment at the sudden appearance of so overwhelming a force , that they were incapable of making any resistance .
the <name> , having thus accomplished her revenge , marshaled her men , packed up her pretended presents , and returned in triumph home .
such stories as these , related by the asiatic writers , though they were probably often much embellished in the narration , had doubtless all some foundation in fact , and they give us some faint idea of the modes of life and action which prevailed among these half-savage chieftains in those times .
vang khan himself was the grandson of mergus , who was sewed up in the sack .
his father was the oldest son of the <name> who contrived the <unk> stratagem to revenge her husband 's death .
it is said that he used to accompany his father to the wars when he was only ten years old .
the way in which he formed his friendship for yezonkai , and the alliance with him which led him to call temujin his son and to refuse to take his wife away from him , as already related , was this : when his father died he succeeded to the command , being the oldest son ; but the others were jealous of him , and after many and long quarrels with them and with other relatives , especially with his uncle , who seemed to take the lead against him , he was at last overpowered or <unk> , and was obliged to fly .
he took refuge , in his distress , in the country of yezonkai .
yezonkai received him in a very friendly manner , and gave him effectual protection .
after a time he furnished him with troops , and helped him to recover his kingdom , and to drive his uncle away into banishment in his turn .
it was while he was thus in yezonkai 's dominions that he became acquainted with temujin , who was then very small , and it was there that he learned to call him his son .
of course , now that temujin was obliged to fly himself from his native country and abandon his hereditary dominions , as he had done before , he was glad of the opportunity of <unk> to the son the favor which he had received , in precisely similar circumstances , from the father , and so he gave temujin a very kind reception .
there is another circumstance which is somewhat curious in respect to vang khan , and that is , that he is generally supposed to be the <name> whose fame was about this period spread all over europe , under the name of <unk> <name> , by the <name> missionaries in <name> .
these missionaries sent to the pope , and to various <name> kings in europe , very exaggerated accounts of the success of their missions among the persians , turks , and tartars ; and at last they wrote word that the great khan of the tartars had become a convert , and had even become a preacher of the gospel , and had taken the name of <unk> <name> .
the word <unk> was understood to be a corruption of <unk> .
a great deal was accordingly written and said all through christendom about the great tartar convert , <unk> <name> .
there were several letters forwarded by the missionaries , <unk> from him , and addressed to the pope and to the different kings of europe .
some of these letters , it is said , are still in existence .
one of them was to the king of <name> .
in this letter the writer tells the king of <name> of his great wealth and of the vastness of his dominions .
he says he has seventy kings to serve and wait upon him .
he invites the king of <name> to come and see him , promising to bestow a great kingdom upon him if he <name> , and also to make him his heir and leave all his dominions to him when he dies ; with a great deal more of the same general character .
the other letters were much the same , and the interest which they naturally excited was increased by the accounts which the missionaries gave of the greatness and renown of this more than <name> convert , and of the progress which christianity had made and was still making in his dominions through their instrumentality .
it is supposed , in modern times , that these stories were pretty much all inventions on the part of the missionaries , or , at least , that the accounts which they sent were greatly exaggerated and embellished ; and there is but little doubt that they had much more to do with the authorship of the letters than any khan .
still , however , it is supposed that there was a great <name> who at least encouraged the missionaries in their work , and allowed them to preach christianity in his dominions , and , if so , there is little doubt that vang khan was the man .
at all events , he was a very great and powerful <name> , and he reigned over a wide extent of country .
the name of his capital was karakorom .
the distance which temujin had to travel to reach this city was about ten days ' journey .
he was received by vang khan with great marks of kindness and consideration .
vang khan promised to protect him , and , in due time , to assist him in recovering his kingdom .
in the mean while temujin promised to enter at once into vang khan 's service , and to devote himself faithfully to promoting the interests of his kind protector by every means in his power .

vang khan gave temujin a very honorable position in his court .
it was natural that he should do so , for temujin was a <name> in the prime of his youth , and of very attractive person and manners ; and , though he was for the present an exile , as it were , from his native land , he was not by any means in a destitute or hopeless condition .
his family and friends were still in the ascendency at home , and he himself , in coming to the kingdom of vang khan , had brought with him quite an important body of troops .
being , at the same time , personally possessed of great courage and of much military skill , he was prepared to render his protector good service in return for his protection .
in a word , the arrival of temujin at the court of vang khan was an event calculated to make quite a sensation .
at first every body was very much pleased with him , and he was very popular ; but before long the other young princes of the court , and the chieftains of the neighboring tribes , began to be jealous of him .
vang khan gave him precedence over them all , partly on account of his personal attachment to him , and partly on account of the rank which he held in his own country , which , being that of a sovereign <name> , naturally entitled him to the very highest position among the subordinate chieftains in the retinue of vang khan .
but these subordinate chieftains were not satisfied .
they murmured , at first secretly , and afterward more openly , and soon began to form combinations and plots against the new favorite , as they called him .
an incident soon occurred which greatly increased this animosity , and gave to temujin 's enemies , all at once , a very powerful leader and head .
this leader was a very influential chieftain named yemuka .
this yemuka , it seems , was in love with the daughter of vang khan , the <name> <unk> .
he asked her in marriage of her father .
to precisely what state of <unk> the negotiations had advanced does not appear , but , at any rate , when temujin arrived , <unk> soon began to turn her thoughts toward him .
he was undoubtedly younger , handsomer , and more accomplished than her old lover , and before long she gave her father to understand that she would much rather have him for her husband than yemuka .
it is true , temujin had one or two wives already ; but this made no difference , for it was the custom then , as , indeed , it is still , for the asiatic princes and chieftains to take as many wives as their wealth and position would enable them to maintain .
yemuka was accordingly refused , and <unk> was given in marriage to temujin .
yemuka was , of course , dreadfully enraged .
he vowed that he would be revenged .
he immediately began to intrigue with all the discontented persons and parties in the kingdom , not only with those who were envious and jealous of temujin , but also with all those who , for any reason , were disposed to put themselves in opposition to vang <unk> government .
thus a formidable conspiracy was formed for the purpose of <unk> temujin 's ruin .
the conspirators first tried the effect of private remonstrances with vang khan , in which they made all sorts of evil representations against temujin , but to no effect .
temujin rallied about him so many old friends , and made so many new friends by his courage and energy , that his party at court proved stronger than that of his enemies , and , for a time , they seemed likely to fail entirely of their design .
at length the conspirators opened communication with the foreign enemies of vang khan , and formed a league with them to make war against and destroy both vang khan and temujin together .
the accounts of the progress of this league , and of the different nations and tribes which took part in it , is imperfect and confused ; but at length , after various preliminary contests and manoeuvres , arrangements were made for assembling a large army with a view of invading vang khan 's dominions and deciding the question by a battle .
the different chieftains and khans whose troops were united to form this army bound themselves together by a solemn oath , according to the customs of those times , not to rest until both vang khan and temujin should be destroyed .
the manner in which they took the oath was this : they brought out into an open space on the plain where they had assembled to take the oath , a horse , a wild ox , and a dog .
at a given signal they fell upon these animals with their swords , and cut them all to pieces in the most furious manner .
when they had finished , they stood together and called out aloud in the following words : " hear !
o god !
o heaven !
o earth !
the oath that we swear against vang khan and temujin .
if any one of us spares them when we have them in our power , or if we fail to keep the promise that we have made to destroy them , may we meet with the same fate that has befallen these beasts that we have now cut to pieces . "
they uttered this <unk> in a very solemn manner , standing among the mangled and bloody remains of the beasts which lay strewed all about the ground .
these preparations had been made thus far very secretly ; but tidings of what was going on came , before a great while , to karakorom , vang khan 's capital .
temujin was greatly excited when he heard the news .
he immediately proposed that he should take his own troops , and join with them as many of vang khan 's soldiers as could be conveniently spared , and go forth to meet the enemy .
to this vang khan consented .
temujin took one half of vang khan 's troops to join his own , leaving the other half to protect the capital , and so set forth on his expedition .
he went off in the direction toward the frontier where he had understood the principal part of the hostile forces were assembling .
after a long march , probably one of many days , he arrived there before the enemy was quite prepared for him .
then followed a series of manoeuvres and <unk> , in which temujin was all the time endeavoring to bring the rebels to battle , while they were doing all in their power to avoid it .
their object in this delay was to gain time for re-enforcements to come in , consisting of bodies of troops belonging to certain members of the league who had not yet arrived .
at length , when these manoeuvres were brought to an end , and the battle was about to be fought , temujin and his whole army were one day greatly surprised to see his father-in-law , vang khan himself , coming into the camp at the head of a small and <unk> band of followers , who had all the appearance of fugitives escaped from a battle .
they looked anxious , <unk> , and exhausted , and the horses that they rode seemed wholly spent with fatigue and privation .
on explanation , temujin learned that , as soon as it was known that he had left the capital , and taken with him a large part of the army , a certain tribe of vang khan 's enemies , living in another direction , had determined to seize the opportunity to invade his dominions , and had accordingly come suddenly in , with an immense horde , to attack the capital .
vang khan had done all that he could to defend the city , but he had been overpowered .
the greater part of his soldiers had been killed or wounded .
the city had been taken and <unk> .
his son , with those of the troops that had been able to save themselves , had escaped to the mountains .
as to vang khan himself , he had thought it best to make his way , as soon as possible , to the camp of temujin , where he had now arrived , after enduring great hardships and sufferings on the way .
temujin was at first much amazed at hearing this story .
he , however , bade his father-in-law not to be cast down or discouraged , and promised him full revenge , and a complete triumph over all his enemies at the coming battle .
so he proceeded at once to complete his arrangements for the coming fight .
he resigned to vang khan the command of the main body of the army , while he placed himself at the head of one of the wings , assigning the other to the chieftain next in rank in his army .
in this order he went into battle .
the battle was a very obstinate and bloody one , but , in the end , temujin 's party was victorious .
the troops opposed to him were defeated and driven off the field .
the victory appeared to be due altogether to temujin himself ; for , after the struggle had continued a long time , and the result still appeared doubtful , the troops of temujin 's wing finally made a desperate charge , and forced their way with such fury into the midst of the forces of the enemy that nothing could withstand them .
this encouraged and animated the other troops to such a degree that very soon the enemy were entirely routed and driven from off the field .
the effect of this victory was to raise the reputation of temujin as a military commander higher than ever , and greatly to increase the confidence which vang khan was inclined to repose in him .
the victory , too , seemed at first to have well-nigh broken up the party of the rebels .
still , the way was not yet open for vang khan to return and take possession of his throne and of his capital , for he learned that one of his brothers had assumed the government , and was reigning in karakorom in his place .
it would seem that this brother , whose name was <unk> , had been one of the leaders of the party opposed to temujin .
it was natural that he should be so ; for , being the brother of the king , he would , of course , occupy a very high position in the court , and would be one of the first to experience the ill effects produced by the coming in of any new favorite .
he had accordingly joined in the plots that were formed against temujin and vang khan .
indeed , he was considered , in some respects , as the head of their party , and when vang khan was driven away from his capital , this brother assumed the throne in his stead .
the question was , how could he now be <unk> and vang khan restored .
temujin began immediately to form his plans for the accomplishment of this purpose .
he concentrated his forces after the battle , and soon afterward opened negotiations with other tribes , who had before been uncertain which side to espouse , but were now assisted a great deal in coming to a decision by the victory which temujin had obtained .
in the mean time the rebels were not idle .
they banded themselves together anew , and made great exertions to procure re-enforcements .
<unk> fortified himself as strongly as possible in karakorom , and collected ample supplies of ammunition and military stores .
it was not until the following year that the parties had completed their preparations and were prepared for the final struggle .
then , however , another great battle was fought , and again temujin was victorious .
<unk> was killed or driven away in his turn .
karakorom was <unk> , and vang khan entered it in triumph at the head of his troops , and was once more established on his throne .
of course , the rank and influence of temujin at his court was now higher than ever before .
he was now about twenty-two or twenty-three years of age .
he had already three wives , though it is not certain that all of them were with him at vang khan 's court .
he was extremely popular in the army , as young commanders of great courage and spirit almost always are .
vang khan placed great reliance upon him , and lavished upon him all possible honors .
he does not seem , however , yet to have begun to form any plans for returning to his native land .

temujin remained at the court , or in the dominions of vang khan , for a great many years .
during the greater portion of this time he continued in the service of vang khan , and on good terms with him , though , in the end , as we shall presently see , their friendship was turned into a bitter enmity .
<unk> , vang khan 's brother , who had usurped his throne during the rebellion , was killed , it was said , at the time when vang khan recovered his throne .
several of the other rebel chieftains were also killed , but some of them succeeded in saving themselves from utter ruin , and in gradually recovering their former power over the hordes which they respectively commanded .
it must be remembered that the country was not divided at this time into regular territorial states and kingdoms , but was rather one vast undivided region , occupied by immense hordes , each of which was more or less stationary , it is true , in its own district or range , but was nevertheless without any permanent settlement .
the various clans drifted slowly this way and that among the plains and mountains , as the prospects of pasturage , the fortune of war , or the pressure of <unk> hordes might incline them .
in cases , too , where a number of hordes were united under one general chieftain , as was the case with those over whom vang khan claimed to have sway , the tie by which they were bound together was very feeble , and the distinction between a state of submission and of rebellion , except in case of actual war , was very slightly defined .
yemuka , the chieftain who had been so exasperated against temujin on account of his being supplanted by him in the affections of the young <name> , vang khan 's daughter , whom temujin had married for his third wife , succeeded in making his escape at the time when vang khan conquered his enemies and recovered his throne .
for a time he concealed himself , or at least kept out of vang khan 's reach , by dwelling with hordes whose range was at some distance from karakorom .
he soon , however , contrived to open secret negotiations with one of vang khan 's sons , whose name was something that sounded like sankum .
some authors , in attempting to represent his name in our letters , spelled it <unk> .
yemuka easily persuaded this young sankum to take sides with him in the quarrel .
it was natural that he should do so , for , being the son of vang khan , he was in some measure displaced from his own legitimate and proper position at his father 's court by the great and constantly increasing influence which temujin exercised .
" and besides , " said yemuka , in the secret representations which he made to sankum , " this new-comer is not only interfering with and <unk> your proper influence and consideration now , but his design is by-and-by to circumvent and supplant you altogether .
he is forming plans for making himself your father 's heir , and so robbing you of your rightful inheritance . "
sankum listened very eagerly to these suggestions , and finally it was agreed between him and yemuka that sankum should exert his influence with his father to obtain permission for yemuka to come back to court , and to be received again into his father 's service , under pretense of having repented of his rebellion , and of being now disposed to return to his allegiance .
sankum did this , and , after a time , vang khan was persuaded to allow yemuka to return .
thus a sort of outward peace was made , but it was no real peace .
yemuka was as envious and jealous of temujin as ever , and now , moreover , in addition to this envy and jealousy , he felt the stimulus of revenge .
things , however , seem to have gone on very quietly for a time , or at least without any open outbreak in the court .
during this time vang khan was , as usual with such princes , frequently engaged in wars with the neighboring hordes .
in these wars he relied a great deal on temujin .
temujin was in command of a large body of troops , which consisted in part of his own guard , the troops that had come with him from his own country , and in part of other bands of men whom vang khan had placed under his orders , or who had joined him of their own accord .
he was assisted in the command of this body by four subordinate generals or khans , whom he called his four <unk> .
they were all very brave and skillful commanders .
at the head of this troop temujin was accustomed to scour the country , hunting out vang <unk> enemies , or making long expeditions over distant plains or among the mountains , in the prosecution of vang khan 's warlike projects , whether those of invasion and plunder , or of retaliation and vengeance .
temujin was extremely popular with the soldiers who served under him .
soldiers always love a dashing , fearless , and energetic leader , who has the genius to devise brilliant schemes , and the spirit to execute them in a brilliant manner .
they care very little how dangerous the situations are into which he may lead them .
those that get killed in performing the exploits which he undertakes can not speak to complain , and those who survive are only so much the better pleased that the dangers that they have been brought safely through were so desperate , and that the harvest of <name> which they have thereby acquired is so great .
temujin , though a great favorite with his own men , was , like almost all half-savage warriors of his class , utterly merciless , when he was angry , in his treatment of his enemies .
it is said that after one of his battles , in which he had gained a complete victory over an immense horde of rebels and other foes , and had taken great <name> of them prisoners , he ordered fires to be built and seventy large <unk> of water to be put over them , and then , when the water was boiling hot , he caused the principal leaders of the vanquished army to be thrown in headlong and thus scalded to death .
then he marched at once into the country of the enemy , and there took all the women and children , and sent them off to be sold as slaves , and seized the cattle and other property which he found , and carried it off as plunder .
in thus taking possession of the enemy 's property and making it his own , and selling the poor captives into slavery , there was nothing remarkable .
such was the custom of the times .
but the act of scalding his prisoners to death seems to denote or reveal in his character a vein of peculiar and atrocious cruelty .
it is possible , however , that the story may not be true .
it may have been invented by yemuka and sankum , or by some of his other enemies .
for yemuka and sankum , and others who were combined with them , were continually endeavoring to undermine temujin 's influence with vang khan , and thus deprive him of his power .
but he was too strong for them .
his great success in all his military undertakings kept him up in spite of all that his rivals could do to pull him down .
as for vang khan himself , he was in part pleased with him and proud of him , and in part he feared him .
he was very unwilling to be so dependent upon a subordinate chieftain , and yet he could not do without him .
a king never desires that any one of his subjects should become too conspicuous or too great , and vang khan would have been very glad to have diminished , in some way , the power and prestige which temujin had acquired , and which seemed to be increasing every day .
he , however , found no means of effecting this in any quiet and peaceful manner .
temujin was at the head of his troops , generally away from karakorom , where vang khan resided , and he was , in a great measure , independent .
he raised his own recruits to keep the <name> of his army good , and it was always easy to subsist if there chanced to be any failure in the ordinary and regular supplies .
besides , occasions were continually occurring in which vang khan wished for temujin 's aid , and could not dispense with it .
at one time , while engaged in some important campaigns , far away among the mountains , yemuka contrived to awaken so much distrust of temujin in vang khan 's mind , that vang khan secretly <unk> in the night , and marched away to a distant place to save himself from a plot which yemuka had told him that temujin was contriving .
here , however , he was attacked by a large body of his enemies , and was reduced to such straits that he was obliged to send couriers off at once to temujin to come with his <unk> and save him .
temujin came .
he rescued vang khan from his danger , and drove his enemies away .
vang khan was very grateful for this service , so that the two friends became entirely reconciled to each other , and were united more closely than ever , greatly to yemuka 's disappointment and chagrin .
they made a new league of amity , and , to seal and confirm it , they agreed upon a double marriage between their two families .
a son of temujin was to be married to a daughter of vang khan , and a son of vang khan to a daughter of temujin .
this new compact did not , however , last long .
as soon as vang khan found that the danger from which temujin had rescued him was passed , he began again to listen to the representations of yemuka and sankum , who still insisted that temujin was a very dangerous man , and was by no means to be trusted .
they said that he was ambitious and unprincipled , and that he was only waiting for a favorable opportunity to rebel himself against vang khan and depose him from his throne .
they made a great many statements to the khan in confirmation of their opinion , some of which were true doubtless , but many were exaggerated , and others probably false .
they , however , succeeded at last in making such an impression upon the khan 's mind that he finally determined to take measures for putting temujin out of the way .
accordingly , on some pretext or other , he contrived to send temujin away from karakorom , his capital , for temujin was so great a favorite with the <name> guards and with all the garrison of the town , that he did not dare to undertake any thing openly against him there .
vang khan also sent a messenger to temujin 's own country to persuade the chief persons there to join him in his plot .
it <name> be recollected that , at the time that temujin left his own country , when he was about fourteen years old , his mother had married a great chieftain there , named <unk> , and that this <unk> , in conjunction doubtless with temujin 's mother , had been made regent during his absence .
vang khan now sent to <unk> to propose that he should unite with him to destroy temujin .
" you have no interest , " said vang khan in the message that he sent to <unk> , " in taking his part .
it is true that you have married his mother , but , personally , he is nothing to you .
and , if he is once out of the way , you <name> be acknowledged as the grand khan of the monguls in your own right , whereas you now hold your place in subordination to him , and he may at any time return and set you aside altogether . "
vang khan hoped by these arguments to induce <unk> to come and assist him in his plan of putting temujin to death , or , at least , if <unk> would not assist him in <unk> the deed , he thought that , by these arguments , he should induce him to be willing that it should be committed , so that he should himself have nothing to fear afterward from his resentment .
but <unk> received the proposal in a very different way from what vang khan had expected .
he said nothing , but he determined immediately to let temujin know of the danger that he was in .
he accordingly at once set out to go to temujin 's camp to inform him of vang khan 's designs .
in the mean time , vang khan , having matured his plans , made an appointment for temujin to meet him at a certain place designated for the purpose of <unk> the double marriage between their children , which had been before agreed upon .
temujin , not suspecting any treachery , received and entertained the messenger in a very honorable manner , and said that he would come .
after making the necessary preparations , he set out , in company with the messenger and with a grand retinue of his own attendants , to go to the place appointed .
on his way he was met or overtaken by <unk> , who had come to warn him of his danger .
as soon as temujin had heard what his <unk> had to say , he made some excuse for <unk> the journey , and , sending a civil answer to vang khan by the embassador , he ordered him to go forward , and went back himself to his own camp .
this camp was at some distance from karakorom .
vang khan , as has already been stated , had sent temujin away from the capital on account of his being so great a favorite that he was afraid of some tumult if he were to attempt any thing against him there .
temujin was , however , pretty strong in his camp .
the troops that usually attended him were there , with the four <unk> as commanders of the four principal divisions of them .
his old instructor and guardian , <unk> , was with him too .
<unk> , it seems , had continued in temujin 's service up to this time , and was accustomed to accompany him in all his expeditions as his counselor and friend .
when vang khan learned , by the return of his messenger , that temujin declined to come to the place of rendezvous which he had appointed , he concluded at once that he suspected treachery , and he immediately decided that he must now strike a decisive blow without any delay , otherwise temujin would put himself more and more on his guard .
he was not mistaken , it seems , however , in thinking how great a favorite temujin was at karakorom , for his secret design was betrayed to temujin by two of his servants , who overheard him speak of it to one of his wives .
vang khan 's plan was to go out secretly to <unk> camp at the head of an armed force superior to his , and there come upon him and his whole troop suddenly , by surprise , in the night , by which means , he thought , he should easily <unk> the whole encampment , and either kill temujin and his generals , or else make them prisoners .
the two men who betrayed this plan were slaves , who were employed to take care of the horses of some person connected with vang khan 's household , and to render various other services .
their names were <unk> and <unk> .
it seems that these men were one day carrying some milk to vang khan 's house or tent , and there they overheard a conversation between vang khan and his wife , by which they learned the particulars of the plan formed for <unk> destruction .
the expedition was to set out , they heard , on the following morning .
it is not at all surprising that they overheard this conversation , for not only the tents , but even the houses used by these asiatic nations were built of very frail and thin materials , and the partitions were often made of canvas and felt , and other such substances as could have very little power to intercept sound .
the two slaves determined to proceed at once to temujin 's camp and warn him of his danger .
so they stole away from their quarters at nightfall , and , after traveling diligently all night , in the morning they reached the camp and told temujin what they had learned .
temujin was surprised ; but he had been , in some measure , prepared for such intelligence by the communication which his <unk> had made him in respect to vang khan 's treacherous designs a few days before .
he immediately summoned <unk> and some of his other friends , in order to consult in respect to what it was best to do .
it was resolved to elude vang khan 's design by means of a stratagem .
he was to come upon them , according to the account of the slaves , that night .
the preparations for receiving him were consequently to be made at once .
the plan was for temujin and all his troops to withdraw from the camp and conceal themselves in a place of ambuscade near by .
they were to leave a number of men behind , who , when night came on , were to set the lights and <unk> the fires , and put every thing in such a condition as to make it appear that the troops were all there .
their expectation was that , when vang khan should arrive , he would make his assault according to his original design , and then , while his forces were in the midst of the confusion incident to such an onset , temujin was to come forth from his ambuscade and fall upon them .
in this way he hoped to conquer them and put them to flight , although he had every reason to suppose that the force which vang khan would bring out against him would be considerably stronger in <name> than his own .

temujin 's stratagem succeeded admirably .
as soon as he had decided upon it he began to put it into execution .
he caused every thing of value to be taken out of his tent and carried away to a place of safety .
he sent away the women and children , too , to the same place .
he then marshaled all his men , excepting the small guard that he was going to leave behind until evening , and led them off to the ambuscade which he had chosen for them .
the place was about two leagues distant from his camp .
temujin concealed himself here in a narrow <name> among the mountains , not far from the road where vang khan would have to pass along .
the <name> was narrow , and was protected by precipitous rocks on each side .
there was a wood at the entrance to it also , which concealed those that were hidden in it from view , and a <name> which flowed by near the entrance , so that , in going in or coming out , it was necessary to ford the <name> .
temujin , on arriving at the spot , went with all his troops into the <name> , and concealed himself there .
in the mean time , the guard that had been left behind in the camp had been instructed to kindle up the camp-fires as soon as the evening came on , according to the usual custom , and to set lights in the tents , so as to give the camp the appearance , when seen from a little distance in the night , of being occupied , as usual , by the army .
they were to wait , and watch the fires and lights until they perceived signs of the approach of the enemy to attack the camp , when they were secretly to retire on the farther side , and so make their escape .
these preparations , and the march of temujin 's troops to the place of ambuscade , occupied almost the whole of the day , and it was near evening before the last of the troops had entered the <name> .
they had scarce accomplished this manoeuvre before vang khan 's army arrived .
vang khan himself was not with them .
he had intrusted the expedition to the command of sankum and yemuka .
indeed , it is probable that they were the real <unk> and <unk> of it , and that vang khan had only been induced to give his consent to it  and that perhaps reluctantly  by their persuasions .
sankum and yemuka advanced cautiously at the head of their columns , and when they saw the illumination of the camp produced by the lights and the camp-fires , they thought at once that all was right , and that their old enemy and rival was now , at last , within their reach and at their <name> .
they brought up the men as near to the camp as they could come without being observed , and then , drawing their bows and making their arrows ready , they advanced furiously to the onset , and discharged an immense shower of arrows in among the tents .
they expected to see thousands of men come rushing out from the tents , or starting up from the ground at this sudden assault , but , to their utter astonishment , all was as silent and motionless after the falling of the arrows as before .
they then discharged more arrows , and , finding that they could not awaken any signs of life , they began to advance cautiously and enter the camp .
they found , of course , that it had been entirely <unk> .
they then rode round and round the inclosure , examining the ground with <unk> and torches to find the tracks which temujin 's army had made in going away .
the tracks were soon discovered .
those who first saw them immediately set off in pursuit of the fugitives , as they supposed them , shouting , at the same time , for the rest to follow .
some did follow immediately .
others , who had strayed away to greater or less distances on either side of the camp in search of the tracks , fell in by degrees as they received the order , while others still remained among the tents , where they were to be seen riding to and fro , endeavoring to make discoveries , or gathering together in groups to express to one another their astonishment , or to inquire what was next to be done .
they , however , all gradually fell into the ranks of those who were following the track which had been found , and the whole body went on as fast as they could go , and in great confusion .
they all supposed that temujin and his troops were making a precipitate retreat , and were expecting every moment to come up to him in his rear , in which case he would be taken at great disadvantage , and would be easily overwhelmed .
instead of this , temujin was just coming forward from his hiding-place , with his squadrons all in perfect order , and advancing in a firm , steady , and compact column , all being ready at the word of command to charge in good order , but with terrible impetuosity , upon the advancing enemy .
in this way the two armies came together .
the shock of the encounter was terrific .
temujin , as might have been expected , was completely victorious .
the confused masses of vang khan 's army were overborne , thrown into dreadful confusion , and trampled under foot .
great <name> were killed .
those that escaped being killed at once turned and fled .
sankum was wounded in the face by an arrow , but he still was able to keep his seat upon his horse , and so galloped away .
those that succeeded in saving themselves got back as soon as they could into the road by which they came , and so made their way , in detached and open parties , home to karakorom .
of course , after this , vang khan could no longer <unk> his hostility to temujin , and both parties prepared for open war .
the different historians through whom we derive our information in respect to the life and adventures of genghis khan have related the transactions which occurred after this open outbreak between temujin and vang khan somewhat differently .
combining their accounts , we learn that both parties , after the battle , opened negotiations with such neighboring tribes as they supposed likely to take sides in the conflict , each endeavoring to gain as many adherents as possible to his own cause .
temujin obtained the alliance and co-operation of a great number of tartar princes who ruled over hordes that dwelt in that part of the country , or among the mountains around .
some of these chieftains were his relatives .
others were induced to join him by being convinced that he would , in the end , prove to be stronger than vang khan , and being , in some sense , politicians as well as warriors , they wished to be sure of coming out at the close of the contest on the victorious side .
there was a certain khan , named <unk> , who was a relative of temujin , and who commanded a very powerful tribe .
on approaching the confines of his territory , temujin , not being certain of <unk> disposition toward him , sent forward an embassador to announce his approach , and to ask if <unk> still retained the friendship which had long subsisted between them .
<unk> might , perhaps , have hesitated which side to join , but the presence of temujin with his whole troop upon his frontier seems to have determined him , so he sent a favorable answer , and at once espoused temujin 's cause .
many other chieftains joined temujin in much the same way , and thus the forces under his command were constantly increased .
at length , in his progress across the country , he came with his troop of followers to a place where there was a stream of salt or bitter water which was unfit to drink .
temujin encamped on the shores of this stream , and performed a grand ceremony , in which he himself and his allies banded themselves together in the most solemn manner .
in the course of the ceremony a horse was sacrificed on the shores of the stream .
temujin also took up some of the water from the <name> and drank it , <unk> heaven , at the same time , to witness a solemn vow which he made , that , as long as he lived , he would share with his officers and soldiers the bitter as well as the sweet , and <unk> curses upon himself if he should ever violate his oath .
all his allies and officers did the same after him .
[ illustration : drinking the bitter waters . ]
this ceremony was long remembered in the army , all those who had been present and had taken part in it <unk> the recollection of it with pride and pleasure ; and long afterward , when temujin had attained to the height of his power and <name> , his generals considered their having been present at this first solemn league and covenant as conferring upon them a sort of title of nobility , by which they and their descendants were to be distinguished forever above all those whose adhesion to the cause of the conqueror dated from a later time .
by this time temujin began to feel quite strong .
he moved on with his army till he came to the borders of a lake which was not a great way from vang khan 's dominions .
here he encamped , and , before proceeding any farther , he determined to try the effect , upon the mind of vang khan , of a letter of expostulation and remonstrance ; so he wrote to him , substantially , as follows : " a great many years ago , in the time of my father , when you were driven from your throne by your enemies , my father came to your aid , defeated your enemies , and restored you .
" at a later time , after i had come into your dominions , your brother conspired against you with the <unk> and the <unk> .
i defeated them , and helped you to recover your power .
when you were reduced to great distress , i shared with you my flocks and every thing that i had .
" at another time , when you were in circumstances of great danger and distress , you sent to me to ask that my four <unk> might go and rescue you .
i sent them according to your request , and they delivered you from a most imminent danger .
they helped you to conquer your enemies , and to recover an immense booty from them .
" in many other instances , when the khans have combined against you , i have given you most effectual aid in subduing them .
" how is it , then , after receiving all these benefits from me for a period of so many years , that you form plans to destroy me in so base and treacherous a manner ? "
this letter seems to have produced some impression upon vang <unk> mind ; but he was now , it seems , so much under the influence of sankum and yemuka that he could decide nothing for himself .
he sent the letter to sankum to ask him what answer should be returned .
but sankum , in addition to his former feelings of envy and jealousy against temujin , was now irritated and angry in consequence of the wound that he had received , and determined to have his revenge .
he would not hear of any accommodation .
in the mean time , the khans of all the tartar and mongul tribes that lived in the countries bordering on vang khan 's dominions , hearing of the rupture between vang khan and temujin , and aware of the great struggle for the mastery between these two potentates that was about to take place , became more and more interested in the quarrel .
temujin was very active in opening negotiations with them , and in endeavoring to induce them to take his side .
he was a comparatively young and rising man , while vang khan was becoming advanced in years , and was now almost wholly under the influence of sankum and yemuka .
temujin , moreover , had already acquired great fame and great popularity as a commander , and his reputation was increasing every day , while vang khan 's <name> was evidently on the <unk> .
a great number of the khans were , of course , <unk> to take temujin 's side .
others he compelled to join him by force , and others he persuaded by promising to release them from the exactions and the tyranny which vang khan had exercised over them , and declaring that he was a messenger especially sent from heaven to accomplish their deliverance .
those asiatic tribes were always ready to believe in military messengers sent from heaven to make conquests for their benefit .
among other nations who joined temujin at this time were the people of his own country of <unk> proper .
he was received very joyfully by his <unk> , who was in command there , and by all his former subjects , and they all promised to sustain him in the coming war .
after a time , when temujin had by these and similar means greatly increased the number of his adherents , and proportionately strengthened his position , he sent an embassador again to vang khan to propose some accommodation .
vang khan called a council to consider the proposal .
but sankum and yemuka persisted in refusing to allow any accommodation to be made .
they declared that they would not listen to proposals of peace on any other condition than that of the absolute surrender of temujin , and of all who were confederate with him , to vang khan as their lawful sovereign .
sankum himself delivered the message to the embassador .
" tell the rebel monguls , " said he , " that they are to expect no peace but by submitting absolutely to the khan 's <name> ; and as for temujin , i <name> never see him again till i come to him sword in hand to kill him . "
immediately after this sankum and yemuka sent off some small plundering expeditions into the mongul country , but they were driven back by temujin 's troops without effecting their purpose .
the result of these skirmishes was , however , greatly to <unk> both parties , and to lead them to prepare in <name> for open war .
chapter ix .
the death of vang khan .

a grand council was now called of all the confederates who were <unk> with temujin , at a place called <unk> , to make arrangements for a vigorous prosecution of the war .
at this council were convened all the chieftains and khans that had been induced to declare against vang khan .
each one came attended by a considerable body of troops as his escort , and a grand deliberation was held .
some were in favor of trying once more to come to some terms of accommodation with vang khan , but temujin convinced them that there was nothing to be hoped for except on condition of absolute submission , and that , in that case , vang khan would never be content until he had effected the utter ruin of every one who had been engaged in the rebellion .
so it was , at last , decided that every man should return to his own tribe , and there raise as large a force as he could , with a view to carrying on the war with the utmost vigor .
temujin was formally appointed <unk> of the army to be raised .
there was a sort of <unk> or ornamented club , called the <unk> , which it was customary on such occasions to bestow , with great solemnity , on the general thus chosen , as his badge of command .
the <unk> was , in this instance , conferred upon temujin with all the usual ceremonies .
he accepted it on the express condition that every man would punctually and implicitly obey all his orders , and that he should have absolute power to punish any one who should disobey him in the way that he judged best , and that they should submit without question to all his decisions .
to these conditions they all solemnly agreed .
being thus regularly placed in command , temujin began by giving places of honor and authority to those who left vang khan 's service to follow him .
he took this occasion to remember and reward the two slaves who had come to him in the night at his camp , some time before , to give him warning of the design of sankum and yemuka to come and surprise him there .
he gave the slaves their freedom , and made provision for their maintenance as long as they should live .
he also put them on the list of <unk> .
the <unk> were a class of persons upon whom , as a reward for great public services , were conferred certain exclusive rights and privileges .
they had no taxes to pay .
in case of plunder taken from the enemy , they received their full share without any deduction , while all the others were obliged to contribute a portion of their shares for the khan .
the <unk> , too , were allowed various other privileges .
they had the right to go into the presence of the khan at any time , without waiting , as others were obliged to do , till they obtained permission , and , what was more singular still , they were entitled to nine pardons for any offenses that they might commit , so that it was only when they had committed ten <unk> or crimes that they were in danger of punishment the privileges which temujin thus bestowed upon the slaves were to be continued to their descendants to the seventh generation .
temujin rewarded the slaves in this bountiful manner , partly , no doubt , out of sincere gratitude to them for having been the means , probably , of saving him and his army from destruction , and partly for effect , in order to impress upon his followers a strong conviction that any great services rendered to him or to his cause were certain to be well rewarded .
temujin now found himself at the head of a very large body of men , and his first care was to establish a settled system of discipline among them , so that they could act with regularity and order when coming into battle .
he divided his army into three separate bodies .
the centre was composed of his own guards , and was commanded by himself .
the wings were formed of the squadrons of his confederates and allies .
his plan in coming into battle was to send forward the two wings , retaining the centre as a reserve , and hold them prepared to rush in with irresistible power whenever the time should arrive at which their coming would produce the greatest effect .
when every thing was thus arranged , temujin set his army in motion , and began to advance toward the country of vang khan .
the squadrons which composed his immense horde were so numerous that they covered all the plain .
in the mean time vang khan had not been idle .
he , or rather sankum and yemuka , acting in his name , had assembled a great army , and he had set out on his march from karakorom to meet his enemy .
his forces , however , though more numerous , were by no means so well disciplined and arranged as those of temujin .
they were greatly encumbered , too , with baggage , the army being followed in its march by endless trains of wagons conveying provisions , arms , and military stores of all kinds .
its progress was , therefore , necessarily slow , for the troops of horsemen were obliged to regulate their speed by the movement of the wagons , which , on account of the heavy burdens that they contained , and the want of finished roads , was necessarily slow .
the two armies met upon a plain between two rivers , and a most desperate and bloody battle ensued .
<unk> , temujin 's former tutor , led one of the divisions of temujin 's army , and was opposed by yemuka , who headed the wing of vang khan 's army which confronted his division .
the other wings attacked each other , too , in the most furious manner , and for three hours it was doubtful which party would be successful .
at length temujin , who had all this time remained in the background with his reserve , saw that the favorable moment had arrived for him to intervene , and he gave the order for his guards to charge , which they did with such impetuosity as to <name> all before them .
one after another of vang khan 's squadrons was overpowered , thrown into confusion , and driven from the field .
it was not long before vang khan saw that all was lost .
he gave up the contest and fled .
a small troop of horsemen , consisting of his immediate attendants and guards , went with him .
at first the fugitives took the road toward karakorom .
they were , however , so hotly pursued that they were obliged to turn off in another direction , and , finally , vang khan resolved to fly from his own country altogether , and appeal for protection to a certain chieftain , named tayian khan , who ruled over a great horde called the <unk> , one of the most powerful tribes in the country of <unk> .
this tayian was the father of temujin 's first wife , the young <name> to whom he was married during the lifetime of his father , when he was only about fourteen years old .
it was thought strange that vang khan should thus seek refuge among the <unk> , for he had not , for some time past , been on friendly terms either with tayian , the khan , or with the tribe .
there were , in particular , a considerable number of the subordinate chieftains who cherished a deep-seated resentment against him for injuries which he had inflicted upon them and upon their country in former wars .
but all these tartar tribes entertained very high ideas of the obligations of hospitality , and vang khan thought that when the <unk> saw him coming among them , a fugitive and in distress , they would lay aside their animosity , and give him a kind reception .
indeed , tayian himself , on whom , as the head of the tribe , the chief discredit would attach of any evil <unk> a visitor and a guest who had come in his distress to seek hospitality , was inclined , at first , to receive his enemy kindly , and to offer him a refuge .
he debated the matter with the other chieftains after vang khan had entered his dominions and was approaching his camp ; but they were extremely unwilling that any <name> should be shown to their fallen enemy .
they represented to tayian how great an enemy he had always been to them .
they exaggerated the injuries which he had done them , and represented them in their worst light .
they said , moreover , that , by <unk> vang khan , they should only involve themselves in a war with temujin , who would undoubtedly follow his enemy into their country , and would greatly resent any attempt on their part to protect him .
these considerations had great effect on the mind of tayian , but still he could not bring himself to give his formal consent to any act of hostility against vang khan .
so the other chieftains held a council among themselves to consider what they should do .
they resolved to take upon themselves the responsibility of slaying vang khan .
" we can not induce tayian openly to authorize it , " they said , " but he secretly desires it , and he <name> be glad when it is done . "
tayian knew very well what course things were taking , though he pretended not to know , and so allowed the other chiefs to go on in their own way .
they accordingly fitted out a troop , and two of the chieftains  the two who felt the most bitter and determined hatred against vang khan  placing themselves at the head of it , set off to intercept him .
he had lingered on the way , it seems , after entering the <unk> territory , in order to learn , before he advanced too far , what reception he was likely to meet with .
the troop of <unk> came suddenly upon him in his encampment , slew all his attendants , and , seizing vang khan , they cut off his head .
they left the body where it lay , and carried off the head to show it to tayian .
tayian was secretly pleased , and he could not quite conceal the gratification which the death of his old enemy afforded him .
he even addressed the head in words of scorn and spite , which revealed the exultation that he felt at the downfall of his rival .
then , however , checking himself , he blamed the chieftains for killing him .
" considering his venerable age , " said he , " and his past greatness and renown as a <name> and commander , you would have done much better to have acted as his guards than as his executioners . "
tayian ordered the head to be treated with the utmost respect .
after properly preparing it , by some process of drying and preserving , he caused it to be inclosed in a case of silver , and set in a place of honor .
while the preparations for this sort of <unk> were making , the head was an object of a very solemn and mysterious interest for all the horde .
they said that the tongue thrust itself several times out of the mouth , and the soothsayers , who watched the changes with great attention , <name> from them important <unk> in respect to the coming events of the war .
these <unk> were strongly in favor of the increasing prosperity and power of temujin .
sankum , the son of vang khan , was killed in the battle , but yemuka escaped .

in the mean time , while these events had been occurring in the country of the <unk> , whither vang khan had fled , temujin was carrying all before him in the country of vang khan .
his victory in the battle was complete ; and it must have been a very great battle , if any reliance is to be placed on the accounts given of the number slain , which it was said amounted to forty thousand .
these <name> are , however , greatly exaggerated .
and then , besides , the number slain in such barbarian conflicts was always much greater , in proportion to the <name> engaged , than it is in the <unk> warfare of civilized nations in modern times .
at all events , temujin gained a very grand and decisive victory .
he took a great many prisoners and a great deal of plunder .
all those trains of wagons fell into his hands , and the contents of many of them were extremely valuable .
he took also a great number of horses .
most of these were horses that had belonged to the men who were killed or who had been made prisoners .
all the best troops that remained of vang khan 's army after the battle also went over to his side .
they considered that vang khan 's power was now entirely overthrown , and that thenceforth temujin would be the acknowledged ruler of the whole country .
they were accordingly ready at once to transfer their allegiance to him .
very soon temujin received the news of vang khan 's death from his father-in-law tayian , and then proceeded with more vigor than before to take possession of all his dominions .
the khans who had formerly served under vang khan sent in their adhesion to him one after another .
they not only knew that all farther resistance would be useless , but they were , in fact , well pleased to transfer their allegiance to their old friend and favorite .
temujin made a sort of triumphal march through the country , being received every where with rejoicings and acclamations of welcome .
his old enemies , sankum and yemuka , had disappeared .
yemuka , who had been , after all , the leading spirit in the opposition to temujin , still held a body of armed men together , consisting of all the troops that he had been able to rally after the battle , but it was not known exactly where he had gone .
the other relatives and friends of vang khan went over to <unk> side without any delay .
indeed , they vied with each other to see who should most recommend themselves to his favor .
a brother of vang khan , who was an influential and powerful chieftain , came among the rest to tender his services , and , by way of a present to conciliate <unk> good <name> , he brought him his daughter , whom he offered to temujin as an addition to the number of his wives .
temujin received the brother very kindly .
he accepted the present which he brought him of his daughter , but , as he had already plenty of wives , and as one of his principal officers , the captain of his guards , seemed to take a special fancy to her , he very generously , as was thought , passed over the young <name> to him .
of course , the young <name> herself had nothing to say in the case .
she was obliged to acquiesce <unk> in any arrangement which her father and the other khans thought proper to make in respect to the disposal of her .
the name of the <name> her father was <unk> .
he came into <unk> camp with many misgivings , fearing that , as he was a brother of vang khan , temujin might feel a special resentment against him , and , perhaps , refuse to accept his submission and his proffered presents .
when , therefore , he found how kindly he was received , his mind was greatly relieved , and he asked temujin to appoint him to some command in his army .
temujin replied that he would do it with great pleasure , and the more readily because it was the brother of vang khan who asked it .
" indeed , " said he to <unk> , " i owe you all the kind treatment in my power for your brother 's sake , in return for the succor and protection for which i was indebted to him , in my misfortunes , in former times , when he received me , a fugitive and an exile , at his court , and bestowed upon me so many favors .
i have never forgotten , and never shall forget , the great obligations i am under to him ; and although in later years he turned against me , still i have never blamed either him or his son sankum for this , but have constantly attributed it to the false representations and evil influence of yemuka , who has always been my implacable enemy .
i do not , therefore , feel any resentment against vang khan for having thus turned against me , nor do i any the less respect his memory on that account ; and i am very glad that an opportunity now occurs for me to make , through you , his brother , some small acknowledgment of the debt of gratitude which i owe him . "
so temujin gave <unk> an honorable post in his army , and treated him in all respects with great consideration .
if he acted usually in this generous manner , it is not at all surprising that he acquired that boundless influence over the minds of his followers which aided him so essentially in attaining his subsequent greatness and renown .
in the mean time , although sankum was killed , yemuka had succeeded in making his escape , and , after meeting with various adventures , he finally reached the country of tayian .
he led with him there all that portion of vang khan 's army that had saved themselves from being killed or made prisoners , and also a great number of officers .
these broken troops yemuka had reorganized , as well as he could , by collecting the scattered remnants and <unk> the broken squadrons , and in this manner , accompanied by such of the sick and wounded as were able to ride , had arrived in tayian 's dominions .
he was known to be a general of great abilities , and he was very favorably received in tayian 's court .
indeed , tayian , having heard rumors of the rapid manner in which temujin was extending his conquests and his power , began to be somewhat jealous of him , and to think that it was time for him to take measures to prevent this aggrandizement of his son-in-law from going too far .
of course , tayian held a great many conversations with yemuka in respect to temujin 's character and schemes .
these yemuka took care to represent in the most unfavorable light , in order to increase as much as possible tayian 's feelings of suspicion and jealousy .
he represented temujin as a very ambitious man , full of schemes for his own aggrandizement , and without any sentiments of gratitude or of honor to restrain him in the execution of them .
he threw wholly upon him the responsibility of the war with vang khan .
it grew , he said , out of plots which temujin had formed to destroy both vang khan and his son , notwithstanding the great obligations he had been under to them for their kindness to him in his misfortunes .
yemuka urged tayian also to arouse himself , before it was too late , to guard himself from the danger .
" he is your son , it is true , " said he , " and he professes to be your friend , but he is so treacherous and unprincipled that you can place no reliance upon him whatever , and , notwithstanding all your past kindness to him , and the tie of relationship which ought to bind him to you , he <name> as readily form plans to compass your destruction as he would that of any other man the moment he imagines that you stand in the way of the accomplishment of his ambitious schemes . "
these representations , acting upon tayian 's natural apprehensions and fears , produced a very sensible effect , and at length tayian was induced to take some measures for defending himself from the threatened danger .
so he opened negotiations with the khans of various tribes which he thought likely to join him , and soon formed quite a powerful league of the enemies of temujin , and of all who were willing to join in an attempt to restrict his power .
these steps were all taken with great secrecy , for yemuka and tayian were very desirous that temujin should know nothing of the league which they were forming against him until their arrangements were fully matured , and they were ready for action .
they did not , however , succeed in keeping the secret as long as they intended .
they were generally careful not to propose to any khan or chieftain to join them in their league until they had first fully ascertained that he was favorable to the object of it .
but , growing less cautious as they went on , they at last made a mistake .
tayian sent proposals to a certain <name> or khan , named <unk> , inviting him to join the league .
these proposals were contained in a letter which was sent by a special messenger .
the letter specified all the particulars of the league , with a statement of the plans which the allies were intending to pursue , and an enumeration of the principal khans or tribes that were already engaged .
now it happened that this <unk> , who reigned over a nation of numerous and powerful tribes on the confines of <name> , was , for some reason or other , inclined to take temujin 's side in the quarrel .
so he detained the messenger who brought the letter as a prisoner , and sent the letter itself , containing all the particulars of the conspiracy , at once to temujin .
temujin was greatly surprised at receiving the intelligence , for , up to that moment , he had considered his father-in-law tayian as one of his best and most trustworthy friends .
he immediately called a grand council of war to consider what was to be done .
temujin had a son named jughi , who had now grown up to be a young man .
jughi 's father thought it was now time for his son to begin to take his place and act his part among the other princes and chieftains of his court , and he accordingly gave him a seat at this council , and thus publicly recognized him , for the first time , as one of the chief personages of the state .
the council , after hearing a statement of the case in respect to the league which tayian and the others were forming , were strongly inclined to combine their forces and march at once to attack the enemy before their plans should be more fully matured .
but there was a difficulty in respect to horses .
the horses of the different hordes that belonged to temujin 's army had become so much exhausted by the long marches and other fatigues that they had undergone in the late campaigns , that they would not be in a fit condition to commence a new expedition until they had had some time to rest and recruit .
but a certain khan , named <unk> , an uncle of temujin 's , at once removed this objection by offering to furnish a full supply of fresh horses for the whole army from his own herds .
this circumstance shows on what an immense scale the pastoral occupations of the great asiatic chieftains were conducted in those days .
temujin accepted this offer on the part of his uncle , and preparations were immediately made for the marching of the expedition .
as soon as the news of these preparations reached yemuka , he urged tayian to assemble the allied troops immediately , and go out to meet temujin and his army before they should cross the frontier .
" it is better , " said he , addressing tayian , " that you should meet and fight him on his own ground , rather than to wait until he has crossed the frontier and commenced his ravages in yours . "
" no , " said tayian , in reply , " it is better to wait .
the farther he advances on his march , the more his horses and his men <name> be spent with fatigue , the <unk> <name> be their supplies , and the more difficult <name> he find it to effect his retreat after we shall have gained a victory over him in battle . "
so tayian , though he began to assemble his forces , did not advance ; and when temujin , at the head of his host , reached the <unk> frontier  for the country over which tayian reigned was called the country of the <unk>  he was surprised to find no enemy there to defend it .
he was the more surprised at this from the circumstance that the frontier , being formed by a river , might have been very easily defended .
but when he arrived at the bank of the river the way was clear .
he immediately crossed the stream with all his forces , and then marched on into the <unk> territory .
temujin took good care , as he advanced , to guard against the danger into which tayian had predicted that he would fall  that of exhausting the strength of his men and of his animals , and also his stores of food .
he took good care to provide and to take with him abundant supplies , and also to advance so carefully and by such easy stages as to keep both the men and the horses fresh and in full strength all the way .
in this order and condition he at last arrived at the spot where tayian had formed his camp and assembled his armies .
both sides immediately marshaled their troops in order of battle .
yemuka was chief in command on tayian 's side .
he was assisted by a young <name> , the son of tayian , whose name was kushluk .
on the other hand , jughi , the young son of temujin , who had been brought forward at the council , was appointed to a very prominent position on his father 's side .
indeed , these two young princes , who were animated by an intense feeling of rivalry and emulation toward each other , were appointed to lead the van on their respective sides in commencing the battle ; jughi advancing first to the attack , and being met by kushluk , to whom was committed the charge of <unk> him .
the two princes fought throughout the battle with the utmost bravery , and both of them acquired great renown .
the battle was commenced early in the morning and continued all day .
in the end , temujin was completely victorious .
tayian was mortally wounded early in the day .
he was immediately taken off the field , and every possible effort was made to save his life , but he soon ceased to breathe .
his son , the <name> kushluk , fought valiantly during the whole day , but toward night , finding that all was lost , he fled , taking with him as many of the troops as he could succeed in getting together in the confusion , and at the head of this band made the best of his way into the dominions of one of his uncles , his father's brother , where he hoped to find a temporary shelter until he should have time to determine what was to be done .
as for yemuka , after fighting with desperate fury all day , he was at last , toward night , surrounded and overpowered , and so made prisoner .
temujin ordered his head to be cut off immediately after the battle was over .
he considered him , not as an honorable and open foe , but rather as a rebel and traitor , and , consequently , <unk> of any <name> .

there was now a vast extent of country , comprising a very large portion of the interior of the asiatic continent , and , indeed , an immense number of wealthy , powerful hordes , under temujin 's dominion , and he at once resolved to <unk> his dominion by organizing a regular imperial government over the whole .
there were a few more battles to be fought in order to subdue certain khans who still resisted , and some cities to be taken .
but these victories were soon obtained , and , in a very short time after the great battle with tayian , temujin found himself the undisputed master of what to him was almost the whole known world .
all open opposition to his rule had wholly disappeared , and nothing now remained for him to do but to perfect the organization of his army , to <unk> his code of laws , to determine upon his capital , and to <unk> generally a system of civil government such as is required for the management of the internal affairs of a great empire .
temujin determined upon making karakorom his capital .
he accordingly proceeded to that city at the head of his troops , and entered it in great state .
here he established a very brilliant court , and during all the following <name> , while he was occupied with the preliminary arrangements for the organization and consolidation of his empire , there came to him there a continual succession of embassadors from the various nations and tribes of central <name> to congratulate him on his victories , and to offer the allegiance or the alliance of the khans which they respectively represented .
these embassadors all came attended by troops of horsemen splendidly dressed and fully armed , and the gayety and magnificence of the scenes which were witnessed in karakorom during the <name> surpassed all that had ever been seen there before .
in the mean time , while the attention of the masses of the people was occupied and amused by these parades , temujin was revolving in his mind the form of constitution which he should establish for his empire , and the system of laws by which his people should be governed .
he conferred privately with some of his ablest counselors on this subject , and caused a system of government and a code of laws to be drawn up by secretaries .
the details of these proposed <unk> were discussed in the privy council , and , when the whole had been well digested and matured , temujin , early in the spring , sent out a summons , calling upon all the great princes and khans throughout his dominions to assemble at an appointed day , in order that he might lay his proposed system before them .
temujin determined to make his government a sort of elective monarchy .
the grand khan was to be chosen by the votes of all the other khans , who were to be assembled in a general <unk> for this purpose whenever a new khan was to be installed .
any person who should cause himself to be proclaimed grand khan , or who should in any other way attempt to assume the supreme authority without having been duly elected by the other khans , was to suffer death .
the country was divided into provinces , over each of which a subordinate khan ruled as governor .
these governors were , however , to be strictly responsible to the grand khan .
whenever summoned by the grand khan they were required to repair at once to the capital , there to render an account of their administration , and to answer any charges which had been made against them .
whenever any serious case of disobedience or <unk> was proved against them they were to suffer death .
temujin <unk> and reorganized the army on the same or similar principles .
the men were divided into companies of about one hundred men each , and every ten of these companies was formed into a regiment , which , of course , contained about a thousand men .
the regiments were formed into larger bodies of about ten thousand each .
officers were appointed , of all the various necessary grades , to command these troops , and arrangements were made for having supplies of arms and ammunition provided and stored in magazines under the care of the officers , ready to be distributed to the men whenever they should require .
temujin also made provision for the building of cities and palaces , the making of roads , and the construction of fortifications , by <unk> that all the people should work one day in every week on these public works whenever required .
although the country over which this new government was to be established was now at peace , temujin was very desirous that the people should not lose the martial spirit which had thus far characterized them .
he made laws to encourage and regulate hunting , especially the hunting of wild beasts among the mountains ; and subsequently he organized many hunting excursions himself , in connection with the lords of his court and the other great chieftains , in order to awaken an interest in the dangers and excitements of the <name> among all the khans .
he also often employed bodies of troops in these expeditions , which he considered as a sort of substitute for war .
he required that none of the natives of the country should be employed as servants , or allowed to perform any menial duties whatever .
for these purposes the people were required to depend on captives taken in war and <unk> .
one reason why he made this rule was to stimulate the people on the frontiers to make hostile excursions among their neighbors , in order to supply themselves and the country generally with slaves .
the right of property in the slaves thus taken was very strictly guarded , and very severe laws were made to enforce it .
it was forbidden , on pain of death , to harbor a slave , or give him meat or drink , clothing or shelter , without permission from his master .
the penalty was death , too , if a person meeting a fugitive slave neglected to seize and secure him , and deliver him to his master .
every man could marry as many wives as he pleased , and his female slaves were all , by law , entirely at his disposal to be made <unk> .
there was one very curious arrangement , which grew out of the great importance which , as we have already seen , was attached to the ties of relationship and family connection among these pastoral nations .
two families could bind themselves together and make themselves legally one , in respect to their connection , by a fictitious marriage arranged between children no longer living .
in such a case the contracts were regularly made , just as if the children were still alive , and the ceremonies were all duly performed .
after this the two families were held to be legally allied , and they were bound to each other by all the obligations which would have arisen in the case of a real marriage .
this custom is said to be continued among some of the tartar nations to the present day .
the people think , it is said , that such a wedding ceremony , duly <unk> by the parents of children who are dead , takes effect upon the subjects of it in the world of spirits , and that thus their union , though arranged and consecrated on earth , is confirmed and consummated in heaven .
besides these peculiar and special <unk> , there were the ordinary laws against robbery , theft , murder , <unk> , and false witness .
the penalties for these offenses were generally severe .
the punishment for stealing cattle was death .
for petty thefts the criminal was to be beaten with a stick , the number of the blows being proportioned to the nature and <unk> of the offense .
he could , however , if he had the means , buy himself off from this punishment by paying nine times the value of the thing stolen .
in respect to religion , the constitution which temujin made declared that there was but one god , the creator of heaven and earth , and it acknowledged him as the supreme ruler and governor of all mankind , the being " who alone gives life and death , riches and poverty , who grants and denies whatever he pleases , and exercises over all things an absolute power . "
this one fundamental article of <name> was all that was required .
for the rest , temujin left the various nations and tribes throughout his dominions to adopt such modes of worship and to celebrate such religious rites as they severally preferred , and forbade that any one should be disturbed or molested in any way on account of his religion , whatever form it might assume .
at length the time arrived for the grand assembly of the khans to be convened .
the meeting was called , not at karakorom , the capital , but at a central spot in the interior of the country , called <unk> <unk> .
such a spot was much more convenient than any town or city would have been for the place of meeting , on account of the great troops of horses and the herds of animals by which the khans were always accompanied in all their expeditions , and which made it necessary that , whenever any considerable number of them were to be convened , the place chosen should be suitable for a grand encampment , with extensive and fertile <unk> extending all around .
as the several khans came in , each at the head of his own troop of retainers and followers , they severally chose their ground , pitched their tents , and turned their herds of horses , sheep , and oxen out to pasture on the plains .
thus , in the course of a few days , the whole country in every direction became dotted with villages of tents , among which groups of horsemen were now and then to be seen galloping to and fro , and small herds of cattle , each under the care of herdsmen and slaves , moved slowly , cropping the grass as they advanced along the hill-sides and through the valleys .
at length , when all had assembled , a spot was selected in the centre of the encampment for the performance of the ceremonies .
a raised seat was prepared for temujin in a situation suitable to enable him to address the assembly from it .
[ c ] before and around this the various khans and their attendants and followers gathered , and temujin made them an oration , in which he explained the circumstances under which they had come together , and announced to them his plans and intentions in respect to the future .
he stated to them that , in consequence of the victories which he had gained through their co-operation and assistance , the foundation of a great empire had been laid , and that he had now called them together in order that they might join with him in organizing the requisite government for such a dominion , and in <unk> a <name> or sovereign to rule over it .
he called upon them first to proceed to the election of this ruler .
[ footnote c : see frontispiece . ]
the khans accordingly proceeded to the election .
this was , in fact , only a form , for temujin himself was , of course , to be chosen .
the election was , however , made , and one of the oldest and most venerable of the khans was commissioned to announce the result .
he came forward with great solemnity , and , in the presence of the whole assembly , declared that the choice had fallen upon temujin .
he then made an address to temujin himself , who was seated during this part of the ceremony upon a carpet of black felt spread upon the ground .
in the address the khan reminded temujin that the exalted authority with which he was now invested came from god , and that to god he was responsible for the right exercise of his power .
if he governed his subjects well , god , he said , would render his reign prosperous and happy ; but if , on the other hand , he abused his power , he would come to a miserable end .
after the conclusion of the address , seven of the khans , who had been designated for this purpose , came and lifted temujin up and bore him away to a throne which had been set up for him in the midst of the assembly , where all the khans , and their various bodies of attendants , came and offered him their homage .
among others there came a certain old prophet , named <unk> , who was held in great veneration by all the people on account of his supposed inspiration and the austere life which he led .
he used to go very thinly clad , and with his feet bare summer and <name> , and it was supposed that his power of enduring the exposures to which he was thus subject was something miraculous and divine .
he had received accordingly from the people a name which signified the image of god , and he was every where looked upon as inspired .
he said , moreover , that a white horse came to him from time to time and carried him up to heaven , where he conversed face to face with god , and received the revelations which he was commissioned to make to men .
all this the people fully believed .
the man may have been an impostor , or he may have been insane .
<unk> , in such cases , the inspiration which the person supposes he is the subject of arises from a certain spiritual exaltation , which , though it does not wholly unfit him for the ordinary avocations and duties of life , still <unk> upon insanity , and often finally lapses into it entirely .
this old prophet advanced toward temujin while he was seated on his carpet of felt , and made a solemn address to him in the hearing of all the assembled khans .
he was charged , he said , with a message from heaven in respect to the kingdom and dominion of temujin , which had been , he declared , ordained of god , and had now been established in fulfillment of the divine <name> .
he was commissioned , moreover , he said , to give to temujin the style and title of genghis khan , [ d ] and to declare that his kingdom should not only endure while he lived , but should descend to his posterity , from generation to generation , to the remotest times .
[ footnote d : the signification of these words , in the language of the monguls , was great khan of khans . ]
the people , on hearing this address , at once adopted the name which the prophet had given to their new ruler , and saluted temujin with it in long and loud acclamations .
it was thus that our hero received the name of genghis khan , which soon extended its fame through every part of <name> , and has since become so greatly renowned through all the world .
* * * * * temujin , or genghis khan , as we must now henceforth call him , having thus been proclaimed by the acclamations of the people under the new title with which the old prophet had invested him , sat upon his throne while his subjects came to render him their homage .
first the khans themselves came up , and kneeled nine times before him , in token of their absolute and complete submission to his authority .
after they had retired the people themselves came , and made their obeisance in the same manner .
as they rose from their knees after the last prostration , they made the air resound once more with their shouts , crying " long live great genghis khan ! "
in repeated and prolonged acclamations .
after this the new emperor made what might be called his <unk> address .
the khans and their followers gathered once more before his throne while he delivered an oration to them , in which he thanked them for the honor which they had done him in raising him to the supreme power , and announced to them the principles by which he should be guided in the government of his empire .
he promised to be just in his dealings with his subjects , and also to be merciful .
he would defend them , he said , against all their enemies .
he would do every thing in his power to promote their comfort and happiness .
he would lead them to honor and <name> , and would make their names known throughout the earth .
he would deal impartially , too , with all the different tribes and hordes , and would treat the monguls and the tartars , the two great classes of his subjects , with equal favor .
when the speech was concluded genghis khan distributed presents to all the subordinate khans , both great and small .
he also made magnificent entertainments , which were continued for several days .
after thus spending some time in feasting and rejoicings , the khans one after another took their leave of the emperor , the great encampment was broken up , and the different tribes set out on their return to their several homes .

after the ceremonies of the inauguration were concluded , genghis khan returned , with the officers of his court and his immediate followers , to karakorom .
this town , though nominally the capital of the empire , was , after all , quite an insignificant place .
indeed , but little importance was attached to any villages or towns in those days , and there were very few fixed places of residence that were of any considerable account .
the reason is , that towns are the seats of commerce and manufactures , and they derive their chief importance from those pursuits ; whereas the monguls and tartars led almost exclusively a wandering and pastoral life , and all their ideas of wealth and grandeur were associated with great flocks and herds of cattle , and handsome tents , and long trains of wagons loaded with stores of clothing , arms , and other <unk> , and vast encampments in the neighborhood of <name> and extended <unk> .
those who lived permanently in fixed houses they looked down upon as an inferior class , confined to one spot by their poverty or their toil , while they themselves could roam at <name> with their flocks and herds over the plains , riding fleet horses or <unk> , and <unk> where they pleased in the green valleys or on the banks of the meandering streams .
karakorom was accordingly by no means a great and splendid city .
it was surrounded by what was called a mud wall  that is , a wall made of blocks of <name> dried in the sun .
the houses of the inhabitants were mere hovels , and even the palace of the king , and all the other public buildings , were of very frail construction ; for all the architecture of the monguls in those days took its character from the tent , which was the type and model , so to speak , of all other buildings .
the new emperor , however , did not spend a great deal of his time at karakorom .
he was occupied for some years in making excursions at the head of his troops to various parts of his dominions , for the purpose of putting down insurrections , <unk> discontented and <unk> khans , and settling disputes of various kinds arising between the different hordes .
in these expeditions he was accustomed to move by easy marches across the plains at the head of his army , and sometimes would establish himself in a sort of permanent camp , where he would remain , perhaps , as in a fixed residence , for weeks or months at a time .
not only genghis khan himself , but many of the other great chieftains , were accustomed to live in this manner , and one of their encampments , if we could have seen it , would have been regarded by us as a great curiosity .
the ground was regularly laid out , like a town , into quarters , squares , and streets , and the space which it covered was sometimes so large as to extend nearly a mile in each direction .
the tent of the khan himself was in the centre .
a space was reserved for it there large enough not only for the grand tent itself , but also for the rows of smaller tents near , for the wives and for other women belonging to the khan 's family , and also for the rows of carts or wagons containing the stores of provisions , the supplies of clothing and arms , and the other valuables which these wandering chieftains always took with them in all their <unk> .
the tent of the khan in summer was made of a sort of calico , and in <name> of felt , which was much warmer .
it was raised very high , so as to be seen above all the rest of the encampment , and it was painted in <name> colors , and adorned with other barbaric decorations .
the dwellings in which the women were lodged , which were around or near the great tent , were sometimes tents , and sometimes little huts made of wood .
when they were of wood they were made very light , and were constructed in such a manner that they could be taken to pieces at the shortest notice , and packed on carts or wagons , in order to be transported to the next place of encampment , whenever , for any reason , it became necessary for their lord and master to remove his <unk> to a different ground .
a large portion of the country which was included within the limits of genghis khan 's dominions was fertile ground , which produced abundance of grass for the pasturage of the flocks and herds , and many springs and streams of water .
there were , however , several districts of mountainous country , which were the refuge of tigers , <unk> , wolves , and other ferocious beasts of prey .
it was among these mountains that the great hunting parties which genghis khan organized from time to time went in search of their game .
there was a great officer of the kingdom , called the grand huntsman , who had the superintendence and charge of every thing relating to hunting and to game throughout the empire .
the grand huntsman was an officer of the very highest rank .
he even took precedence of the first ministers of state .
genghis khan appointed his son jughi , who has already been mentioned in connection with the great council of war called by his father , and with the battle which was subsequently fought , and in which he gained great renown , to the office of grand huntsman , and , at the same time , made two of the older and more experienced khans his ministers of state .
the hunting of wild beasts as ferocious as those that infested the mountains of <name> is a very dangerous amusement even at the present day , notwithstanding the advantage which the huntsman derives from the use of gunpowder , and rifled barrels , and <unk> bullets .
but in those days , when the huntsman had no better weapons than bows and arrows , javelins , and spears , the undertaking was dangerous in the extreme .
an african lion of full size used to be considered as a match for forty men in the days when only ordinary weapons were used against him , and it was considered almost hopeless to attack him with less than that number .
and even with that number to <unk> and assail him he was not usually conquered until he had killed or disabled two or three of his foes .
now , however , with the terrible artillery invented in modern times , a single man , if he has the requisite courage , coolness , and steadiness of nerve , is a match for such a lion .
the weapon used is a double-barreled <unk> , both barrels being rifled , that is , provided with spiral grooves within , that operate to give the bullets a <unk> motion as they issue from the muzzle , by which they bore their way through the air , as it were , to their destination , with a surprising directness and precision .
the bullets discharged by these <unk> are not balls , but cylinders , pointed with a cone at the forward end .
they are hollow , and are filled with a <unk> composition which is capable of exploding with a force vastly greater than that of gunpowder .
the conical point at the end is made separate from the body of the cylinder , and slides into it by a sort of <unk> , which , when the bullet strikes the body of the lion or other wild beast , acts like a sort of <unk> cap to explode the <unk> powder , and thus the instant that the missile enters the animal 's body it bursts with a terrible explosion , and <unk> the iron fragments of the cylinder among his vitals .
thus , while an ordinary musket ball might lodge in his flesh , or even pass entirely through some parts of his body , without producing any other effect than to arouse him to a phrensy , and <unk> the force with which he would spring upon his foe , the bursting of one of these <unk> bullets almost any where within his body brings him down in an instant , and leaves him writhing and rolling upon the ground in the agonies of death .
on the boulevard des <unk> , in <name> , is the manufactory of <unk> , who makes these <unk> for the <unk> of algiers .
<unk> , in passing by his windows , stop to look at specimens of these bullets exhibited there .
they are of various sizes , adapted to barrels of different bores .
some are entire ; others are rent and torn in pieces , having been fired into a bank of earth , that they might burst there as they would do in the body of a wild beast , and then be recovered and preserved to show the effect of the explosion .
even with such terrible weapons as these , it requires at the present day great courage , great coolness , and very extraordinary steadiness of nerve to face a lion or a tiger in his mountain <unk> , with any <name> of coming off victorious in the contest .
but the danger was , of course , infinitely greater in the days of genghis khan , when pikes and spears , and bows and arrows , were the only weapons with which the body of huntsmen could arm themselves for the combat .
indeed , in those days wild beasts were even in some respects more formidable enemies than men .
for men , however excited by angry passions , are , in some degree , under the influence of fear .
they <name> not rush headlong upon absolute and certain destruction , but may be driven back by a mere display of force , if it is obvious that it is a force which they are wholly incapable of resisting .
thus a party of men , however desperate , may be attacked without much danger to the assailants , provided that the force which the assailants bring against them is overwhelming .
but it is not so with wild beasts .
a lion , a tiger , or a panther , once aroused , is wholly insensible to fear .
he <name> rush headlong upon his foes , however numerous they may be , and however <unk> armed .
he makes his own destruction sure , it is true , but , at the same time , he renders almost inevitable the destruction of some one or more of his enemies , and , in going out to attack him , no one can be sure of not becoming himself one of the victims of his fury .
thus the hunting of wild beasts in the mountains was very dangerous work , and it is not surprising that the office of grand huntsman was one of great consideration and honor .
the hunting was , however , not all of the dangerous character above described .
some animals are timid and inoffensive by nature , and attempt to save themselves only by flight .
such animals as these were to be pursued and overtaken by the superior speed of horses and dogs , or to be <unk> by stratagem .
there was a species of deer , in certain parts of the mongul country , that the huntsmen were accustomed to take in this way , namely : the huntsmen , when they began to draw near to a place where a herd of deer were feeding , would divide themselves into two parties .
one party would provide themselves with the antlers of stags , which they arranged in such a manner that they could hold them up over their heads in the thickets , as if real stags were there .
the others , armed with bows and arrows , javelins , spears , and other such weapons , would place themselves in ambush near by .
those who had the antlers would then make a sort of cry , imitating that uttered by the <unk> .
the stags of the herd , hearing the cry , would immediately come toward the spot .
the men in the thicket then would raise the antlers and move them about , so as to deceive the stags , and excite their feelings of rivalry and ire , while those who were appointed to that office continued to counterfeit the cry of the hind .
the stags immediately would begin to paw the ground and to prepare for a conflict , and then , while their attention was thus wholly taken up by the tossing of the false antlers in the thicket , the men in ambush would creep up as near as they could , take good aim , and shoot their poor <unk> victims through the heart .
of course , it required a great deal of practice and much skill to perform successfully such feats as these ; and there were many other branches of the huntsman 's <name> , as practiced in those days , which could only be acquired by a systematic and special course of training .
one of the most difficult things was to train the horses so that they would advance to meet tigers and other wild beasts without fear .
horses have naturally a strong and instinctive terror for such beasts , and this terror it was very difficult to overcome .
the mongul huntsmen , however , contrived means to inspire the horses with so much courage in this respect that they would advance to the encounter of these terrible foes with as much ardor as a trained charger shows in advancing to meet other horses and horsemen on the field of battle .
besides the mountainous regions above described , there were several deserts in the country of the monguls .
the greatest of these deserts extends through the very heart of <name> , and is one of the most extensive districts of barren land in the world .
unlike most other great deserts , however , the land is very elevated , and it is to this elevation that its barrenness is , in a great measure , due .
a large part of this desert consists of rocks and barren sands , and , in the time of which we are writing , was totally <unk> .
it was so cold , too , on account of the great elevation of the land , that it was almost impossible to traverse it except in the warmest season of the year .
other parts of this district , which were not so elevated , and where the land was not quite so barren , produced grass and herbage on which the flocks and herds could feed , and thus , in certain seasons of the year , people resorted to them for pasturage .
throughout the whole country there were no extensive forests .
there were a few tangled thickets among the mountains , where the wild beasts concealed themselves and made their lairs , but this was all .
one reason why forests did not spring up was , as is supposed , the custom of the people to burn over the plains every spring , as the indians were accustomed to do on the american prairies .
in the spring the dead grass of the preceding year lay dry and withered , and sometimes closely matted together , on the ground , thus <unk> , as the people thought , the fresh grass from growing up .
so the people were accustomed , on some spring morning when there was a good breeze blowing , to set it on fire .
the fire would run rapidly over the plains , burning up every thing in its way that was above the ground .
but the roots of the grass , being below , were safe from it .
very soon afterward the new grass would spring up with great luxuriance .
the people thought that the <name> verdure which the new grass displayed , and its subsequent rapid growth , were owing simply to the fact that the old dead grass was out of the way .
it is now known , however , that the burning of the old grass leaves an ash upon the ground which acts powerfully as a <unk> , and that the richness of the fresh vegetation is due , in a great measure , to this cause .
such was the country which was inhabited by the wandering pastoral tribes that were now under the sway of genghis khan .
his dominion had no settled boundaries , for it was a dominion over certain tribes rather than over a certain district of country .
nearly all the tribes composing both the mongul and the tartar nations had now submitted to him , though he still had some small wars to wage from time to time with some of the more distant tribes before his authority was fully and finally acknowledged .
the history of some of these conflicts <name> be narrated in the next chapter .

<name> kushluk , as the reader <name> perhaps recollect , was the son of tayian , the khan of the <unk> , who organized the grand league of khans against temujin at the <unk> of yemuka , as related in a preceding chapter .
he was the young <name> who was opposed to jughi , the son of temujin , in the great final battle .
the reader <name> recollect that in that battle tayian himself was slain , as was also yemuka , but the young <name> succeeded in making his escape .
he was accompanied in his flight by a certain general or chieftain named tukta bey .
this tukta bey was the khan of a powerful tribe .
the name of the town or village which he considered his capital was <unk> .
it was situated toward the southwest , not far from the borders of <name> .
tukta bey , taking kushluk with him , retreated to this place , and there began to make preparations to collect a new army to act against temujin .
i say temujin , for these circumstances took place immediately after the battle , and before temujin had received his new title of genghis khan .
temujin , having learned that tukta bey and the young <name> had gone to <unk> , determined at once to follow them there .
as soon as tukta bey heard that he was coming , he began to strengthen the fortifications of his town and to increase the garrison .
he also laid in supplies of food and military stores of all kinds .
while he was making these preparations , he received the news that temujin was advancing into his country at the head of an immense force .
the force was so large that he was convinced that his town could not long stand out against it .
he was greatly perplexed to know what to do .
now it happened that there was a brother of tayian khan 's , named boyrak , the chief of a powerful horde that occupied a district of country not very far distant from tukta bey 's dominions .
tukta bey thought that this boyrak would be easily induced to aid him in the war , as it was a war waged against the mortal enemy of his brother .
he determined to leave his capital to be defended by the garrison which he had placed in it , and to proceed himself to boyrak 's country to obtain re-enforcements .
he first sent off the <name> kushluk , so that he might be as soon as possible in a place of safety .
then , after completing the necessary arrangements and dispositions for the defense of his town , in case it should be attacked during his absence , he took his oldest son , for whose safety he was also greatly concerned , and set out at the head of a small troop of horsemen to go to boyrak .
accordingly , when temujin , at the head of his forces , arrived at the town of <unk> , he found that the fugitives whom he was pursuing were no longer there .
however , he determined to take the town .
he accordingly at once invested it , and commenced the siege .
the garrison made a very determined resistance .
but the forces under <unk> command were too strong for them .
the town was soon taken .
temujin ordered his soldiers to slay without <name> all who were found in arms against him within the walls , and the walls themselves , and all the other defenses of the place , he caused to be leveled with the ground .
he then issued his proclamation , offering peace and pardon to all the rest of the tribe on condition that they would take the oath of allegiance to him .
this they readily agreed to do .
there were a great many subordinate khans , both of this tribe and of some others that were near , who thus yielded to temujin , and promised to obey him .
all this took place , as has already been said , immediately after the great battle with tayian , and before temujin had been <unk> as emperor , or had received his new title of genghis khan .
indeed , temujin , while making this expedition to <unk> in pursuit of kushluk and tukta bey , had been somewhat uneasy at the loss of time which the campaign occasioned him , as he was anxious to go as soon as possible to karakorom , in order to take the necessary measures there for arranging and <unk> his government .
he accordingly now determined not to pursue the fugitives any farther , but to proceed at once to karakorom , and postpone all farther operations against kushluk and tukta until the next season .
so he went to karakorom , and there , during the course of the <name> , formed the constitution of his new empire , and made arrangements for <unk> a grand assembly of the khans the next spring , as related in the last chapter .
in the mean time , tukta bey and the <name> kushluk were very kindly received by boyrak , tayian 's brother .
for a time they all had reason to expect that temujin , after having taken and destroyed <unk> , would continue his pursuit of the <name> , and boyrak began accordingly to make preparations for defense .
but when , at length , they learned that temujin had given up the pursuit , and had returned to karakorom , their apprehensions were , for the moment , relieved .
they were , however , well aware that the danger was only postponed ; and boyrak , being determined to defend the cause of his nephew , and to avenge , if possible , his brother 's death , occupied himself diligently with increasing his army , strengthening his fortifications , and providing himself with all possible means of defense against the attack which he expected would be made upon him in the coming season .
boyrak 's expectations of an attack were fully realized .
temujin , after having settled the affairs of his government , and having now become genghis khan , took the first opportunity in the following season to fit out an expedition against tukta bey and boyrak .
he marched into boyrak 's dominions at the head of a strong force .
boyrak came forth to meet him .
a great battle was fought .
boyrak was entirely defeated .
when he found that the battle was lost he attempted to fly .
he was , however , pursued and taken , and was then brought back to the camp of genghis khan , where he was put to death .
the conqueror undoubtedly justified this act of cruelty toward his helpless prisoner on the plea that , like yemuka , he was not an open and honorable foe , but a rebel and traitor , and , consequently , that the act of putting him to death was the execution of a criminal , and not the murder of a prisoner .
but , although boyrak himself was thus taken and slain , kushluk and tukta bey succeeded in making their escape .
they fled to the northward and westward , scarcely knowing , it would seem , where they were to go .
they at last found a place of refuge on the banks of the river <unk> .
this river rises not far from the centre of the asiatic continent , and flows northward into the northern ocean .
the country through which it flows lay to the <unk> of genghis khan 's dominions , and beyond the confines of it .
through this country <name> kushluk and tukta bey wandered on , accompanied by the small troop of followers that still adhered to them , until they reached a certain fortress called <unk> , where they determined to make a stand .
they were among friends here , for <unk> , it seems , was on the confines of territory that belonged to tukta bey .
the people of the neighborhood immediately flocked to tukta 's standard , and thus the fugitive khan soon found himself at the head of a considerable force .
this force was farther increased by the coming in of broken bands that had made their escape from the battle at which boyrak had been slain at the same time with tukta bey , but had become separated from him in their flight .
it would seem that , at first , genghis khan did not know what was become of the fugitives .
at any rate , it was not until the next year that he attempted to pursue them .
then , hearing where they were and what they were doing , he prepared an expedition to penetrate into the country of the <unk> and attack them .
it was in the dead of <name> when he arrived in the country .
he had hurried on at that season of the year in order to prevent tukta bey from having time to finish his fortifications .
tukta bey and those who were with him were amazed when they heard that their enemy was coming at that season of the year .
the defenses which they were preparing for their fortress were not fully completed , but they were at once convinced that they could not hold their ground against the body of troops that genghis khan was bringing against them in the open field , and so they all took shelter in and near the fortress , and awaited their enemy there .
the winters in that latitude are very cold , and the country through which genghis khan had to march was full of difficulty .
the branches of the river which he had to cross were obstructed with ice , and the roads were in many places rendered almost impassable by snow .
the emperor did not even know the way to the fortress where tukta bey and his followers were concealed , and it would have been almost impossible for him to find it had it not been for certain tribes , through whose territories he passed on the way , who furnished him with guides .
these tribes , perceiving how overwhelming was the force which genghis khan commanded , knew that it would be useless for them to resist him .
so they yielded submission to him at once , and detached parties of horsemen to go with him down the river to show him the way .
under the conduct of these guides genghis khan passed on .
in due time he arrived at the fortress of <unk> , and immediately forced tukta bey and his allies to come to an engagement .
tukta 's army was very soon defeated and put to flight .
tukta himself , and many other khans and chieftains who had joined him , were killed ; but the <name> kushluk was once more fortunate enough to make his escape .
he fled with a small troop of followers , all mounted on fleet horses , and after various wanderings , in the course of which he and they who were with him endured a great deal of privation and suffering , the unhappy fugitive at last reached the dominions of a powerful <name> named gurkhan , who reigned over a country which is situated in the western part of <name> , toward the caspian sea , and is named <unk> .
this is the country from which the people called the turks , who afterward spread themselves so widely over the western part of <name> and the eastern part of europe , originally sprung .
gurkhan received kushluk and his party in a very friendly manner , and genghis khan did not follow them .
whether he thought that the distance was too great , or that the power of gurkhan was too formidable to make it prudent for him to advance into his dominions without a stronger force , does not appear .
at any rate , for the time being he gave up the pursuit , and after fully securing the fruits of the victory which he had gained at <unk> , and receiving the submission of all the tribes and khans that inhabited that region of country , he set out on his return home .
it is related that one of the khans who gave in his submission to genghis khan at this time made him a present of a certain bird called a <unk> , according to a custom often observed among the people of that region .
the <unk> was a very large and fierce bird of prey , which , however , could be trained like the <unk> which were so much prized in the middle ages by the princes and nobles of europe .
it seems it was customary for an inferior khan to present one of these birds to his superior on great occasions , as an emblem and token of his submission to his superior 's authority .
the bird in such a case was very richly decorated with gold and precious stones , so that the present was sometimes of a very costly and magnificent character .
genghis khan received such a present as this from a chieftain named <unk> <unk> , who was among those that yielded to his sway in the country of the <unk> , after the battle at which tukta bey was defeated and killed .
the bird was presented to genghis khan by <unk> with great ceremony , as an act of submission and homage .
what , in the end , was the fate of <name> kushluk , <name> appear in the next chapter .

there was another great and powerful khan , named idikut , whose tribe had hitherto been under the dominion of gurkhan , the <name> of <unk> , where kushluk had sought refuge , but who about this time revolted from gurkhan and went over to genghis khan , under circumstances which illustrate , in some degree , the peculiar nature of the political ties by which these different tribes and nations were bound to each other .
it seems that the tribe over which idikut ruled was tributary to <unk> , and that gurkhan had an officer stationed in idikut 's country whose business it was to collect and <unk> the tribute .
the name of this collector was <unk> .
he was accustomed , it seems , like almost all <unk> in those days , to exact more than was his due .
the system generally adopted by governments in that age of the world for collecting their revenues from tributary or conquered provinces was to farm them , as the phrase was .
that is , they sold the whole revenue of a particular district in the gross to some <name> man , who paid for it a specific sum , considerably less , of course , than the tax itself would really yield , and then he <unk> himself for his outlay and for his trouble by collecting the tax in detail from the people .
of course , it was for the interest of the <unk> , in such a case , after having paid the round sum to the government , to extort as much as possible from the people , since all that he obtained over and above the sum that he had paid was his profit on the transaction .
then , if the people complained to the government of his exactions , they could seldom obtain any redress , for the government knew that if they rebuked or punished the farmer of the revenue , or interfered with him in any way , they would not be able to make so favorable terms with him for the next year .
the plan of farming the revenues thus led to a great deal of extortion and oppression , which the people were compelled patiently to endure , as there was generally no remedy .
in modern times and among civilized nations this system has been almost universally abandoned .
the taxes are now always collected for the government directly by officers who have to pay over not a fixed sum , but simply what they collect .
thus the <unk> are , in some sense , impartial , since , if they collect more than the law <unk> them to demand , the benefit <unk> almost wholly to the government , they themselves gaining little or no advantage by their extortion .
besides this , there are courts established which are , in a great measure , independent of the government , to which the <unk> can appeal at once in a case where he thinks he is <unk> .
this , it is true , often puts him to a great deal of trouble and expense , but , in the end , he is pretty sure to have justice done him , while under the old system there was ordinarily no remedy at all .
there was nothing to be done but to appeal to the king or chieftain himself , and these complaints seldom received any attention .
for , besides the natural unwillingness of the sovereign to trouble himself about such disputes , he had a direct interest in not requiring the extorted money to be paid back , or , rather , in not having it proved that it was extorted .
thus the poor <unk> found that the officer who collected the money , and the umpire who was to decide in case of disputes , were both directly interested against him , and he was continually wronged ; whereas , at the present day , by means of a system which provides disinterested officers to determine and collect the tax , and independent judges to decide all cases of dispute , the evils are almost wholly avoided .
the only difficulty now is the extravagance and waste with which the public money is expended , making it necessary to collect a much larger amount than would otherwise be required .
perhaps some future generation <name> discover some plain and simple remedy for this evil too .
* * * * * the name of the officer who had the general charge of the collection of the taxes in idikut 's territory for gurkhan , king of <unk> , was , as has already been said , <unk> .
he oppressed the people , exacting more from them than was really due .
whether he had <unk> the revenue , and was thus enriching himself by his <unk> , or whether he was acting directly in gurkhan 's name , and made the people pay more than he ought from zeal in his master 's service , and a <name> to recommend himself to favor by sending home to <unk> as large a revenue from the provinces as possible , does not appear .
at all events , the people complained bitterly .
they had , however , no access to gurkhan , <unk> 's master , and so they carried their complaints to idikut , their own khan .
idikut remonstrated with <unk> , but he , instead of taking the remonstrance in good part and relaxing the severity of his proceedings , resented the interference of idikut , and answered him in a haughty and threatening manner .
this made idikut very angry .
indeed , he was angry before , as it might naturally be supposed that he would have been , at having a person owing allegiance to a foreign <name> exercising authority in a proud and domineering manner within his dominions , and the reply which <unk> made when he remonstrated with him on account of his <unk> exasperated him beyond all bounds .
he immediately caused <unk> to be assassinated .
he also slew all the other officers of gurkhan within his country  those , probably , who were employed to assist <unk> in collecting the taxes .
the murder of these officers was , of course , an act of open rebellion against gurkhan , and idikut , in order to shield himself from the consequences of it , determined to join himself and his tribe at once to the empire of genghis khan ; so he immediately dispatched two embassadors to the mongul emperor with his proposals .
the envoys , accompanied by a suitable troop of guards and attendants , went into the mongul country and presently came up with genghis khan , while he was on a march toward the country of some tribe or horde that had revolted from him .
they were very kindly received ; for , although genghis khan was not prepared at present to make open war upon gurkhan , or to invade his dominions in pursuit of <name> kushluk , he was intending to do this at some future day , and , in the mean time , he was very glad to weaken his enemy by drawing off from his empire any tributary tribes that were at all disposed to revolt from him .
he accordingly received the embassadors of idikut in a very cordial and friendly manner .
he readily acceded to the proposals which idikut made through them , and , in order to give full proof to idikut of the readiness and sincerity with which he accepted his proposals , he sent back two embassadors of his own to accompany idikut 's embassadors on their return , and to join them in assuring that <name> of the cordiality with which genghis khan accepted his offers of friendship , and to promise his protection .
idikut was very much pleased , when his messengers returned , to learn that his mission had been so successful .
he immediately determined to go himself and visit genghis khan in his camp , in order to confirm the new alliance by making a personal tender to the emperor of his homage and his services .
he accordingly prepared some splendid presents , and , placing himself at the head of his troop of guards , he proceeded to the camp of genghis khan .
the emperor received him in a very kind and friendly manner .
he accepted his presents , and , in the end , was so much pleased with idikut himself that he gave him one of his daughters in marriage .
as for gurkhan , when he first heard of the murder of <unk> and the other officers , he was in a terrible rage .
he declared that he would revenge his servant by laying waste idikut 's territories with fire and sword .
but when he heard that idikut had placed himself under the protection of genghis khan , and especially when he learned that he had married the emperor 's daughter , he thought it more prudent to postpone his vengeance , not being quite willing to draw upon himself the hostility of so great a power .
<name> kushluk remained for many years in <unk> and in the countries adjoining it .
he married a daughter of gurkhan , his protector .
partly in consequence of this connection and of the high rank which he had held in his own native land , and partly , perhaps , in consequence of his personal courage and other military qualities , he rapidly acquired great influence among the khans of western <name> , and at last he organized a sort of rebellion against gurkhan , made war against him , and deprived him of more than half his dominions .
he then collected a large army , and prepared to make war upon genghis khan .
genghis khan sent one of his best generals , at the head of a small but very compact and <unk> force , against him .
the name of this general was <name> .
kushluk was not at all <unk> by the danger which now threatened him .
his own army was much larger than that of <name> , and he accordingly advanced to meet his enemy without fear .
he was , however , beaten in the battle , and , when he saw that the day was lost , he fled , followed by a small party of horsemen , who succeeded in saving themselves with him .
<name> set out immediately in pursuit of the fugitive , accompanied by a small body of men mounted on the fleetest horses .
the party who were with kushluk , being exhausted by the fatigue of the battle and bewildered by the excitement and terror of their flight , could not keep together , but were overtaken one by one and slain by their pursuers until only three were left .
these three kept close to kushluk , and with him went on until <name> 's party lost the track of them .
at length , coming to a place where two roads met , <name> asked a peasant if he had seen any strange horsemen pass that way .
the peasant said that four horsemen had passed a short time before , and he told <name> which road they had taken .
<name> and his party rode on in the direction which the peasant had indicated , and , pushing forward with redoubled speed , they soon overtook the unhappy fugitives .
they fell upon kushluk without <name> , and killed him on the spot .
they then cut off his head , and turned back to <name> it to genghis khan .
genghis khan rewarded <name> in the most magnificent manner for his successful performance of this exploit , and then , putting <unk> head upon a pole , he displayed it in all the camps and villages through which he passed , where it served at once as a token and a trophy of his victory against an enemy , and , at the same time , as a warning to all other persons of the terrible danger which they would incur in attempting to resist his power .

the accounts given us of the events and transactions of genghis <unk> reign after he acquired the supreme power over the mongul and tartar nations are imperfect , and , in many respects , confused .
it appears , however , from them that in the year <unk> , that is , about five years after his election as grand khan , he became involved in a war with the chinese , which led , in the end , to very important consequences .
the kingdom of <name> lay to the southward of the mongul territories , and the frontier was defended by the famous chinese wall , which extended from east to west , over hills and valleys , from the great desert to the sea , for many hundred miles .
the wall was defended by towers , built here and there in commanding positions along the whole extent of it , and at certain distances there were fortified towns where powerful garrisons were stationed , and reserves of troops were held ready to be marched to different points along the wall , wherever there might be occasion for their services .
the wall was not strictly the chinese frontier , for the territory on the outside of it to a considerable distance was held by the chinese government , and there were many large towns and some very strong fortresses in this outlying region , all of which were held and garrisoned by chinese troops .
the inhabitants , however , of the countries outside the wall were generally of the tartar or mongul race .
they were of a nation or tribe called the <unk> , and were somewhat inclined to rebel against the chinese rule .
in order to assist in keeping them in subjection , one of the chinese emperors issued a decree which ordained that the governors of those provinces should place in all the large towns , and other strongholds outside the wall , twice as many families of the chinese as there were of the <unk> .
this regulation greatly increased the discontent of the <unk> , and made them more inclined to rebellion than they were before .
besides this , there had been for some time a growing difficulty between the chinese government and genghis khan .
it seems that the monguls had been for a long time accustomed to pay some sort of tribute to the emperor of <name> , and many years before , while genghis khan , under the name of temujin , was living at karakorom , a subject of vang khan , the emperor sent a certain <name> <name> , named <unk> , to receive what was due .
while <unk> was in the mongul territory he and temujin met , but they did not agree together at all .
the chinese <name> put some slight upon temujin , which temujin resented .
very likely temujin , whose character at that time , as well as afterward , was marked with a great deal of pride and spirit , opposed the payment of the tribute .
at any rate , <unk> became very much incensed against him , and , on his return , made serious charges against him to the emperor , and urged that he should be seized and put to death .
but the emperor declined engaging in so dangerous an undertaking .
<unk> 's proposal , however , became known to temujin , and he secretly resolved that he would one day have his revenge .
at length , about three or four years after temujin was raised to the throne , the emperor of the chinese died , and <unk> succeeded him .
the very next year he sent an officer to genghis khan to demand the usual tribute .
when the officer came into the presence of genghis khan in his camp , and made his demand , genghis khan asked him who was the emperor that had sent him with such a message .
the officer replied that <unk> was at that time emperor of the chinese .
" <unk> ! "
repeated genghis khan , in a tone of great contempt .
" the chinese have a proverb , " he added , " that such a people as they ought to have a god for their emperor ; but it seems they do not know how to choose even a decent man . "
it was true that they had such a proverb .
they were as remarkable , it seems , in those days as they are now for their national <unk> and vanity .
" go and tell your emperor , " added genghis khan , " that i am a sovereign ruler , and that i <name> never acknowledge him as my master . "
when the messenger returned with this defiant answer , <unk> was very much enraged , and immediately began to prepare for war .
genghis khan also at once commenced his preparations .
he sent envoys to the leading khans who occupied the territories outside the wall inviting them to join him .
he raised a great army , and put the several divisions of it under the charge of his ablest generals .
<unk> raised a great army too .
the historians say that it amounted to three hundred thousand men .
he put this army under the command of a great general named hujaku , and ordered him to advance with it to the northward , so as to intercept the army of genghis khan on its way , and to defend the wall and the fortresses on the outside of it from his attacks .
in the campaign which ensued genghis khan was most successful .
the monguls took possession of a great many towns and fortresses beyond the wall , and every victory that they gained made the tribes and nations that inhabited those provinces more and more disposed to join them .
many of them revolted against the chinese authority , and turned to their side .
one of these was a chieftain so powerful that he commanded an army of one hundred thousand men .
in order to bind himself solemnly to the covenant which he was to make with genghis khan , he ascended a mountain in company with the <unk> and with others who were to witness the proceedings , and there performed the ceremony customary on such occasions .
the ceremony consisted of sacrificing a white horse and a black ox , and then breaking an arrow , at the same time pronouncing an oath by which he bound himself under the most solemn sanctions to be faithful to genghis khan .
to reward the <name> for this act of adhesion to his cause , genghis khan made him king over all that portion of the country , and caused him to be every where so proclaimed .
this encouraged a great many other khans and chieftains to come over to his side ; and at length one who had the command of one of the gates of the great wall , and of the fortress which defended it , joined him .
by this means genghis khan obtained access to the interior of the chinese dominions , and <unk> and his great general hujaku became seriously alarmed .
at length , after various <unk> and <unk> , genghis khan learned that hujaku was encamped with the whole of his army in a very strong position at the foot of a mountain , and he determined to proceed thither and attack him .
he did so ; and the result of the battle was that hujaku was beaten and was forced to retreat .
he retired to a great fortified town , and genghis khan followed him and laid siege to the town .
hujaku , finding himself in imminent danger , fled ; and genghis khan was on the point of taking the town , when he was suddenly stopped in his career by being one day wounded severely by an arrow which was shot at him from the wall .
the wound was so severe that , while suffering under it , genghis khan found that he could not successfully direct the operations of his army , and so he withdrew his troops and retired into his own country , to wait there until his wound should be healed .
in a few months he was entirely recovered , and the next year he fitted out a new expedition , and advanced again into <name> .
in the mean time , hujaku , who had been repeatedly defeated and driven back the year before by genghis khan , had fallen into disgrace .
his rivals and enemies among the other generals of the army , and among the officers of the court , conspired against him , and represented to the emperor that he was unfit to command , and that his having failed to defend the towns and the country that had been committed to him was owing to his cowardice and incapacity .
in consequence of these representations hujaku was <unk> , that is , dismissed from his command in disgrace .
this made him very angry , and he determined that he would have his revenge .
there was a large party in his favor at court , as well as a party against him ; and after a long and bitter contention , the former once more prevailed , and induced the emperor to restore hujaku to his command again .
the quarrel , however , was not ended , and so , when genghis khan came the next year to renew the invasion , the councils of the chinese were so distracted , and their operations so paralyzed by this feud , that he gained very easy victories over them .
the chinese generals , instead of acting together in a harmonious manner against the common enemy , were intent only on the quarrel which they were waging against each other .
at length the animosity proceeded to such an extreme that hujaku resolved to depose the emperor , who seemed inclined rather to take part against him , assassinate all the chiefs of the opposite party , and then finally to put the emperor to death , and cause himself to be proclaimed in his stead .
in order to prepare the way for the execution of this scheme , he forbore to act vigorously against genghis khan and the monguls , but allowed them to advance farther and farther into the country .
this , of course , increased the general discontent and excitement , and prepared the way for the revolt which hujaku was plotting .
at length the time for action arrived .
hujaku suddenly appeared at the head of a large force at the gates of the capital , and gave the alarm that the monguls were coming .
he pressed forward into the city to the palace , and gave the alarm there .
at the same time , files of soldiers , whom he had ordered to this service , went to all parts of the city , arresting and putting to death all the leaders of the party opposed to him , under pretense that he had discovered a plot or conspiracy in which they were engaged to betray the city to the enemy .
the excitement and confusion which was produced by this charge , and by the alarm occasioned by the supposed coming of the monguls , so paralyzed the authorities of the town that nobody resisted hujaku , or attempted to save the persons whom he arrested .
some of them he caused to be killed on the spot .
others he shut up in prison .
finding himself thus undisputed master of the city , he next took possession of the palace , seized the emperor , deposed him from his office , and shut him up in a dungeon .
soon afterward he put him to death .
this was the end of <unk> ; but hujaku did not succeed , after all , in his design of causing himself to be proclaimed emperor in his stead .
he found that there would be very great opposition to this , and so he gave up this part of his plan , and finally raised a certain <name> of the <name> family to the throne , while he retained his office of commander-in-chief of the forces .
having thus , as he thought , effectually destroyed the influence and power of his enemies at the capital , he put himself once more at the head of his troops , and went forth to meet genghis khan .
some accident happened to him about this time by which his foot was hurt , so that he was , in some degree , disabled , but still he went on .
at length he met the vanguard of genghis khan 's army at a place where they were attempting to cross a river by a bridge .
hujaku determined immediately to attack them .
the state of his foot was such that he could not walk nor even mount a horse , but he caused himself to be put upon a sort of car , and was by this means carried into the battle .
the monguls were completely defeated and driven back .
perhaps this was because genghis khan was not there to command them .
he was at some distance in the rear with the main body of the army .
hujaku was very desirous of following up his victory by pursuing and attacking the mongul vanguard the next day .
he could not , however , do this personally , for , on account of the excitement and exposure which he had endured in the battle , and the rough movements and <unk> which , notwithstanding all his care , he had to bear in being conveyed to and fro about the field , his foot grew much worse .
inflammation set in during the night , and the next day the wound opened afresh ; so he was obliged to give up the idea of going out himself against the enemy , and to send one of his generals instead .
the general to whom he gave the command was named <unk> .
<unk> went out against the enemy , but , after a time , returned unsuccessful .
hujaku was very angry with him when he came to hear his report .
perhaps the wound in his foot made him impatient and unreasonable .
at any rate , he declared that the cause of <unk> failure was his <unk> in pursuing the enemy , which was cowardice or treachery , and , in either case , he deserved to suffer death for it .
he immediately sent to the emperor a report of the case , asking that the sentence of death which he had pronounced against <unk> might be confirmed , and that he might be authorized to put it into execution .
but the emperor , knowing that <unk> was a courageous and faithful officer , would not consent .
in the mean while , before the emperor 's answer came back , the wrath of hujaku had had time to cool a little .
accordingly , when he received the answer , he said to <unk> that he would , after all , try him once more .
" take the command of the troops again , " said he , " and go out against the enemy .
if you beat them , i <name> overlook your first offense and spare your life ; but if you are beaten yourself a second time , you shall die . "
so <unk> placed himself at the head of his detachment , and went out again to attack the monguls .
they were to the northward , and were posted , it seems , upon or near a <name> plain .
at any rate , a strong north wind began to blow at the time when the attack commenced , and blew the sand and dust into the eyes of his soldiers so that they could not see , while their enemies the monguls , having their backs to the wind , were very little <unk> .
the result was that <unk> was repulsed with considerable loss , and was obliged to make the best of his way back to hujaku 's quarters to save the remainder of his men .
he was now desperate .
hujaku had declared that if he came back without having gained a victory he should die , and he had no doubt that the man was violent and reckless enough to keep his word .
he determined not to submit .
he might as well die fighting , he thought , at the head of his troops , as to be <unk> put to death by hujaku 's executioner .
so he arranged it with his troops , who probably hated hujaku as much as he did , that , on returning to the town , they should march in under arms , take possession of the place , surround the palace , and seize the general and make him prisoner , or kill him if he should attempt any resistance .
the troops accordingly , when they arrived at the gates of the town , seized and disarmed the guards , and then marched in , brandishing their weapons , and uttering loud shouts and outcries , which excited first a feeling of astonishment and then of terror among the inhabitants .
the alarm soon spread to the palace .
indeed , the troops themselves soon reached and surrounded the palace , and began thundering at the gates to gain admission .
they soon forced their way in .
hujaku , in the mean time , terrified and panic-stricken , had fled from the palace into the gardens , in hopes to make his escape by the garden walls .
the soldiers pursued him .
in his excitement and agitation he leaped down from a wall too high for such a descent , and , in his fall , broke his leg .
he lay writhing helplessly on the ground when the soldiers came up .
they were wild and furious with the excitement of pursuit , and they killed him with their spears where he lay .
<unk> took the head of his old enemy and carried it to the capital , with the intention of offering it to the emperor , and also of surrendering himself to the officers of justice , in order , as he said , that he might be put to death for the crime of which he had been guilty in heading a military revolt and killing his superior officer .
by all the laws of war this was a most <unk> and a wholly unpardonable offense .
but the emperor was heartily glad that the turbulent and unmanageable old general was put out of the way , for a man so unprincipled , so ambitious , and so reckless as hujaku was is always an object of aversion and terror to all who have any thing to do with him .
the emperor accordingly issued a proclamation , in which he declared that hujaku had been justly put to death in punishment for many crimes which he had committed , and soon afterward he appointed <unk> commander-in-chief of the forces in his stead .

after the death of hujaku , the emperor of <name> endeavored to defend his dominions against genghis khan by means of his other generals , and the war was continued for several years , during which time genghis khan made himself master of all the northern part of <name> , and ravaged the whole country in the most reckless and cruel manner .
the country was very populous and very <name> .
the people , unlike the monguls and tartars , lived by <unk> the ground , and they practiced , in great perfection , many manufacturing and mechanic arts .
the country was very fertile , and , in the place of the boundless pasturages of the mongul territories , it was covered in all directions with cultivated fields , gardens , orchards , and <unk> , while thriving villages and busy towns were scattered over the whole face of it .
it was to protect this busy hive of wealth and industry that the great wall had been built ages before ; for the chinese had always been stationary , industrious , and peaceful , while the territories of central <name> , lying to the north of them , had been filled from time immemorial with wild , roaming , and unscrupulous troops of marauders , like those who were now united under the banner of genghis khan .
the wall had afforded for some hundreds of years an adequate protection , for no commander had appeared of sufficient power to organize and combine the various hordes on a scale great enough to enable them to force so strong a barrier .
but , now that genghis khan had come upon the stage , the barrier was broken through , and the terrible and reckless hordes poured in with all the force and fury of an inundation .
in the year <unk> , which was the year following that in which hujaku was killed , genghis khan organized a force so large , for the invasion of <name> , that he divided it into four different battalions , which were to enter by different roads , and <unk> different portions of the country .
each of these divisions was by itself a great and powerful army , and the simultaneous invasion of four such masses of reckless and merciless enemies filled the whole land with terror and dismay .
the chinese emperor sent the best bodies of troops under his command to guard the passes in the mountains , and the bridges and <unk> on the rivers , hoping in this way to do something toward <unk> the tide of these torrents of invasion .
but it was all in vain .
genghis khan had raised and equipped his forces by means , in a great measure , of the plunder which he had obtained in <name> the year before , and he had made great promises and glowing representations to his men in respect to the booty to be obtained in this new campaign .
the troops were consequently full of ardor and enthusiasm , and they pressed on with such impetuosity as to <name> all before them .
the emperor of <name> , in pursuing his measures of defense , had ordered all the men capable of bearing arms in the villages and in the open country to repair to the nearest large city or fortress , there to be enrolled and equipped for service .
the consequence was that the monguls found in many places , as they advanced through the country , nobody but infirm old men , and women and children in the hamlets and villages .
a great many of these , especially such as seemed to be of most consequence , the handsomest and best of the women , and the oldest children , they seized and took with them in continuing their march , intending to make slaves of them .
they also took possession of all the gold and silver , and also of all the silks and other <name> and valuable merchandise which they found , and distributed it as plunder .
the spoil which they obtained , too , in sheep and cattle , was enormous .
from it they made up immense flocks and herds , which were driven off into the mongul country .
the rest were slaughtered , and used to supply the army with food .
it was the custom of the invaders , after having <unk> a town and its environs , and taken away all which they could convert to any useful purpose for themselves , to burn the town itself , and then to march on , leaving in the place only a smoking heap of ruins , with the miserable remnant of the population which they had spared wandering about the scene of desolation in misery and despair .
they made a most cowardly and atrocious use , too , of the prisoners whom they conveyed away .
when they arrived at a fortified town where there was a garrison or any other armed force prepared to resist them , they would bring forward these helpless captives , and put them in the <unk> of the battle in such a manner that the men on the walls could not shoot their arrows at their savage assailants without killing their own wives and children .
the officers commanded the men to fire notwithstanding .
but they were so moved by the piteous cries which the women and children made that they could not bear to do it , and so they refused to obey , and in the excitement and confusion thus produced the monguls easily obtained possession of the town .
there are two great rivers in <name> , both of which flow from west to east , and they are at such a distance from each other and from the frontiers that they divide the territory into three nearly equal parts .
the <unk> of these rivers is the <unk> ho .
the monguls in the course of two years <unk> and made themselves masters of almost the whole country lying north of this river , that is , of about one third of <name> proper .
there were , however , some <unk> towns which they found it very difficult to conquer .
among other places , there was the imperial city of <unk> , where the emperor himself resided , which was so strongly defended that for some time the monguls did not venture to attack it .
at length , however , genghis khan came himself to the place , and concentrated there a very large force .
the emperor and his court were very much alarmed , expecting an immediate assault .
still genghis khan hesitated .
some of his generals urged him to scale the walls , and so force his way into the city .
but he thought it more politic to adopt a different plan .
so he sent an officer into the town with proposals of peace to be communicated to the emperor .
in these proposals genghis khan said that he himself was inclined to spare the town , but that to appease his soldiers , who were furious to attack and <unk> the city , it would be necessary to make them considerable presents , and that , if the emperor would agree to such terms with him as should enable him to satisfy his men in this respect , he would spare the city and would retire .
the emperor and his advisers were much perplexed at the receipt of this proposal .
there was great difference of opinion among the counselors in respect to the reply which was to be made to it .
some were in favor of rejecting it at once .
one general , not content with a simple rejection of it , proposed that , to show the indignation and resentment which they felt in receiving it , the garrison should march out of the gates and attack the monguls in their camp .
there were other ministers , however , who urged the emperor to submit to the necessity of the case , and make peace with the conqueror .
they said that the idea of going out to attack the enemy in their camp was too desperate to be entertained for a moment , and if they waited within the walls and attempted to defend themselves there , they exposed themselves to a terrible danger , without any <unk> <name> of advantage at all commensurate with it ; for if they failed to save the city they were all utterly and irretrievably ruined ; and if , on the other hand , they succeeded in <unk> the assault , it was only a brief respite that they could <name> to gain , for the monguls would soon return in greater <name> and in a higher state of excitement and fury than ever .
besides , they said , the garrison was discontented and depressed in spirit , and would make but a feeble resistance .
it was composed mainly of troops brought in from the country , away from their families and homes , and all that they desired was to be released from duty , in order that they might go and see what had become of their wives and children .
the emperor , in the end , adopted this counsel , and he sent a commissioner to the camp of genghis khan to ask on what terms peace could be made .
genghis khan stated the conditions .
they were very hard , but the emperor was compelled to submit to them .
one of the stipulations was that genghis khan was to receive one of the chinese princesses , a daughter of the late emperor <unk> , to add to the number of his wives .
there were also to be delivered to him for slaves five hundred young boys and as many girls , three thousand horses , a large quantity of silk , and an immense sum of money .
as soon as these conditions were fulfilled , after dividing the slaves and the booty among the officers and soldiers of his army , genghis khan raised the siege and moved off to the northward .
in respect to the captives that his soldiers had taken in the towns and villages  the women and children spoken of above  the army carried off with them all that were old enough to be of any value as slaves .
the little children , who would only , they thought , be in the way , they massacred .
the emperor was by no means easy after the mongul army had gone .
a marauding enemy like that , bought off by the payment of a ransom , is exceedingly apt to find some pretext for returning , and the emperor did not feel that he was safe .
very soon after the monguls had withdrawn , he proposed to his council the plan of removing his court southward to the other side of the <unk> ho , to a large city in the province of <unk> .
some of his counselors made great objections to this proposal .
they said that if the emperor withdrew in that manner from the northern provinces that portion of his empire would be irretrievably lost .
genghis khan would soon obtain complete and undisputed possession of the whole of it .
the proper course to be adopted , they said , was to remain and make a firm stand in defense of the capital and of the country .
they must levy new troops , repair the fortifications , recruit the garrison , and lay in supplies of food and of other military stores , and thus prepare themselves for a vigorous and efficient resistance in case the enemy should return .
but the emperor could not be persuaded .
he said that the treasury was exhausted , the troops were discouraged , the cities around the capital were destroyed , and the whole country was so <unk> by the <unk> of the monguls that no considerable number of fresh levies could be obtained ; and that , consequently , the only safe course for the government to pursue was to retire to the southward , beyond the river .
he would , however , he added , leave his son , with a strong garrison , to defend the capital .
he accordingly took with him a few favorites of his immediate family and a small body of troops , and commenced his journey  a journey which was considered by all the people as a base and ignoble flight .
he involved himself in endless troubles by this step .
a revolt broke out on the way among the guards who accompanied him .
one of the generals who headed the revolt sent a messenger to genghis khan informing him of the emperor 's abandonment of his capital , and offering to go over , with all the troops under his command , to the service of genghis khan if genghis khan would receive him .
when genghis khan heard thus of the retreat of the emperor from his capital , he was , or pretended to be , much incensed .
he considered the proceeding as in some sense an act of hostility against himself , and , as such , an <unk> of the treaty and a renewal of the war .
so he immediately ordered one of his leading generals  a certain chieftain named <unk>  to proceed southward at the head of a large army and lay siege to <unk> again .
the old emperor , who seems now to have lost all spirit , and to have given himself up entirely to despondency and fear , was greatly alarmed for the safety of his son the <name> , whom he had left in command at <unk> .
he immediately sent orders to his son to leave the city and come to him .
the departure of the <name> , in obedience to these orders , of course threw an additional gloom over the city , and excited still more the general discontent which the emperor 's conduct had awakened .
the <name> , on his departure , left two generals in command of the garrison .
their names were <unk> and <unk> .
they were left to defend the city as well as they could from the army of monguls under <unk> , which was now rapidly drawing near .
the generals were greatly embarrassed and perplexed with the difficulties of their situation .
the means of defense at their disposal were wholly inadequate , and they knew not what to do .
at length one of them , <unk> , proposed to the other that they should kill themselves .
this <unk> refused to do .
<unk> was the commander on whom the troops chiefly relied , and he considered suicide a mode of deserting one 's post scarcely less dishonorable than any other .
he said that his duty was to stand by his troops , and , if he could not defend them where they were , to endeavor to draw them away , while there was an opportunity , to a place of safety .
so <unk> , finding his proposal rejected , went away in a rage .
he retired to his apartment , and wrote a dispatch to the emperor , in which he explained the desperate condition of affairs , and the impossibility of saving the city , and in the end declared himself deserving of death for not being able to accomplish the work which his majesty had assigned to him .
he enveloped and sealed this dispatch , and then , calling his domestics together , he divided among them , in a very calm and composed manner , all his personal effects , and then took leave of them and dismissed them .
a single officer only now remained with him .
in the presence of this officer he wrote a few words , and then sent him away .
as soon as the officer had gone , he drank a cup of poison which he had previously ordered to be prepared for him , and in a few minutes was a lifeless corpse .
in the mean time , the other general , <unk> , had been making preparations to leave the city .
his plan was to take with him such troops as might be serviceable to the emperor , but to leave all the inmates of the palace , as well as the inhabitants of the city , to their fate .
among the people of the palace were , it seems , a number of the emperor 's wives , whom he had left behind at the time of his own flight , he having taken with him at that time only a few of the more favored ones .
these women who were left , when they heard that <unk> was intending to abandon the city with a view of joining the emperor in the south , came to him in a body , and begged him to take them with him .
in order to relieve himself of their <unk> , he said that he would do so , but he added that he must leave the city himself with the guards to prepare the way , and that he would return immediately for them .
they were satisfied with this promise , and returned to the palace to prepare for the journey .
<unk> at once left the city , and very soon after he had gone , <unk> , the mongul general , arrived at the gates , and , meeting with no effectual resistance , he easily forced his way in , and a scene of universal terror and confusion ensued .
the soldiers spread themselves over the city in search of plunder , and killed all who came in their way .
they plundered the palace and then set it on fire .
so extensive was the edifice , and so vast were the stores of clothing and other valuables which it contained , even after all the treasures which could be made available to the conquerors had been taken away , that the fire continued to burn among the ruins for a month or more .
what became of the unhappy women who were so cruelly deceived by <unk> in respect to their hopes of escape does not directly appear .
they doubtless perished with the other inhabitants of the city in the general massacre .
soldiers at such a time , while engaged in the sack and plunder of a city , are always excited to a species of insane fury , and take a savage delight in thrusting their pikes into all that come in their way .
<unk> excused himself , when he arrived at the quarters of the emperor , for having thus abandoned the women to their fate by the alleged impossibility of saving them .
he could not have succeeded , he said , in effecting his own retreat and that of the troops who went with him if he had been encumbered in his movements by such a company of women .
the emperor accepted this excuse , and seemed to be satisfied with it , though , not long afterward , <unk> was accused of conspiracy against the emperor and was put to death .
<unk> took possession of the imperial treasury , where he found great stores of silk , and also of gold and silver plate .
all these things he sent to genghis khan , who remained still at the north at a grand encampment which he had made in <unk> .
after this , other campaigns were fought by genghis khan in <name> , in the course of which he extended his conquests still farther to the southward , and made himself master of a very great extent of country .
after confirming these conquests , he selected from among such chinese officers as were disposed to enter into his service suitable persons to be appointed governors of the provinces , and in this way annexed them to his dominions ; these officers thus transferring their allegiance from the emperor to him , and <unk> to send to him the tribute which they should annually collect from their respective dominions .
every thing being thus settled in this quarter , genghis khan next turned his attention to the western frontiers of his empire , where the tartar and mongul territory bordered on <unk> and the dominions of the mohammedans .

the portion of <name> which genghis khan had added to his dominions by the conquests described in the last chapter was called <unk> , and the possession of it , added to the extensive territories which were previously under his sway , made his empire very vast .
the country which he now held , either under his direct government , or as tributary provinces and kingdoms , extended north and south through the whole interior of <name> , and from the shores of the japan and <name> seas on the east , nearly to the caspian sea on the west , a distance of nearly three thousand miles .
beyond his western limits lay <unk> and other countries governed by the mohammedans .
among the other mohammedan princes there was a certain sultan <name> , a great and very powerful sovereign , who reigned over an extensive region in the neighborhood of the caspian sea , though the principal seat of his power was a country called <unk> .
he was , in consequence , sometimes styled <name> <unk> .
it might perhaps have been expected that genghis khan , having subdued all the rivals within his reach in the eastern part of <name> , and being strong and secure in the possession of his power , would have found some pretext for making war upon the sultan , with a view of conquering his territories too , and adding the countries bordering on the caspian to his dominions .
but , for some reason or other , he concluded , in this instance , to adopt a different policy .
whether it was that he was tired of war and wished for repose , or whether the sultan 's dominions were too remote , or his power too great to make it prudent to attack him , he determined on sending an embassy instead of an army , with a view of proposing to the sultan a treaty of friendship and alliance .
the time when this embassy was sent was in the year <unk> , and the name of the principal embassador was <unk> .
<unk> set out on his mission accompanied by a large retinue of attendants and guards .
the journey occupied several weeks , but at length he arrived in the sultan 's dominions .
soon after his arrival he was admitted to an audience of the sultan , and there , accompanied by his own secretaries , and in the presence of all the chief officers of the sultan 's court , he delivered his message .
he gave an account in his speech of the recent victories which his sovereign , genghis khan , had won , and of the great extension which his empire had in consequence attained .
he was now become master , he said , of all the countries of central <name> , from the eastern extremity of the continent up to the frontiers of the sultan 's dominions , and having thus become the sultan 's neighbor , he was desirous of entering into a treaty of amity and alliance with him , which would be obviously for the mutual interest of both .
he had accordingly been sent an embassador to the sultan 's court to propose such an alliance .
in offering it , the emperor , he said , was actuated by a feeling of the sincerest good-will .
he wished the sultan to consider him as a father , and he would look upon the sultan as a son .
according to the <unk> ideas of government which prevailed in those days , the relation of father to son involved not merely the idea of a tie of affection connecting an older with a younger person , but it implied something of <unk> and authority on the one part , and dependence and subjection on the other .
perhaps genghis khan did not mean his proposition to be understood in this sense , but made it solely in reference to the <unk> between his own and the <unk> years , for he was himself now becoming considerably advanced in life .
however this may be , the sultan was at first not at all pleased with the proposition in the form in which the embassador made it .
he , however , listened quietly to <unk> 's words , and said nothing until the public audience was ended .
he then took <unk> alone into another apartment in order to have some quiet conversation with him .
he first asked him to tell him the exact state of the case in respect to all the pretended victories which genghis khan had gained , and , in order to propitiate him and induce him to reveal the honest truth , he made him a present of a <name> scarf , splendidly adorned with jewels .
" how is it ? "
said he ; " has the emperor really made all those conquests , and is his empire as extensive and powerful as he pretends ?
tell me the honest truth about it . "
" what i have told your majesty is the honest truth about it , " replied <unk> .
" my master the emperor is as powerful as i have represented him , and this your majesty <name> soon find out in case you come to have any difficulty with him . "
this bold and defiant language on the part of the embassador greatly increased the irritation which the sultan felt before .
he seemed much incensed , and replied in a very angry manner .
" i know not what your master means , " said he , " by sending such messages to me , telling me of the provinces that he has conquered , and boasting of his power , or upon what ground he pretends to be greater than i , and expects that i shall honor him as my father , and be content to be treated by him only as his son .
is he so very great a personage as this ? "
<unk> now found that perhaps he had spoken a little too plainly , and he began immediately to soften and modify what he had said , and to compliment the sultan himself , who , as he was well aware , was really superior in power and <name> to genghis khan , notwithstanding the great extension to which the empire of the latter had recently attained .
he also begged that the sultan would not be angry with him for delivering the message with which he had been intrusted .
he was only a servant , he said , and he was bound to obey the orders of his master .
he assured the sultan , moreover , that if any unfavorable construction could by possibility be put upon the language which the emperor had used , no such meaning was designed on his part , but that in sending the embassage , and in every thing connected with it , the emperor had acted with the most friendly and honorable intentions .
by means of <unk> language like this the sultan was at length appeased , and he finally was induced to agree to every thing which the embassador proposed .
a treaty of peace and commerce was drawn up and signed , and , after every thing was concluded , <unk> returned to the mongul country loaded with presents , some of which were for himself and his attendants , and others were for genghis khan .
he was accompanied , too , by a caravan of merchants , who , in consequence of the new treaty , were going into the country of genghis khan with their goods , to see what they could do in the new market thus opened to them .
this caravan traveled in company with <unk> on his return , in order to avail themselves of the protection which the guard that attended him could afford in passing through the intervening countries .
these countries being filled with hordes of tartars , who were very little under the dominion of law , it would have been unsafe for a caravan of <name> merchandise to pass through them without an escort .
genghis khan was greatly pleased with the result of his embassy .
he was also much gratified with the presents that the sultan had sent him , which consisted of costly stuffs for garments , beautiful and <unk> arms , precious stones , and other similar articles .
he welcomed the merchants too , and opened facilities for them to travel freely throughout his dominions and dispose of their goods .
in order that future caravans might go and come at all times in safety , he established guards along the roads between his country and that of the sultan .
these guards occupied fortresses built at convenient places along the way , and especially at the <unk> on the rivers , and in the passes of the mountains ; and there orders were given to these guards to scour the country in every direction around their respective posts , in order to keep it clear of robbers .
whenever a band of robbers was formed , the soldiers hunted them from one <unk> to another until they were exterminated .
in this way , after a short time , the country became perfectly safe , and the caravans of merchants could go and come with the richest goods , and even with treasures of gold and silver , without any fear .
at first , it would seem , some of the merchants from the countries of <name> asked too much for their goods .
at least a story is told of a company who came very soon after the opening of the treaty , and who offered their goods first to genghis khan himself , but they asked such high prices for them that he was astonished .
" i suppose , " said he , " by your asking such prices as these , you imagine that i have never bought any goods before . "
he then took them to see his treasures , and showed them over a thousand large chests filled with valuables of every description ; gold and silver utensils , <name> silks , arms and accoutrements splendidly adorned with precious stones , and other such commodities .
he told them that he showed them these things in order that they might see that he had had some experience in respect to dealings in merchandise of that sort before , and knew something of its just value .
and that , since they had been so exorbitant in their demands , presuming probably upon the ignorance of those whom they came to deal with , he should send them back with all their goods , and not allow them to sell them any where in his dominions , at any price .
[ illustration : merchants offering their goods . ]
this threat he put in execution .
the merchants were obliged to go back without selling any of their goods at all .
the next company of merchants that came , having heard of the adventure of the others , determined to act on a different principle .
accordingly , when they came into the presence of the khan with their goods , and he asked them the prices of some of them , they replied that his majesty might himself fix the price of the articles , as he was a far better judge of the value of such things than they were .
indeed , they added that if his majesty chose to take them without paying any thing at all he was welcome to do so .
this answer pleased the emperor very much .
he paid them double price for the articles which he selected from their stores , and he granted them peculiar privileges in respect to trading with his subjects while they remained in his dominions .
the trade which was thus opened between the dominions of the sultan and those of genghis khan was not , however , wholly in the hands of merchants coming from the former country .
soon after the coming of the caravan last mentioned , genghis khan fitted out a company of merchants from his own country , who were to go into the country of the sultan , taking with them such articles , the products of the country of the monguls , as they might <name> to find a market for there .
there were four principal merchants , but they were attended by a great number of assistants , servants , <unk> , etc. , so that the whole company formed quite a large caravan .
genghis khan sent with them three embassadors , who were to present to the sultan renewed assurances of the friendly feelings which he entertained for him , and of his <name> to encourage and promote as much as possible the commercial intercourse between the two countries which had been so happily begun .
the three embassadors whom genghis khan selected for this service were themselves mohammedans .
he had several persons of this <name> among the officers of his court , although the monguls had a national religion of their own , which was very different from that of the mohammedans ; still , all forms of worship were tolerated in genghis <unk> dominions , and the emperor was accustomed to take good officers into his service wherever he could find them , without paying any regard to the nature of their religious belief so far as their general duties were concerned .
but now , in sending this deputation to the sultan , he selected the embassadors from among the mohammedans at his court , thinking that it would please the sultan better to receive his message through persons of his own religious <name> .
besides , the three persons whom he appointed were natives of <unk> , and they were , of course , well acquainted with the language of the country and with the country itself .
besides the merchants and the embassadors , genghis khan gave permission to each of his wives , and also to each of the great lords of his court , to send a servant or messenger with the caravan , to select and purchase for their masters and <unk> whatever they might find most curious or useful in the mohammedan cities which the caravan might visit .
the lords and ladies were all very glad to avail themselves of the opportunity thus afforded them .
all these persons , the embassadors and their suite , the merchants and their servants , and the special messengers sent by the lords and ladies of the court , formed , as may well be supposed , a very numerous company .
it is said that the caravan , when ready to commence its march , contained no less than four hundred and fifty persons .
every thing being at last made ready , the caravan set out on its long journey .
it was accompanied by a suitable escort , and , in order to provide still more effectually for the safety of the <name> merchandise and the valuable lives committed to it , genghis khan sent on orders beforehand to all the military stations on the way , directing the captains to double the guard on their respective sections of the road while the caravan was passing .
by means of these and other similar precautions the expedition accomplished the journey in safety , and arrived without any misfortune in the mohammedan country .
very serious misfortunes , however , awaited them there immediately after their arrival , arising out of a train of events which had been for some time in progress , and which i must now go back a little to describe .
it seems that some difference had arisen some time before this between the sultan <name> and the calif of bagdad , who was the great head of the mohammedan power .
<name> applied to the calif to <name> him certain privileges and powers which had occasionally been bestowed on other <unk> who had rendered great services to the mohammedan empire .
he claimed that he had merited these rewards by the services which he had rendered .
he had conquered , he said , more than one hundred princes and chieftains , and had cut off their heads and annexed their territories to his dominions , thus greatly enlarging and extending the mohammedan power .
<name> made this demand of the calif through the medium of an embassador whom he sent to bagdad .
the calif , after hearing what the embassador had to say , refused to comply .
he said that the services which <name> had rendered were not of sufficient importance and value to merit the honors and privileges which <name> demanded .
but , although he thus declined complying with <name> 's request , he showed a disposition to treat the sultan himself with all proper deference by sending an embassador of his own to accompany <name> 's embassador on his return , with instructions to communicate the reply which the calif felt bound to make in a respectful and courteous manner .
<name> received the calif 's embassador very honorably , and in his presence concealed the anger which the answer of the calif excited in his mind .
as soon as the embassador was gone , however , he convened a grand council of all the great chieftains , and generals , and ministers of state in his dominions , and announced to them his determination to raise an army and march to bagdad , with a view of deposing the calif and reigning in his stead .
the great personages assembled at the council were very ready to enter into this scheme , for they knew that if it was successful there would be a great many honors and a great deal of booty that would fall to their share in the final distribution of the spoil .
so they all engaged with great zeal in aiding the sultan to form and equip his army .
in due time the expedition was ready , and the sultan commenced his march .
but , as often happens in such cases , the preparations had been hindered by various causes of delay , and it was too late in the season when the army began to move .
the forces moved slowly , too , after they commenced their march , so that the <name> came on while they were among the passes of the mountains .
the <name> was unusually severe , and the troops suffered so much from the frosts and the rains , and from the various hardships to which they were in consequence exposed , that the sultan found it impossible to go on .
he was consequently obliged to return , and begin his work over again .
and the worst of it was , that the calif was now aware of his designs , and would be able , he knew , before the next season , to take effectual measures to defend himself .
when the calif heard of the misfortunes which had befallen the sultan 's army , and his narrow escape from the dangers of a formidable invasion , he was at first overjoyed , and he resolved at once on making war upon the rebellious sultan .
in forming his plans for the campaign , the idea occurred to him of endeavoring to <unk> genghis khan to invade the sultan 's dominions from the east while he himself attacked him from the west ; for bagdad , the capital of the calif , was to the westward of the sultan 's country , as the empire of the monguls was to the eastward of it .
but when the calif proposed his plan to his counselors , some of them objected to it very strenuously .
the sultan and the people of his country were , like the calif himself , mohammedans , while the monguls were of another religion altogether , or , as the mohammedans called them , unbelievers or infidels ; and the counselors who objected to the calif 's proposal said that it would be very wrong to bring the enemies of god into the country of the faithful to guard against a present and temporary danger , and thereby , perhaps , in the end occasion the ruin both of their religion and their empire .
it would be an impious deed , they thought , thus to bring in a horde of barbarian infidels to wage war with them against their brethren .
to this the calif replied that the emergency was so critical that they were justified in <unk> themselves of any means that offered to save themselves from the ruin with which they were threatened .
and as to the possibility that genghis khan , if admitted to the country as their ally , would in the end turn his arms against them , he said that they must watch , and take measures to guard against such a danger .
besides , he would rather have an open <unk> like genghis khan for a foe , than a mohammedan traitor and rebel like the sultan .
he added , moreover , that he did not believe that the mongul emperor felt any animosity or ill <name> against the mohammedans or against their <name> .
it was evident , indeed , that he did not , for he had a great many mohammedans in his dominions , and he allowed them to live there without molestation .
he even had mohammedan officers of very high rank in his court .
so it was finally decided to send a message and invite him to join the calif in making war on the sultan .
the difficulty was now to contrive some means by which this message could be conveyed through the sultan 's territories , which , of course , lay between the dominions of the calif and those of genghis khan .
to accomplish this purpose the calif resorted to a very singular device .
instead of writing his communication in a letter , he caused it to be pricked with a needle and some indigo , by a sort of tattooing process , upon the messenger 's head , in such a manner that it was concealed by his hair .
the messenger was then disguised as a countryman and sent forth .
he succeeded in accomplishing the journey in safety , and when he arrived genghis khan had only to cause his head to be shaved , when the inscription containing the calif 's proposal to him at once became <unk> .
this method of making the communication was considered very safe , for even if , from any accident , the man had been intercepted on the way , on suspicion of his being a messenger , the sultan 's men would have found nothing , in searching him , to confirm their suspicions , for it is not at all probable that they would have thought of looking for a letter among his hair .
genghis khan was well pleased to receive the proposals of the calif , but he sent back word in reply that he could not at present engage in any hostile movement against the sultan on account of the treaty of peace and commerce which he had recently established with him .
so long as the sultan observed the stipulations of the treaty , he felt bound in honor , he said , not to break it .
he knew , however , he added , that the restless spirit of the sultan would not long allow things to remain in the posture they were then in , and that on the first occasion given he would not fail to declare war against him .
things were in this state when the grand caravan of merchants and embassadors which genghis khan had sent arrived at the frontiers of the sultan 's dominions .
after passing the frontier , the first important place which they reached was a city called <unk> .
they were received very courteously by the governor of this place , and were much pleased with the opportunity afforded them to rest from the fatigues of their long journey .
it seems , however , after all , that the governor 's friendship for his guests was only pretended , for he immediately wrote to the sultan , informing him that a party of persons had arrived at his city from the mongul country who pretended to be merchants and embassadors , but that he believed that they were spies , for they were extremely inquisitive about the strength of the garrisons and the state of the defenses of the country generally .
he had no doubt , he added , that they were emissaries sent by genghis khan to find out the best way of invading his dominions .
one account states that the motive which induced the governor to make these representations to the sultan was some offense which he took at the familiar manner in which he was addressed by one of the embassadors , who was a native of <unk> , and had known the governor in former times when he was a private person .
another says that his object was to have the expedition broken up , in order that he might seize for himself the <name> merchandise and the valuable presents which the merchants and embassadors had in their possession .
at any rate , he wrote to the sultan <unk> the whole party as foreign emissaries and spies , and in a short time he received a reply from the sultan directing him to put them all to death , or otherwise to deal with them as he thought proper .
so he invited the whole party to a grand entertainment in his palace , and then , at a given signal , probably after most of them had become in some measure helpless from the influence of the wine , a body of his guards rushed in and massacred them all .
or , rather , they attempted to massacre them all , but one of the merchants ' men contrived in the confusion to make his escape .
he succeeded in getting back into the mongul country , where he reported what had happened to genghis khan .
genghis khan was greatly exasperated when he heard these tidings .
he immediately called together his sons , and all the great lords and chieftains of his court , and recited to them the story of the massacre of the merchants in such a manner as to fill their hearts with indignation and rage , and to inspire them all with a burning thirst for revenge .
he also immediately sent word to the sultan that , since by so infamous an action he had violated all the engagements which had subsisted between them , he , from that instant , declared himself his mortal enemy , and would take vengeance upon him for his <unk> and cruelty by <unk> his country with fire and sword .
this message was sent , it was said , by three embassadors , whose persons ought to have been considered sacred , according to every principle of international law .
but the sultan , as soon as they had delivered their message , ordered their heads to be cut off .
this new massacre excited the rage and fury of genghis khan to a higher pitch than ever .
for three days , it is said , he neither ate nor slept , and seemed almost beside himself with mingled vexation , grief , and anger .
and afterward he busied himself night and day with the arrangements for assembling his army and preparing to march , and he allowed himself no rest until every thing was ready .

genghis khan made his preparations for a war on an immense scale .
he sent messengers in every direction to all the princes , khans , governors , and other chieftains throughout his empire , with letters explaining to them the cause of the war , and ordering them to repair to the places of rendezvous which he appointed , with all the troops that they could raise .
he gave particular directions in respect to the manner in which the men were to be armed and equipped .
the arms required were the sabre , the bow , with a quiver full of arrows , and the battle-axe .
each soldier was also to <name> a rope , ropes and cordage being continually in demand among people living on horseback and in tents .
the officers were to wear armor as well as to <name> arms .
those who could afford it were to provide themselves with a complete coat of mail .
the rest were to wear helmets and <unk> only .
the horses were also to be protected as far as possible by <unk> , either of iron , or of leather thick and tough enough to prevent an arrow from penetrating .
when the troops thus called for appeared at the place of rendezvous appointed for them , genghis khan found , as is said , that he had an army of seven hundred thousand men !
the army being thus assembled , genghis khan caused certain rules and regulations , or articles of war , as they might be called , to be drawn up and <unk> to the troops .
one of the rules was that no body of troops were ever to retreat without first fighting , whatever the <unk> of the danger might be .
he also ordered that where a body of men were engaged , if any subordinate division of them , as one company in a regiment , or one regiment in a battalion , should break ranks and fly before the order for a retreat should have been given by the proper authority , the rest were to leave fighting the enemy , and attack the portion flying , and kill them all upon the spot .
the emperor also made formal provision for the event of his dying in the course of the campaign .
in this case a grand assembly of all the khans and chieftains of the empire was to be convened , and then , in the presence of these khans and of his sons , the constitution and laws of the empire , as he had established them , were to be read , and after the reading the assembly were to proceed to the election of a new khan , according to the forms which the constitution had provided .
after all these affairs had been arranged , genghis khan put his army in motion .
he was obliged , of course , to separate it into several grand divisions , and to send the several divisions forward by different roads , and through different sections of the country .
so large a body can never be kept together on a long march , on account of the immense quantity of food that is required , both for the horses and the men , and which must be supplied in the main by the country itself which they traverse , since neither horses nor men can <name> food with them for more than a very few days .
genghis khan put one of the largest divisions under the command of his son jughi , the <name> who distinguished himself so much in the conflicts by which his father raised himself to the supreme power .
jughi was ordered to advance with his division through <unk> , the country where the <name> kushluk had sought refuge , and which still remained , in some degree , disaffected toward genghis khan .
genghis khan himself , with the main body of the army , took a more southerly route directly toward the dominions of the sultan .
in the mean time the sultan himself had not been idle .
he collected together all the forces that he could command .
when they were mustered , the number of men was found to be four hundred thousand .
this was a large army , though much smaller than that of genghis khan .
the sultan set out upon his march with his troops to meet the invaders .
after advancing for some distance , he learned that the army of jughi , which had passed through <unk> , was at the northward of his position , and he found that by turning in that direction he might <name> to meet and conquer that part of the mongul force before it could have time to join the main body .
he determined at once to adopt this plan .
he accordingly turned his course , and marched forward into the part of the country where he supposed jughi to be .
at length he came to a place where his scouts found , near a river , a great many dead bodies lying on the ground .
among the others who had fallen there was one man who was wounded , but was not dead .
this wounded man told the scouts that the bodies were those of persons who had been slain by the army of jughi , which had just passed that way .
the sultan accordingly pressed forward and soon overtook them .
jughi was hastening on in order to join his father .
jughi consulted his generals in respect to what it was best to do .
they advised him to avoid a battle .
" we are not strong enough , " said they , " to encounter alone the whole of the sultan 's army .
it is better that we should retreat , which we can do in an orderly manner , and thus join the main body before we give the enemy battle .
or , if the sultan should attempt to pursue us , he can not keep his army together in doing so .
they <name> necessarily become divided into detachments on the road , and then we can turn and destroy them in detail , which <name> be a much surer mode of proceeding than for us to attack them in the mass . "
jughi was not willing to follow this advice .
" what <name> my father and my brothers think , " said he , " when they see us coming to them , flying from the enemy , without having fought them , contrary to his express commands ?
no .
we must stand our ground , trusting to our valor , and do our best .
if we are to die at all , we had better be slain in battle than in flight .
you have done your duty in <unk> me of the danger we are in , and now it remains for me to do mine in trying to bring you out of it with honor . "
so he ordered the army to halt , and to be drawn up in order of battle .
the battle was soon commenced , and it was continued throughout the day .
the monguls , though fewer in <name> , were superior to their enemies in discipline and in courage , and the advantage was obviously on their side , though they did not gain a decisive victory .
toward night , however , the sultan 's troops evinced every where a disposition to give way , and it was with great difficulty that the officers could induce them to maintain their ground until the darkness came on and put an end to the conflict .
when at length the combatants could no longer see to distinguish friend from foe , the two armies withdrew to their respective camps , and built their fires for the night .
jughi thought that by fighting during this day he had done all that his father required of him to vindicate the honor of the army , and that now it would be most prudent to retreat , without risking another battle on the morrow .
so he caused fresh supplies of fuel to be put upon the camp-fires in order to deceive the enemy , and then marched out of his camp in the night with all his men .
the next morning , by the time that the sultan 's troops were again under arms , he had advanced far on his march to join his father , and was beyond their reach .
he soon rejoined his father , and was received by him with great <name> .
genghis khan was extremely pleased with the course which his son had pursued , and bestowed upon him many public honors and rewards .
after this other great battles were fought between the two armies .
at one of them , a great trumpet fifteen feet long is mentioned among the other martial instruments that were used to excite the men to ardor in making the charge .
in these battles the monguls were victorious .
the sultan , however , still continued to make head as well as he could against the invaders , until at length he found that he had lost one hundred and sixty thousand of his men .
this was almost half of his army , and the loss enfeebled him so much that he was convinced that it was useless for him any longer to resist the monguls in the open field ; so he sent off his army in detachments to the different towns and fortresses of his kingdom , ordering the several divisions to shut themselves up and defend themselves as well as they could , in the places assigned to them , until better times should return .
the sultan , however , did not seek shelter in this way for himself .
he selected from his troops a certain portion of those who were most active and alert and were best mounted , and formed of them a sort of flying squadron with which he could move rapidly from place to place through the country , wherever his aid might be most required .
genghis khan , of course , now prepared to attack the cities where the several divisions of the sultan 's army had intrenched themselves .
he wished first to get possession of <unk> , which was the place where the embassadors and the merchants had been massacred .
but the city was not very large , and so , instead of marching toward it himself , he gave the charge of capturing it to two of his younger sons , whom he sent off for the purpose at the head of a suitable detachment .
he himself , with the main body , set off upon a march toward the cities of <unk> and bokhara , which were the great central cities of the sultan 's dominions .

bokhara was a great and beautiful city .
it was situated in the midst of a very fine and fertile country , in a position very favorable for the trade and commerce of those days .
it was also a great seat of learning and of the arts and sciences .
it contained many institutions in which were taught such arts and sciences as were then cultivated , and students resorted to it from all the portions of western <name> .
the city proper was inclosed with a strong wall .
besides this there was an outer wall , thirty miles in circumference , which inclosed the suburbs of the town , and also a beautiful region of parks and gardens , which contained the public places of amusement and the villas of the wealthy inhabitants .
it was this peaceful seat of industry and wealth that genghis khan , with his hordes of ruthless barbarians , was coming now to sack and plunder .
the first city which the monguls reached on their march toward bokhara was one named <unk> .
in approaching it a large troop rode up toward the walls , uttering terrific shouts and outcries .
the people shut the gates in great terror .
genghis khan , however , sent an officer to them to say that it was useless for them to attempt to resist him , and to advise them to surrender at once .
they must <unk> their citadel , he said , and send out all the young and able-bodied men to genghis khan .
the officer advised them , too , to send out presents to genghis khan as an additional means of <unk> him and inducing him to spare the town .
the inhabitants yielded to this advice .
the gates were thrown open .
all the young men who were capable of bearing arms were marshaled and marched out to the mongul camp .
they were accompanied by the older men among the inhabitants , who took with them the best that the town contained , for presents .
genghis khan accepted the presents , ordered the young men to be enrolled in his army , and then , dismissing the older ones in peace , he resumed his march and went on his way .
he next came to a town named nur .
one of the men from <unk> served as a guide to show the detachment which was sent to summon the city a near way to reach it .
nur was a sort of sacred town , having many holy places in it which were resorted to by many pilgrims and other devotees .
the people of nur shut the gates and for some time refused to surrender .
but at last , finding that it was useless to attempt to resist , they opened the gates and allowed the monguls to come in .
genghis khan , to punish the inhabitants , as he said , for even thinking of resisting him , set aside a supply of cattle and other provisions to keep them from starving , and then gave up all the rest of the property found in the town to be divided among his soldiers as plunder .
at length the army reached the great plain in which bokhara was situated , and encamped before the town .
bokhara was very large and very populous , as may well be supposed from its outer wall of thirty miles in circuit , and genghis khan did not expect to make himself master of it without considerable difficulty and delay .
he was , however , very intent on besieging and taking it , not only on account of the general wealth and importance of the place , but also because he supposed that the sultan himself was at this time within the walls .
he had heard that the sultan had retreated there with his flying squadron , taking with him all his treasure .
this was , however , a mistake .
the sultan was not there .
he had gone there , it is true , at first , and had taken with him the most valuable of his treasures , but before genghis khan arrived he had secretly withdrawn to <unk> , thinking that he might be safer there .
in truth , the sultan was beginning to be very much disheartened and discouraged .
among other things which occurred to disturb his mind , certain letters were found and brought to him , as if they had been intercepted , which letters gave accounts of a conspiracy among his officers to desert him and go over to the side of genghis khan .
these letters were not signed , and the sultan could not discover who had written them , but the pretended conspiracy which they revealed filled his soul with anxiety and distress .
it was only a pretended conspiracy after all , for the letters were written by a man in genghis khan 's camp , and with genghis <unk> permission or <unk> .
this man was a mohammedan , and had been in the sultan 's service ; but the sultan had put to death his father and his brothers on account of some alleged offense , and he had become so incensed at the act that he had deserted to genghis khan , and now he was determined to do his former sovereign all the mischief in his power .
his intimate knowledge of persons and things connected with the sultan 's court and army enabled him to write these letters in such a way as to deceive the sultan completely .
it was past midsummer when the army of genghis khan laid siege to bokhara , and it was not until the spring of the following year that they succeeded in carrying the outer wall , so strongly was the city fortified and so well was it defended .
after having forced the outer wall , the monguls destroyed the suburbs of the town , <unk> the cultivated gardens and grounds , and <unk> the villas .
they then took up their position around the inner wall , and commenced the siege of the city itself in due form .
the sultan had left three of his greatest generals in command of the town .
these men determined not to wait the operations of genghis khan in attacking the walls , but to make a sudden <name> from the gates , with the whole force that could be spared , and attack the besiegers in their intrenchments .
they made this <name> in the night , at a time when the monguls were least expecting it .
they were , however , wholly unsuccessful .
they were driven back into the city with great loss .
the generals , it seems , had determined to risk all on this desperate attempt , and , in case it failed , at once to abandon the city to its fate .
accordingly , when driven into the city through the gates on one side , they marched directly through it and passed out through the gates on the other side , hoping to save themselves and the garrison by this retreat , with a view of ultimately <unk> the sultan .
they , however , went first in a southerly direction from the city toward the river <unk> .
the generals took their families and those of the principal officers of the garrison with them .
the night was dark , and they succeeded in leaving the city without being observed .
in the morning , however , all was discovered , and genghis khan sent off a strong detachment of <unk> troops in pursuit .
these troops , after about a day 's <name> , overtook the flying garrison near the river .
there was no escape for the poor fugitives , and the merciless monguls destroyed them almost every one by riding over them , trampling them down with their horses ' hoofs , and cutting them to pieces with their sabres .
in the mean time , while this detachment had been pursuing the garrison , genghis khan , knowing that there were no longer any troops within the city to defend it , and that every thing there was in utter confusion , determined on a grand final assault ; but , while his men were getting the engines ready to batter down the walls , a procession , consisting of all the magistrates and clergy , and a great mass of the principal citizens , came forth from one of the gates , bearing with them the keys of the city .
these keys they offered to genghis khan in token of surrender , and begged him to spare their lives .
the emperor received the keys , and said to the citizens that he would spare their lives on condition that , if there were any of the <unk> soldiers concealed in the city , they would give them up , and that they would also seize and deliver to him any of the citizens that were suspected of being in the sultan 's interest .
this they took a solemn oath that they would do .
the soldiers , however  that is , those that remained in the town  were not delivered up .
most of them retired to the castle , which was a sort of citadel , and put themselves under the command of the governor of the castle , who , being a very energetic and resolute man , declared that he never would surrender .
there were a great many of the young men of the town , sons of the leading citizens , who also retired to the castle , determined not to yield to the conqueror .
genghis khan , having thus obtained the keys of the city itself , caused the gates to be opened , and his troops marched in and took possession .
he had promised the citizens that his soldiers should spare the lives of the people and should not <unk> the houses on condition that the magistrates delivered up peaceably the public magazines of grain and other food to supply his army ; also that all the people who had buried or otherwise concealed gold and silver , or other treasures , should bring them forth again and give them up , or else make known where they were concealed .
this the people promised that they would do .
after having entered the town , genghis khan was riding about the streets on horseback at the head of his troop of guards when he came to a large and very beautiful edifice .
the doors were wide , and he drove his horse directly in .
his troops , and the other soldiers who were there , followed him in .
there were also with him some of the magistrates of the town , who were accompanying him in his progress about the city .
after the whole party had entered the edifice , genghis khan looked around , and then asked them , in a <unk> manner , if that was the sultan 's palace .
" no , " said they , " it is the house of god . "
the building was a mosque .
on hearing this , genghis khan alighted from his horse , and , giving the bridle to one of the principal magistrates to hold , he went up , in a very irreverent manner , to a sacred place where the priests were accustomed to sit .
he seized the copy of the koran which he found there , and threw it down under the feet of the horses .
after amusing himself for a time in <unk> the <name> by these and other similar performances , he caused his soldiers to bring in their provisions , and allowed them to eat and drink in the <name> , in a riotous manner , without any regard to the sacredness of the place , or to the feelings of the people of the town which he outraged by this conduct .
a few days after this genghis khan assembled all the magistrates and principal citizens of the town , and made a speech to them from an elevated stand or pulpit which was erected for the purpose .
he began his speech by praising god , and claiming to be an object of his special favor , in proof of which he <unk> the victories which he had obtained , as he said , through the divine aid .
he then went on to denounce the <unk> conduct of the sultan toward him in making a solemn treaty of peace with him and then treacherously murdering his merchants and embassadors .
he said that the sultan was a detestable tyrant , and that god had commissioned him to rid the earth of all such monsters .
he said , in conclusion , that he would protect their lives , and would not allow his soldiers to take away their household goods , provided they surrendered to him fairly and honestly all their money and other treasures ; and if any of them refused to do this , or to tell where their treasures were hid , he would put them to the torture , and compel them to tell .
the wretched inhabitants of the town , feeling that they were entirely at the <name> of the terrible hordes that were in possession of the city , did not attempt to conceal any thing .
they brought forward their hidden treasures , and even offered their household goods to the conqueror if he was disposed to take them .
they were only anxious to save , if possible , their dwellings and their lives .
genghis khan appeared at first to be pleased with the submissive spirit which they manifested , but at last , under pretense that he heard of some soldiers being concealed somewhere , and perhaps irritated at the <unk> holding out so long against him , he ordered the town to be set on fire .
the buildings were almost all of wood , and the fire raged among them with great fury .
multitudes of the inhabitants perished in the flames , and great <name> died miserably afterward from want and exposure .
the citadel immediately afterward surrendered , and it would seem that genghis khan began to feel satisfied with the amount of misery which he had caused , for it is said that he spared the lives of the governor and of the soldiers , although we might have expected that he would have massacred them all .
the citadel was , however , demolished , and thus the town itself , and all that pertained to it , became a mass of smoking ruins .
the property <unk> from the inhabitants was divided among the mongul troops , while the people themselves went away , to roam as vagabonds and beggars over the surrounding country , and to die of want and despair .
what difference is there between such a conqueror as this and the captain of a band of pirates or of robbers , except in the immense magnitude of the scale on which he <unk> his crimes ?
the satisfaction which genghis khan felt at the capture of bokhara was greatly increased by the intelligence which he received soon afterward from the two princes whom he had sent to lay siege to <unk> , informing him that that city had fallen into their hands , and that the governor of it , the officer who had so treacherously put to death the embassadors and the merchants , had been taken and slain .
the name of this governor was <unk> khan .
the sultan , knowing that genghis khan would doubtless make this city one of his first objects of attack , left the governor a force of fifty thousand men to defend it .
he afterward sent him an additional force of ten thousand men , under the command of a general named <unk> .
with these soldiers the governor shut himself up in the city .
he knew very well that if he surrendered or was taken he could expect no <name> , and he went to work accordingly strengthening the fortifications , and laying in stores of provisions , determined to fight to the last extremity .
the captain of the guard who came to assist him had not the same reason for being so very obstinate in the defense of the town , and this difference in the situation of the two commanders led to difficulty in the end , as we shall presently see .
the mongul princes began the siege of <unk> by filling up the ditches that encircled the outer wall of the town in the places where they wished to plant their <unk> to make breaches in the walls .
they were hindered a great deal in their work , as is usual in such cases , by the sallies of the besieged , who rushed upon them in the night in great <name> , and with such desperate fury that they often succeeded in destroying some of the engines , or setting them on fire before they could be driven back into the town .
this continued for some time , until at last the mongul princes began to be discouraged , and they sent word to their father , who was then engaged in the siege of bokhara , informing him of the desperate defense which was made by the garrison of <unk> , and asking his permission to turn the siege into a blockade  that is , to withdraw from the immediate vicinity of the walls , and to content themselves with investing the city closely on every side , so as to prevent any one from going out or coming in , until the provisions of the town should be exhausted , and the garrison be starved into a surrender .
in this way , they said , the lives of vast <name> of the troops would be saved .
but their father sent back word to them that they must do no such thing , but must go on and fight their way into the town , no matter how many of the men were killed .
so the princes began again with fresh ardor , and they pushed forward their operations with such desperate energy that in less than a month the outer wall , and the works of the besieged to defend it , were all in ruins .
the towers were beaten down , the ramparts were broken , and many breaches were made through which the besiegers might be expected at any moment to force their way into the town .
the besieged were accordingly obliged to abandon the outer walls and retire within the inner lines .
the monguls now had possession of the suburbs , and , after <unk> them of all that they could convert to their own use , and burning and destroying every thing else , they advanced to attack the inner works ; and here the contest between the besiegers and the garrison was renewed more fiercely than ever .
the besieged continued their resistance for five months , defending themselves by every possible means from the walls , and making desperate sallies from time to time in order to destroy the monguls ' engines and kill the men .
at length <unk> , the captain of the guard , who had been sent to assist the governor in the defense of the town , began to think it was time that the carnage should cease and that the town should be surrendered .
but the governor , who knew that he would most assuredly be beheaded if in any way he fell into the hands of the enemy , would not listen to any proposal of the kind .
he succeeded , also , in exciting among the people of the town , and among the soldiers of the garrison , such a hatred of the monguls , whom he represented as infidels of the very worst character , the enemies alike of god and man , that they joined him in the determination not to surrender .
<unk> now found himself an object of suspicion and distrust in the town and in the garrison on account of his having made the proposal to surrender , and feeling that he was not safe , he determined to make a separate peace for himself and his ten thousand by going out secretly in the night and giving himself up to the princes .
he thought that by doing this , and by putting the monguls in possession of the gate through which his troops were to march out , so as to enable them to gain admission to the city , his life would be spared , and that he might perhaps be admitted into the service of genghis khan .
but he was mistaken in this idea .
the princes said that a man who would betray his own countrymen would betray them if he ever had a good opportunity .
so they ordered him and all his officers to be slain , and the men to be divided among the soldiers as slaves .
they nevertheless took possession of the gate by which the deserters had come out , and by this means gained admission to the city .
the governor fled to the citadel with all the men whom he could assemble , and shut himself up in it .
here he fought desperately for a month , making continual sallies at the head of his men , and doing every thing that the most resolute and reckless bravery could do to harass and beat off the besiegers .
but all was in vain .
in the end the walls of the citadel were so broken down by the engines brought to bear upon them , that one day the monguls , by a determined and desperate assault made on all sides simultaneously , forced their way in , through the most dreadful scenes of carnage and destruction , and began killing without <name> every soldier that they could find .
the soldiers defended themselves to the last .
some took refuge in narrow courts and lanes , and on the roofs of the houses  for the citadel was so large that it formed of itself quite a little town  and fought desperately till they were brought down by the arrows of the monguls .
the governor took his position , in company with two men who were with him , on a terrace of his palace , and refused to surrender , but fought on furiously , determined to kill any one who attempted to come near him .
his wife was near , doing all in her power to encourage and sustain him .
genghis khan had given orders to the princes not to kill the governor , but to take him alive .
he wished to have the satisfaction of disposing of him himself .
for this reason the soldiers who attempted to take him on the terrace were very careful not to shoot their arrows at him , but only at the men who were with him , and while they did so a great many of them were killed by the arrows which the governor and his two friends discharged at those who attempted to climb up to the place where they were standing .
[ illustration : the governor on the terrace . ]
after a while the two men were killed , but the governor remained alive .
yet nobody could come near him .
those that attempted it were shot , and fell back again among their companions below .
the governor's wife supplied him with arrows as fast as he could use them .
at length all the arrows were spent , and then she brought him stones , which he hurled down upon his assailants when they tried to climb up to him .
but at last so many ascended together that the governor could not beat them all back , and he was at length surrounded and secured , and immediately put in irons .
the princes wrote word at once to their father that the town was taken , and that the governor was in their hands a prisoner .
they received orders in return to bring him with them to bokhara .
while on the way , however , another order came requiring them to put the prisoner to death , and this order was immediately executed .
what was the fate of his courageous and devoted wife has never been known .

after the fall of bokhara and <unk> , the war was continued for two years with great vigor by genghis khan and the monguls , and the poor sultan was driven from place to place by his merciless enemies , until at last his cause was wholly lost , and he himself , as <name> appear in the next chapter , came to a miserable end .
during the two years while genghis khan continued the war against him , a great many incidents occurred illustrating the modes of warfare practiced in those days , and the sufferings which were endured by the mass of the people in consequence of these terrible struggles between rival despots contending for the privilege of governing them .
at one time genghis khan sent his son jughi with a large detachment to <unk> and take a certain town named <unk> .
as soon as jughi arrived before the place , he sent in a flag of truce to call upon the people of the town to surrender , promising , at the same time , to treat them kindly if they would do so .
the bearer of the flag was a mohammedan named <name> .
jughi probably thought that the message would be better received by the people of the town if brought to them by one of their own countrymen , but he made a great mistake in this .
the people , instead of being pleased with the messenger because he was a mohammedan , were very much exasperated against him .
they considered him a <unk> and a traitor ; and , although the governor had solemnly promised that he should be allowed to go and come in safety , so great a tumult arose that the governor found it impossible to protect him , and the poor man was torn to pieces by the mob .
jughi immediately assaulted the town with all his force , and as soon as he got possession of it he slaughtered without <name> all the officers and soldiers of the garrison , and killed also about one half of the inhabitants , in order to avenge the death of his murdered messenger .
he also caused a handsome monument to be erected to his memory in the principal square of the town .
jughi treated the inhabitants of every town that dared to resist with extreme severity , while those that yielded at once were , in some degree , spared and protected .
the consequence of this policy was that the people of many of the towns surrendered without attempting to defend themselves at all .
in one case the magistrates and other principal inhabitants of a town came out to meet him a distance of two days ' journey from them , bringing with them the keys of the town , and a great quantity of magnificent presents , all of which they laid at the conqueror 's feet , and implored his <name> .
there was one town which jughi 's force took by a kind of stratagem .
a certain engineer , whom he employed to make a <unk> of the fortifications , reported that there was a place on one side of the town where there was a ditch full of water outside of the wall , which made the access to the wall there so difficult that the garrison would not be at all likely to expect an attack on that side .
the engineer proposed a plan for building some light bridges , which the soldiers were to throw over the ditch in the night , after having drawn off the attention of the garrison to some other quarter , and then , mounting upon the walls by means of ladders , to get into the town .
this plan was adopted .
the bridges and the ladders were prepared , and then , when the appointed night came , a feigned attack was made in the opposite part of the town .
the garrison were then all called off to repel this pretended attack , and in this way the wall opposite to the ditch was left <unk> .
the soldiers then threw the bridges over the ditch , and planted the ladders against the wall , and before the garrison could get intelligence of what they were doing they had made their way into the town , and had opened one of the gates , and by this means the whole army got in .
the engineer himself , who had proposed the plan , went up first on the first ladder that was planted against the wall .
to take the lead in such an <unk> required great coolness and courage , for it was dark , and no one knew , in going up the ladder , how many enemies he might have to encounter at the top of it .
the next place which the army of jughi approached was a quiet and beautiful town , the seat of several institutions of learning , and the residence of learned men and men of leisure .
it was a very pleasant place , full of fountains , gardens , and delightful <unk> , with many charming public and private <unk> .
the name of this place was <unk> , and the beauty and attractiveness of it were proverbial through all the country .
<unk> was a place rather of pleasure than of strength , and yet it was surrounded by a wall , and the governor of it determined to make an effort to defend it .
the garrison fought bravely , and they kept the besiegers off for three days .
at the end of that time the engines of the monguls had made so many breaches in the walls that the governor was convinced that they would soon get in , and so he sent to jughi to ask for the terms on which he would allow them to surrender .
jughi replied that he would not now make any terms with him at all .
it was too late .
he ought to have surrendered at the beginning .
so the mongul army forced its way into the town , and slaughtered the whole garrison without <name> .
jughi then ordered all the inhabitants , men , women , and children , to repair to a certain place on the plain outside the walls .
in obedience to this command , all the people went to the appointed place .
they went with fear and trembling , expecting that they were all to be killed .
but they found , in the end , that the object of jughi in bringing them thus out of the town was not to kill them , but only to call them away from the houses , so that the soldiers could plunder them more conveniently while the owners were away .
after being kept out of the town for a time they were allowed to return , and when they went back to their houses they found that they had been <unk> and stripped of every thing that the soldiers could <name> away .
there was another large and important town named <unk> .
it was situated two or three hundred miles to the northward of <unk> , on the river sir , which flows into <unk> lake .
the governor of this city was timur <unk> .
he was a very powerful chieftain , and a man of great military renown , having often been in active service under the sultan as one of the principal generals of his army .
when timur heard of the fall of <unk> , he presumed that his city of <unk> would be next attacked , as it seemed to come next in the way of the mongul army ; so he began to make vigorous preparations for defense .
he broke up all the roads leading toward the town , and destroyed the bridges .
he also laid in great supplies of food to maintain the inhabitants in case of a protracted siege , and he ordered all the corn , fruits , and cattle of the surrounding country , which he did not require for this purpose , to be taken away and stowed in secret places at a distance , to prevent their falling into the hands of the enemy .
jughi did not himself attack this town , but sent a large detachment under the orders of a general named <unk> <unk> .
<unk> advanced toward the city and commenced his operations .
the first thing that was to be done was to rebuild a bridge over the river , so as to enable him to gain access to the town , which was on the opposite bank .
then he set up immense engines at different points along the line , some of which were employed to batter down the walls , and others , at the same time , to throw stones , darts , and arrows over the <unk> , in order to drive the garrison back from them .
these engines did great execution .
those built to batter down the walls were of great size and power .
some of them , it was said , threw stones over the wall as big as millstones .
timur <unk> was equally active in the defense of the town .
he built a number of flat-bottomed boats , which might be called floating batteries , since they were constructed for throwing missiles of all sorts into the camp of the enemy .
these batteries , it is said , were covered over on the top to protect the men , and they had <unk> in the sides , like a modern man-of-war , out of which , not cannon balls and <unk> indeed , but arrows , darts , javelins , and stones were projected .
the boats were sent out , some on the upper side of the town and some on the lower , and were placed in stations where they could most effectually reach the mongul works .
they were the means of killing and wounding great multitudes of men , and they greatly disturbed and hindered the besiegers ' operations .
still <unk> persevered .
he endeavored to shut up the city on every side as closely as possible ; but there was on one side a large morass or jungle which he could not guard , and timur received a great many re-enforcements , to take the place of the men who were killed on the walls , by that way .
in the mean time , however , <unk> was continually receiving re-enforcements too from <name> jughi , who was not at a great distance , and thus the struggle was continued with great fury .
at last timur contrived an ingenious stratagem , by which he hoped to cause his enemy to fall into a snare .
it seems that there was a small island in the river , not far from the walls of the city , on which , before the siege commenced , timur had built a fortress , to be held as a sort of advanced post , and had garrisoned the fortress with about one thousand men .
timur now , in order to divert the attention of the monguls from the city itself , sent a number of men out from the city , who pretended to be deserters , and went immediately to the mongul camp .
of course , <unk> questioned them about the defenses of the city , in order to learn where the weak points were for him to attack .
the pretended deserters advised him to attack this fortress on the island , saying that it could very easily be taken , and that its situation was such that , when it was taken , the city itself must surrender , for it completely commanded the place .
so <unk> caused his principal engines to be removed to the bank of the river , opposite the island , and employed all his energies and spent all his ammunition in shooting at the fortress ; but the river was so wide , and the walls of the fortress wore so thick and so high , that he made very little impression .
at last his whole supply of stones  for stones served in those days instead of cannon balls  was exhausted , and as the town was situated in an alluvial district , in which no stones were to be found , he was obliged to send ten or twelve miles to the upland to procure a fresh supply of ammunition .
all this consumed much time , and enabled the garrison to recruit themselves a great deal and to strengthen their defenses .
the operations of the siege were in a great measure suspended while the men were obtaining a new supply of stones , and the whole <unk> force of the army was employed in going back and forth to bring them .
at length an immense quantity were collected ; but then the mongul general changed his plan .
instead of throwing the stones from his engines toward the fortress on the island , which it had been proved was beyond his reach , he determined to build out a <unk> into the river toward it , so as to get a <unk> for his engines nearer the walls , where they could have some chance of doing execution .
so he set his men at work to prepare <unk> , and bundles , and rafts of timber , which were to be loaded with the stones and sunk in the river to form the foundation for the proposed bank .
the men would bring the stones down to the bank in their hands , and then horsemen , who were ready on the brink , would take them , and , resting them on the saddle , would drive their horses in until they came near the place where the stones were to go , when they would throw them down and then return for others .
in this way they could work upon the <unk> in many parts at once , some being employed in building at the end where it <unk> on the shore , while the horsemen were laying the foundations at the same time out in the middle of the stream .
the work of the horsemen was very difficult and dangerous , on account of holes in the <name> bottom of the river , into which they were continually sinking .
besides this , the garrison on the walls were doing their utmost all the time to impede the work by shooting arrows , javelins , stones , and fiery darts among the workmen , by which means vast <name> , both of men and horses , were killed .
the monguls , however , persevered , and , notwithstanding all the opposition which the garrison made , they succeeded in advancing the mole which they were building so far that timur was convinced that they would soon gain so advantageous a position that it would be impossible for him to hold out against them .
so he determined to attempt to make his escape .
his plan was to embark on board his boats , with all his men , and go down the river in the night .
in order to prepare for this undertaking , he employed his men secretly in building more boats , until he had in all more than seventy .
these boats were kept out of sight , in hidden places in the river , until all were ready .
each of them was covered with a sort of heavy awning or roof , made of wet felt , which was plastered over with a coating of <name> and vinegar .
this covering was intended both to defend the men from missiles and the boats themselves from being set on fire .
there was one obstacle to the escape of the boats which it was necessary to remove beforehand , and that was the bridge which the monguls had built across the river , just below the town , when they first came to <unk> it .
to destroy this bridge , timur one night made a <name> from one of the gates , and attacked the men who were stationed to guard the bridge .
at the same time he sent down the current of the river a number of great flat-bottomed boats , filled with combustibles of various kinds , mixed with tar and <unk> .
these combustibles were set on fire before they were launched , and , as the current of the river bore them down one after another against the bridge , they set the wooden piers and posts that supported it on fire , while the guard , being engaged with the party which had sallied from the town , could not go to extinguish the flames , and thus the bridge was consumed .
the way being thus opened , timur <unk> very soon afterward embarked his family and the greater part of his army on board the boats in the night ; and , while the monguls had no suspicion of what was going on , the boats were launched , and sent off one after another swiftly down the stream .
before morning came all traces of the party had passed away .
very soon , however , the mongul general heard how his intended prey had escaped him , and he immediately sent off a strong detachment to follow the southern bank of the river and pursue the fugitives .
the detachment soon overtook them , and then a furious battle ensued between the mongul horsemen on the banks and in the margin of the water and the men in the boats , who kept the boats all the time as near as possible to the northern shore .
sometimes , however , when the stream was narrow , or when a <name> point projected from the northern shore , so as to drive the boats nearer to the mongul side , the battle became very fierce and bloody .
the monguls drove their horses far into the water , so as to be as near as possible to the boats , and threw arrows , javelins , and fiery darts at them , while the mohammedans defended themselves as well as they could from their windows or <unk> .
[ illustration : battle of the boats . ]
things went on in this way for some time , until , at length , the boats arrived at a part of the river where the water was so shallow  being obstructed by <unk> and shoals  that the boats fell aground .
there was nothing now for timur to do but to abandon the boats and escape with his men to the land .
this he succeeded in doing ; and , after reaching the shore , he was able to form his men in array , on an elevated piece of ground , before <unk> could bring up a sufficient number of men to attack him .
when the monguls at length came to attack him , he beat them off in the first instance , but he was obliged soon afterward to leave the field and continue his retreat .
of course , he was hotly pursued by the monguls .
his men became rapidly thinned in number , some being killed , and others getting separated from the main body in the confusion of the flight , until , at last , timur was left almost alone .
at last he was himself on the very point of being taken .
there were three monguls closely pursuing him .
he turned round and shot an arrow at the foremost of the pursuers .
the arrow struck the mongul in the eye .
the agony which the wounded man felt was so great that the two others stopped to assist him , and in the mean time timur got out of the way .
in due time , and after meeting with some other <unk> escapes , he reached the camp of the sultan , who received him very joyfully , loaded him with praises for the indomitable spirit which he had evinced , and immediately made him governor of another city .
in the mean time , some of the boats which had been abandoned by the soldiers were got off by the men who had been left in charge of them  one especially , which contained the family of timur .
this boat went quietly down the river , and conveyed the family to a place of safety .
the city of <unk> , from which timur and his men had fled , was , of course , now without any means of defense , and it surrendered the very next day to the monguls .

in the mean time , while jughi and the other generals were <unk> the country with their detachments , and besieging and capturing all the secondary towns and fortresses that came in their way , as related in the last chapter , genghis khan himself , with the main body of the army , had advanced to <unk> in pursuit of the sultan , who had , as he supposed , taken shelter there .
<unk> was the capital of the country , and was then , as it has been since , a great and renowned city .
besides the sultan himself , whom genghis khan was pursuing , there were the ladies of his family whom he wished also to capture .
the two principal ladies were the <unk> and the <unk> .
the <unk> was a <name> of very great distinction .
she had been greatly renowned during the lifetime of her husband , the former sultan , for her learning , her piety , the kindness of her heart , and the general excellence of her character , so far as her dealings with her subjects and friends were concerned , and her influence throughout the realm had been unbounded .
at some periods of her life she had exercised a great deal of political power , and at one time she bore the very grand title of <unk> of the <name> of the world .
she exercised the power which she then possessed , in the main , in a very wise and beneficial manner .
she administered justice impartially .
she protected the weak , and restrained the oppressions of the strong .
she listened to all the cases which were brought before her with great attention and <name> , and arrived almost always at just conclusions respecting them .
with all this , however , she was very strict and severe , and , as has almost always been the case with women raised to the possession of irresponsible power , she was <unk> and cruel in the extreme whenever , as she judged , any political necessity required her to act with decision .
her name was <unk> .
[ e ] [ footnote e : pronounced <unk> . ]
<unk> was not now at <unk> .
she was at <unk> , a city which was the chief residence of the court .
she had been living there in retirement ever since the death of her husband , the present <unk> father .
<unk> itself , as has already been said , was a great and splendid city .
like most of the other cities , it was inclosed in a double wall , though , in this case , the outer wall surrounded the whole city , while the inner one inclosed the mosque , the palace of the sultan , and some other public buildings .
these walls were much better built and more strongly fortified than those of bokhara .
there were twelve iron gates , it is said , in the outer wall .
these gates were a league apart from each other .
at every two leagues along the wall was a fort capable of containing a large body of men .
the walls were likewise strengthened with battlements and towers , in which the men could fight under shelter , and they were surrounded by a broad and deep ditch , to prevent an enemy from approaching too near to them , in order to undermine them or batter them down .
the city was abundantly supplied with water by means of <unk> constructions as perfect and complete as could be made in those days .
the water was brought by leaden pipes from a stream which came down from the mountains at some distance from the town .
it was conveyed by these pipes to every part of the town , and was distributed freely , so that every great street had a little current of water running through it , and every house a fountain in the court or garden .
besides this , in a public square or park there was a mound where the water was made to spout up in the centre , and then flow down in little rivulets and cascades on every side .
the gates and towers which have been described were in the outer wall , and beyond them , in the environs , were a great many fields , gardens , orchards , and <unk> grounds , which produced fruits of all sorts , that were sent by the merchants into all the neighboring countries .
at a little distance the town was almost entirely concealed from view by these gardens and orchards , there being nothing to be seen but <unk> , and some of the loftier roofs of the houses , rising above the tops of the trees .
there were so many people who flocked into <unk> from the surrounding country for shelter and protection , when they learned that genghis khan was coming , that the place would hardly contain them .
in addition to these , the sultan sent over one hundred thousand troops to defend the town , with thirty generals to command them .
there were twenty large elephants , too , that were brought with the army , to be employed in any service which might be required of them during the siege .
this army , however , instead of entering the city at once , encamped about it .
they strengthened the position of the camp by a deep ditch which they dug , throwing up the earth from the ditch on the side toward the camp so as to form a redoubt with which to defend the ground from the monguls .
but as soon as genghis khan arrived they were speedily driven from this post , and forced to take shelter within the walls of the city .
here they defended themselves with so much vigor and resolution that genghis khan would probably have found it very difficult to take the town had it not been for dissensions within the walls .
it seems that the <name> merchants and other wealthy men of the city , being convinced that the place would sooner or later fall into the hands of the monguls , thought it would be better to surrender it at once , while they were in a condition to make some terms by which they might <name> to save their lives , and perhaps their property .
but the generals would not listen to any proposition of this kind .
they had been sent by the sultan to defend the town , and they felt bound in honor , in obedience to their orders , to fight in defense of it to the last extremity .
the dissension within the city grew more and more violent every day , until at length the party of the inhabitants grew so strong and decided that they finally took possession of one of the gates , and sent a large deputation , consisting of priests , magistrates , and some of the principal citizens , to genghis khan , bearing with them the keys of the town , and proposing to deliver them up to him if he would spare the garrison and the inhabitants .
but he said he would make no terms except with those who were of their party and were willing to surrender .
in respect to the generals and the soldiers of the garrison he would make no promises .
the deputation gave up the keys and genghis khan entered the city .
the inhabitants were spared , but the soldiers were massacred wherever they could be found .
a great many perished in the streets .
a considerable body of them , however , with the governor at their head , retreated within the inner wall , and there defended themselves desperately for four days .
at the end of that time , finding that their case was hopeless , and knowing that they could expect no quarter from the monguls in any event , they resolved to make a <name> and cut their way through the ranks of their enemies at all hazards .
the governor , accordingly , put himself at the head of a troop of one thousand horse , and , coming out suddenly from his retreat , he dashed through the camp at a time when the monguls were off their guard , and so gained the open country and made his escape .
all the soldiers that remained behind in the city were immediately put to the sword .
in the mean time , the sultan himself , finding that his affairs were going to ruin , retreated from province to province , accompanied by as large a force as he could keep together , and vainly seeking to find some place of safety .
he had several sons , and among them two whose titles were jalaloddin and <unk> .
jalaloddin was the oldest , and was therefore naturally entitled to be his father 's successor ; but , for some reason or other , the <unk> , <unk> , had taken a dislike to him , and had persuaded her son , the sultan , to execute a sort of act or deed by which jalaloddin was displaced , and <unk> , who was a great favorite of hers , was made heir to the throne in his place .
the sultan had other sons who were governors of different provinces , and he fled from one to another of these , seeking in vain for some safe retreat .
but he could find none .
he was hunted from place to place by detachments of the monguls , and the number of his attendants and followers was continually diminishing , until at last he began to be completely discouraged .
at length , at one of the cities where he made a short stay , he delivered to an officer named <name> , who was the steward of his household , ten <unk> sealed with the <name> <unk> , with instructions to take them secretly to a certain distant fortress and lock them up carefully there , without allowing any one to know that he did it .
these <unk> contained the <name> jewels , and they were of inestimable value .
after this , one of his sons joined him with quite a large force , but very soon a large body of monguls came up , and , after a furious battle , the sultan 's troops were defeated and scattered in all directions ; and he was again obliged to fly , accompanied by a very small body of officers , who still contrived to keep near him .
with these he succeeded , at last , in reaching a very retired town near the caspian sea , where he hoped to remain concealed .
his strength was now spent , and all his courage gone .
he sank down into a condition of the greatest despondency and distress , and spent his time in going to the mosque and offering up prayers to god to save him from total ruin .
he made confession of his sins , and promised an entire amendment of life if the almighty would deliver him from his enemies and restore him to his throne .
at last the mongul detachment that was in pursuit of him in that part of the country were informed by a peasant where he was ; and one day , while he was at his prayers in the mosque , word was brought to him that the monguls were coming .
he rushed out of the mosque , and , guided by some friends , ran down to the shore and got into a boat , with a view of escaping by sea , all retreat by land being now cut off .
he had scarce got on board the boat when the monguls appeared on the shore .
the men in the boat immediately pushed off .
the monguls , full of disappointment and rage , shot at them with their arrows ; but the sultan was not struck by any of them , and was soon out of the reach of his pursuers .
the sultan lay in the boat almost helpless , being perfectly exhausted by the terror and distress which he had endured .
he soon began to suffer , too , from an intense pain in the chest and side , which gradually became so severe that he could scarcely breathe .
the men with him in the boat , finding that he was seriously sick , made the best of their way to a small island named <unk> , which is situated near the southeastern corner of the sea .
here they pitched a tent , and made up a bed in it , as well as they could , for the sufferer .
they also sent a messenger to the shore to bring off a physician secretly .
the physician did all that was in his power , but it was too late .
the inflammation and the pain subsided after a time , but it was evident that the patient was sinking , and that he was about to die .
it happened that the sultan 's son , jalaloddin , the one who had been set aside in favor of his brother <unk> , was at this time on the main land not far from the island , and intelligence was communicated to him of his father 's situation .
he immediately went to the island to see him , taking with him two of his brothers .
they were obliged to manage the business very secretly , to prevent the monguls from finding out what was going on .
on the arrival of jalaloddin , the sultan expressed great satisfaction in seeing him , and he <unk> the decree by which he had been superseded in the succession .
" you , my son , " said he , " are , after all , the one among all my children who is best able to revenge me on the monguls ; therefore i <unk> the act which i formerly executed at the request of the <name> , my mother , in favor of <unk> . "
he then solemnly appointed jalaloddin to be his successor , and enjoined upon the other princes to be obedient and faithful to him as their sovereign .
he also formally delivered to him his sword as the emblem and badge of the supreme power which he thus conferred upon him .
soon after this the sultan expired .
the attendants buried the body secretly on the island for fear of the monguls .
they washed it carefully before the interment , according to custom , and then put on again a portion of the same dress which the sultan had worn when living , having no means of procuring or making any other shroud .
as for <unk> , the <unk> , when she heard the tidings of her son 's death , and was informed , at the same time , that her favorite <unk> had been set aside , and jalaloddin , whom she hated , and who , she presumed , hated her , had been made his successor , she was in a great rage .
she was at that time at <unk> , which was the capital , and she attempted to persuade the officers and soldiers near her not to submit to the sultan 's decree , but to make <unk> their sovereign after all .
while she was engaged in forming this conspiracy , the news reached the city that the monguls were coming .
<unk> immediately determined to flee to save her life .
she had , it seems , in her custody at <unk> twelve children , the sons of various princes that reigned in different parts of the empire or in the environs of it .
these children were either held as hostages , or had been made captive in insurrections and wars , and were retained in prison as a punishment to their fathers .
the <unk> found that she could not take these children with her , and so she ordered them all to be slain .
she was afraid that the monguls , when they came , might set them free .
as soon as she was gone the city fell into great confusion on account of the struggles for power between the two parties of jalaloddin and <unk> .
but the <unk> , who had made the mischief , did not trouble herself to know how it would end .
her only anxiety was to save her own life .
after various wanderings and adventures , she at last found her way into a very retired district of country lying on the southern shore of the caspian , between the mountains and the sea , and here she sought refuge in a castle or fortress named <unk> , where she thought she was secure from all pursuit .
she brought with her to the castle her jewels and all her most valuable treasures .
but genghis khan had spies in every part of the country , and he was soon informed where <unk> was concealed .
so he sent a messenger to a certain mongul general named <unk> <unk> , who was commanding a detachment in that part of the country , informing him that <unk> was in the castle of <unk> , and commanding him to go and lay siege to it , and to take it at all hazards , and to bring <unk> to him either dead or alive .
<unk> immediately set off for the castle .
the <unk> , however , had notice of his approach , and the lords who were with her urged her to fly .
if she would go with them , they said , they would take her to jalaloddin , and he would protect her .
but she would not listen to any such proposal .
she hated jalaloddin so intensely that she would not , even to save her life , put herself under his power .
the very worst possible treatment , she said , that she could receive from the monguls would be more agreeable to her than the greatest favors from the hand of jalaloddin .
the ground of this extreme animosity which she felt toward jalaloddin was not any personal animosity to him ; it arose simply from an ancient and long-continued dislike and hatred which she had borne against his mother !
so <unk> refused to retire from the danger , and soon afterward the horde of monguls arrived , and pitched their camp before the castle walls .
for three months <unk> and his monguls continued to ply the walls of the fortress with <unk> and other engines , in order to force their way in , but in vain .
the place was too strong for them .
at length genghis khan , hearing how the case stood , sent word to them to give up the attempt to make a breach , and to invest the place closely on all sides , so as to allow no person to go out or to come in ; in that way , he said , the garrison would soon be starved into a surrender .
when the governor of the castle saw , by the arrangements which <unk> made in obedience to this order , that this was the course that was to be pursued , he said he was not uneasy , for his magazines were full of provisions , and as to water , the rain which fell very copiously there among the mountains always afforded an abundant supply .
but the governor was mistaken in his calculations in respect to the rain .
it usually fell very frequently in that region , but after the blockade of the fortress commenced , for three weeks there was not the smallest shower .
the people of the country around thought this failure of the rain was a special judgment of heaven against the <name> for the murder of the children , and for her various other crimes .
it was , indeed , remarkable , for in ordinary times the rain was so frequent that the people of all that region depended upon it entirely for their supply of water , and never found it necessary to search for springs or to dig wells .
the sufferings of the people within the fortress for want of water were very great .
many of them died in great misery , and at length the provisions began to fail too , and <unk> was compelled to allow the governor to surrender .
the monguls immediately seized the <name> , and took possession of all her treasures .
they also took captive all the lords and ladies who had attended her , and the women of her household , and two or three of her great-grandchildren , whom she had brought with her in her flight .
all these persons were sent under a strong guard to genghis khan .
genghis khan retained the <name> as a captive for some time , and treated her in a very cruel and barbarous manner .
he would sometimes order her to be brought into his tent , at the end of his dinner , that he might enjoy his triumph by insulting and <unk> her .
on these occasions he would throw her scraps of food from the table as if she had been a dog .
he took away the children from her too , all but one , whom he left with her a while to comfort her , as he said ; but one day an officer came and seized this one from her very arms , while she was dressing him and <unk> his hair .
this last blow caused her a severer pang than any that she had before endured , and left her utterly disconsolate and heart-broken .
some accounts say that soon after this she was put to death , but others state that genghis khan retained her several years as a captive , and carried her to and fro in triumph in his train through the countries over which she had formerly reigned with so much power and splendor .
she deserved her sufferings , it is true ; but genghis khan was none the less guilty , on that account , for treating her so cruelly .

after this genghis khan went on successfully for several years , extending his conquests over all the western part of central <name> , while the generals whom he had left at home were extending his dominions in the same manner in the eastern portion .
he <unk> nearly all of persia , went entirely around the caspian sea , and even approached the confines of <name> .
in this expedition toward <name> he was in pursuit of jalaloddin .
immediately after the death of his father , jalaloddin had done all in his power to raise an army and <name> on the war against genghis khan .
he met with a great deal of embarrassment and difficulty at first , on account of the plots and conspiracies which his grandmother had organized in favor of his brother <unk> , and the dissensions among his people to which they gave rise .
at last , in the course of a year , he succeeded , in some measure , in healing this breach and in raising an army ; and , though he was not strong enough to fight the monguls in a general battle , he <name> about them in their march and harassed them in various ways , so as to impede their operations very essentially .
genghis khan from time to time sent off detachments from his army to take him .
he was often defeated in the engagements which ensued , but he always succeeded in saving himself and in keeping together a portion of his men , and thus he maintained himself in the field , though he was growing weaker and weaker all the time .
at last he became completely discouraged , and , after signal defeat which he met with from a detachment which had been sent against him by genghis khan , he went , with the few troops that remained together , to a strong fortress among the mountains , and told the governor that it seemed to him useless to continue the struggle any longer , and that he had come to shut himself up in the fortress , and abandon the contest in despair .
the governor , however , told him that it was not right for a <name> , the descendant of ancestors so illustrious as his , and the <unk> of so resplendent a crown , to yield to discouragement and despondency on account of the reverses of fortune .
he advised him again to take the field , and to raise a new army , and continue the contest to the end .
jalaloddin determined to follow this advice , and , after a brief period of repose at the castle , he again took the field .
he made great exertions , and finally succeeded in getting together about twenty thousand men .
this was a small force , it is true , compared with the <name> of the enemy ; but it was sufficient , if well managed , to enable the <name> to undertake operations of considerable importance , and jalaloddin began to feel somewhat encouraged again .
with his twenty thousand men he gained one or two victories too , which encouraged him still more .
in one of these cases he defeated rather a singular stratagem which the mongul general contrived .
it seems that the mongul detachment which was sent out in this instance against jalaloddin was not strong enough , and the general , in order to make jalaloddin believe that his force was greater than it really was , ordered all the felt caps and cloaks that there were in the army to be stuffed with straw , and placed on the horses and camels of the baggage , in order to give the appearance of a second line of reserve in the rear of the line of real soldiers .
this was to induce jalaloddin to surrender without fighting .
but in some way or other jalaloddin detected the deceit , and , instead of surrendering , fought the monguls with great vigor , and defeated them .
he gained a very decided victory , and perhaps this might have been the beginning of a change of fortune for him if , unfortunately , his generals had not quarreled about the division of the spoil .
there was a beautiful arabian horse which two of his leading generals desired to possess , and each claimed it .
the dispute became , at last , so violent that one of the generals struck the other in his face with the lash of his whip .
upon this the feud became a deadly one .
both parties appealed to jalaloddin .
he did not wish to make either general an enemy by deciding in favor of the other , and so he tried to compromise the matter .
he did not succeed in doing this ; and one of the generals , mortally offended , went off in the night , taking with him all that portion of the troops which was under his command .
jalaloddin did every thing in his power to bring the disaffected general back again ; but , before he could accomplish this purpose , genghis khan came up with a large force between the two parties , and prevented their effecting a junction .
jalaloddin had now no alternative but to retreat .
genghis khan followed him , and it was in this way that , after a time , both the armies reached the banks of the indus , on the borders of <name> .
jalaloddin , being closely pursued , took his position in a narrow defile near the bank of the river , and here a great battle was fought among the rocks and precipices .
jalaloddin , it is said , had only thirty thousand men at his command , while genghis khan was at the head of an army of three hundred thousand .
the <name> in both cases are probably greatly exaggerated , but the proportion may perhaps be true .
it was only a small portion of the mongul army that could get into the defile where the sultan 's troops had posted themselves ; and so desperately did the latter fight , that it is said they killed twenty thousand of the monguls before they gave in .
in fact , they fought like wild beasts , with desperate and <unk> fury , all day long .
toward night it became evident to jalaloddin that it was all over with him .
a large portion of his followers were killed .
some had made their escape across the river , though many of those who sought to do so were drowned in the attempt .
the rest of his men were completely exhausted and discouraged , and wholly unable to renew the contest on the following day .
jalaloddin had exposed himself very freely in the fight , in hopes , perhaps , that he should be killed .
but genghis khan had given positive orders that he should be taken alive .
he had even appointed two of his generals to watch carefully , and to see that no person should , under any circumstances , kill him .
he wished to take him alive , in order to lead him through the country a prisoner , and exhibit him to his former subjects as a trophy of his victory , just as he had done and was still doing with the old <name> <unk> , his grandmother .
but jalaloddin was determined that his conqueror should not enjoy this pleasure .
he resolved to attempt to save himself by swimming the river .
he accordingly went first , breathless , and covered with dust and blood from the fight , to take a hurried leave of his mother , his wives , and his children , who , as was customary in those countries and times , had accompanied him in his campaign .
he found them in his tent , full of anxiety and terror .
he took leave of them with much sorrow and many tears , trying to comfort them with the <name> that they should meet again in happier times .
then he took off his armor and his arms , in order that he might not be impeded in crossing the river , reserving , however , his sword and bow , and a quiver full of arrows .
he then mounted a fresh horse and rode toward the river .
when he reached the bank of the river , the horse found the current so rapid and the agitation of the water so great that he was very unwilling to advance ; but jalaloddin spurred him in .
indeed , there was no time to be lost ; for scarcely had he reached the shore when genghis khan himself , and a party of monguls , appeared in view , advancing to seize him .
they stopped on the bank when they saw jalaloddin ride into the water among the rocks and <unk> .
they did not dare to follow him , but they remained at the water-side to see how his perilous adventure would end .
as soon as jalaloddin found that he was out of their reach , he stopped at a place where his horse found a foothold , and turned round toward his pursuers with looks of hatred and defiance .
he then <name> his bow , and began to shoot at them with his arrows , and he continued to shoot until all the arrows in his quiver were exhausted .
some of the more daring of the monguls proposed to genghis khan that they should swim out and try to take him .
but genghis khan would not allow them to go .
he said the attempt would be useless .
" you can do nothing at all with him , " said he .
" a man of such cool and determined bravery as that <name> defy and defeat all your attempts .
any father might be proud to have such a son , and any son proud to be descended from such a father . "
when his arrows were all expended , jalaloddin took to the river again ; and his horse , after a series of most desperate struggles among the <unk> and eddies , and the boiling surges which swept around the rocks , succeeded at length in carrying his master over .
the progress of the horse was watched with great interest by genghis khan and his party from the shore as long as they could see him .
as soon as jalaloddin landed , and had recovered a little from the fatigue and excitement of the passage , he began to look around him , and to consider what was next to be done .
he found himself entirely alone , in a wild and solitary place , which he had reason to fear was infested with tigers and other ferocious beasts of prey , such as haunt the jungles in <name> .
night was coming on too , and there were no signs of any habitations or of any shelter .
so he fastened his horse at the foot of a tree , and climbed up himself among the branches , and in this way passed the night .
the next morning he came down and began to walk along the bank of the river to see what he could find .
he was in a state of great anxiety and distress .
suddenly , to his great relief and <name> , he came upon a small troop of soldiers , accompanied by some officers , who had escaped across the river from the battle as he had done .
three of these officers were his particular friends , and he was overjoyed to see them .
they had made their way across the river in a boat which they had found upon the bank at the beginning of the defeat of the army .
they had spent the whole night in the boat , being in great danger from the shoals and shelving rocks , and from the impetuosity of the current .
finally , toward morning , they had landed , not far from the place where jalaloddin found them .
not long after this he came upon a troop of three hundred horsemen , who had escaped by swimming the river at a place where the water was more smooth , at some distance below .
these men told him that about six miles farther down the stream there was a body of about four thousand men who had made their escape in a similar manner .
on assembling these men , jalaloddin found himself once more at the head of a considerable force .
the immediate wants of the men were , however , extremely pressing , for they were all wholly destitute of food and of every other necessary , and jalaloddin would have been greatly embarrassed to provide for them had it not been for the <unk> and fidelity of one of the officers of his household on the other side of the river .
this officer 's name was <unk> .
as soon as he found that his master had crossed the river , knowing , too , that a great number of the troops had attempted to cross besides , and that , in all probability , many of them had succeeded in reaching the other bank , who would all be greatly in want of provisions and stores the next morning , he went to work at once , during the night , and loaded a very large boat with provisions , arms , money , and stuff to make clothing for the soldiers .
he succeeded in getting off in this boat before his plan was discovered by the monguls , and in the course of the next morning he reached the opposite bank with it , and thus furnished to jalaloddin an abundant provision for his immediate necessities .
jalaloddin was so much pleased with the conduct of <unk> in this affair that he appointed him at once to a very high and responsible office in his service , and gave him a new title of honor .
in the mean time , genghis khan , on the other side of the river , took possession the next morning of jalaloddin 's camp .
of course , the family of the sultan fell into his hands .
the emperor ordered all the males to be killed , but he reserved the women for a different fate .
among the persons killed was a boy about eight years old , <unk> oldest son .
jalaloddin had ordered his treasure to be sunk in the river , intending , probably , to come back and recover it at some future time .
but genghis khan found out in some way where it was sunk , and he sent divers down for it , and thus obtained possession of it as a part of his booty .
after this , jalaloddin remained five or six years in <name> , where he joined himself and his army with some of the princes of that country , and fought many campaigns there .
at length , when a favorable opportunity occurred , he came back to his own country , and fought some time longer against the monguls there , but he never succeeded in gaining possession of any substantial power .
genghis khan continued after this for two or three years in the mohammedan countries of the western part of <name> , and extended his conquests there in every direction .
it is not necessary to follow his movements in detail .
it would only be a repetition of the same tale of <unk> , plunder , murder , and devastation .
sometimes a city would surrender at once , when the conqueror approached the gates , by sending out a deputation of the magistrates and other principal inhabitants with the keys of the city , and with magnificent presents , in hopes to appease him .
and they usually so far succeeded in this as to put the mongul soldiery in <unk> , so that they would content themselves with <unk> and plundering the place , leaving the inhabitants alive .
at other times the town would attempt to resist .
the monguls would then build engines to batter down the walls , and to hurl great stones over among the besieged .
in many instances there was great difficulty in obtaining a sufficient supply of stones , on account of the alluvial character of the ground on which the city stood .
in such cases , after the stones found near were exhausted , the besiegers would cut down great trees from the avenues leading to the town , or from the forests near , and , sawing the trunk up into short lengths , would use the immense blocks thus formed as ammunition for the engines .
these great logs of heavy wood , when thrown over the walls , were capable of doing almost as much execution as the stones , though , compared with a modern <unk>  a monstrous ball of iron , which , after flying four or five miles from the battery , leaving on its way a fiery train through the air , descends into a town and bursts into a thousand fragments , which fly like iron hail in every direction around  they were very harmless missiles .
in sawing up the trunks of the trees into logs , and in bringing stones for the engines , the monguls employed the prisoners whom they had taken in war and made slaves of .
the amount of work of this kind which was to be done at some of the sieges was very great .
it is said that at the siege of <unk>  a town whose inhabitants greatly offended genghis khan by secretly sending arms , provisions , and money to jalaloddin , after they had once surrendered to the monguls and pretended to be friendly to them  the army of the monguls employed twelve hundred of these engines , all of which were made at a town at some distance from the place besieged , and were then transported , in parts , by the slaves , and put together by them under the walls .
while the slaves were employed in works of this kind , they were sometimes protected by wooden shields covered with raw hides , which were carried before them by other slaves , to keep off and extinguish the fiery darts and arrows which were shot at them from the wall .
sometimes , too , the places where the engines were set up were protected by wooden bulwarks , which , together with the <unk> itself of the engines , were covered with raw hides , to prevent their being set on fire by the enemy .
the number of raw hides required for this purpose was immense , and to obtain them the monguls slaughtered vast herds of horses and cattle which they plundered from the enemy .
in order to embarrass the enemy in respect to ammunition for their engines , the people of a town , when they heard that the monguls were coming , used to turn out sometimes in mass , several days before , and gather up all the stones they could find , and throw them into the river , or otherwise put them out of the way .
in some cases , the towns that were threatened , as has already been said , did not attempt to resist , but submitted at once , and cast themselves on the <name> of the conqueror .
in such cases the mongul generals usually spared the lives of the inhabitants , though they plundered their property .
it sometimes happened , too , that after attempting to defend themselves for some time , the garrison would become discouraged , and then would attempt to make some terms or conditions with the conqueror before they surrendered .
in these cases , however , the terms which the monguls insisted upon were often so hard that , rather than yield to them , the garrison would go on fighting to the end .
in one instance there lived in a town that was to be assailed a certain sheikh , or <name> , named <unk> , who was a man of very exalted character , as well as of high distinction .
the mongul general whom genghis khan had commissioned to take the town was his third son , <unk> .
<unk> had heard of the fame of the sheikh , and had conceived a very high respect for him .
so he sent a herald to the wall with a passport for the sheikh , and for ten other persons such as he should choose , giving him free permission to leave the town and go wherever he pleased .
but the sheikh declined the offer .
then <unk> sent in another passport , with permission to the sheikh to take a thousand men with him .
but he still refused .
he could not accept <unk> 's bounty , he said , unless it were extended to all the mohammedans in the town .
he was obliged to take his lot with the rest , for he was bound to his people by ties too strong to be easily sundered .
so the siege went on , and at the end of it , when the town was carried , the sheikh was slain with the rest in the streets , where he stood his ground to the last , fighting like a lion .
all the mohammedan chieftains , however , did not possess so <name> a spirit as this .
one chieftain , when he found that the monguls were coming , caused himself to be let down with ropes from the wall in the night , and so made his escape , leaving the town and the garrison to their fate .
the garrisons of the towns , knowing that they had little <name> to expect from their terrible enemies , fought often very desperately to the last , as they would have done against beasts of prey .
they would suddenly open the gates and rush out in large bands , provided with combustibles of all kinds and torches , with which they would set fire to the engines of the besiegers , and then get back again within the walls before the monguls could recover sufficiently from the alarm and confusion to intercept them .
in this manner they destroyed a great many of the engines , and killed vast <name> of men .
still the monguls would persevere , and , sooner or later , the place was sure to fall .
then , when the inhabitants found that all <name> was over , they had become so desperate in their hatred of their foes that they would sometimes set the town on fire with their own hands , and throw themselves and their wives and children into the flames , rather than fall into the hands of their infuriated enemies .
the cruelties which the monguls perpetrated upon their unhappy victims when , after a long resistance , they finally gained possession of a town , were indeed dreadful .
they usually ordered all the people to come out to an open space on the plain , and there , after taking out all the young and able-bodied men , who could be made useful in bringing stones and setting up engines , and other such labors , and also all the young and beautiful women , to be divided among the army or sold as slaves , they would put the rest together in a mass , and kill them all by shooting at them with arrows , just as if they had been beasts surrounded in a <name> , excepting that the excitement and pleasure of shooting into such a mass of human victims , and of hearing the shrieks and cries of their terror , was probably infinitely greater to their brutal murderers than if it had been a herd of lions , tigers , and wolves that they were destroying .
it is said by the historians that in one case the number of people ordered out upon the plain was so great that it took four days for them to pass out and assemble at the appointed place , and that , after those who were to be spared had been separated from the rest , the number that were left to be slain was over one hundred thousand , as recorded by the secretaries who made an enumeration of them .
in another case the slaughter was so great that it took twelve days to count the number of the dead .
some of the atrocities which were perpetrated upon the prisoners were almost too horrible to be described .
in one case a woman , quite advanced in years , begged the monguls to spare her life , and promised that , if they would do so , she would give them a <name> of great value .
they asked her where the <name> was , and she said she had swallowed it .
the monguls then immediately cut her down , and ripped her body open with their swords to find the <name> .
they found it , and then , encouraged by this success , and thinking it probable that other women might have attempted to hide their jewels in the same way , they proceeded to kill and cut open a great number of women to search for pearls in their bodies , but they found no more .
at the siege of a certain city , called <unk> , a young grandson of genghis khan , wishing to please his grandfather by his daring , approached so near the wall that he was reached by an arrow shot by one of the archers , and killed .
genghis khan was deeply affected by this event , and he showed by the bitterness of his grief that , though he was so utterly heartless and cruel in inflicting these woes upon others , he could feel for himself very acutely when it came to his turn to suffer .
as for the mother of the child , she was rendered perfectly furious by his death .
she thought of nothing but revenge , and she only waited for the town to be taken in order that she might enjoy it .
when , at last , a practicable breach was made , and the soldiers began to pour into the city , she went in with the rest , and insisted that every man , woman , and child should be put to death .
her special rage was directed against the children , whom she seemed to take special pleasure in destroying , in vengeance for the death of her own child .
the hatred and rage which she manifested against children extended even to babes unborn , and these feelings she evinced by atrocities too shocking to be described .
the opinions which genghis khan entertained on religious subjects appear from a conversation which he held at one time during the course of his campaigns in western <name> with some learned mohammedan doctors at bokhara , which was the great seat at that time of science and philosophy .
he asked the doctors what were the principles of their religion .
they replied that these principles consisted of five fundamental points : 1 .
in believing in one god , the creator of all things , and the supreme ruler and governor of the universe .
2 .
in giving one <unk> part of their yearly income or gains to the poor .
3 .
in praying to god five times every day .
4 .
in setting apart one month in each year for fasting .
5 .
in making a pilgrimage to the <name> in mecca , there to worship god .
genghis khan told them that he believed himself in the first of these articles , and he approved of the three succeeding ones .
it was very well , he said , to give one <unk> of one 's income to the poor , and to pray to god five times a day , and to set apart a month in the year for a fast .
but as to the last article , he could not but dissent from it entirely , for the whole world was god 's house , and it was ridiculous , he said , to imagine that one place could really be any more fitting than another as a place for worshiping him .
the learned doctors were much dissatisfied with this answer .
they were , in fact , more displeased with the dissent which the emperor expressed from this last article , the only one that was purely and wholly ritual in its character , than they were gratified with the concurrence which he expressed in all the other four .
this is not at all surprising , for , from the times of the pharisees down to the present day , the spirit of <unk> and <unk> in religion always plants itself most strongly on the platform of <unk> .
it is always contending strenuously for rites , while it places comparatively in the background all that bears directly on the vital and spiritual interests of the soul .

when genghis khan found that his conquests in western <name> were in some good degree established and confirmed , he illustrated his victory and the consequent extension of his empire by two very imposing celebrations .
the first was a grand hunt .
the second was a solemn <unk> of all the estates of his immense realm in a sort of diet or <unk> assembly .
the accounts given by the historians of both these celebrations are doubtless greatly exaggerated .
their description of the hunt is as follows : it was after the close of the campaign in <unk> that it took place , while the army were in <name> quarters .
the object of the hunt was to keep the soldiers occupied , so as to avoid the relaxation of discipline , and the vices and disorder which generally creep into a camp where there are no active occupations to engage the minds of the men .
the hunt took place in a vast region of uninhabited country , which was infested with wild beasts of every kind .
the soldiers were marched out on this expedition in order of war , as if it were a country occupied by armed men that they were going to attack .
the different detachments were conducted to the different points in the outskirts of the country , from which they severally extended themselves to the right and left , so as completely to <unk> the ground .
and the space was so large , it is said , which was thus inclosed , that it took them several weeks to march in to the centre .
it is true that in such a case the men would advance very slowly , perhaps only a few miles each day , in order that they might examine the ground thoroughly , and leave no ravine , or thicket , or other <unk> , where beasts might conceal themselves , unexplored .
still , the circle was doubtless immensely large .
when the appointed morning at length arrived , the men at the several stations were arrayed , and they commenced their advance toward the centre , moving to the sound of trumpets , drums , <unk> , and other such instruments of martial music as were in use in those days .
the men were strictly forbidden to kill any animal .
they were only to start them out from their <unk> and lairs , and drive them in toward the centre of the field .
great <name> of the men were provided with picks , spades , and other similar tools , with which they were to dig out the burrows and holes of such animals as should seek refuge under ground .
they went on in this way for some weeks .
the animals ran before them , thinking , when they were disturbed by the men , that it was only a momentary danger , which they could easily escape from , as usual , by running forward into the next thicket ; but soon the advancing line of the soldiers reached them there , and drove them out again , and if they attempted to turn to the right or the left they soon found themselves intercepted .
thus , as the circle grew narrower , and the space inclosed diminished , the animals began to find themselves mixing with one another in great <name> , and being now irritated and angry , they attacked one another in many instances , the strong falling upon and killing the weak .
thus a great many were killed , though not by the hands of the soldiers .
at last the <name> became so great , and the excitement and terror of the animals so intense , that the soldiers had great difficulty in driving them forward .
the poor beasts ran this way and that , half distracted , while the soldiers pressed steadily on behind them , and cut them off from every chance of escape by raising terrific shouts and outcries , and by brandishing weapons before them wherever they attempted to turn .
at length the animals were all driven in to the inner circle , a comparatively small space , which had been previously marked out .
around this space double and triple lines of troops were drawn up , armed with pikes and spears , which they pointed in toward the centre , thus forming a sort of wall by which the beasts were closely shut in .
the plan was now for the officers and khans , and all the great personages of the court and the army , to go into the circle , and show their courage and their prowess by attacking the beasts and slaying them .
but the courage required for such an exploit was not so great as it might seem , for it was always found on these occasions that the beasts , though they had been very wild and ferocious when first aroused from their lairs , and had appeared excessively irritated when they found the circle beginning to narrow around them , ended at last in losing all their spirit , and in becoming discouraged , dejected , and tame .
this was owing partly , perhaps , to their having become , in some degree , familiar with the sight of men , but more probably to the exhaustion produced by long-continued fatigue and excitement , and to their having been for so many days deprived in a great degree of their accustomed food and rest .
thus in this , as in a great many other similar instances , the poor soldiers and common people incurred the danger and the toil , and then the great men came in at the end to reap the <name> .
genghis khan himself was the first to enter the circle for the purpose of attacking the beasts .
he was followed by the princes of his family , and by other great chieftains and khans .
as they went in , the whole army surrounded the inclosure , and completely filled the air with the sound of drums , <unk> , trumpets , and other such instruments , and with the noise of the most terrific shouts and outcries which they could make , in order to terrify and <unk> the beasts as much as possible , and to destroy in them all thought and <name> of resistance .
and , indeed , so much effect was produced by these means of <unk> , that the beasts , it is said , became completely stupefied .
" they were so <unk> that they lost all their fierceness .
the lions and tigers became as tame as lambs , and the bears and wild boars , like the most <unk> creatures , became dejected and amazed . "
still , the going in of genghis khan and the princes to attack them was not wholly without danger ; for , of course , it was a point of honor with them to select the most ferocious and fierce of the animals , and some of these , when they found themselves actually assailed , were aroused again , and , recovering in some degree their native ferocity , seemed impelled to make a last desperate effort to defend themselves .
after killing a few of the lions , tigers , and bears , genghis khan and his immediate suite retired to a place at one side of the inclosure , where a throne had been set up for the emperor on an eminence which afforded a good view of the field .
here genghis khan took his seat in order to enjoy the spectacle of the slaughter , and then an immense number of men were allowed to go in and amuse themselves with killing and destroying the poor beasts till they were perfectly <unk> with the sight of blood and of suffering .
at last some of the khan 's <unk> , attended by several other young princes , approached the throne where the emperor was seated , and <unk> him to order the carnage to cease , and to allow the rest of the animals to go free .
this petition the emperor granted .
the lines were broken up , the animals that had escaped being massacred made their way back into the wilds again , and the hunt was over .
the several detachments of the army then set out on their march back to the camp again .
but so great was the scale on which this grand hunting expedition was conducted , that four months elapsed between the time of their setting out upon it till the time of their return .
* * * * * the grand diet or general assembly of the states of genghis <unk> empire took place two or three years later , when the conquest of western <name> was complete , and the sons of the emperor and all the great generals could be called together at the emperor 's head-quarters without much danger .
the place chosen for this assembly was a vast plain in the vicinity of the city of <unk> , which has already been mentioned as one of the great cities conquered by genghis khan .
<unk> lay in a central and convenient position for the purpose of this assembly .
it was , moreover , a <name> and beautiful city , and could furnish all that would be necessary for the wants of the assembly .
the meeting , however , was not to be held in the city itself , but upon a great plain in the environs of it , where there was space for all the khans , with their numerous <unk> , to pitch their tents .
when the khans and chieftains began to assemble , there came first the sons of the king , returning from the various expeditions on which their father had sent them , and bringing with them magnificent presents .
these presents , of course , consisted of the treasures and other valuables which they had taken in plunder from the various cities which had fallen into their hands .
the presents which jughi brought exceeded in value those of all the others .
among the rest , there was a herd of horses one hundred thousand in number .
these horses had , of course , been seized in the pastures of the conquered countries , and were now brought to the emperor to be used by him in mounting his troops .
they were arrayed in bands according to the color , white , dappled gray , bay , black , and spotted , of each kind an equal number .
the emperor received and welcomed his sons with great <name> , and readily accepted their presents .
in return , he made presents to them from his own <unk> .
after this , as other princes and khans came in , and encamped with their troops and followers on the plain , the emperor entertained them all with a series of grand banquets and public diversions of all sorts .
among other things a grand hunting party was organized , somewhat similar in the general plan to the one already described , only on a much smaller scale , of course , in respect to the number of persons engaged and the time occupied , while yet it greatly surpassed that one in magnificence and splendor .
several thousand beasts were slain , it is said , and a great number and variety of birds , which were taken by the <unk> .
at the end of the hunt a great banquet was given , which surpassed all the other feasts in <unk> .
they had on the tables of this banquet a great variety of drinks  not only <name> wines from the southern countries , but beer , and <unk> , and also <unk> , which the army had learned to make in persia .
in the mean time , the great space on the plain , which had been set apart for the encampment , had been gradually becoming filled up by the arrival of the khans , until at length , in every direction , as far as the eye could reach , the whole plain was covered with groups of tents and long lines of movable houses , brought on wheels .
the ground which the encampment covered was said by the historians to have been seven leagues in extent .
if the space occupied was any thing at all approaching this magnitude , it could only be that the outer portions of it were occupied by the herdsmen and other servants of the khans , who had to take care of the cattle and horses of the troops , and to provide them with suitable pasture .
indeed , the great number of animals which these wandering tribes always took with them on their journeys rendered it necessary to appropriate a much larger space to their encampments than would have been otherwise required .
it is surprising to us , who are accustomed to look upon living in tents as so exclusively an irregular and temporary expedient , to learn how completely this mode of life was reduced to a system in those days , and how perfect and complete all the arrangements relating to it were made .
in this case , in the centre of the encampment , a space of two leagues in length was regularly laid out in streets , squares , and <unk> , like a town .
here were the emperor 's quarters , with magnificent tents for himself and his immediate household , and multitudes of others of a plainer character for his servants and retainers .
the tents of the other grand khans were near .
they were made of <name> materials , and ornamented in a sumptuous manner , and silken streamers of various colors floated in the wind from the summits of them .
besides these there was an immense tent , built for the assembly itself to hold its sessions in .
this tent was so large , it is said , that it would contain two thousand persons .
it was covered with white , which made it very conspicuous .
there were two <unk> leading to the interior .
one of them was called the imperial gate , and was for the use of genghis khan alone .
the other was the public gate , and was used in general for the members of the assembly and for spectators .
within the tent was erected a magnificent throne , intended for the use of the emperor during the sessions of the assembly .
a great amount of important business was transacted by the assembly while it continued in session , and many important <unk> were made by the emperor .
the constitution and laws of the empire were <unk> anew , and all necessary arrangements made for the government of the various provinces both near and remote .
at length , when these various objects had been accomplished , and the business was concluded , the emperor gave audience individually to all the princes , khans , generals , governors of provinces , and other grand dignitaries who were present on the occasion , in order that they might take their leave preparatory to returning to their several countries .
when this ceremony was concluded the encampment was broken up , and the various khans set off , each at the head of his own caravan , on the road leading to his own home .

after the grand <unk> described in the last chapter , genghis khan lived only three years .
during this time he went on extending his conquests with the same triumphant success that had attended his previous operations .
having at length established his dominion in western <name> on a permanent basis , he returned to the original seat of his empire in the east , after seven years ' absence , where he was received with great honor by the mongul nation .
he began again to extend his conquests in <name> .
he was very successful .
indeed , with the exception of one great calamity which befell him , his career was one of continued and <unk> prosperity .
this calamity was the death of his son jughi , his oldest , most distinguished , and <unk> son .
the news of this event threw the khan into a deep melancholy , so that for a time he lost all his interest in public affairs , and even the news of victories obtained in distant countries by his armies ceased to awaken any joyful emotions in his mind .
the khan was now , too , becoming quite advanced in life , being about sixty-four years old , which is an age at which the mind is slow to recover its lost elasticity .
he did , however , slowly recover from the effects of his grief , and he then went on with his warlike preparations .
he had conquered all the northern portion of <name> , and was now making arrangements for a grand invasion of the southern part , when at length , in the spring of the year <unk> , he fell sick .
he struggled against the disease during the summer , but at length , in <name> , he found himself growing worse , and felt that his end was drawing nigh .
his mind was occupied mainly , during all this interval , by arranging the details of the coming campaign , and making known to the officers around him all the particulars of his plans , in order that they might <name> them out successfully after his decease .
he was chiefly concerned , as well he might be , lest the generals should quarrel among each other after he should be gone , and he continually <unk> them to be united , and on no account to allow discord or dissensions to creep in and divide them .
his oldest son , next to jughi , was <unk> , but he was of a mild and amiable temper , and not so well qualified to govern so <unk> an empire as the next son , whose name was <unk> .
the next son to <unk> , whose name was <unk> , was with his father at the time when his sickness at last assumed an immediately alarming character .
this change for the worse , which convinced the emperor that his death was drawing nigh , took place one day when he was traveling with a portion of his army , being borne on a litter on account of his infirm and feeble condition .
a halt was ordered , a camp was formed , and the great conqueror was borne to a tent which was pitched for him on the spot near the borders of the forest .
the physicians and the <unk> came around him , and tried to comfort him with encouraging predictions , but he knew by the pains that he felt , and by other inward sensations , that his hour had come .
he accordingly ordered that all of his sons who were in the camp , and all the princes of his family , should be called in to his bedside .
when they had all assembled , he caused himself to be raised up in his bed , and then made a short but very solemn address to them .
" i leave you , " said he , " the greatest empire in the world , but your preserving it depends upon your remaining always united .
if discord steals in among you all <name> most assuredly be lost . "
then , turning to the great chieftains and khans who were standing by  the great nobles of his court  he appealed to them , as well as to the princes of his family , whether it was not just and reasonable that he , who had established the empire , and built it up wholly from the very foundations , should have the right to name a successor to inherit it after he was gone .
they all expressed a full assent to this proposition .
his sons and the other princes of his family fell on their knees and said , " you are our father and our emperor , and we are your slaves .
it is for us to bow in submission to all the commands with which you honor us , and to render the most implicit obedience to them . "
the khan then proceeded to announce to the assembly that he had made choice of his son <unk> as his successor , and he declared him the khan of khans , which was the imperial title , according to the constitution .
the whole assembly then kneeled again , and solemnly declared that they accepted the choice which the emperor had made , and promised allegiance and fidelity to the new sovereign so soon as he should be invested with power .
the aged emperor then gave to his second son , <unk> , a large country for his kingdom , which , however , he was , of course , to hold under the general sovereignty of his brother .
he also appointed his son <unk> , who was then present , to act as regent until <unk> should return .
the assembly was then dismissed , and very soon afterward the great conqueror died .
<unk> , of course , immediately entered upon his office as regent , and under his direction the body of his father was interred , with great magnificence , under a venerable tree , where the khan had rested himself with great satisfaction a few days before he was taken sick .
the spot was a very beautiful one , and in due time a magnificent monument was erected over the grave .
trees were afterward planted around the spot , and other improvements were made in the grounds , by which it became , at length , it was said , one of the finest <unk> in the world .
as soon as <unk> , whom the emperor had designated as his successor , returned home , he was at once proclaimed emperor , and established himself at his father 's court .
the news of the old emperor 's death rapidly spread throughout <name> , and a succession of embassadors were sent from all the provinces , <unk> , and kingdoms throughout the empire , and also from such contiguous states as desired to maintain friendly relations with the new monarch , to bring addresses and messages of <unk> from their respective rulers .
and so great was the extent of country from which these embassadors came that a period of six months was consumed before these melancholy ceremonies were ended .
* * * * * the fate of the grand empire which genghis khan established was the same with that of all others that have arisen in the world , from time to time , by the extension of the power of great military commanders over <unk> and heterogeneous nations .
the sons and successors to whom the vast possessions descended soon quarreled among themselves , and the immense fabric fell to pieces in less time than it had taken to construct it .
the end .

chapter i .
the three modes of management .
it is not impossible that in the minds of some persons the idea of employing gentle measures in the management and training of children may seem to imply the abandonment of the principle of authority , as the basis of the parental government , and the <unk> of some weak and inefficient system of artifice and manoeuvring in its place .
to suppose that the object of this work is to aid in effecting such a <unk> as that , is entirely to mistake its nature and design .
the only government of the parent over the child that is worthy of the name is one of authority  complete , absolute , unquestioned authority .
the object of this work is , accordingly , not to show how the gentle methods which <name> be brought to view can be employed as a substitute for such authority , but how they can be made to aid in establishing and maintaining it .
three methods .
there are three different modes of management customarily employed by parents as means of inducing their children to comply with their requirements .
they are , 1 .
government by manoeuvring and artifice .
2 .
by reason and affection .
3 .
by authority .
manoeuvring and artifice .
1 .
many mothers manage their children by means of tricks and contrivances , more or less adroit , designed to avoid direct issues with them , and to beguile them , as it were , into compliance with their wishes .
as , for example , where a mother , recovering from sickness , is going out to take the air with her husband for the first time , and  as she is still feeble  wishes for a very quiet drive , and so concludes not to take little <name> with her , as she usually does on such occasions ; but knowing that if <name> sees the chaise at the door , and discovers that her father and mother are going in it , she <name> be very eager to go too , she adopts a system of manoeuvres to conceal her design .
she brings down her bonnet and shawl by stealth , and before the chaise comes to the door she sends <name> out into the garden with her sister , under pretense of showing her a bird 's nest which is not there , trusting to her sister 's skill in <unk> the child's mind , and amusing her with something else in the garden , until the chaise has gone .
and if , either from hearing the sound of the wheels , or from any other cause , <name> 's suspicions are awakened  and children habitually managed on these principles soon learn to be extremely <unk> and suspicious  and she insists on going into the house , and thus discovers the stratagem , then , perhaps , her mother tells her that they are only going to the doctor 's , and that if <name> goes with them , the doctor <name> give her some dreadful medicine , and compel her to take it , thinking thus to <unk> her from insisting on going with them to ride .
as the chaise drives away , <name> stands bewildered and perplexed on the door-step , her mind in a tumult of excitement , in which hatred of the doctor , distrust and suspicion of her mother , disappointment , vexation , and ill humor , surge and swell among those delicate organizations on which the structure and development of the soul so closely depend  doing perhaps an irreparable injury .
the mother , as soon as the chaise is so far turned that <name> can no longer watch the expression of her countenance , goes away from the door with a smile of complacency and satisfaction upon her face at the ingenuity and success of her little artifice .
in respect to her statement that she was going to the doctor 's , it may , or may not , have been true .
most likely not ; for mothers who manage their children on this system find the line of <unk> between deceit and falsehood so vague and ill defined that they soon fall into the habit of disregarding it altogether , and of saying , without hesitation , any thing which <name> serve the purpose in view .
governing by reason and affection .
2 .
the theory of many mothers is that they must govern their children by the influence of reason and affection .
their method may be exemplified by supposing that , under circumstances similar to those described under the preceding head , the mother calls <name> to her side , and , smoothing her hair caressingly with her hand while she speaks , says to her , " <name> , your father and i are going out to ride this afternoon , and i am going to explain it all to you why you can not go too .
you see , i have been sick , and am getting well , and i am going out to ride , so that i may get well faster .
you love mamma , i am sure , and wish to have her get well soon .
so you <name> be a good girl , i know , and not make any trouble , but <name> stay at home contentedly  wo n't you ?
then i shall love you , and your papa <name> love you , and after i get well we <name> take you to ride with us some day . "
the mother , in managing the case in this way , <unk> partly on convincing the reason of the child , and partly on an appeal to her affection .
governing by authority .
3 .
by the third method the mother secures the compliance of the child by a direct exercise of authority .
she says to her  the circumstances of the case being still supposed to be the same  " <name> , your father and i are going out to ride this afternoon , and i am sorry , for your sake , that we can not take you with us . "
" why ca n't you take me ? "
asks <name> .
" i can not tell you why , now , " replies the mother , " but perhaps i <name> explain it to you after i come home .
i think there is a good reason , and , at any rate , i have decided that you are not to go .
if you are a good girl , and do not make any difficulty , you can have your little chair out upon the front door-step , and can see the chaise come to the door , and see your father and me get in and drive away ; and you can wave your handkerchief to us for a good-bye . "
then , if she observes any expression of discontent or <unk> in <name> 's countenance , the mother would add , " if you should not be a good girl , but should show signs of making us any trouble , i shall have to send you out somewhere to the back part of the house until we are gone . "
but this last supposition is almost always unnecessary ; for if <name> has been habitually managed on this principle she <name> not make any trouble .
she <name> perceive at once that the question is settled  settled irrevocably  and especially that it is entirely beyond the power of any demonstrations of <unk> or rebellion that she can make to change it .
she <name> acquiesce at once .
[ a ] she may be sorry that she can not go , but she <name> make no resistance .
those children only attempt to <name> their points by noisy and violent demonstrations who find , by experience , that such measures are usually successful .
a child , even , who has become once accustomed to them , <name> soon drop them if she finds , owing to a change in the system of management , that they now never succeed .
and a child who never , from the beginning , finds any efficiency in them , never learns to employ them at all .
conclusion .
of the three methods of managing children exemplified in this chapter , the last is the only one which can be followed either with comfort to the parent or safety to the child ; and to show how this method can be brought effectually into operation by gentle measures is the object of this book .
it is , indeed , true that the importance of tact and skill in the training of the young , and of cultivating their reason , and securing their affection , can not be overrated .
but the influences secured by these means form , at the best , but a <name> foundation for filial obedience to rest upon .
the child is not to be made to comply with the requirements of his parents by being <unk> <unk> into compliance , nor is his obedience to rest on his love for father and mother , and his unwillingness to <unk> them , nor on his conviction of the <unk> and reasonableness of their commands , but on simple submission to authority  that absolute and almost unlimited authority which all parents are commissioned by god and nature to exercise over their offspring during the period while the offspring remain dependent upon their care .
chapter ii .
what are gentle measures ?
it being thus distinctly understood that the gentle measures in the training of children herein recommended are not to be resorted to as a substitute for parental authority , but as the easiest and most effectual means of establishing and maintaining that authority in its most absolute form , we have now to consider what the nature of these gentle measures is , and by what characteristics they are distinguished , in their action and influence , from such as may be considered more or less violent and harsh .
gentle measures are those which tend to exert a <unk> , <unk> , and soothing influence on the mind , or to produce only such excitements as are pleasurable in their character , as means of <unk> wrong and encouraging right action .
<unk> measures are those which tend to <unk> and irritate the mind , or to agitate it with painful excitements .
three degrees of violence .
there seem to be three grades or forms of violence to which a mother may resort in controlling her children , or , perhaps , rather three classes of measures which are more or less violent in their effects .
to illustrate these we <name> take an example .
case supposed .
one day <name> , four years old , asked her mother for an apple .
" have you had any already ? "
asked her mother .
" only one , " replied <name> .
" then <name> may give you another , " said the mother .
what <name> said was not true .
she had already eaten two apples .
<name> heard the falsehood , but she did not consider it her duty to betray the child , so she said nothing .
the mother , however , afterwards , in the course of the day , accidentally ascertained the truth .
now , as we have said , there are three grades in the kind and character of the measures which may be considered violent that a mother may resort to in a case like this .
bodily punishment .
1 .
first , there is the infliction of bodily pain .
the child may be whipped , or tied to the <unk> , and kept in a constrained and uncomfortable position for a long time , or shut up in solitude and darkness , or punished by the infliction of bodily suffering in other ways .
and there is no doubt that there is a tendency in such treatment to correct or cure the fault .
but measures like these , whether successful or not , are certainly violent measures .
they shock the whole nervous system , sometimes with the excitement of pain and terror , and always , probably , with that of resentment and anger .
in some cases this excitement is extreme .
the excessively delicate organization of the <name> , through which such agitations reach the sensorium , and which , in children of an early age , is in its most tender and sensitive state of development , is subjected to a most intense and violent agitation .
evil effects of violence in this form .
the evil effects of this excessive cerebral action may perhaps entirely pass away in a few hours , and leave no trace of injury behind ; but then , on the other hand , there is certainly reason to fear that such commotions , especially if often repeated , tend to impede the regular and healthful development of the organs , and that they may become the origin of <unk> , or of actual <unk> , resulting very seriously in future years .
it is impossible , perhaps , to know with certainty whether permanent ill effects follow in such cases or not .
at any rate , such a remedy is a violent one .
the frightening system .
2 .
there is a second grade of violence in the treatment of such a case , which consists in exciting pain or terror , or other painful or disagreeable emotions , through the imagination , by presenting to the fancy of the child images of phantoms , <unk> , and other frightful monsters , whose ire , it is pretended , is greatly excited by the misdeeds of children , and who come in the <unk> to take them away , or otherwise visit them with terrible retribution .
domestic servants are very prone to adopt this mode of discipline .
being forbidden to resort to personal violence as a means of exciting pain and terror , they attempt to accomplish the same end by other means , which , however , in many respects , are still more injurious in their action .
management of nurses and servants .
nurses and attendants upon children from certain nationalities in europe are peculiarly disposed to employ this method of governing children placed under their care .
one reason is that they are accustomed to this mode of management at home ; and another is that many of them are brought up under an idea , which prevails extensively in some of those countries , that it is right to tell falsehoods where the honest object is to accomplish a charitable or useful end .
accordingly , inasmuch as the restraining of the children from wrong is a good and useful object , they can declare the existence of giants and <unk> , to <name> away and devour bad girls and boys , with an air of <unk> and seeming honesty , and with a calm and persistent assurance , which aids them very much in producing on the minds of the children a conviction of the truth of what they say ; while , on the other hand , those who , in theory at least , occupy the position that the direct <unk> of one 's word is never justifiable , act at a disadvantage in attempting this method .
for although , in practice , they are often inclined to make an exception to their principles in regard to truth in the case of what is said to young children , they can not , after all , tell children what they know to be not true with that bold and confident air necessary to <name> full conviction to the children 's minds .
they are embarrassed by a kind of half guilty feeling , which , partially at least , betrays them , and the children do not really and fully believe what they say .
they can not suppose that their mother would really tell them what she knew was false , and yet they can not help perceiving that she does not speak and look as if what she was saying was actually true .
monsieur and madame <unk> .
in all countries there are many , among even the most refined and highly cultivated classes , who are not at all embarrassed by any moral delicacy of this kind .
this is especially the case in those countries in europe , particularly on the continent , where the idea above referred to , of the <unk> of falsehood in certain cases as a means for the attainment of a good end , is generally entertained .
the french have two terrible <unk> , under the names of monsieur and madame <unk> , who are as familiar to the imaginations of french children as <name> claus is , in a much more agreeable way , to the juvenile fancy at our <unk> .
monsieur and madame <unk> are frightful monsters , who come down the chimney , or through the roof , at night , and <name> off bad children .
they learn from their little fingers  which whisper in their ears when they hold them near  who the bad children are , where they live , and what they have done .
the instinctive <name> of young children in their mother 's truthfulness is so strong that no absurdity seems gross enough to overcome it .
the black man and the policeman .
there are many mothers among us who  though not quite prepared to call in the aid of ghosts , giants , and <unk> , or of monsieur and madame <unk> , in managing their children  still , sometimes , try to <unk> out their failing authority by threatening them with the " black man , " or the " policeman , " or some other less , supernatural terror .
they seem to imagine that inasmuch as , while there is no such thing in existence as a <unk> , there really are policemen and prisons , they only half tell an untruth by saying to the <unk> little one that a policeman is coming to <name> him off to jail .
injurious effects .
although , by these various modes of exciting imaginary fears , there is no direct and outward infliction of bodily suffering , the effect produced on the delicate organization of the <name> by such excitements is violent in the extreme .
the paroxysms of agitation and terror which they sometimes excite , and which are often spontaneously renewed by darkness and solitude , and by other exciting causes , are of the nature of temporary insanity .
indeed , the extreme nervous <unk> which they produce sometimes becomes a real insanity , which , though it may , in many cases , be finally <unk> , may probably in many others lead to lasting and most deplorable results .
harsh <unk> and <unk> .
3 .
there is a third mode of treatment , more common , perhaps , among us than either of the preceding , which , though much milder in its character than they , we still class among the violent measures , on account of its operation and effects .
it consists of stern and harsh rebukes , denunciations of the <unk> of the sin of falsehood , with solemn <unk> of the awful consequences of it , in this life and in that to come , intended to awaken feelings of alarm and distress in the mind of the child , as a means of promoting repentance and reformation .
these are not violent measures , it is true , so far as outward physical action is concerned ; but the effects which they produce are sometimes of quite a violent nature , in their operation on the delicate nervous and mental <unk> which are excited and agitated by them .
if the mother is successful in making the impression which such a mode of treatment is designed to produce , the child , especially if a girl , is agitated and distressed .
her nervous system is greatly disturbed .
if calmed for a time , the paroxysm is very liable to return .
she wakes in the night , perhaps , with an indefinable feeling of anxiety and terror , and comes to her mother 's bedside , to seek , in her presence , and in the sense of protection which it affords , a relief from her distress .
the conscientious mother , supremely anxious to secure the best interests of her child , may say that , after all , it is better that she should endure this temporary suffering than not be saved from the sin .
this is true .
but if she can be saved just as effectually without it , it is better still .
the gentle method of treatment .
4 .
we now come to the gentle measures which may be adopted in a case of discipline like this .
they are <unk> varied in form , but , to illustrate the nature and operation of them , and the spirit and temper of mind with which they should be enforced , with a view of communicating ; to the mind of the reader some general idea of the characteristics of that gentleness of treatment which it is the object of this work to commend , we <name> describe an actual case , substantially as it really occurred , where a child , whom we <name> still call <name> , told her mother a falsehood about the apple , as already related .
choosing the right time .
her mother  though <name> 's manner , at the time of giving her answer , led her to feel somewhat suspicious  did not express her suspicions , but gave her the additional apple .
nor did she afterwards , when she ascertained the facts , say any thing on the subject .
the day passed away as if nothing unusual had occurred .
when <unk> came she undressed the child and laid her in her bed , playing with her , and talking with her in an amusing manner all the time , so as to bring her into a contented and happy frame of mind , and to establish as close a connection as possible of affection and sympathy between them .
then , finally , when the child 's prayer had been said , and she was about to be left for the night , her mother , sitting in a chair at the head of her little bed , and putting her hand lovingly upon her , said : the story .
" but first i must tell you one more little story .
" once there was a boy , and his name was <name> .
he was a pretty large boy , for he was five years old . "
<name> , it must be recollected , was only four .
" he was a very pretty boy .
he had bright blue eyes and curling hair .
he was a very good boy , too .
he did not like to do any thing wrong .
he always found that it made him feel uncomfortable and unhappy afterwards when he did any thing wrong .
a good many children , especially good children , find that it makes them feel uncomfortable and unhappy when they do wrong .
perhaps you do . "
" yes , mamma , i do , " said <name> .
" i am glad of that , " replied her mother ; " that is a good sign . "
" <name> went one day , " added the mother , continuing her story , " with his little cousin <name> to their uncle 's , in hopes that he would give them some apples .
their uncle had a beautiful garden , and in it there was an <unk> which bore most excellent apples .
they were large , and <name> , and mellow , and sweet .
the children liked the apples from that tree very much , and <name> and <name> went that day in hopes that their uncle would give them some of them .
he said he would .
he would give them three apiece .
he told them to go into the garden and wait there until he came .
they must not take any apples off the tree , he said , but if they found any under the tree they might take them , provided that there were not more than three apiece ; and when he came he would take enough off the tree , he said , to make up the number to three .
" so the children went into the garden and looked under the tree .
they found two apples there , and they took them up and ate them  one apiece .
then they sat down and began to wait for their uncle to come .
while they were waiting <name> proposed that they should not tell their uncle that they had found the two apples , and so he would give them three more , which he would take from the tree ; whereas , if he knew that they had already had one apiece , then he would only give them two more .
<name> said that his uncle would ask them about it .
<name> said , 'no matter , we can tell him that we did not find any . '
" <name> seemed to be thinking about it for a moment , and then , shaking his head , said , 'no , i think we had better not tell him a lie ! '
" so when he saw their uncle coming he said , 'come , <name> , let us go and tell him about it , just how it was .
so they ran together to meet their uncle , and told him that they had found two apples under the tree , one apiece , and had eaten them .
then he gave them two more apiece , according to his promise , and they went home feeling contented and happy .
" they might have had one more apple apiece , probably , by combining together to tell a falsehood ; but in that case they would have gone home feeling guilty and unhappy . "
the effect .
<name> 's mother paused a moment , after finishing her story , to give <name> time to think about it a little .
" i think , " she added at length , after a suitable pause , " that it was a great deal better for them to tell the truth , as they did . "
" i think so too , mamma , " said <name> , at the same time casting down her eyes and looking a little confused .
" but you know , " added her mother , speaking in a very kind and gentle tone , " that you did not tell me the truth to-day about the apple that <name> gave you . "
<name> paused a moment , looked in her mother 's face , and then , reaching up to put her arms around her mother 's neck , she said , " mamma , i am determined never to tell you another wrong story as long as i live . "
only a single lesson , after all .
now it is not at all probable that if the case had ended here , <name> would have kept her promise .
this was one good lesson , it is true , but it was only one .
and the lesson was given by a method so gentle , that no nervous , cerebral , or mental function was in any degree irritated or <unk> excited by it .
moreover , no one who knows any thing of the workings of the infantile mind can doubt that the impulse in the right direction given by this conversation was not only better in character , but was greater in amount , than could have been effected by either of the other methods of management previously described .
how gentle measures operate .
by the gentle measures , then , which are to be here discussed and recommended , are meant such as do not <unk> in a violent and irritating manner , in any way , upon the extremely delicate , and almost embryonic condition of the cerebral and nervous organization , in which the gradual development of the mental and moral faculties are so intimately involved .
they do not imply any , the least , relaxation of the force of parental authority , or any lowering whatever of the standards of moral obligation , but are , on the contrary , the most effectual , the surest and the safest way of establishing the one and of enforcing the other .
chapter iii .
there must be authority .
the first duty which <unk> upon the mother in the training of her child is the establishment of her authority over him  that is , the forming in him the habit of immediate , implicit , and <unk> obedience to all her commands .
and the first step to be taken , or , rather , perhaps the first essential condition required for the performance of this duty , is the fixing of the conviction in her own mind that it is a duty .
unfortunately , however , there are not only vast <name> of mothers who do not in any degree perform this duty , but a large proportion of them have not even a theoretical idea of the obligation of it .
an objection .
" i wish my child to be governed by reason and reflection , " says one .
" i wish him to see the necessity and propriety of what i require of him , so that he may render a ready and willing compliance with my wishes , instead of being obliged blindly to submit to arbitrary and despotic power . "
she forgets that the faculties of reason and reflection , and the power of appreciating " the necessity and propriety of things , " and of bringing considerations of future , remote , and perhaps contingent good and evil to restrain and subdue the <unk> of appetites and passions eager for present pleasure , are qualities that appear late , and are very slowly developed , in the infantile mind ; that no real reliance whatever can be placed upon them in the early years of life ; and that , moreover , one of the chief and expressly intended objects of the establishment of the parental relation is to provide , in the mature reason and reflection of the father and mother , the means of guidance which the embryo reason and reflection of the child could not afford during the period of his immaturity .
the two great elements of parental obligation .
indeed , the chief end and aim of the parental relation , as designed by the author of nature , may be considered as comprised , it would seem , in these two objects , namely : first , the support of the child by the strength of his parents during the period necessary for the development of his strength , and , secondly , his guidance and direction by their reason during the development of his reason .
the second of these obligations is no less imperious than the first .
to expect him to provide the means of his support from the resources of his own embryo strength , would imply no greater <unk> on the part of his father and mother than to look for the exercise of any really controlling influence over his conduct by his embryo reason .
the expectation in the two cases would be equally vain .
the only difference would be that , in the failure which would inevitably result from the trial , it would be in the one case the body that would suffer , and in the other the soul .
the judgment more slowly developed than the strength .
indeed , the necessity that the conduct of the child should be controlled by the reason of the parents is in one point of view greater , or at least more protracted , than that his wants should be supplied by their power ; for the development of the thinking and reasoning powers is late and slow in comparison with the advancement toward maturity of the physical powers .
it is considered that a boy attains , in this country , to a sufficient degree of strength at the age of from seven to ten years to earn his living ; but his reason is not sufficiently mature to make it safe to intrust him with the care of himself and of his affairs , in the judgment of the law , till he is of more than twice that age .
the parents can actually thus sooner look to the strength of the child for his support than they can to his reason for his guidance .
what parents have to do in respect to the reasoning powers of children .
to aid in the development and cultivation of the thinking and reasoning powers is doubtless a very important part of a parent 's duty .
but to cultivate these faculties is one thing , while to make any control which may be procured for them over the mind of the child the basis of government , is another .
to explain the reasons of our commands is excellent , if it is done in the right time and manner .
the wrong time is when the question of obedience is pending , and the wrong manner is when they are offered as inducements to obey .
we may offer reasons for recommendations , when we leave the child to judge of their force , and to act according to our recommendations or not , as his judgment shall dictate .
but reasons should never be given as inducements to obey a command .
the more completely the obedience to a command rests on the principle of simple submission to authority , the easier and better it <name> be both for parent and child .
manner of exercising authority .
let no reader fall into the error of supposing that the mother 's making her authority the basis of her government renders it necessary for her to assume a stern and severe aspect towards her children , in her intercourse with them ; or to issue her commands in a harsh , abrupt , and imperious manner ; or always to refrain from explaining , at the time , the reasons for a command or a prohibition .
the more gentle the manner , and the more kind and courteous the tones in which the mother 's wishes are expressed , the better , provided only that the wishes , however expressed , are really the <unk> of an authority which is to be yielded to at once without question or delay .
she may say , " <name> , <name> you please to leave your doll and take this letter for me into the library to your father ? "
or , " <name> , in five minutes it <name> be time for you to put your blocks away to go to bed ; i <name> tell you when the time is out ; " or , " <name> , look at the clock "  to call his attention to the fact that the time is arrived for him to go to school .
no matter , in a word , under how mild and gentle a form the mother's commands are given , provided only that the children are trained to understand that they are at once to be obeyed .
a second objection .
another large class of mothers are deterred from making any efficient effort to establish their authority over their children for fear of thereby <unk> their affections .
" i wish my child to love me , " says a mother of this class .
" that is the supreme and <unk> wish of my heart ; and if i am continually <unk> and <unk> her by my authority , she <name> soon learn to consider me an obstacle to her happiness , and i shall become an object of her aversion and dislike . "
there is some truth , no doubt , in this statement thus expressed , but it is not applicable to the case , for the reason that there is no need whatever for a mother 's " continually <unk> and <unk> " her children in her efforts to establish her authority over them .
the love which they <name> feel for her <name> depend in a great measure upon the degree in which she <unk> and takes part with them in their occupations , their enjoyments , their disappointments , and their sorrows , and in which she <unk> their <unk> desires .
the love , however , awakened by these means <name> be not weakened nor <unk> , but immensely strengthened and confirmed , by the exercise on her part of a just and equable , but firm and absolute , authority .
this must always be true so long as a feeling of respect for the object of affection tends to strengthen , and not to weaken , the sentiment of love .
the mother who does not govern her children is bringing them up not to love her , but to despise her .
effect of <unk> if , besides being their playmate , their companion , and friend , indulgent in respect to all their harmless fancies , and patient and forbearing with their childish faults and foolishness , she also exercises in cases requiring it an authority over them which , though just and gentle , is yet absolute and supreme , she rises to a very exalted position in their view .
their affection for her has infused into it an element which greatly <unk> and <unk> it  an element somewhat analogous to that sentiment of lofty devotion which a loyal subject feels for his <name> .
effect of the want of <unk> on the other hand , if she is inconsiderate enough to attempt to win a place in her children 's hearts by the sacrifice of her maternal authority , she <name> never succeed in securing a place there that is worth possessing .
the children <name> all , girls and boys alike , see and understand her weakness , and they <name> soon learn to look down upon her , instead of looking up to her , as they ought .
as they grow older they <name> all become more and more unmanageable .
the insubordination of the girls must generally be endured , but that of the boys <name> in time grow to be intolerable , and it <name> become necessary to send them away to school , or to adopt some other plan for <unk> the house of their <unk> , and relieving the poor mother 's heart of the insupportable burden she has to bear in finding herself <unk> and trampled upon by her own children .
in the earlier years of life the feeling entertained for their mother in such a case by the children is simply that of contempt ; for the sentiment of gratitude which <name> modify it in time is very late to be developed , and has not yet begun to act .
in later years , however , when the boys have become young men , this sentiment of gratitude begins to come in , but it only changes the contempt into pity .
and when years have passed away , and the mother is perhaps in her grave , her sons think of her with a mingled feeling excited by the conjoined remembrance of her helpless imbecility and of her true maternal love , and say to each other , with a smile , " poor dear mother !
what a time she had of it trying to govern us boys ! "
if a mother is willing to have her children thus regard her with contempt pure and simple while they are children , and with contempt transformed into pity by the infusion of a tardy sentiment of gratitude , when they are grown , she may try the plan of endeavoring to secure their love by indulging them without governing them .
but if she sets her heart on being the object through life of their respectful love , she may indulge them as much as she pleases ; but she must govern them .
indulgence .
a great deal is said sometimes about the evils of indulgence in the management of children ; and so far as the condemnation refers only to indulgence in what is injurious or evil , it is doubtless very just .
but the harm is not in the indulgence itself  that is , in the act of affording gratification to the child  but in the injurious or dangerous nature of the things indulged in .
it seems to me that children are not generally indulged enough .
they are thwarted and restrained in respect to the gratification of their harmless wishes a great deal too much .
indeed , as a general rule , the more that children are gratified in respect to their childish fancies and impulses , and even their caprices , when no evil or danger is to be apprehended , the better .
when , therefore , a child asks , " may i do this ? "
or , " may i do that ? "
the question for the mother to consider is not whether the thing proposed is a wise or a foolish thing to do  that is , whether it would be wise or foolish for her , if she , with her ideas and feelings , were in the place of the child  but only whether there is any harm or danger in it ; and if not , she should give her ready and cordial consent .
antagonism between free indulgence and absolute control .
there is no necessary antagonism , nor even any inconsistency , between the freest indulgence of children and the maintenance of the most absolute authority over them .
indeed , the authority can be most easily established in connection with great liberality of indulgence .
at any rate , it <name> be very evident , on reflection , that the two principles do not stand at all in opposition to each other , as is often vaguely supposed .
children may be greatly indulged , and yet perfectly governed .
on the other hand , they may be continually checked and thwarted , and their lives made miserable by a continued succession of vexations , restrictions , and <unk> , and yet not be governed at all .
an example <name> , however , best illustrate this .
mode of management with <name> .
a mother , going to the village by a path across the fields , proposed to her little daughter <name> to go with her for a walk .
<name> asked if she might invite her cousin <name> to go too .
" yes , " said her mother ; " i think she is not at home ; but you can go and see , if you like . "
<name> went to see , and returned in a few minutes , saying that <name> was not at home .
" never mind , " replied her mother ; " it was polite in you to wish to invite her . "
they set out upon the walk .
<name> runs hither and thither over the grass , returning continually to her mother to bring her flowers and curiosities .
her mother looks at them all , seems to approve of , and to sympathize in , <name> 's wonder and delight , and even points out new charms in the objects which she brings to her , that <name> had not observed .
at length <name> spied a butterfly .
" mother , " said she , " here 's a butterfly .
may i run and catch him ? "
" you may try , " said her mother .
<name> ran till she was tired , and then came back to her mother , looking a little disappointed .
" i could not catch him , mother . "
" never mind , " said her mother , " you had a good time trying , at any rate .
perhaps you <name> see another by-and-by .
you may possibly see a bird , and you can try and see if you can catch him . "
so <name> ran off to play again , satisfied and happy .
a little farther on a pretty tree was growing , not far from the path on one side .
a short , half-decayed log lay at the foot of the tree , <unk> and nearly concealed by a growth of <unk> , grass , and wild flowers .
" <name> , " said the mother , " do you see that tree with the pretty flowers at the foot of it ? "
" yes , mother . "
" i would rather not have you go near that tree .
come over to this side of the path , and keep on this side till you get by . "
<name> began immediately to obey , but as she was crossing the path she looked up to her mother and asked why she must not go near the tree .
" i am glad you would like to know why , " replied her mother , " and i <name> tell you the reason as soon as we get past . "
<name> kept on the other side of the path until the tree was left well behind , and then came back to her mother to ask for the promised reason .
" it was because i heard that there was a wasp 's nest under that tree , " said her mother .
" a wasp 's nest ! "
repeated <name> , with a look of alarm .
" yes , " rejoined her mother , " and i was afraid that the wasps might sting you . "
<name> paused a moment , and then , looking back towards the tree , said , " i am glad i did not go near it . "
" and i am glad that you obeyed me so readily , " said her mother .
" i knew you would obey me at once , without my giving any reason .
i did not wish to tell you the reason , for fear of frightening you while you were passing by the tree .
but i knew that you would obey me without any reason .
you always do , and that is why i always like to have you go with me when i take a walk . "
[ illustration : indulgence . ]
<name> is much gratified by this commendation , and the effect of it , and of the whole incident , in confirming and strengthening the principle of obedience in her heart , is very much greater than rebukes or punishments for any <unk> act of disobedience could possibly be .
" but , mother , " asked <name> , " how did you know that there was a wasp 's nest under that tree ? "
" one of the boys told me so , " replied her mother .
" and do you really think there is one there ? "
asked <name> .
" no , " replied her mother , " i do not really think there is .
boys are very apt to imagine such things . "
" then why would you not let me go there ? "
asked <name> .
" because there might be one there , and so i thought it safer for you not to go near . "
<name> now left her mother 's side and resumed her excursions , running this way and that , in every direction , over the fields , until at length , her strength beginning to fail , she came back to her mother , out of breath , and with a languid air , saying that she was too tired to go any farther .
" i am tired , too , " said her mother ; " we had better find a place to sit down to rest . "
" where shall we find one ? "
asked <name> .
" i see a large stone out there before us a little way , " said her mother .
" how <name> that do ? "
" i mean to go and try it , " said <name> ; and , having seemingly recovered her breath , she ran forward to try the stone .
by the time that her mother reached the spot she was ready to go on .
these and similar incidents marked the whole progress of the walk .
we see that in such a case as this firm government and free indulgence are conjoined ; and that , far from there being any antagonism between them , they may work together in perfect <name> .
mode of management with <name> .
on the other hand , there may be an extreme limitation in respect to a mother 's indulgence of her children , while yet she has no government over them at all .
we shall see how this might be by the case of little <name> .
<name> was asked by her mother to go with her across the fields to the village under circumstances similar to those of <name> 's invitation , except that the real motive of <name> 's mother , in proposing that <name> should accompany her , was to have the child 's help in bringing home her parcels .
" yes , mother , " said <name> , in reply to her mother 's invitation , " i should like to go ; and i <name> go and ask cousin <name> to go too . "
" oh no , " rejoined her mother , " why do you wish <name> to go ?
she <name> only be a trouble to us . "
" she wo n't be any trouble at all , mother , and i mean to go and ask her , " said <name> ; and , putting on her bonnet , she set off towards the gate .
" no , <name> , " insisted her mother , " you must not go .
i do n't wish to have <name> go with us to-day . "
<name> paid no attention to this prohibition , but ran off to find <name> .
after a few minutes she returned , saying that <name> was not at home .
" i am glad of it , " said her mother ; " i told you not to go to ask her , and you did very wrong to disobey me .
i have a great mind not to let you go yourself . "
<name> ran off in the direction of the path , not caring for the censure or for the threat , knowing well that they would result in nothing .
her mother followed .
when they reached the pastures <name> began running here and there over the grass .
" <name> ! "
said her mother , speaking in a stern and reproachful tone ; " what do you keep running about so for all the time , <name> ?
you 'll get tired out before we get to the village , and then you 'll be teasing me to let you stop and rest .
come and walk along quietly with me . "
but <name> paid no attention whatever to this injunction .
she ran to and fro among the rocks and clumps of bushes , and once or twice she brought to her mother flowers or other curious things that she found .
" those things are not good for any thing , child , " said her mother .
" they are nothing but common weeds and trash .
besides , i told you not to run about so much .
why ca n't you come and walk quietly along the path , like a sensible person ? "
<name> paid no attention to this <unk> of her mother 's command , but continued to run about as before .
" <name> , " repeated her mother , " come back into the path .
i have told you again and again that you must come and walk with me , and you do n't pay the least heed to what i say .
by-and-by you <name> fall into some hole , or tear your clothes against the bushes , or get pricked with the briers .
you must not , at any rate , go a step farther from the path than you are now . "
<name> walked on , looking for flowers and curiosities , and receding farther and farther from the path , for a time , and then returning towards it again , according to her own fancy or <name> , without paying any regard to her mother 's directions .
" <name> , " said her mother , " you must not go so far away from the path .
then , besides , you are coming to a tree where there is a wasps ' nest .
you must not go near that tree ; if you do , you <name> get stung . "
<name> went on , looking for flowers , and gradually drawing nearer to the tree .
" <name> ! "
exclaimed her mother , " i tell you that you must not go near that tree .
you <name> certainly get stung . "
<name> went on  somewhat hesitatingly and cautiously , it is true  towards the foot of the tree , and , seeing no signs of wasps there , she began gathering the flowers that grew at the foot of it .
" <name> !
<name> ! "
exclaimed her mother ; " i told you not to go near that tree !
get your flowers quick , if you must get them , and come away . "
<name> went on gathering the flowers at her leisure .
" you <name> certainly get stung , " said her mother .
" i do n't believe there is any hornets ' nest here , " replied <name> .
" wasps ' nest , " said her mother ; " it was a wasps ' nest . "
" or wasps ' nest either , " said <name> .
" yes , " rejoined her mother , " the boys said there was . "
" that 's nothing , " said <name> ; " the boys think there are wasps ' nests in a great many places where there are not any . "
after a time <name> , having gathered all the flowers she wished for , came back at her leisure towards her mother .
" i told you not to go to that tree , " said her mother , reproachfully .
" you told me i should certainly get stung if i went there , " rejoined <name> , " and i did n't . "
" well , you might have got stung , " said her mother , and so walked on .
pretty soon after this <name> said that she was tired of walking so far , and wished to stop and rest .
" no , " replied her mother , " i told you that you would get tired if you ran about so much ; but you would do it , and so now i shall not stop for you at all . "
<name> said that she should stop , at any rate ; so she sat down upon a log by the <unk> .
her mother said that she should go on and leave her .
so her mother walked on , looking back now and then , and calling <name> to come .
but finding that <name> did not come , she finally found a place to sit down herself and wait for her .
the principle illustrated by this case .
many a mother <name> see the image of her own management of her children reflected without exaggeration or <unk> in this glass ; and , as the former story shows how the freest indulgence is compatible with the maintenance of the most absolute authority , this enables us to see how a perpetual resistance to the impulses and desires of children may co-exist with no government over them at all .
let no mother fear , then , that the measures necessary to establish for her the most absolute authority over her children <name> at all curtail her power to promote their happiness .
the maintenance of the best possible government over them <name> not in any way prevent her yielding to them all the harmless <unk> they may <name> .
she may indulge them in all their childish impulses , fancies , and even caprices , to their heart 's content , without at all weakening her authority over them .
indeed , she may make these very indulgences the means of strengthening her authority .
but without the authority she can never develop in the hearts of her children the only kind of love that is worth possessing  namely , that in which the feeling of affection is dignified and ennobled by the sentiment of respect .
one more consideration .
there is one consideration which , if properly appreciated , would have an overpowering influence on the mind of every mother in inducing her to establish and maintain a firm authority over her child during the early years of his life , and that is the possibility that he may not live to reach maturity .
should the terrible calamity befall her of being compelled to follow her boy , yet young , to his grave , the character of her grief , and the degree of distress and anguish which it <name> occasion her , <name> depend very much upon the memories which his life and his relations to her have left in her soul .
when she returns to her home , bowed down by the terrible burden of her bereavement , and wanders over the now desolated rooms which were the scenes of his infantile occupations and joys , and sees the now useless playthings and books , and the various objects of curiosity and interest with which he was so often and so busily engaged , there can , of course , be nothing which can really <unk> her overwhelming grief ; but it <name> make a vital difference in the character of this grief , whether the image of her boy , as it takes its fixed and final position in her memory and in her heart , is associated with recollections of <unk> , respectful regard for his mother 's wishes , and of ready and <unk> submission to her authority and obedience to her commands ; or whether , on the other hand , the picture of his past life , which is to remain forever in her heart , is to be distorted and marred by memories of <unk> , acts of ungovernable impulse and insubordination , habitual disregard of all authority , and disrespectful , if not contemptuous , treatment of his mother .
there is a sweetness as well as a bitterness of grief ; and something like a feeling of <name> and gladness <name> spring up in the mother 's heart , and mingle with and soothe her sorrow , if she can think of her boy , when he is gone , as always docile , <unk> , submissive to her authority , and obedient to her commands .
such recollections , it is true , can not avail to remove her grief  perhaps not even to diminish its intensity ; but they <name> greatly <unk> the bitterness of it , and wholly take away its sting .
chapter iv .
gentle punishment of disobedience .
children have no natural instinct of obedience to their parents , though they have other instincts by means of which the habit of obedience , as an acquisition , can easily be formed .
the true state of the case is well illustrated by what we observe among the lower animals .
the hen can call her chickens when she has food for them , or when any danger threatens , and they come to her .
they come , however , simply under the impulse of a <name> for food or fear of danger , not from any instinctive <name> to conform their action to their mother 's <name> ; or , in other words , with no idea of submission to parental authority .
it is so , substantially , with many other animals whose habits in respect to the relation between parents and offspring come under human observation .
the colt and the calf follow and keep near the mother , not from any instinct of <name> to conform their conduct to her <name> , but solely from love of food , or fear of danger .
these last are strictly instinctive .
they act spontaneously , and require no training of any sort to establish or to maintain them .
the case is substantially the same with children .
they run to their mother by instinct , when want , fear , or pain impels them .
they require no teaching or training for this .
but for them to come simply because their mother wishes them to come  to be controlled , in other words , by her <name> , instead of by their own impulses , is a different thing altogether .
they have no instinct for that .
they have only a capacity for its development .
instincts and capacities .
it may , perhaps , be maintained that there is no real difference between instincts and capacities , and it certainly is possible that they may pass into each other by insensible gradations .
still , practically , and in reference to our treatment of any intelligent nature which is in course of gradual development under our influence , the difference is wide .
the dog has an instinct impelling him to attach himself to and follow his master ; but he has no instinct leading him to draw his master 's cart .
he requires no teaching for the one .
it comes , of course , from the <unk> impulses of his nature .
for the other he requires a skillful and careful training .
if we find a dog who <unk> no disposition to seek the society of man , but <unk> off into woods and solitudes alone , he is useless , and we attribute the fault to his own <unk> nature .
but if he <name> not fetch and <name> at command , or bring home a basket in his mouth from market , the fault , if there be any fault , is in his master , in not having taken the proper time and pains to train him , or in not knowing how to do it .
he has an instinct leading him to attach himself to a human master , and to follow his master wherever he goes .
but he has no instinct leading him to fetch and <name> , or to draw carts for any body .
if he shows no affection for man , it is his own fault  that is , the fault of his nature .
but if he does not fetch and <name> well , or go out of the room when he is ordered out , or draw steadily in a cart , it is his teacher 's fault .
he has not been properly trained .
who is responsible ?  so with the child .
if he does not seem to know how to take his food , or shows no disposition to run to his mother when he is hurt or when he is frightened , we have reason to suspect something wrong , or , at least , something abnormal , in his mental or physical constitution .
but if he does not obey his mother 's commands  no matter how <unk> or unmanageable he may be  the fault does not , certainly , indicate any thing at all wrong in him .
the fault is in his training .
in witnessing his disobedience , our reflection should be , not " what a bad boy ! "
but " what an unfaithful or incompetent mother ! "
i have dwelt the longer on this point because it is fundamental as long as a mother imagines , as so many mothers seem to do , that obedience on the part of the child is , or ought to be , a matter of course , she <name> never properly undertake the work of training him .
but when she thoroughly understands and feels that her children are not to be expected to submit their <name> to hers , except so far as she forms in them the habit of doing this by special training , the battle is half won .
actual instincts of children .
the natural instinct which impels her children to come at once to her for refuge and protection in all their troubles and fears , is a great source of happiness to every mother .
this instinct shows itself in a thousand ways .
" a mother , one morning "  i quote the anecdote from a newspaper [ b ] which came to hand while i was writing this chapter  " gave her two little ones books and toys to amuse them , while she went to attend to some work in an upper room .
half an hour passed quietly , and then a timid voice at the foot of the stairs called out : " <unk> , are you there ? '
" 'yes , darling . '
" 'all right , then ! '
and the child went back to its play .
" by-and-by the little voice was heard again , repeating , " <unk> , are you there ? '
" 'yes . '
" 'all right , then ; ' and the little ones returned again , satisfied and reassured , to their toys . "
the sense of their mother 's presence , or at least the certainty of her being near at hand , was necessary to their security and contentment in their plays .
but this feeling was not the result of any teachings that they had received from their mother , or upon her having inculcated upon their minds in any way the necessity of their keeping always within reach of maternal protection ; nor had it been acquired by their own observation or experience of dangers or difficulties which had befallen them when too far away .
it was a native instinct of the soul  the same that leads the lamb and the calf to keep close to their mother 's side , and causes the <unk> babe to cling to its mother 's bosom , and to shrink from being put away into the crib or cradle alone .
the responsibility rests upon the mother .
the mother is thus to understand that the principle of obedience is not to be expected to come by nature into the heart of her child , but to be implanted by education .
she must understand this so fully as to feel that if she finds that her children are disobedient to her commands  leaving out of view cases of peculiar and extraordinary temptation  it is her fault , not theirs .
perhaps i ought not to say her fault exactly , for she may have done as well as she knows how ; but , at any rate , her failure .
instead , therefore , of being angry with them , or fretting and complaining about the trouble they give her , she should leave them , as it were , out of the case , and turn her thoughts to herself , and to her own management , with a view to the discovery and the correcting of her own <unk> and errors .
in a word , she must set regularly and systematically about the work of teaching her children to subject their <name> to hers .
three methods .
i shall give three principles of management , or rather three different classes of measures , by means of which children may certainly be made obedient .
the most perfect success <name> be attained by employing them all .
but they require very different degrees of skill and tact on the part of the mother .
the first requires very little skill .
it demands only steadiness , calmness , and perseverance .
the second draws much more upon the mother 's mental resources , and the last , most of all .
indeed , as <name> presently be seen , there is no limit to the amount of tact and ingenuity , not to say genius , which may be advantageously exercised in the last method .
the first is the most essential ; and it <name> alone , if faithfully carried out , accomplish the end .
the second , if the mother has the tact and skill to <name> it into effect , <name> aid very much in accomplishing the result , and in a manner altogether more agreeable to both parties .
the third <name> make the work of forming the habit of obedience on the part of the mother , and of acquiring it on the part of the child , a source of the highest enjoyment to both .
but then , unfortunately , it requires more skill and dexterity , more gentleness of touch , so to speak , and a more delicate constitution of soul , than most mothers can be expected to possess .
but let us see what the three methods are .
first method .
1 .
the first principle is that the mother should so regulate her management of her child , that he should never gain any desired end by any act of <unk> , but always incur some small trouble , inconvenience , or privation , by disobeying or neglecting to obey his mother 's command .
the important words in this statement of the principle are never and always .
it is the absolute certainty that disobedience <name> hurt him , and not help him , in which the whole efficacy of the rule consists .
it is very surprising how small a punishment <name> prove <unk> if it is only certain to follow the transgression .
you may set apart a certain place for a prison  a corner of the sofa , a certain ottoman , a chair , a stool , any thing <name> answer ; and the more entirely every thing like an air of displeasure or severity is excluded , in the manner of making the preliminary arrangements , the better .
a mother without any tact , or any proper understanding of the way in which the hearts and minds of young children are influenced , <name> begin , very likely , with a scolding .
" children , you are getting very disobedient .
i have to speak three or four times before you move to do what i say .
now , i am going to have a prison .
the prison is to be that dark closet , and i am going to shut you up in it for half an hour every time you disobey .
now , remember !
the very next time ! "
empty threatening .
mothers who govern by threatening seldom do any thing but threaten .
accordingly , the first time the children disobey her , after such an announcement , she says nothing , if the case happens to be one in which the disobedience occasions her no particular trouble .
the next time , when the transgression is a little more serious , she thinks , very rightly perhaps , that to be shut up half an hour in a dark closet would be a <unk> punishment .
then , when at length some very <unk> and grave act of insubordination occurs , she happens to be in particularly <unk> , for some reason , and has not the heart to shut " the poor thing " in the closet ; or , perhaps , there is company present , and she does not wish to make a scene .
so the penalty announced with so much emphasis turns out to be a dead letter , as the children knew it would from the beginning .
how discipline may be both gentle and efficient .
with a little dexterity and tact on the mother 's part , the case may be managed very differently , and with a very different result .
let us suppose that some day , while she is engaged with her sewing or her other household duties , and her children are playing around her , she tells them that in some great schools in europe , when the boys are disobedient , or violate the rules , they are shut up for punishment in a kind of prison ; and perhaps she entertains them with invented examples of boys that would not go to prison , and had to be taken there by force , and kept there longer on account of their <unk> ; and also of other <name> boys , tall and handsome , and the best players on the grounds , who went readily when they had done wrong and were ordered into confinement , and bore their punishment like men , and who were accordingly set free all the sooner on that account .
then she proposes to them the idea of adopting that plan herself , and asks them to look all about the room and find a good seat which they can have for their prison  one end of the sofa , perhaps , a stool in a corner , or a box used as a house for a kitten .
i once knew an instance where a step before a door leading to a staircase served as penitentiary , and sitting upon it for a minute or less was the severest punishment required to maintain most perfect discipline in a family of young children for a long time .
when any one of the children violated any rule or direction which had been enjoined upon them  as , for example , when they left the door open in coming in or going out , in the <name> ; or interrupted their mother when she was reading , instead of standing quietly by her side and waiting until she looked up from her book and gave them leave to speak to her ; or used any violence towards each other , by pushing , or pulling , or struggling for a plaything or a place ; or did not come promptly to her when called ; or did not obey at once the first command in any case , the mother would say simply , " <name> ! "
or " <name> !
prison ! "
she would pronounce this sentence without any appearance of displeasure , and often with a smile , as if they were only playing prison , and then , in a very few minutes after they had taken the <unk> seat , she would say free !
which word set them at <name> again .
must begin at the beginning .
i have no doubt that some mothers , in reading this , <name> say that such management as this is mere trifling and play ; and that real and actual children , with all their natural <unk> , insubordination , and obstinacy , can never be really governed by any such means .
i answer that whether it proves on trial to be merely trifling and play or not depends upon the firmness , steadiness , and decision with which the mother carries it into execution .
every method of management requires firmness , perseverance , and decision on the part of the mother to make it successful , but , with these qualities duly exercised , it is astonishing what slight and gentle penalties <name> suffice for the most complete establishment of her authority .
i knew a mother whose children were trained to habits of almost perfect obedience , and whose only method of punishment , so far as i know , was to require the offender to stand on one foot and count five , ten , or twenty , according to the nature and <unk> of the offense .
such a mother , of course , begins early with her children .
she trains them from their earliest years to this constant subjection of their <name> to hers .
such penalties , moreover , owe their efficiency not to the degree of pain or inconvenience that they impose upon the offender , but mainly upon their calling his attention , distinctly , after every offense , to the fact that he has done wrong .
slight as this is , it <name> prove to be sufficient if it always comes  if no case of disobedience or of <unk> wrong-doing of any kind is allowed to pass unnoticed , or is not followed by the infliction of the proper penalty .
it is in all cases the certainty , and not the severity , of punishment which constitutes its power .
suppose one is not at the beginning .
what has been said thus far relates obviously to cases where the mother is at the commencement of her work of training .
this is the way to begin ; but you can not begin unless you are at the beginning .
if your children are partly grown , and you find that they are not under your command , the difficulty is much greater .
the principles which should govern the management are the same , but they can not be applied by means so gentle .
the prison , it may be , must now be somewhat more real , the terms of imprisonment somewhat longer , and there may be cases of insubordination so decided as to require the offender to be carried to it by force , on account of his refusal to go of his own accord , and perhaps to be held there , or even to be tied .
cases requiring treatment so decisive as this must be very rare with children under ten years of age ; and when they occur , the mother has reason to feel great <unk>  or at least great <unk>  at finding that she has failed so entirely in the first great moral duty of the mother , which is to train her children to complete submission to her authority from the beginning .
children coming under new control .
sometimes , however , it happens that children are transferred from one charge to another , so that the one upon whom the duty of government <unk> , perhaps only for a time , finds that the child or children put under his or her charge have been trained by previous <unk> to habits of utter insubordination .
i say , trained to such habits , for the practice of allowing children to gain their ends by any particular means is really training them to the use of those means .
thus multitudes of children are taught to disobey , and trained to habits of <unk> and insubordination , by the means most effectually adapted to that end .
difficulties .
when under these circumstances the children come under a new charge , whether permanently or temporarily , the task of <unk> in or their characters is more delicate and difficult than where one can begin at the beginning ; but the principles are the same , and the success is equally certain .
the difficulty is somewhat increased by the fact that the person thus provisionally in charge has often no natural authority over the child , and the circumstances may moreover be such as to make it necessary to abstain carefully from any measures that would lead to difficulty or collision , to cries , complaints to the mother , or any of those other forms of commotion or annoyance , which <unk> children know so well how to employ in gaining their ends .
the mother may be one of those weak-minded women who can never see any thing unreasonable in the crying complaints made by their children against other people .
or she may be sick , and it may be very important to avoid every thing that could agitate or disturb her .
<name> and egbert .
this last was the case of <name> , a young man of seventeen , who came to spend some time at home after an absence of two years in the city .
he found his mother sick , and his little brother , egbert , utterly <unk> and unmanageable .
" the first thing i have to do , " said <name> to himself , when he observed how things were , " is to get command of egbert ; " and as the first lesson which he gave his little brother illustrates well the principle of gentle but efficient punishment , i <name> give it here .
egbert was ten years of age .
he was very fond of going a-fishing , but he was not allowed to go alone .
his mother , very weak and <unk> about some things , was extremely decided about this .
so egbert had learned to submit to this <unk> , as he would have done to all others if his mother had been equally decided in respect to all .
the first thing that egbert thought of the next morning after his brother's return was that <name> might go a-fishing with him .
" i do n't know , " replied <name> , in a hesitating and doubtful tone .
" i don't know whether it <name> do for me to go a-fishing with you .
i do n't know whether i can depend upon your always obeying me and doing as i say . "
egbert made very positive promises , and so it was decided to go .
<name> took great interest in helping egbert about his <unk> , and did all in his power in other ways to establish friendly relations with him , and at length they set out .
they walked a little distance down what was in the <name> a wood road , and then came to a place where two paths led into a wood .
either of them led to the river .
but there was a <name> to cross , and for one of these paths there was a bridge .
there was none for the other .
<name> said that they would take the former .
egbert , however , paid no regard to this direction , but saying simply " no , i 'd rather go this way , " walked off in the other path .
" i was afraid you would not obey me , " said <name> , and then turned and followed egbert into the forbidden path , without making any further objection .
egbert concluded at once that he should find <name> as easily to be managed as he had found other people .
the disobedience .
when they came in sight of the <name> , <name> saw that there was a narrow log across it , in guise of a bridge .
he called out to egbert , who had gone on before him , not to go over the log until he came .
but egbert called back in reply that there was no danger , that he could go across alone , and so went boldly over .
<name> , on arriving at the <name> , and finding that the log was firm and strong , followed egbert over it .
" i told you i could go across it , " said egbert .
" yes , " replied <name> , " and you were right in that .
you did cross it .
the log is very steady .
i think it makes quite a good bridge . "
egbert said he could hop across it on one foot , and <name> gave him leave to try , while he , <name> , held his <unk> for him .
<name> followed him over the log , and then told him that he was very sorry to say it , but that he found that they could not go a-fishing that day .
egbert wished to know the reason .
<name> said it was a private reason and he could not tell him then , but that he would tell him that evening after he had gone to bed .
there was a story about it , too , he said , that he would tell him at the same time .
egbert was curious to know what the reason could be for changing the plan , and also to hear the story .
still he was extremely disappointed in having to lose his fishing , and very much disposed to be angry with <name> for not going on .
it was , however , difficult to get very angry without knowing <name> 's reason , and <name> , though he said that the reason was a good one  that it was a serious difficulty in the way of going a-fishing that day , which had only come to his knowledge since they left home , steadily persisted in declining to explain what the difficulty was until the evening , and began slowly to walk back toward the house .
egbert becomes sullen .
egbert then declared that , at any rate , he would not go home .
if he could not go a-fishing he would stay there in the woods .
<name> readily fell in with this idea .
" here is a nice place for me to sit down on this flat rock under the trees , " said he , " and i have got a book in my pocket .
you can play about in the woods as long as you please .
perhaps you <name> see a squirrel ; if you do , tell me , and i <name> come and help you catch him . "
so saying , he took out his book and sat down under the trees and began to read .
egbert , after loitering about sullenly a few minutes , began to walk up the path , and said that he was going home .
<name> , however , soon succeeded in putting him in <unk> again by talking with him in a friendly manner , and without manifesting any signs of displeasure , and also by playing with him on the way .
he took care to keep on friendly terms with him all the afternoon , aiding him in his various undertakings , and contributing to his amusement in every way as much as he could , while he made no complaint , and expressed no dissatisfaction with him in any way whatever .
final disposition of the case .
after egbert had gone to bed , and before he went to sleep , <name> made him a visit at his bedside , and , after a little playful frolic with him , to put him in special <unk> , said he would make his explanation .
" the reason why i had to give up the fishing expedition , " he said , " was , i found that i could not depend upon your obeying me . "
egbert , after a moment 's pause , said that he did not disobey him ; and when <name> reminded him of his taking the path that he was forbidden to take , and of his crossing the log bridge against orders , he said that that path led to the river by the shortest way , and that he knew that the log was firm and steady , and that he could go over it without falling in .
" and so you thought you had good reasons for disobeying me , " rejoined <name> .
" yes , " said egbert , triumphantly .
" that is just it , " said <name> .
" you are willing to obey , except when you think you have good reasons for disobeying , and then you disobey .
that 's the way a great many boys do , and that reminds me of the story i was going to tell you .
it is about some soldiers . "
<name> then told egbert a long story about a colonel who sent a captain with a company of men on a secret expedition with specific orders , and the captain disobeyed the orders and crossed a stream with his force , when he had been directed to remain on the hither side of it , thinking himself that it would be better to cross , and in consequence of it he and all his force were captured by the enemy , who were lying in ambush near by , as the colonel knew , though the captain did not know it .
<name> concluded his story with some very forcible remarks , showing , in a manner adapted to egbert 's state of mental development , how essential it was to the character of a good soldier that he should obey implicitly all the commands of his superior , without ever presuming to disregard them on the ground of his seeing good reason for doing so .
he then went on to relate another story of an officer on whom the general could rely for implicit and <unk> obedience to all his commands , and who was sent on an important expedition with orders , the reasons for which he did not understand , but all of which he promptly obeyed , and thus brought the expedition to a successful conclusion .
he made the story interesting to egbert by <unk> many details of a character adapted to egbert 's comprehension , and at the end <name> a moral from it for his instruction .
the moral .
this moral was not , as some readers might perhaps anticipate , and as , indeed , many persons of less tact might have made it , that egbert ought himself , as a boy , to obey those in authority over him .
instead of this he closed by saying : " and i advise you , if you grow up to be a man and ever become the general of an army , never to trust any captain or colonel with the charge of an important enterprise , unless they are men that know how to obey . "
egbert answered very gravely that he was " determined that he would n't . "
soon after this <name> bade him good-night and went away .
the next day he told egbert not to be discouraged at his not having yet learned to obey .
" there are a great many boys older than you , " he said , " who have not learned this lesson ; but you <name> learn in time .
i ca n't go a-fishing with you , or undertake any other great expeditions , till i find i can trust you entirely to do exactly as i say in cases where i have a right to decide ; but you <name> learn before long , and then we can do a great many things together which we can not do now . "
the principles illustrated .
any one who has any proper understanding of the workings of the juvenile mind <name> see that <name> , by managing egbert on these principles , would in a short time acquire complete ascendency over him , while the boy would very probably remain , in relation to his mother , as disobedient and <unk> as ever .
if the penalty annexed to the transgression is made as much as possible the necessary and natural consequence of it , and is insisted upon calmly , deliberately , and with inflexible decision , but without irritation , without reproaches , almost without any indications even of displeasure , but is , on the contrary , lightened as much as possible by sympathy and kindness , and by taking the most indulgent views , and admitting the most <unk> considerations in respect to the nature of the offense , the result <name> certainly be the establishment of the authority of the parent or guardian on a firm and permanent basis .
there are a great many cases of this kind , where a child with confirmed habits of insubordination comes under the charge of a person who is not responsible for the formation of these habits .
even the mother herself sometimes finds herself in substantially this position with her own children ; as , for example , when after some years of lax and inefficient government she becomes convinced that her management has been wrong , and that it threatens to bring forth bitter fruits unless it is reformed .
in these cases , although the work is somewhat more difficult , the principles on which success depends are the same .
slight penalties , firmly , <unk> , and invariably enforced  without violence , without scolding , without any manifestation of resentment or anger , and , except in extreme cases , without even expressions of displeasure  constitute a system which , if carried out calmly , but with firmness and decision , <name> assuredly succeed .
the real difficulty .
the case would thus seem to be very simple , and success very easy .
but , alas !
this is far from being the case .
nothing is required , it is true , but firmness , steadiness , and decision ; but , unfortunately , these are the very requisites which , of all others , it seems most difficult for mothers to command .
they can not govern their children because they can not govern themselves .
still , if the mother possess these qualities in any tolerable degree , or is able to acquire them , this method of training her children to the habit of submitting implicitly to her authority , by calmly and good-naturedly , but firmly and invariably , <unk> some slight privation or penalty to every act of resistance to her <name> , is the easiest to practice , and <name> certainly be successful .
it requires no ingenuity , no skill , no contrivance , no thought  nothing but steady persistence in a simple routine .
this was the first of the three modes of action enumerated at the commencement of this discussion .
there were two others named , which , though requiring higher qualities in the mother than simple steadiness of purpose , <name> make the work far more easy and agreeable , where these qualities are possessed .
some further consideration of the subject of punishment , with special reference to the light in which it is to be regarded in respect to its nature and its true mode of action , <name> occupy the next chapter .
chapter v. the philosophy of punishment .
it is very desirable that every parent and teacher should have a distinct and clear <name> of the true nature of punishment , and of the precise manner in which it is designed to act in <unk> offenses .
this is necessary in order that the <unk> measures which he may employ may accomplish the desired good , and avoid the evils which so often follow in their train .
nature and design of punishment .
the first question which is to be considered in determining upon the principles to be adopted and the course to be pursued with children in respect to punishment , is , which of the two views in respect to the nature and design of punishment which prevail in the minds of men we <name> adopt in shaping our system .
for , 1 .
punishment may be considered in the light of a vindictive retribution for sin  a penalty demanded by the eternal principles of justice as the natural and proper sequel and complement of the past act of transgression , with or without regard to any salutary effects that may result from it in respect to future acts .
or , 2 .
it may be considered as a <unk> measure , adopted solely with reference to its influence as a means of <unk> the subject of it , or others , from transgression in time to come .
according to the first view , punishment is a penalty which justice demands as a satisfaction for the past .
according to the other it is a remedy which goodness <unk> for the benefit of the future .
<unk> have lost themselves in endless speculations on the question how far , in the government of god , punishment is to be considered as possessing one or the other of these two characters , or both combined .
there seems to be also some uncertainty in the minds of men in relation to the precise light in which the penalties of violated law are to be regarded by civil governments , and the spirit in which they are to be administered  they being apparently , as prescribed and employed by most governments , in some respects , and to some extent , <unk> and vindictive , and in other respects <unk> and <unk> .
it would seem , however , that in respect to school and family government there could be no question on this point .
the punishment of a child by a parent , or of a pupil by a teacher , ought certainly , one would think , to exclude the element of vindictive retribution altogether , and to be employed solely with reference to the salutary influences that may be expected from it in time to come .
if the injunction " vengeance is mine , i <name> repay it , saith the lord " is to be recognized at all , it certainly ought to be acknowledged here .
this principle , once fully and cordially admitted , <unk> the subject of punishment , as administered by parents and teachers , very much .
one extremely important and very striking result of it <name> appear from a moment 's reflection .
it is this , namely : it <unk> completely and effectually all manifestations of irritation or excitement in the infliction of punishment  all harsh tones of voice , all scowling or angry looks , all violent or threatening gesticulations , and every other mode , in fact , of expressing indignation or passion .
such indications as these are wholly out of place in punishment considered as the application of a remedy devised <unk> with the sole view of accomplishing a future good .
they <unk> only with punishment considered as vengeance , or a vindictive retribution for the past sin .
this idea is fundamental .
the mother who is made angry by the misconduct of her children , and <unk> them in a passion , acts under the influence of a brute instinct .
her family government is in principle the same as that of the lower animals over their young .
it is , however , at any rate , a government ; and such government is certainly better than none .
but human parents , in the training of their human offspring , ought surely to aim at something higher and nobler .
they who do so , who possess themselves fully with the idea that punishment , as they are to administer it , is wholly <unk> in its character  that is to say , is to be considered solely with reference to the future good to be attained by it , <name> have established in their minds a principle that <name> surely guide them into right ways , and bring them out successfully in the end .
they <name> soon acquire the habit of never threatening , of never punishing in anger , and of calmly considering , in the case of the faults which they observe in their children , what course of procedure <name> be most effectual in correcting them .
parents seem sometimes to have an idea that a manifestation of something like anger  or , at least , very serious displeasure on their part  is necessary in order to make a proper impression in respect to its fault on the mind of the child .
this , however , i think , is a mistake .
the impression is made by what we do , and not by the indications of irritation or displeasure which we manifest in doing it .
to illustrate this , i <name> state a case , <unk> all its essential points just as it occurred .
the case is very analogous , in many particulars , to that of egbert and <name> related in the last chapter .
<name> 's walk .
" <name> , " said <name> 's aunt , <name> , who had come to make a visit at mary's mother 's in the country , " i am going to the village this afternoon , and if you would like you may go with me . "
<name> was , of course , much pleased with this invitation .
" a part of the way , " continued her aunt , " is by a path across the fields .
while we are there you must keep in the path all the time , for it rained a little this morning , and i am afraid that the grass may not be quite dry . "
" yes , aunt <name> ; i 'll keep in the path , " said <name> .
so they set out on the walk together .
when they came to the gate which led to the path across the fields , aunt <name> said , " remember , <name> , you must keep in the path . "
<name> said nothing , but ran forward .
pretty soon she began to walk a little on the margin of the grass , and , before long , observing a place where the grass was short and where the sun shone , she ran out boldly upon it , and then , looking down at her shoes , she observed that they were not wet .
she held up one of her feet to her aunt as she came opposite to the place , saying , " see , aunt , the grass is not wet at all . "
" i see it is not , " said her aunt .
" i thought it would not be wet ; though i was not sure but that it might be .
but come , " she added , holding out her hand , " i have concluded not to go to the village , after all .
we are going back home . "
" oh , aunt <name> ! "
said <name> , following her aunt as she began <unk> her steps along the path .
" what is that for ? "
" i have altered my mind , " said her aunt .
" what makes you alter your mind ? "
by this time aunt <name> had taken hold of <name> 's hand , and they were walking together along the path towards home .
" because you do n't obey me , " she said .
" why , auntie , " said <name> , " the grass was not wet at all where i went . "
" no , " said her aunt , " it was perfectly dry . "
" and it did not do any harm at all for me to walk upon it , " said <name> .
" not a bit of harm , " said her aunt .
" then why are you going home ? "
asked <name> .
" because you do n't obey me , " replied her aunt .
" you see , " said her aunt , " there is one thing about this that you don't understand , because you are such a little girl .
you <name> understand it by-and-by , when you grow older ; and i do n't blame you for not knowing it now , because you are so young . "
" what is it that i do n't know ? "
asked <name> .
" i am afraid you would not understand it very well if i were to explain it , " replied her aunt .
" try me , " said <name> .
" well , you see , " replied her aunt , " i do n't feel safe with any child that does not obey me .
this time no harm was done , because the grass happened to be dry ; but farther on there was a <name> .
i might have told you not to go near the brink of the <name> for fear of your falling in .
then you might have gone , notwithstanding , if you thought there was no danger , just as you went out upon the grass because you thought it was not wet , notwithstanding my saying that you must keep in the path .
so you see i never feel safe in taking walks in places where there is any danger with children that i can not always depend upon to do exactly what i say . "
<name> was , of course , now ready to make profuse promises that she would obey her aunt in future on all occasions and began to beg that she would continue her walk to the village .
" no , " said her aunt , " i do n't think it would be quite safe for me to trust to your promises , though i have no doubt you honestly mean to keep them .
but you remember you promised me that you would keep in the path when we planned this walk ; and yet when the time of temptation came you could not keep the promise ; but you <name> learn .
when i am going on some perfectly safe walk i <name> take you with me again ; and if i stay here some time you <name> learn to obey me so perfectly that i can take you with me to any place , no matter how dangerous it may be . "
aunt <name> thus gently , but firmly , persisted in abandoning the walk to the village , and returning home ; but she immediately turned the conversation away from the subject of <name> 's fault , and amused her with stories and aided her in gathering flowers , just as if nothing had happened ; and when she arrived at home she said nothing to any one of <name> 's disobedience .
here now was punishment calculated to make a very strong impression  but still without scolding , without anger , almost , in fact , without even any manifestations of displeasure .
and yet how long can any reasonable person suppose it would be before <name> would learn , if her aunt acted invariably on the same principles , to submit implicitly to her <name> ?
a different management .
compare the probable result of this mode of management with the scolding and threatening policy .
suppose aunt <name> had called to <name> angrily , " <name> !
<name> !
come directly back into the path .
i told you not to go out of the path , and you are a very naughty child to disobey me .
the next time you disobey me in that way i <name> send you directly home . "
<name> would have been vexed and irritated , perhaps , and would have said to herself , " how cross aunt <name> is to-day ! "
but the " next time " she would have been as disobedient as ever .
if mothers , instead of scowling , scolding , and threatening now , and putting off doing the thing that ought to be done to the " next time , " would do that thing at once , and give up the scowling , scolding , and threatening altogether , they would find all parties immensely benefited by the change .
it is evident , moreover , that by this mode of management the punishment is employed not in the way of retribution , but as a remedy .
<name> loses her walk not on the ground that she deserved to lose it , but because it was not safe to continue it .
an objection .
some mother may perhaps say , in reference to the case of <name> and her aunt , that it may be all very well in theory , but that practically mothers have not the leisure and the means for adopting such moderate measures .
we can not stop , she may say , every time we are going to the village , on important business perhaps , and turn back and lose the afternoon on account of the <unk> of a disobedient child .
my answer is that it <name> not have to be done every time ,  but only very seldom .
the effect of acting once or twice on this principle , with the certainty on the part of the child that the mother or the aunt <name> always act so when the occasion calls for it , very soon puts an end to all necessity for such action .
indeed , if <name> , in the instance above given , had been managed in this way from infancy , she would not have thought of leaving the path when forbidden to do so .
it is only in some such case as that of an aunt who knows how to manage right , coming as a visitor into the family of a mother who manages wrong , that such an incident as this could occur .
still it must be admitted that the gentle methods of discipline , which reason and common sense indicate as the true ones for permanently influencing the minds of children and forming their characters , do , in each individual case , require more time and care than the cuffs and <unk> dictated by passion .
a box on the ear , such as a cat gives to a rebellious kitten , is certainly the quickest application that can be made .
the measures that are calculated to reach and affect the heart can not vie with blows and <unk> in respect to the promptness of their action .
still , the parent or the teacher who <name> begin to act on the principles here recommended with children while they are young <name> find that such methods are far more prompt in their action and more effectual in immediate results than they would suppose , and that they <name> be the means of establishing the only kind of authority that is really worthy of the name more rapidly than any other .
the special point , however , with a view to which these illustrations are introduced , is , as has been already remarked , that penalties of this nature , and imposed in this spirit , are not vindictive , but simply <unk> and <unk> .
they are not intended to satisfy the sense of justice for what is past , but only to secure greater safety and happiness in time to come .
the element of <unk> .
punishments may be very light and gentle in their character , provided they are certain to follow the offense .
it is in their certainty , and not in their severity , that the efficiency of them lies .
very few children are ever severely burnt by putting their fingers into the flame of a candle .
they are effectually taught not to put them in by very slight <unk> , on account of the absolute <unk> of the result produced by the contact .
mothers often do not understand this .
they attempt to cure some habitual fault by <unk> and threats , and declarations of what they <name> certainly do " next time , " and perhaps by occasional acts of real severity in cases of peculiar <unk> , instead of a quiet , gentle , and comparatively trifling infliction in every instance of the fault , which would be altogether more effectual .
a child , for example , has acquired the habit of leaving the door open .
now occasionally scolding him , when it is specially cold , and now and then shutting him up in a closet for half an hour , <name> never cure him of the fault .
but if there were an automaton figure standing by the side of the door , to say to him every time that he came through without shutting it , door !
which call should be a signal to him to go back and shut the door , and then sit down in a chair near by and count ten ; and if this slight penalty was invariably enforced , he would be most effectually cured of the fault in a very short time .
now , the mother can not be exactly this automaton , for she can not always be there ; but she can recognize the principle , and <name> it into effect as far as possible  that is , invariably , when she is there .
and though she <name> not thus cure the boy of the fault so soon as the automaton would do it , she <name> still do it very soon .
irritation and anger .
avoid , as much as possible , every thing of an irritating character in the punishments inflicted , for to irritate frequently the mind of a child tends , of course , to form within him an irritable and <unk> temper .
it is true , perhaps , that it is not possible absolutely to avoid this effect of punishment in all cases ; but a great deal may be done to diminish the evil by the exercise of a little tact and ingenuity on the part of the mother whose attention is once particularly directed to the subject .
the first and most important measure of precaution on this point is the absolute exclusion of every thing like angry looks and words as <unk> of punishment .
if you find that any wrong which your child commits awakens irritation or anger in your mind , suspend your judgment of the case and postpone all action until the irritation and anger have subsided , and you can consider calmly and deliberately what to do , with a view , not of satisfying your own resentment , but of doing good to the child .
then , when you have decided what to do , <name> your decision into effect in a good-natured manner  firmly and <unk>  but still without any violence , or even harshness , of manner .
co-operation of the offender .
there are many cases in which , by the exercise of a little tact and ingenuity , the parent can actually secure the co-operation of the child in the infliction of the punishment prescribed for the curing of a fault .
there are many advantages in this , when it can be done .
it gives the child an interest in curing himself of the fault ; it makes the punishment more effectual ; and it removes almost all possibility of its producing any irritation or resentment in his mind .
to illustrate this we <name> give a case .
it is of no consequence , for the purpose of this article , whether it is a real or an imaginary one .
little egbert , seven years old , had formed the habit so common among children of wasting a great deal of time in dressing himself , so as not to be ready for breakfast when the second <name> rang .
his mother offered him a reward if he would himself devise any plan that would cure him of the fault .
" i do n't know what to do , exactly , to cure you , " she said ; " but if you <name> think of any plan that <name> really succeed , i <name> give you an excursion in a carriage . "
" how far ? "
asked egbert .
" ten miles , " said his mother .
" i <name> take you in a carriage on an excursion anywhere you say , for ten miles , if you <name> find out some way to cure yourself of this fault . "
" i think you ought to punish me , " said egbert , speaking in rather a timid tone .
" that 's just it , " said his mother , " it is for you to think of some kind of punishment that wo n't be too disagreeable for me to inflict , and which <name> yet be successful in curing you of the fault .
i <name> allow you a fortnight to get cured .
if you are not cured in a fortnight i shall think the punishment is not enough , or that it is not of a good kind ; but if it works so well as to cure you in a fortnight , then you shall have the ride . "
egbert wished to know whether he must think of the punishment himself , or whether his sister <name> might help him .
his mother gave him leave to ask any body to help him that he pleased .
<name> , after some reflection , recommended that , whenever he was not dressed in time , he was to have only one lump of sugar , instead of four , in his tumbler of water for breakfast .
his usual drink at breakfast was a tumbler of water , with four lumps of sugar in it .
the first <name> was rung at half-past six , and breakfast was at half-past seven .
his sister recommended that , as half an hour was ample time for the work of dressing , egbert should go down every morning and report himself ready before the clock struck seven .
if he failed of this , he was to have only one lump of sugar , instead of four , in his glass of water .
there was some question about the necessity of requiring him to be ready before seven ; egbert being inclined to argue that if he was ready by <unk> , that would be enough .
but <name> said no .
" to allow you a full hour to dress , " she said , " when half an hour is enough , may answer very well in respect to having you ready for breakfast , but it is no way to cure you of the fault .
that would enable you to play half of the time while you are dressing , without <unk> the punishment ; but the way to cure you is to make it sure that you <name> have the punishment to bear if you play at all . "
so it was decided to allow only half an hour for the <unk> .
egbert 's mother said she was a little afraid about the one lump of sugar that was left to him when he failed .
" the plan may succeed , " she said ; " i am very willing that you should try it ; but i am afraid that when you are tempted to stop and play in the midst of your dressing , you <name> say , i shall have one lump of sugar , at any rate , and so <name> yield to the temptation .
so perhaps it would be safer for you to make the rule that you are not to have any sugar at all when you fail .
still , perhaps your plan <name> succeed .
you can try it and see .
i should wish myself to have the punishment as slight as possible to produce the effect . "
by such management as this , it is plain that egbert is brought into actual co-operation with his mother in the infliction of a punishment to cure him of a fault .
it is true , that making such an arrangement as this , and then leaving it to its own working , would lead to no result .
as in the case of all other plans and methods , it must be strictly , firmly , and perseveringly followed up by the watchful efficiency of the mother .
we can not substitute the action of the child for that of the parent in the work of early training , but we can often derive very great advantage by securing his <unk> .
playful punishments .
so true is it that the efficacy of any mode of punishment consists in the certainty of its infliction , that even playful punishments are in many cases sufficient to accomplish the cure of a fault .
<name> , for example , was in the habit of continually getting into disputes and mild quarrels with his sister <name> , a year or two younger than himself .
" i know it is very foolish , " he said to his mother , when she was talking with him on the subject one evening after he had gone to bed , and she had been telling him a story , and his mind was in a calm and tranquil state .
" it is very foolish , but somehow i ca n't help it .
i forget . "
" then you must have some punishment to make you remember , " said his mother .
" but sometimes she is the one to blame , " said <name> , " and then she must have the punishment . "
" no , " replied his mother .
" when a <name> and a gentleman become involved in a dispute in polite society , it is always the gentleman that must be considered to be to blame . "
" but <name> and i are not polite society , " said <name> .
" you ought to be , " said his mother .
" at any rate , when you , an older brother , get into disputes with your sister , it is because you have not sense enough to manage so as to avoid them .
if you were a little older and wiser you would have sense enough . "
" well , mother , what shall the punishment be ? "
said <name> .
" would you really like to have a punishment , so as to cure yourself of the fault ? "
asked his mother .
<name> said that he would like one .
" then , " said his mother , " i propose that every time you get into a dispute with <name> , you turn your jacket wrong side out , and wear it so a little while as a symbol of folly . "
<name> laughed heartily at this idea , and said he should like such a punishment as that very much .
it would only be fun , he said .
his mother explained to him that it would be fun , perhaps , two or three times , but after that it would only be a trouble ; but still , if they decided upon that as a punishment , he must submit to it in every case .
every time he found himself getting into any dispute or difficulty with his sister , he must stop at once and turn his jacket inside out ; and if he did not himself think to do this , she herself , if she was within hearing , would simply say , " jacket ! "
and then he must do it .
" no matter which of us is most to blame ? "
asked <name> .
" you <name> always be the one that is most to blame , " replied his mother , " or , at least , almost always .
when a boy is playing with a sister younger than himself , he is the one that is most to blame for the quarrelling .
his sister may be to blame by doing something wrong in the first instance ; but he is the one to blame for allowing it to lead to a quarrel .
if it is a little thing , he ought to yield to her , and not to mind it ; and if it is a great thing , he ought to go away and leave her , rather than to stop and quarrel about it .
so you see you <name> be the one to blame for the quarrel in almost all cases .
there may possibly be some cases where you <name> not be to blame at all , and then you <name> have to be punished when you don't deserve it , and you must bear it like a man .
this is a liability that happens under all systems . "
" we <name> try the plan for one fortnight , " she continued .
" so now remember , every single time that i hear you disputing or quarrelling with <name> , you must take off your jacket and put it on again wrong side out  no matter whether you think you were to blame or not  and wear it so a few minutes .
you can wear it so for a longer or shorter time , just as you think is best to make the punishment effectual in curing you of the fault .
by the end of the fortnight we shall be able to see whether the plan is working well and doing any good . "
" so now , " continued his mother , " shut up your eyes and go to sleep .
you are a good boy to wish to cure yourself of such faults , and to be willing to help me in contriving ways to do it .
and i have no doubt that you <name> submit to this punishment good-naturedly every time , and not make me any trouble about it . "
let it be remembered , now , that the efficacy of such management as this consists not in the devising of it , nor in holding such a conversation as the above with the boy  salutary as this might be  but in the faithfulness and strictness with which it is followed up during the fortnight of trial .
in the case in question , the progress which <name> made in diminishing his tendency to get into disputes with his sister was so great that his mother told him , at the end of the first fortnight , that their plan had succeeded " admirably "  so much so , she said , that she thought the punishment of taking off his jacket and turning it inside out would be for the future unnecessarily severe , and she proposed to substitute for it taking off his cap , and putting it on wrong side before .
the reader <name> , of course , understand that the object of such an illustration as this is not to recommend the particular measure here described for adoption in other cases , but to illustrate the spirit and temper of mind in which all measures adopted by the mother in the training of her children should be carried into effect .
measures that involve no threats , no scolding , no angry manifestations of displeasure , but are even playful in their character , may be very efficient in action if they are firmly and perseveringly maintained .
punishments that are the natural consequence of the offense .
there is great advantage in adapting the character of the punishment to that of the fault  making it , as far as possible , the natural and proper consequence of it .
for instance , if the boys of a school do not come in promptly at the close of the twenty minutes ' recess , but waste five minutes by their <unk> in obeying the summons of the <name> , and the teacher keeps them for five minutes beyond the usual hour of dismissal , to make up for the lost time , the punishment may be felt by them to be deserved , and it may have a good effect in diminishing the evil it is intended to remedy ; but it <name> probably excite a considerable degree of mental irritation , if not of resentment , on the part of the children , which <name> diminish the good effect , or is , at any rate , an evil which is to be avoided if possible .
if now , on the other hand , he assigns precisely the same penalty in another form , the whole of the good effect may be secured without the evil .
suppose he addresses the boys just before they are to go out at the next recess , as follows : " i think , boys , that twenty minutes is about the right length of time for the recess , all told  that is , from the time you go out to the time when you are all back in your seats again , quiet and ready to resume your studies .
i found yesterday that it took five minutes for you all to come in  that is , that it was five minutes from the time the <name> was rung before all were in their seats ; and to-day i shall ring the <name> after fifteen minutes , so as to give you time to come in .
if i find to-day that it takes ten minutes , then i <name> give you more time to come in to-morrow , by ringing the <name> after you have been out ten minutes . "
" i am sorry to have you lose so much of your recess , and if you can make the time for coming in shorter , then , of course , your recess can be longer .
i should not wonder if , after a few trials , you should find that you could all come in and get into your places in one minute ; and if so , i shall be very glad , for then you can have an uninterrupted recess of nineteen minutes , which <name> be a great gain . "
every one who has had any considerable experience in the management of boys <name> readily understand how different the effect of this measure <name> be from that of the other , while yet the penalty is in both cases precisely the same  namely , the loss , for the boys , of five minutes of their play .
the little runaway .
in the same manner , where a child three or four years old was in the habit , when allowed to go out by himself in the yard to play , of running off into the street , a very appropriate punishment would be to require him , for the remainder of the day , to stay in the house and keep in sight of his mother , on the ground that it was not safe to trust him by himself in the yard .
this would be much better than sending him to bed an hour earlier , or subjecting him to any other inconvenience or privation having no obvious connection with the fault .
for it is of the greatest importance to avoid , by every means , the exciting of feelings of irritation and resentment in the mind of the child , so far as it is possible to do this without <unk> the efficiency of the punishment .
it is not always possible to do this .
the efficiency of the punishment is , of course , the essential thing ; but parents and teachers who turn their attention to the point <name> find that it is much less difficult than one would suppose to secure this end completely without producing the too frequent <unk> of punishment  anger , <unk> , and ill-will .
[ illustration : " it is not safe " ] in the case , for example , of the child not allowed to go out into the yard , but required to remain in the house in sight of his mother , the mother should not try to make the punishment more heavy by speaking again and again of his fault , and evincing her displeasure by trying to make the confinement as irksome to the child as possible ; but , on the other hand , should do all in her power to <unk> it .
" i am very sorry , " she might say , " to have to keep you in the house .
it would be much pleasanter for you to go out and play in the yard , if it was only safe .
i do n't blame you very much for running away .
it is what foolish little children , as little as you , very often do .
i suppose you thought it would be good fun to run out a little way in the street .
and it is good fun ; but it is not safe .
by-and-by , when you grow a little larger , you wo n't be so foolish , and then i can trust you in the yard at any time without having to watch you at all .
and now what can i get for you to amuse you while you stay in the house with me ? "
punishment coming in this way , and administered in this spirit , <name> irritate the mind and injure the temper comparatively little ; and , instead of being less ; <name> be much more effective in accomplishing the right kind of cure for the fault , than any stern , severe , and vindictive retribution can possibly be .
the question of corporal punishment .
the question of resorting to corporal punishment in the training of the young has been much , very much , argued and discussed on both sides by writers on education ; but it seems to me to be mainly a question of <unk> and skill .
if the parent or teacher has tact or skill enough , and practical knowledge enough of the workings of the youthful mind , he can gain all the necessary ascendency over it without resort to the violent infliction of bodily pain in any form .
if he has not these qualities , then he must turn to the next best means at his disposal ; for it is better that a child should be trained and governed by the <name> than not trained and governed at all .
i do not suppose that savages could possibly control their children without blows ; while , on the other hand , <name> <unk> would have brought under complete submission to her <name> a family of the most ardent and impulsive <unk> , perhaps without even a harsh word or a frown .
if a mother begins with children at the beginning , is just and true in all her dealings with them , gentle in manner , but <unk> firm in act , and looks constantly for divine guidance and aid in her conscientious efforts to do her duty , i feel quite confident that it <name> never be necessary for her to strike them .
the necessity may , however , sooner or later come , for aught i know , in the case of those who act on the contrary principle .
under such management , the <name> may come to be the only alternative to absolute <unk> and anarchy .
there <name> be occasion , however , to refer to this subject more fully in a future chapter .
chapter <name> .
<unk> obedience .
the mode of action described in the last two chapters for training children to habits of obedience consisted in discouraging disobedience by connecting some certain , though mild and gentle disadvantage , inconvenience , or penalty , with every transgression .
in this chapter is to be considered another mode , which is in some respects the converse of the first , inasmuch as it consists in the encouragement of obedience , by often  not necessarily always  connecting with it some advantage , or gain , or pleasure ; or , as it may be stated summarily , the cautious encouragement of obedience by rewards .
this method of action is more difficult than the other in the sense that it requires more skill , tact , and delicacy of perception and discrimination to <name> it successfully into effect .
the other demands only firm , but gentle and steady persistence .
if the penalty , however slight it may be , always comes ,  the effect <name> take care of itself .
but judiciously to administer a system of rewards , or even of <unk> , requires tact , discrimination , and skill .
it requires some observation of the peculiar characteristics of the different minds acted upon , and of the effects produced , and often some intelligent modification of the measures is required , to fit them to varying circumstances and times .
obedience must not be bought .
if the bestowing of commendation and rewards is made a matter of mere blind routine , as the assigning of gentle penalties may be , the result <name> become a mere system of bribing , or rather paying children to be good ; and goodness that is bought , if it deserves the name of virtue at all , is certainly virtue of a very inferior quality .
whether a reward conferred for obedience shall operate as a bribe , or rather as a price paid  for a bribe , strictly speaking , is a price paid , not for doing right , but for doing wrong  depends sometimes on very slight differences in the management of the particular case  differences which an <unk> mother <name> not be very ready to appreciate .
a mother , for example , going into the village on a summer afternoon , leaves her children playing in the yard , under the general charge of <name> , who is at work in the kitchen , whence she can observe them from time to time through the open window .
she thinks the children <name> be safe , provided they remain in the yard .
the only thing to be guarded against is the danger that they may go out through the gate into the road .
two different modes of management .
under some circumstances , as , for example , where the danger to which they would be exposed in going into the road was very great , or where the mother can not rely upon her power to control her children 's conduct by moral means in any way , the only safe method would be to fasten the gate .
but if she prefers to depend for their safety on their voluntary obedience to her commands , and wishes , moreover , to promote the spirit of obedience by <unk> rather than punishing , she can make her rewards of the nature of hire or not , according to her mode of management .
if she wishes to hire obedience , she has only to say to the children that she is going into the village for a little time , and that they may play in the yard while she is gone , but must not go out of the gate ; adding , that she is going to bring home some oranges or <unk> , which she <name> give them if she finds that they have obeyed her , but which she <name> not give them if they have disobeyed .
such a promise , provided the children have the double confidence in their mother which such a method requires  namely , first , a full belief that she <name> really bring home the promised rewards , if they obey her ; and secondly  and this is a confidence much less frequently felt by children , and much less frequently deserved by their mothers  a conviction that , in case they disobey , no <unk> on their part or promises for the next time <name> induce their mother to give them the good things , but that the rewards <name> certainly be lost to them unless they are deserved , according to the conditions of the promise  in such a case  that is , when this double confidence exists , the promise <name> have great influence upon the children .
still , it is , in its nature , hiring them to obey .
i do not say that this is necessarily a bad plan , though i think there is a better .
children may , perhaps , be trained gradually to habits of obedience by a system of direct rewards , and in a manner , too , far more agreeable to the parent and better for the child than by a system of compulsion through threats and punishment .
the method of indirect <unk> .
but there is another way of connecting pleasurable ideas and associations with submission to parental authority in the minds of children , as a means of alluring them to the habit of obedience  one that is both more efficient in its results and more healthful and salutary in its action than the practice of bestowing direct <unk> and rewards .
suppose , for example , in the case above described , the mother , on leaving the children , simply gives them the command that they are not to leave the yard , but makes no promises , and then , on returning from the village with the <unk> in her bag , simply asks <name> , when she comes in , whether the children have obeyed her injunction not to leave the yard .
if <name> says yes , she nods to them , with a look of satisfaction and pleasure , and adds : " i thought they would obey me .
i am very glad .
now i can trust them again . "
then , by-and-by , towards the close of the day , perhaps , and when the children suppose that the affair is forgotten , she takes an opportunity to call them to her , saying that she has something to tell them .
" you remember when i went to the village to-day , i left you in the yard and said that you must not go out of the gate , and you obeyed .
perhaps you would have liked to go out into the road and play there , but you would not go because i had forbidden it .
i am very glad that you obeyed .
i thought of you when i was in the village , and i thought you would obey me .
i felt quite safe about you .
if you had been disobedient children , i should have felt uneasy and anxious .
but i felt safe .
when i had finished my shopping , i thought i would buy you some <unk> , and here they are .
you can go and sit down together on the carpet and divide them .
<name> can choose one , and then <name> ; then <name> , and then <name> again ; and so on until they are all chosen . "
difference in the character of the effects .
it may , perhaps , be said by the reader that this is substantially the same as giving a direct reward for the obedience .
i admit that it is in some sense substantially the same thing , but it is not the same in form .
and this is one of those cases where the effect is modified very greatly by the form .
where children are directly promised a reward if they do so and so , they naturally regard the transaction as of the nature of a contract or a bargain , such that when they have fulfilled the conditions on their part the reward is their due , as , indeed , it really is ; and they come and demand it as such .
the tendency , then , is , to divest their minds of all sense of obligation in respect to doing right , and to make them feel that it is in some sense <unk> with them whether to do right and earn the reward , or not to do right and lose it .
in the case , however , last described , which seems at first view to differ only in form from the preceding one , the commendation and the <unk> would be so connected with the act of obedience as to associate very agreeable ideas with it in the children 's minds , and thus to make doing right appear attractive to them on future occasions , while , at the same time , they would not in any degree deprive the act itself of its spontaneous character , as resulting from a sense of duty on their part , or produce the impression on their minds that their remaining within the gate was of the nature of a service rendered to their mother for hire , and afterwards duly paid for .
the lesson which we deduce from this illustration and the considerations connected with it may be stated as follows : the general principle .
that the rewards conferred upon children with a view of connecting pleasurable ideas and associations with good conduct should not take the form of compensations stipulated for beforehand , and then conferred according to agreement , as if they were of the nature of payment for a service rendered , but should come as the natural expression of the satisfaction and happiness felt by the mother in the good conduct of her child  expressions as free and spontaneous on her part as the good conduct was on the part of the child .
the mother who understands the full import of this principle , and whose mind becomes fully possessed of it , <name> find it constantly coming into practical use in a thousand ways .
she has undertaken , for example , to teach her little son to read .
of course learning to read is irksome to him .
he dislikes extremely to leave his play and come to take his lesson .
sometimes a mother is inconsiderate enough to be pained at this .
she is troubled to find that her boy takes so little interest in so useful a work , and even , perhaps , <unk> him , and threatens him for not loving study .
" if you don't learn to read , " she says to him , in a tone of irritation and displeasure , " you <name> grow up a dunce , and every body <name> laugh at you , and you <name> be ashamed to be seen . "
children 's difficulties .
but let her imagine that she herself was to be called away two or three times a day , for half an hour , to study chinese , with a very exacting teacher , always more or less impatient and dissatisfied with her progress ; and yet the <unk> and difficulty for the mother , in learning to <unk> chinese , would be as nothing compared with that of the child in learning to read .
the only thing that could make the work even tolerable to the mother would be a pretty near , distinct , and certain prospect of going to <name> under circumstances that would make the knowledge of great advantage to her .
but the child has no such near , distinct , and certain prospect of the advantages of knowing how to read .
he has scarcely any idea of these advantages at all .
you can describe them to him , but the description <name> have no perceptible effect upon his mind .
those faculties by which we bring the future vividly before us so as to influence our present action , are not yet developed .
his cerebral organization has not yet advanced to that condition , any more than his bones have advanced to the hardness , <unk> , and strength of manhood .
his mind is only capable of being influenced strongly by what is present , or , at least , very near .
it is the design of divine providence that this should be so .
the child is not made to look forward much yet , and the mother who is pained and distressed because he <name> not look forward , shows a great ignorance of the nature of the infantile mind , and of the manner of its development .
if she finds fault with her boy for not feeling distinctly enough the future advantages of learning to lead him to love study now , she is simply finding fault with a boy for not being possessed of the most slowly developed faculties of a man .
the way , then , to induce children to attend to such duties as learning to read , is not to reason with them on the advantages of it , but to put it simply on the ground of authority .
" it is very irksome , i know , but you must do it .
when you are at play , and having a very pleasant time , i know very well that it is hard for you to be called away to puzzle over your letters and your reading .
it was very hard for me when i was a child .
it is very hard for all children ; but then it must be done . "
the way in this , as in all other similar cases , to reduce the <unk> of disagreeable duties to a minimum is not to attempt to convince or persuade the child , but to put the performance of them simply on the ground of submission to authority .
the child must leave his play and come to take his lesson , not because he sees that it is better for him to learn to read than to play all the time , nor because he is to receive a reward in the form of compensation , but because his mother requires him to do it .
indirect <unk> .
if , therefore , she concludes , in order to connect agreeable ideas with the hard work of learning to read , that she <name> often , at the close of the lessons , tell him a little story , or show him a picture , or have a frolic with him , or give him a piece of <name> or a lump of sugar , or bestow upon him any other little gratification , it is better not to promise these things beforehand , so as to give to the coming of the child , when called , the character of a service rendered for hire .
let him come simply because he is called ; and then let the <unk> be bestowed as the expressions of his mother 's satisfaction and happiness , in view of her boy 's ready obedience to her commands and faithful performance of his duty .
obedience , though implicit , need not be blind .
it must not be supposed from what has been said that because a mother is not to rely upon the reason and forecast of the child in respect to future advantages to <unk> from efforts or sacrifices as motives of present action , that she is not to employ the influence of these motives at all .
it is true that those faculties of the mind by which we apprehend distant things and govern our conduct by them are not yet developed in the child ; but they are to be developed , and the aid of the parent <name> be of the greatest service in promoting the development of them .
at proper times , then , the pleasures and advantages of knowing how to read should be described to the child , and presented moreover in the most attractive form .
the proper time for doing this would be when no lesson is in question  during a ride or a walk , or in the midst of a story , or while looking at a book of pictures .
a most improper time would be when a command had been given and was disregarded , or was reluctantly obeyed ; for then such representations would only tend to <unk> the principle of authority by bringing in the influence of reasonings and persuasions to make up for its acknowledged inefficiency .
it is one of those cases where a force is weakened by <unk>  as a plant , by being long held up by a stake , comes in the end not to be able to stand alone .
so a mother can not in any way more effectually undermine her authority , as authority , than by attempting to <unk> out its force by arguments and <unk> .
authority not to be made oppressive .
while the parent must thus take care to establish the principle of authority as the ground of obedience on the part of his children , and must not make their doing what he requires any the less acts of obedience , through vainly attempting to diminish the hardship of obeying a command by mingling the influence of reasonings and persuasions with it , he may in other ways do all in his power  and that <name> be a great deal  to make the acts of obedience easy , or , at least , to diminish the difficulty of them and the severity of the trial which they often bring to the child .
one mode by which this may be done is by not springing disagreeable obligations upon a child suddenly , but by giving his mind a little time to form itself to the idea of what is to come .
when <name> and <name> are playing together happily with their blocks upon the floor , and are , perhaps , just completing a tower which they have been building , if their mother comes suddenly into the room , announces to them abruptly that it is time for them to go to bed , throws down the tower and brushes the blocks into the basket , and then hurries the children away to the undressing , she gives a sudden and painful shock to their whole nervous system , and greatly increases the disappointment and pain which they experience in being obliged to give up their play .
the delay of a single minute would be sufficient to bring their minds round easily and gently into submission to the necessity of the case .
if she comes to them with a smile , looks upon their work a moment with an expression of interest and pleasure upon her countenance , and then says , " it is <unk> , children , but i would like to see you finish your tower . "
one minute of delay like this , to soften the suddenness of the transition , <name> make the act of submission to the necessity of giving up play and going to bed , in obedience to the mother 's command , comparatively easy , instead of being , as it very likely would otherwise have been , extremely vexatious and painful .
give a little time .
in the same way , in bringing to a close an evening party of children at play , if the <name> of the house comes a little before the time and says to them that after " one more play , " or " two more plays , " as the case may be , " the party must come to an end , " the closing of it would be made easy ; while by waiting till the hour had come , and then suddenly interrupting the gayety , perhaps in the middle of a game , by the abrupt announcement to the children that the clock has struck , and they must stop their plays and begin to get ready to go home , she brings upon them a sudden shock of painful surprise , disappointment , and , perhaps , irritation .
so , if children are to be called away from their play for any purpose whatever , it is always best to give them a little notice , if it be only a moment 's notice , beforehand .
" <name> , in a minute or two i shall wish you to go and get some wood .
you can be getting your things ready to be left . "
" <name> , it is almost time for your lesson .
you had better put <name> to sleep and lay her in the cradle . "
" boys , in ten minutes it <name> be time for you to go to school .
so do not begin any new whistles , but only finish what you have begun . "
on the same principle , if boys are at play in the open air  at ball , or skating , or flying kites  and are to be recalled by a <name> , obedience to the call <name> be made much more easy to them by a preliminary signal , as a warning , given five minutes before the time .
of course , it <name> not always be convenient to give these signals and these times of preparation .
nor <name> it be always necessary to give them .
to determine how and in what cases it is best to apply the principle here explained <name> require some tact and good judgment on the part of the parent .
it would be folly to lay down a rigid rule of this kind to be considered as always <unk> .
all that is desirable is that the mother should understand the principle , and that she should apply it as far as she conveniently and easily can do so .
she <name> find in practice that when she once appreciates the value of it , and observes its kind and beneficent working , she <name> find it convenient and easy to apply it far more generally than she would suppose .
no weakening of authority in this .
it is very plain that softening thus the hardship for the child of any act of obedience required of him by giving him a little time implies no <unk> of the authority of the parent , nor does it <unk> at all from the <unk> of the obedience on the part of the child .
the submission to authority is as complete in doing a thing in five minutes if the order was to do it in five minutes , as in doing it at once if the order was to do it at once .
and the mother must take great care , when thus trying to make obedience more easy by allowing time , that it should be prompt and absolute when the time has expired .
the idea is , that though the parent is bound fully to maintain his authority over his children , in all its force , he is also bound to make the exercise of it as little irksome and painful to them as possible , and to prevent as much as possible the pressure of it from encroaching upon their juvenile joys .
he must insist <unk> on being obeyed ; but he is bound to do all in his power to make the yoke of obedience light and easily to be borne .
influence on the healthful development of the <name> .
indeed , besides the bearing of these views on the happiness of the children , it is not at all improbable that the question of health may be seriously involved in them .
for , however certain we may be of the <unk> of the soul in its essence , it is a perfectly well established fact that all its operations and functions , as an animating spirit in the human body , are fulfilled through the workings of material organs in the <name> ; that these organs are in childhood in an exceedingly immature , tender , and delicate condition ; and that all sudden , sharp , and , especially , painful emotions , greatly excite , and sometimes cruelly irritate them .
when we consider how seriously the action of the digestive organs , in persons in an ordinary state of health , is often interfered with by mental anxiety or distress ; how frequently , in persons subject to <unk> , the paroxysm is brought on by <unk> or perplexities endured incidentally on the preceding day ; and especially how often violent and painful emotions , when they are extreme , result in decided and sometimes in permanent and hopeless insanity  that is , in an irreparable damage to some delicate mechanism in the <name>  we shall see that there is every reason for supposing that all sudden shocks to the nervous system of children , all violent and painful excitements , all vexations and <unk> , and <unk> of <unk> and anger , have a tendency to disturb the healthy development of the cerebral organs , and may , in many cases , seriously affect the future health and welfare , as well as the present happiness , of the child .
it is true that mental disturbances and agitations of this kind can not be wholly avoided .
but they should be avoided as far as possible ; and the most efficient means for avoiding them is a firm , though calm and gentle , establishment and maintenance of parental authority , and not , as many mothers very <unk> imagine , by unreasonable indulgences , and by endeavors to manage their children by persuasions , <unk> , and <unk> , instead of by commands .
the most indulged children , and the least governed , are always the most <unk> and irritable ; while a strong government , if regular , uniform , and just , and if administered by gentle measures , is the most effectual of all possible <unk> for surrounding childhood with an atmosphere of calmness and peace .
in a word , while the mother is bound to do all in her power to render submission to her authority easy and agreeable to her children , by softening as much as possible the disappointment and hardship which her commands sometimes occasion , and by connecting pleasurable ideas and sensations with acts of obedience on the part of the child , she must not at all relax the authority itself , but must maintain it under all circumstances in its full force , with a very firm and decided , though still gentle hand .
chapter vii .
the <name> of training .
it is very clear that the most simple and the most obvious of the modes by which a parent may establish among his children the habit of submission to his authority , are those which have been already described , namely , punishments and rewards  punishments , gentle in their character , but invariably enforced , as the sure results of acts of insubordination ; and rewards for obedience , occasionally and cautiously bestowed , in such a manner that they may be regarded as <unk> simply , on the part of the parent , of the good conduct of his children , and expressions of his gratification , and not in the light of payment or hire .
these are obviously the most simple modes , and the ones most ready at hand .
they require no exalted or unusual qualities on the part of father or mother , unless , indeed , we consider gentleness , combined with firmness and good sense , as an assemblage of rare and exalted qualities .
to assign , and firmly and uniformly to enforce , just but gentle penalties for disobedience , and to recognize , and sometimes reward , special acts of obedience and submission , are measures fully within the reach of every parent , however humble may be the condition of his intelligence or his attainments of knowledge .
another class of influences .
there is , however , another class of influences to be adopted , not as a substitute for these simple measures , but in connection and co-operation with them , which <name> be far more deep , powerful , and permanent in their results , though they require much higher qualities in the parent for carrying them successfully into effect .
this higher method consists in a systematic effort to develop in the mind of the child a love of the principle of obedience , by express and appropriate training .
parents not aware of the extent of their responsibility .
many parents , perhaps indeed nearly all , seem , as we have already shown , to act as if they considered the duty of obedience on the part of their children as a matter of course .
they do not expect their children to read or to write without being taught ; they do not expect a dog to fetch and <name> , or a horse to draw and to understand commands and signals , without being trained .
in all these cases they perceive the necessity of training and instruction , and understand that the initiative is with them .
if a horse , endowed by nature with average good qualities , does not work well , the fault is attributed at once to the man who undertook to train him .
but what mother , when her child , grown large and strong , becomes the trial and sorrow of her life by his ungovernable disobedience and insubordination , takes the blame to herself in reflecting that he was placed in her hands when all the powers and faculties of his soul were in embryo , tender , <unk> , and unresisting , to be formed and fashioned at her <name> ?
the spirit of filial obedience not instinctive .
children , as has already been remarked , do not require to be taught and trained to eat and drink , to resent injuries , to cling to their possessions , or to run to their mother in danger or pain .
they have natural instincts which provide for all these things .
but to speak , to read , to write , and to calculate ; to tell the truth , and to obey their parents ; to forgive injuries , to face bravely fancied dangers and bear patiently unavoidable pain , are attainments for which no natural instincts can adequately provide .
there are instincts that <name> aid in the work , but none that can of themselves be relied upon without instruction and training .
in actual fact , children usually receive their instruction and training in respect to some of these things incidentally  as it happens  by the rough knocks and <unk> , and various painful experiences which they encounter in the early years of life .
in respect to others , the guidance and aid afforded them is more direct and systematic .
unfortunately the establishment in their minds of the principle of obedience comes ordinarily under the former category .
no systematic and appropriate efforts are made by the parent to <unk> it .
it is left to the uncertain and fitful influences of accident  to remonstrances , reproaches , and injunctions called forth under sudden excitement in the various emergencies of domestic discipline , and to other means , vague , capricious , and uncertain , and having no wise <unk> to the attainment of the end in view .
requires appropriate training .
how much better and more successfully the object would be accomplished if the mother were to understand distinctly at the outset that the work of training her children to the habit of submission to her authority is a duty , the responsibility of which <unk> not upon her children , but upon her ; that it is a duty , moreover , of the highest importance , and one that demands careful consideration , much forethought , and the wise adaptation of means to the end .
methods .
the first thought of some parents may possibly be , that they do not know of any other measures to take in order to teach their children submission to their authority , than to reward them when they obey and punish them when they disobey .
to show that there are other methods , we <name> consider a particular case .
<name> , a young <name> of seventeen , came to make a visit to her sister .
she soon perceived that her sister 's children , <unk> and <name> , were entirely <unk> .
their mother coaxed , remonstrated , advised , gave reasons , said " i would n't do this , " or " i would n't do that , "  did every thing , in fact , except simply to command ; and the children , consequently , did pretty much what they pleased .
their mother wondered at their disobedience and insubordination , and in cases where these faults resulted in special inconvenience for herself she bitterly reproached the children for their undutiful behavior .
but the reproaches produced no effect .
" the first thing that i have to do , " said <name> to herself , in observing this state of things , " is to teach the children to obey  at least to obey me .
i <name> give them their first lesson at once . "
<name> makes a beginning .
so she proposed to them to go out with her into the garden and show her the flowers , adding that if they would do so she would make each of them a bouquet .
she could make them some very pretty bouquets , she said , provided they would help her , and would follow her directions and obey her implicitly while gathering and arranging the flowers .
this the children promised to do , and <name> went with them into the garden .
there , as she passed about from border to border , she gave them a great many different directions in respect to things which they were to do , or which they were not to do .
she gathered flowers , and gave some to one child , and some to the other , to be held and carried  with special instructions in respect to many details , such as directing some flowers to be put together , and others to be kept separate , and <unk> in what manner they were to be held or carried .
then she led them to a bower where there was a long seat , and explained to them how they were to lay the flowers in order upon the seat , and directed them to be very careful not to touch them after they were once laid down .
they were , moreover , to leave a place in the middle of the seat entirely clear .
they asked what that was for .
<name> said that they would see by-and-by .
" you must always do just as i say , " she added , " and perhaps i shall explain the reason afterwards , or perhaps you <name> see what the reason is yourselves . "
after going on in this way until a sufficient number and variety of flowers were collected , <name> took her seat in the vacant place which had been left , and assigned the two portions of the seat upon which the flowers had been placed to the children , giving each the charge of the flowers upon one portion , with instructions to select and give to her such as she should call for .
from the flowers thus brought she formed two bouquets , one for each of the children .
then she set them both at work to make bouquets for themselves , giving them minute and special directions in regard to every step .
if her object had been to cultivate their taste and judgment , then it would have been better to allow them to choose the flowers and determine the arrangement for themselves ; but she was teaching them obedience , or , rather , beginning to form in them the habit of obedience ; and so , the more numerous and minute the commands the better , provided that they were not in them selves unreasonable , nor so numerous and minute as to be vexatious , so as to incur any serious danger of their not being readily and <unk> obeyed .
[ illustration : the lesson in obedience . ]
the <name> of training .
101 when the bouquets were finished <name> gave the children , severally , the two which had been made for them ; and the two which they had made for themselves she took into the house and placed them in glasses upon the parlor <unk> , and then stood back with the children in the middle of the room to admire them .
" see how pretty they look !
and how nicely the work went on while we were making them !
that was because you obeyed me so well while we were doing it .
you did exactly as i said in every thing . "
a beginning only .
now this was an excellent first lesson in training the children to the habit of obedience .
it is true that it was only a first lesson .
it was a beginning , but it was a very good beginning .
if , on the following day , <name> had given the children a command which it would be irksome to them to obey , or one which would have called for any special sacrifice or self-denial on their part , they would have disregarded it .
still they would have been a little less inclined to disregard it than if they had not received their first lesson ; and there can be no doubt that if <name> were to continue her training in the same spirit in which she commenced it she would , before many weeks , acquire a complete ascendency over them , and make them entirely submissive to her <name> .
and yet this is a species of training the efficacy of which depends on influences in which the <name> of reward or the fear of punishment does not enter .
the bouquets were not promised to the children at the outset , nor were they given to them at last as rewards .
it is true that they saw the advantages resulting from due subordination of the <unk> to the superior in concerted action , and at the end they felt a satisfaction in having acted right ; but these advantages did not come in the form of rewards .
the efficacy of the lesson depended on a different principle altogether .
the philosophy of it .
the philosophy of it was this : <name> , knowing that the principle of obedience in the children was extremely weak , and that it could not stand any serious test , contrived to bring it into exercise a great many times under the lightest possible pressure .
she called upon them to do a great many different things , each of which was very easy to do , and gave them many little <unk> which it required a very slight effort of self-denial on their part to regard ; and she connected agreeable associations in their minds with the idea of submission to authority , through the interest which she knew they would feel in seeing the work of gathering the flowers and making the bouquets go systematically and prosperously on , and through the commendation of their conduct which she expressed at the end .
such persons as <name> do not analyze distinctly , in their thoughts , nor could they express in words , the principles which <unk> their management ; but they have an instinctive mental perception of the adaptation of such means to the end in view .
other people , who observe how easily and quietly they seem to obtain an ascendency over all children coming within their influence , and how absolute this ascendency often becomes , are frequently surprised at it .
they think there is some mystery about it ; they say it is " a knack that some people have ; " but there is no mystery about it at all , and nothing unusual or strange , except so far as practical good sense , considerate judgment , and intelligent observation and appreciation of the characteristics of childhood are unusual and strange .
<name> was aware that , although the principle of obedience is seldom or never entirely obliterated from the hearts of children  that is , that the impression upon their minds , which , though it may not be absolutely instinctive , is very early acquired , that it is incumbent on them to obey those set in authority over them , is seldom wholly effaced , the sentiment had become extremely feeble in the minds of <unk> and <name> ; and that it was like a frail and dying plant , which required very delicate and careful <unk> to <unk> it to life and give it its normal health and vigor .
her management was precisely of this character .
it called the weak and feeble principle into gentle exercise , without putting it to any severe test , and thus commenced the formation of a habit of action .
any one <name> see that a course of training on these principles , patiently and perseveringly continued for the proper time , could not fail of securing the desired end , except in cases of children characterized by unusual and entirely abnormal perversity .
we can not here follow in detail the various modes in which such a manager as <name> would adapt her principle to the changing incidents of each day , and to the different stages of progress made by her pupils in learning to obey , but can only enumerate certain points worthy of the attention of parents who may feel desirous to undertake such a work of training .
three practical directions .
1 .
relinquish entirely the idea of expecting children to be spontaneously docile and obedient , and the practice of scolding or punishing them <unk> when they are not so .
instead of so doing , understand that <unk> and obedience on their part is to be the result of wise , careful , and persevering , though gentle training on the part of the parent .
2 .
if the children have already formed habits of disobedience and insubordination , do not expect that the desirable change can be effected by sudden , spasmodic , and violent efforts , accompanied by denunciations and threats , and declarations that you are going to " turn over a new leaf . "
the attempt to change perverted tendencies in children by such means is like trying to straighten a bend in the stem of a growing tree by blows with a hammer .
3 .
instead of this , begin without saying at all what you are going to do , or finding any fault with the past , and , with a distinct recognition of the fact that whatever is bad in the native tendencies of your children's minds is probably inherited from their parents , and , perhaps , specially from yourself , and that whatever is wrong in their habits of action is certainly the result of bad training , proceed cautiously and gently , but perseveringly and firmly , in bringing the bent stem gradually up to the right position .
in doing this , there is no amount of ingenuity and skill , however great , that may not be <unk> employed ; nor is there , on the other hand , except in very rare and exceptional cases , any parent who has an <unk> so small as not to be sufficient to accomplish the end , if conscientiously and faithfully employed .
chapter viii .
methods exemplified .
in order to give a more clear idea of what i mean by forming habits of obedience in children by methods other than those connected with a system of rewards and punishments , i <name> specify some such methods , introducing them , however , only as illustrations of what is intended .
for , while in respect to rewards and punishments something like special and definite rules and directions may be given , these other methods , as they depend on the tact , ingenuity , and inventive powers of the parents for their success , depend also in great measure upon these same qualities for the discovery of them .
the only help that can be received from without must consist of suggestions and illustrations , which can only serve to communicate to the mind some general ideas in respect to them .
recognizing the <unk> 1 .
a very excellent effect is produced in forming habits of obedience in children , by simply noticing their good conduct when they do right , and letting them see that you notice it .
when children are at play upon the carpet , and their mother from time to time calls one of them  <name> , we <name> say  to come to her to render some little service , it is very often the case that she is accustomed , when <name> obeys the call at once , leaving her play immediately and coming directly , to say nothing about the prompt obedience , but to treat it as a matter of course .
it is only in the cases of failure that she seems to notice the action .
when <name> , greatly interested in what for the moment she is doing , delays her coming , she says , " you ought to come at once , <name> , when i call you , and not make me wait in this way . "
in the cases when <name> did come at once , she had said nothing .
<name> goes back to her play after the reproof , a little disturbed in mind , at any rate , and perhaps considerably out of humor .
now <name> may , perhaps , be in time induced to obey more promptly under this management , but she <name> have no heart in making the improvement , and she <name> advance reluctantly and slowly , if at all .
but if , at the first time that she comes promptly , and then , after doing the errand , is ready to go back to her play , her mother says , " you left your play and came at once when i called you .
that was right .
it pleases me very much to find that i can depend upon your being so prompt , even when you are at play , " <name> <name> go back to her play pleased and happy ; and the tendency of the incident <name> be to cause her to feel a spontaneous and cordial interest in the principle of prompt obedience in time to come .
<name> is taking a walk through the fields with his mother .
he sees a butterfly and sets off in <name> of it .
when he has gone away from the path among the rocks and bushes as far as his mother thinks is safe , she calls him to come back .
in many cases , if the boy does not come at once in obedience to such a call , he would perhaps receive a scolding .
if he does come back at once , nothing is said .
in either case no decided effect would be produced upon him .
but if his mother says , " <name> , you obeyed me at once when i called you .
it must be hard , when you are after a butterfly and think you have almost caught him , to stop immediately and come back to your mother when she calls you ; but you did it , " <name> <name> be led by this treatment to feel a <name> to come back more promptly still the next time .
a <unk> of course there is an endless variety of ways by which you can show your children that you notice and appreciate the efforts they make to do right .
doubtless there is a danger to be guarded against .
to adopt the practice of noticing and commending what is right , and paying no attention whatever to what is wrong , would be a great perversion of this counsel .
there is a danger more <unk> than this , but still very serious and real , of <unk> a feeling of vanity and <unk> by constant and inconsiderate praise .
these things must be guarded against ; and to secure the good aimed at , and at the same time to avoid the evil , requires the exercise of the tact and ingenuity which has before been referred to .
but with proper skill and proper care the habit of noticing and commending , or even noticing alone , when children do right , and of even being more quick to notice and to be pleased with the right than to detect and be dissatisfied with the wrong , <name> be found to be a very powerful means of training children in the right way .
children <name> act with a great deal more readiness and alacrity to preserve a good character which people already attribute to them , than to relieve themselves of the <unk> of a bad one with which they are charged .
in other words , it is much easier to allure them to what is right than to drive them from what is wrong .
giving <unk> 2 .
there is , perhaps , nothing more irksome to children than to listen to advice given to them in a direct and simple form , and perhaps there is nothing that has less influence upon them in the formation of their characters than advice so given .
and there is good reason for this ; for either the advice must be general , and of course more or less abstract , when it is necessarily in a great measure lost upon them , since their powers of generalization and abstraction are not yet developed ; or else , if it is practical and particular at all , it must be so with reference to their own daily experience in life  in which case it becomes more irksome still , as they necessarily regard it as an indirect mode of fault-finding .
indeed , this kind of advice is almost certain to assume the form of <unk> fault-finding , for the subject of the counsel given would be , in almost all cases , suggested by the errors , or shortcomings , or failures which had been recently observed in the conduct of the children .
the <name> , then , of giving to children general advice and instruction in respect to their conduct and behavior , consists in making it definite and practical , and at the same time contriving some way of <unk> it entirely of all direct application to themselves in respect to their past conduct .
of course , the more we make it practically applicable to them in respect to the future the better .
there are various ways of giving advice of this character .
it requires some ingenuity to invent them , and some degree of tact and skill to apply them successfully .
but the necessary tact and skill would be easily acquired by any mother whose heart is really set upon finding gentle modes of leading her child into the path of duty .
<name> and his cousins .
<name> , going to spend one of his college vacations at his uncle 's , was taken by his two cousins , <name> and <name>  eight and six years old  into their room .
the room was all in confusion .
there was a set of <unk> upon one side , the books upon them lying tumbled about in all directions .
there was a case containing playthings in another place , the playthings broken and in disorder ; and two tables , one against the wall , and the other in the middle of the room , both covered with litter .
now if <name> had commenced his conversation by giving the children a lecture on the disorder of their room , and on the duty , on their part , of taking better care of their things , the chief effect would very probably have been simply to prevent their wishing to have him come to their room again .
but <name> managed the case differently .
after going about the room for a few minutes with the children , and looking with them at their various treasures , and admiring what they seemed to admire , but without finding any fault , he sat down before the fire and took the children upon his lap  one upon each knee  and began to talk to them .
<name> had one of her <unk> in her hand , some of the leaves torn , and the rest defaced with <unk> .
" now , <name> , " said <name> , " i 'm going to give you some advice .
i am going to advise you what to do and how to act when you go to college .
by-and-by you <name> grow to be a young man , and <name> then , perhaps , go to college . "
the idea of growing to be a young man and going to college was very pleasing to <name> 's imagination , and brought his mind into what may be called a receptive condition  that is , into a state to receive readily , and entertain with favor , the thoughts which <name> was prepared to present .
<name> then went on to draw a very agreeable picture of <name> 's leaving home and going to college , with many details calculated to be pleasing to his cousin 's fancy , and came at length to his room , and to the circumstances under which he would take possession of it .
then he told him of the condition in which different scholars kept their respective rooms  how some were always in disorder , and every thing in them <unk> , so that they had no pleasant or <unk> aspect at all ; while in others every thing was well arranged , and kept continually in that condition , so as to give the whole room , to every one who entered it , a very charming appearance .
" the books on their shelves were all properly arranged , " he said , " all standing up in order  those of a like size together .
jump down , <name> , and go to your shelves , and arrange the books on the middle shelf in that way , to show him what i mean . "
<name> jumped down , and ran with great alacrity to arrange the books according to the directions .
when she had arranged one shelf , she was proceeding to do the same with the next , but <name> said she need not do any more then .
she could arrange the others , if she pleased , at another time , he said .
" but come back now , " he added , " and hear the rest of the advice . "
" i advise you to keep your <unk> in nice order at college , " he continued ; " and so with your apparatus and your cabinet .
for at college , you see , you <name> perhaps have articles of philosophical apparatus , and a cabinet of specimens , instead of playthings .
i advise you , if you should have such things , to keep them all nicely arranged upon their shelves . "
here <name> turned his chair a little , so that he and the children could look towards the cabinet of playthings .
<name> climbed down from his cousin 's lap and ran off to that side of the room , and there began hastily to arrange the playthings .
" yes , " said <name> , " that is the way .
but never mind that now .
i think you <name> know how to arrange your philosophical instruments and your cabinet very nicely when you are in college ; and you can keep your playthings in order in your room here , while you are a boy , if you please .
but come back now and hear the rest of the advice . "
so <name> came back and took his place again upon <name> 's knee .
" and i advise you , " continued <name> , " to take good care of your books when you are in college .
it is pleasanter , at the time , to use books that are clean and nice , and then , besides , you <name> like to take your college books with you , after you leave college , and keep them as long as you live , as memorials of your early days , and you <name> value them a great deal more if they are in good order . "
here <name> opened the book which was in her hand , and began to fold back the <unk> and to smooth down the leaves .
the principle involved .
in a word , by the simple expedient of shifting the time , in the imagination of the children , when the advice which he was giving them would come to its practical application , he divested it of all appearance of fault-finding in respect to their present conduct , and so secured not merely its ready admission , but a cordial welcome for it , in their minds .
any mother who sees and clearly <unk> the principle here illustrated , and has ingenuity enough to avail herself of it , <name> find an endless variety of modes by which she can make use of it , to gain easy access to the hearts of her children , for instructions and counsels which , when they come in the form of fault-finding advice , make no impression whatever .
expectations of results must be reasonable .
some persons , however , who read without much reflection , and who do not clearly see the principle involved in the case above described , and do not understand it as it is intended  that is , as a single specimen or example of a mode of action capable of an endless variety of applications , <name> perhaps say , " oh , that was all very well .
<name> 's talk was very good for the purpose of amusing the children for a few minutes while he was visiting them , but it is idle to suppose that such a conversation could produce any permanent or even lasting impression upon them ; still less , that it could work any effectual change in respect to their habits of order . "
that is very true .
in the work of forming the hearts and minds of children it is " line upon line , and precept upon precept " that is required ; and it can not be claimed that one such conversation as that of <name> is any thing more than one line .
but it certainly is that .
it would be as unreasonable to expect that one single lesson like that could effectually and completely accomplish the end in view , as that one single watering of a plant <name> suffice to enable it to attain completely its growth , and enable it to produce in perfection its fruits or its flowers .
but if a mother often clothes thus the advice or instruction which she has to give to her children in some imaginative guise like this , advising them what to do when they are on a journey , for example , or when they are making a visit at the house of a friend in the country ; or , in the case of a boy , what she would counsel him to do in case he were a young man employed by a farmer to help him on his farm , or a clerk in a store , or a sea-captain in charge of a ship , or a general commanding a force in the field ; or , if a girl , what dangers or what undesirable habits or actions she should avoid when travelling in europe , or when , as a young <name> , she joins in picnics or goes on excursions , or attends <unk> or evening parties , or in any of the countless other situations which it is pleasant for young persons to picture to their minds , introducing into all , so far as her ingenuity and skill enable her to do it , interesting incidents and details , she <name> find that she is opening to herself an avenue to her children 's hearts for the sound moral principles that she wishes to <unk> upon them , which she can often employ easily , pleasantly , and very advantageously , both to herself and to them .
when a child is sick , it may be of little consequence whether the medicine which is required is agreeable or disagreeable to the taste .
but with moral remedies the case is different .
sometimes the whole efficiency of the treatment administered as a <unk> for a moral disorder depends upon the readiness and willingness with which it is taken .
to make it disagreeable , consequently , in such cases , is to neutralize the intended action of it  a result which the methods described in this chapter greatly tend to avoid .
chapter ix .
<name> and the dolls .
this book may , perhaps , sometimes fall into the hands of persons who have , temporarily or otherwise , the charge of young children without any absolute authority over them , or any means , or even any right , to enforce their commands , as was the case , in fact , with the older brothers or sister referred to in the preceding illustrations .
to such persons , these indirect modes of training children in habits of subordination to their <name> , or rather of yielding to their influence , are specially useful .
such persons may be interested in the manner in which <name> made use of the children's dolls as a means of guiding and governing their little mothers .
<name> .
<name> had a young sister named <name> , and a cousin whose name was <name> .
<name> used often to come to make <name> a visit , and when together the children were accustomed to spend a great deal of time in playing with their dolls .
besides dressing and undressing them , and playing take them out to excursions and visits , they used to talk with them a great deal , and give them much useful and valuable information and instruction .
[ illustration : roundabout instruction . ]
now <name> contrived to obtain a great influence and ascendency over the minds of the children by means of these dolls .
she fell at once into the idea of the children in regard to them , and treated them always as if they were real persons ; often speaking of them and to them , in the presence of the other children , in the most serious manner .
this not only pleased the children very much , but enabled <name> , under pretense of talking to the dolls , to communicate a great deal of useful instruction to the children , and sometimes to make very salutary and lasting impressions upon their minds .
lectures to the dolls .
for instance , sometimes when <name> was making <name> a visit , and the two children came into her room with their dolls in their arms , she would speak to them as if they were real persons , and then taking them in her hands would set them before her on her knee , and give them a very grave lecture in respect to the proper behavior which they were to observe during the afternoon .
if <name> had attempted to give precisely the same lecture to the children themselves , they would very soon have become restless and uneasy , and it would have made very little impression upon them .
but being addressed to the dolls , they would be greatly interested in it , and would listen with the utmost attention ; and there is no doubt that the counsels and instructions which she gave made a much stronger impression upon their minds than if they had been addressed directly to the children themselves .
to give an idea of these conversations i <name> report one of them in full .
" how do you do , my children ? "
she said , on one such occasion .
" i am very glad to see you .
how nice you look !
you have come , <unk> ( <unk> was the name of <name> 's doll ) , to make <name> a visit .
i am very glad .
you <name> have a very pleasant time , i am sure ; because you never quarrel .
i observe that , when you both wish for the same thing , you do n't quarrel for it and try to pull it away from one another ; but one waits like a <name> until the other has done with it .
i expect you have been a very good girl , <unk> , since you were here last . "
then , turning to <name> , she asked , in a somewhat altered tone , " has she been a good girl , <name> ? "
" she has been a pretty good girl , " said <name> , " but she has been sick . "
" ah ! "
said <name> in a tone of great concern , and looking again at <unk> , " i heard that you had been sick .
i heard that you had an attack of <name> borealis , or something like that .
and you do n't look very well now .
you must take good care of yourself , and if you do n't feel well , you must ask your mother to bring you in to me and i <name> give you a dose of my medicine  my <unk> <unk> .
i know you always take your medicine like a little heroine when you are sick , without making any difficulty or trouble at all . "
<unk> <unk> was the latin name which <name> gave to a preparation of which she kept a supply in a small phial on her table , ready to make-believe give to the dolls when they were sick .
<name> and <name> were very fond of playing that their dolls were sick and bringing them to <name> for medicine , especially as <name> always recommended to them to taste the medicine themselves from a spoon first , in order to set their children a good example of taking it well .
sometimes <name> would let the children take the phial away , so as to have it always at hand in case the dolls should be taken suddenly worse .
but in such cases as this the attacks were usually so frequent , and the mothers were obliged to do so much tasting to encourage the patients , that the phial was soon brought back nearly or quite empty , when <name> used to <unk> it by filling it nearly full of water , and then pouring a sufficient quantity of the <unk> powder into the mouth of it from the <unk> with a spoon .
nothing more was necessary except to shake up the mixture in order to facilitate the process of solution , and the medicine was ready .
a medium of <unk> <name> was accustomed to use the dolls not only for the purpose of instruction , but sometimes for reproof , in many ingenious ways .
for instance , one day the children had been playing upon the piazza with blocks and other playthings , and finally had gone into the house , leaving all the things on the floor of the piazza , instead of putting them away in their places , as they ought to have done .
they were now playing with their dolls in the parlor .
<name> came to the parlor , and with an air of great mystery beckoned the children aside , and said to them , in a whisper , " leave <unk> and <name> here , and do n't say a word to them .
i want you to come with me .
there is a secret  something i would not have them know on any account . "
so saying , she led the way on tiptoe , followed by the children out of the room , and round by a circuitous route to the piazza .
" there ! "
said she , pointing to the playthings ; " see !
all your playthings left out !
put them away quick before <unk> and <name> see them .
i would not have them know that their mothers leave their playthings about in that way for any consideration .
they would think that they might do so too , and that would make you a great deal of trouble .
you teach them , i have no doubt , that they must always put their playthings away , and they must see that you set them a good example .
put these playthings all away quick , and carefully , and we <name> not let them know any thing about your leaving them out . "
so the children went to work with great alacrity , and put the playthings all away .
and this method of treating the case was much more effectual in making them disposed to avoid committing a similar fault another time than any direct rebukes or expressions of displeasure addressed personally to them would have been .
besides , a scolding would have made them unhappy , and this did not make them unhappy at all ; it amused and entertained them .
if you can lead children to cure themselves of their faults in such a way that they shall have a good time in doing it , there is a double gain .
in due time , by this kind of management , and by other modes conceived and executed in the same spirit , <name> gained so great an ascendency over the children that they were far more ready to conform to her <name> , and to obey all her directions , than they would have been to submit to the most legitimate authority that was maintained , as such authority too often is , by fault-finding and threats , and without any sympathy with the fancies and feelings which reign over the hearts of the children in the little world in which they live .
chapter x .
sympathy :  1 .
the child with the parent .
the subject of sympathy between children and parents is to be considered in two aspects : first , that of the child with the parent ; and secondly , that of the parent with the child .
that is to say , an emotion may be awakened in the child by its existence and manifestation in the parent , and secondly , it may be awakened in the parent by its existence in the child .
we are all ready to acknowledge in words the great power and influence of sympathy , but very few are aware how very vast this power is , and how inconceivably great is the function which this principle <unk> in the formation of the human character , and in regulating the conduct of men .
mysterious action of the principle of sympathy .
there is a great mystery in the nature of it , and in the manner of its action .
this we see very clearly in the simplest and most striking material form of it  the act of gaping .
why and how does the witnessing of the act of gaping in one person , or even the thought of it , produce a tendency to the same action in the nerves and muscles of another person ?
when we attempt to trace the chain of connection through the eye , the <name> , and the thoughts  through which line of agencies the chain of cause and effect must necessarily run  we are lost and bewildered .
other states and conditions in which the mental element is more apparent are communicated from one to another in the same or , at least , in some analogous way .
being simply in the presence of one who is amused , or happy , or sad , causes us to feel amused , or happy , or sad ourselves  or , at least , has that tendency  even if we do not know from what cause the emotion which is communicated to us proceeds .
a person of a joyous and happy disposition often <unk> up at once any little circle into which he enters , while a morose and melancholy man carries gloom with him wherever he goes .
eloquence , which , if we were to hear it addressed to us personally and individually , in private conversation , would move us very little , <name> excite us to a pitch of the highest enthusiasm if we hear it in the midst of a vast audience ; even though the words , and the gestures , and the <unk> of the voice , and the force with which it reaches our ears , were to be precisely the same in the two cases .
and so a joke , which would produce only a quiet smile if we read it by ourselves at the fireside alone , <name> <unk> convulsions of laughter when heard in a crowded theatre , where the hilarity is shared by thousands .
a new element , indeed , seems to come into action in these last two cases ; for the mental condition of one mind is not only communicated to another , but it appears to be increased and intensified by the communication .
each does not feel merely the enthusiasm or the mirth which would naturally be felt by the other , but the general emotion is vastly heightened by its being so largely shared .
it is like the case of the live coal , which does not merely set the dead coal on fire by being placed in contact with it , but the two together , when together , burn far more brightly than when apart .
wonderful power of sympathy .
so much for the reality of this principle ; and it is almost impossible to exaggerate the extent and the magnitude of the influence it exerts in forming the character and shaping the ideas and opinions of men , and in regulating all their ordinary habits of thought and feeling .
people's opinions are not generally formed or controlled by arguments or reasonings , as they fondly suppose .
they are imbibed by sympathy from those whom they like or love , and who are , or have been , their associates .
thus people , when they arrive at maturity , adhere in the main to the associations , both in religion and in politics , in which they have been brought up , from the influence of sympathy with those whom they love .
they believe in this or that doctrine or system , not because they have been convinced by proof , but chiefly because those whom they love believe in them .
on religious questions the arguments are presented to them , it is true , while they are young , in <unk> and in other forms of religious instruction , and in politics by the conversations which they overhear ; but it is a mistake to suppose that arguments thus offered have any material effect as processes of <unk> in producing any logical conviction upon their minds .
an english boy is whig or <name> because his father , and his brothers , and his uncles are <unk> or <unk> .
he may , indeed , have many arguments at his command with which to maintain his opinions , but it is not the force of the arguments that has convinced him , nor do they have any force as a means of convincing the other boys to whom he offers them .
they are controlled by their sympathies , as he is by his .
but if he is a popular boy , and makes himself a favorite among his companions , the very fact that he is of this or that party <name> have more effect upon the other boys than the most logical and conclusive trains of reasoning that can be conceived .
so it is with the religious and political differences in this and in every other country .
every one 's opinions  or rather the opinion of people in general , for of course there are many individual exceptions  are formed from sympathy with those with whom in mind and heart they have been in friendly communication during their years of childhood and youth .
and even in those cases where persons change their religious opinions in adult age , the explanation of the mystery is generally to be found , not in seeking for the argument that convinced them , but for the person that led them , in the accomplishment of the change .
for such changes can very often , and perhaps generally , be traced to some person or persons whose influence over them , if carefully scrutinized , would be found to consist really not in the force of the arguments they offered , but in the magic power of a silent and perhaps unconscious sympathy .
the way , therefore , to convert people to our ideas and opinions is to make them like us or love us , and then to avoid arguing with them , but simply let them perceive what our ideas and opinions are .
the well-known proverb , " example is better than precept , " is only another form of expressing the <unk> power of sympathy ; for example can have little influence except so far as a sympathetic feeling in the observer leads him to imitate it .
so that , example is better than precept means only that sympathy has more influence in the human heart than reasoning .
the power of sympathy in childhood .
this principle , so powerful at every period of life , is at its maximum in childhood .
it is the origin , in a very great degree , of the spirit of imitation which forms so remarkable a characteristic of the first years of life .
the child 's thoughts and feelings being spontaneously drawn into <name> with the thoughts and feelings of those around him whom he loves , leads , of course , to a reproduction of their actions , and the prevalence and universality of the effect shows how constant and how powerful is the cause .
so the great secret of success for a mother , in the formation of the character of her children , is to make her children respect and love her , and then simply to be herself what she wishes them to be .
and to make them respect and love her , is to control them by a firm government where control is required , and to indulge them almost without limit where indulgence <name> do no harm .
special application of the principle .
but besides this general effect of the principle of sympathy in aiding parents in forming the minds and hearts of their children , there are a great many cases in which a father or mother who understands the secret of its wonderful and almost magic power can avail themselves of it to produce special effects .
one or two examples <name> show more clearly what i mean .
<name> 's aunt <name> came to pay his mother a visit in the village where <name> 's mother lived .
on the same day she went to take a walk with <name>  who is about nine years old  to see the village .
as they went along together upon the sidewalk , they came to two small boys who were trying to fly a kite .
one of the boys was standing upon the sidewalk , embarrassed a little by some <unk> of the string .
" here , you fellow ! "
said <name> , as he and his aunt approached the spot , " get out of the way with your kite , and let us go by . "
the boy hurried out of the way , and , in so doing , got his <unk> more entangled still in the branches of a tree which grew at the margin of the sidewalk .
now <name> 's aunt might have taken the occasion , as she and her nephew walked along , to give him some kind and friendly instruction or counsel about the duty of being kind to every body in any difficulty , trouble , or perplexity , whether they are young or old ; showing him how we increase the general sum of happiness in so doing , and how we feel happier ourselves when we have done good to any one , than when we have increased in any way , or even <unk> or disregarded , their troubles .
how <name> would receive such a lecture would depend a great deal upon his disposition and state of mind .
but in most cases such counsels , given at such a time , involving , as they would , some covert though very gentle censure , would cause the heart of the boy to close itself in a greater or less degree against them , like the leaves of a <unk> shrinking from the touch .
the reply would very probably be , " well , he had no business to be on the sidewalk , right in our way . "
<name> and his aunt walked on a few steps .
his aunt then stopped , hesitatingly , and said , " how would it do to go back and help that boy <unk> his <unk> ?
he 's a little fellow , and does not know so much about kites and <unk> as you do . "
here the suggestion of giving help to perplexity and distress came associated with a compliment instead of what implied censure , and the leaves of the <unk> expanded at once , and widely , to the genial influence .
" yes , " said <name> ; " let 's go . "
so his aunt turned and went back a step or two , and then said , " you can go and do it without me .
i 'll wait here till you come back .
i do n't suppose you want any help from me .
if you do , i 'll come . "
" no , " aid <name> , " i can do it alone . "
so <name> ran on with great alacrity to help the boys clear the string , and then came back with a beaming face to his aunt , and they walked on .
<name> 's aunt made no further allusion to the affair until the end of the walk , and then , on entering the gate , she said , " we have had a very pleasant walk , and you have taken very good care of me .
and i am glad we helped those boys out of their trouble with the kite . "
" so am i , " said <name> .
analysis of the incident .
now it is possible that some one may say that <name> was wrong in his harsh treatment of the boys , or at least in his want of consideration for their perplexity ; and that his aunt , by her mode of treating the case , covered up the wrong , when it ought to have been brought distinctly to view and openly amended .
but when we come to analyze the case , we shall find that it is not at all certain that there was any thing wrong on william's part in the transaction , so far as the state of his heart , in a moral point of view , is concerned .
all such incidents are very complicated in their nature , and in their bearings and relations .
they present many aspects which vary according to the point of view from which they are regarded .
even grown people do not always see all the different aspects of an affair in respect to which they are called upon to act or to form an opinion , and children , perhaps , never ; and in judging their conduct , we must always consider the aspect in which the action is presented to their minds .
in this case , <name> was thinking only of his aunt .
he wished to make her walk convenient and agreeable to her .
the boy <unk> his string on the sidewalk was to him , at that time , simply an obstacle in his <unk> way , and he dealt with it as such , sending the boy off as an act of kindness and attention to his aunt solely .
the idea of a <unk> being suffering distress which he might either increase by harshness or relieve by help was not present in his mind at all .
we may say that he ought to have thought of this .
but a youthful mind , still imperfect in its development , can not be expected to take cognizance at once of all the aspects of a transaction which tends in different directions to different results .
it is true , that he ought to have thought of the distress of the boys , if we mean that he ought to be taught or trained to think of such distress when he witnessed it ; and that was exactly what his aunt was endeavoring to do .
we ourselves have learned , by long experience of life , to perceive at once the many different aspects which an affair may present , and the many different results which may flow in various directions from the same action ; and we often <unk> blame children , simply because their minds are yet so imperfectly developed that they can not take simultaneous cognizance of more than one or two of them .
this is the true philosophy of most of what is called <unk> in children , and for which , poor things , they receive so many harsh <unk> and so much punishment .
a little girl , for example , undertakes to water her sister 's plants .
in her praiseworthy <name> to do her work well and thoroughly , she fills the mug too full , and <unk> the water upon some books that are lying upon the table .
the explanation of the misfortune is simply that her mind was filled , completely filled , with the thoughts of helping her sister .
the thought of the possibility of spilling the water did not come into it at all .
there was no room for it while the other thought , so <unk> , was there ; and to say that she ought to have thought of both the results which might follow her action , is only to say that she ought to be older .
sympathy as the origin of childish fears .
the power of sympathy in the mind of a child  that is , its tendency to <unk> the opinions or sentiments manifested by others in their presence  may be made very effectual , not only in <unk> principles of right and wrong , but in relation to every other idea or emotion .
children are afraid of thunder and lightning , or of robbers at night , or of ghosts , because they perceive that their parents , or older brothers or sisters , are afraid of them .
where the parents do not believe in ghosts , the children are not afraid of them ; unless , indeed , there are domestics in the house , or playmates at school , or other companions from whom they take the <unk> .
so , what they see that their parents value they prize themselves .
they <unk> from their playmates at school a very large proportion of their tastes , their opinions , and their ideas , not through arguments or reasoning , but from sympathy ; and most of the wrong or foolish notions of any kind that they have acquired have not been established in their minds by false reasoning , but have been taken by sympathy , as a disease is communicated by infection ; and the remedy is in most cases , not reasoning , but a <unk> sympathy .
afraid of a kitten .
little <name> was very much afraid of a kitten which her brother brought home  the first that she had known .
she had , however , seen a picture of a tiger or some other <unk> animal devouring a man in a forest , and had been frightened by it ; and she had heard too , perhaps , of children being scratched by cats or kittens .
so , when the kitten was brought in and put down on the floor , she ran to her sister in great terror , and began to cry .
now her sister might have attempted to reason with her by explaining the difference between the kitten and the wild animals of the same class in the woods , and by assuring her that thousands of children have kittens to play with and are never scratched by them so long as they treat them kindly  and all without producing any sensible effect .
but , instead of this , she adopted a different plan .
she took the child up into her lap , and after <unk> her fears , began to talk to the kitten .
" poor little pussy , " said she , " i am glad you have come .
you never scratch any body , i am sure , if they are kind to you .
<name> <name> give you some milk some day , and she and i <name> like to see you lap it up with your pretty little tongue .
and we <name> give you a ball to play with some day upon the carpet .
see , <name> , see !
she is going to lie down upon the rug .
she is glad that she has come to such a nice home .
now she is putting her head down , but she has not any pillow to lay it upon .
would n't you like a pillow , <name> ?
<name> <name> make you a pillow some day , i am sure , if you would like one .
<name> is beginning to learn to sew , and she could make you a nice pillow , and stuff it with cotton wool .
then we can see you lying down upon the rug , with the pillow under your head that <name> <name> have made for you  all comfortable . "
such a talk as this , though it could not be expected entirely and at once to dispel <name> 's <unk> fears , would be far more effectual towards beginning the desired change than any arguments or reasoning could possibly be .
any mother who <name> reflect upon the principle here explained <name> at once recall to mind many examples and illustrations of its power over the hearts and minds of children which her own experience has afforded .
and if she begins practically and systematically to appeal to it , she <name> find herself in possession of a new element of power  new , at least , to her realization  the exercise of which <name> be as easy and agreeable to herself as it <name> be effective in its influence over her children .
chapter xi .
sympathy :  ii .
the parent with the child .
i think there can be no doubt that the most effectual way of securing the confidence and love of children , and of acquiring an ascendency over them , is by sympathizing with them in their <unk> hopes and fears , and joys and sorrows  in their ideas , their fancies , and even in their caprices , in all cases where duty is not concerned .
indeed , the more <unk> , that is , the more peculiar to the children themselves , the feelings are that we enter into with them , the closer is the bond of kindness and affection that is formed .
an example .
if a gentleman coming to reside in a new town concludes that it is desirable that he should be on good terms with the boys in the streets , there are various ways by which he can seek to accomplish the end .
fortunately for him , the simplest and easiest mode is the most effectual .
on going into the village one day , we <name> suppose he sees two small boys playing horse .
one boy is horse , and the other driver .
as they draw near , they check the play a little , to be more decorous in passing by the stranger .
he stops to look at them with a pleased expression of countenance , and then says , addressing the driver , with a face of much seriousness , " that 's a first-rate horse of yours .
would you like to sell him ?
he seems to be very spirited . "
the horse immediately begins to prance and <unk> .
" you must have paid a high price for him .
you must take good care of him .
give him plenty of oats , and do n't drive him hard when it is hot weather .
and if ever you conclude to sell him , i wish you would let me know . "
so saying , the gentleman walks on , and the horse , followed by his driver , goes galloping forward in high glee .
now , by simply manifesting thus a <unk> with the boys in their childish play , the stranger not only gives a fresh impulse to their enjoyment at the time , but establishes a friendly relationship between them and him which , without his doing any thing to strengthen or perpetuate it , <name> of itself endure for a long time .
if he does not speak to the boys again for months , every time they meet him they <name> be ready to greet him with a smile .
the incident <name> go much farther towards establishing friendly relations between him and them than any presents that he could make them  except so far as his presents were of such a kind , and were given in such a way , as to be expressions of kindly feeling towards them  that is to say , such as to constitute of themselves a manifestation of sympathy .
the uncle who gives his nephews and <unk> presents , let them be ever so costly or beautiful , and takes no interest in their affairs , never inspires them with any feeling of personal affection .
they like him as they like the <unk> which bears them sweet and juicy apples , or the cow that gives them milk  which is on their part a very different sentiment from that which they feel for the kitten that plays with them and shares their joys  or even for their dolls , which are only pictured in their imagination as sharing them .
<unk> and <name> .
miss <unk> calls at a house to make a visit .
a child of seven or eight years of age is playing upon the floor .
after a little time , at a pause in the conversation , she calls the child  addressing her as " my little girl "  to come to her .
the child  a shade being cast over her mind by being thus unnecessarily reminded of her littleness  hesitates to come .
the mother says , " come and shake hands with the <name> , my dear ! "
the child comes reluctantly .
miss <unk> asks what her name is , how old she is , whether she goes to school , what she studies there , and whether she likes to go to school , and at length <unk> her .
the child , only too glad to be free from such a tiresome visitor , goes back to her play , and afterwards the only ideas she has associated with the person of her visitor are those relating to her school and her lessons , which may or may not be of an agreeable character .
presently , after miss <unk> has gone , miss <name> comes in .
after some conversation with the mother , she goes to see what the child is building with her blocks .
after looking on for a moment with an expression of interest in her countenance , she asks her if she has a doll .
the child says she has four .
miss <name> then asks which she likes best , and expresses a <name> to see that one .
the child , much pleased , runs away to bring it , and presently comes back with all four .
miss <name> takes them in her hands , examines them , talks about them , and talks to them ; and when at last the child goes back to her play , she goes with the feeling in her heart that she has found a new friend .
thus , to bring ourselves near to the hearts of children , we must go to them by entering into their world .
they can not come to us by entering ours .
they have no experience of it , and can not understand it .
but we have had experience of theirs , and can enter it if we choose ; and in that way we bring ourselves very near to them .
sympathy must be sincere .
but the sympathy which we thus express with children , in order to be effectual , must be sincere and genuine , and not pretended .
we must renew our own childish ideas and imaginations , and become for the moment , in feeling , one with them , so that the interest which we express in what they are saying or doing may be real , and not merely assumed .
they seem to have a natural instinct to distinguish between an honest and actual sharing of their thoughts and emotions , and all mere condescension and pretense , however adroitly it may be disguised .
want of time .
some mothers may perhaps say that they have not time thus to enter into the ideas and occupations of their children .
they are engrossed with the serious cares of life , or busy with its various occupations .
but it does not require time .
it is not a question of time , but of manner .
the <unk> wife , for example , is busy <unk> , or sewing , or preparing breakfast for her husband and sons , who are expected every moment to come in hungry from their work .
her little daughter , ten years old , comes to show her a shawl she has been making from a piece of calico for her doll .
the busy mother thinks she must say , " yes ; but run away now , <name> ; i am very busy ! "
 because that is the easiest and quickest thing to say ; but it is just as easy and just as quick to say , " what a pretty shawl !
play now that you are going to take <unk> out for a walk in it ! "
the one mode sends the child away repulsed and a little disappointed ; the other pleases her and makes her happy , and tends , moreover , to form a new bond of union and sympathy between her mother 's heart and her own .
a merchant , engrossed all day in his business , comes home to his house at dinner-time , and meets his boy of fifteen on the steps returning from his school .
" well , <name> , " he says , as they walk together up stairs , " i <name> you have been a good boy at school to-day . "
<name> , not knowing what to say , makes some inaudible or unmeaning reply .
his father then goes on to say that he hopes his boy <name> be diligent and attentive to his studies , and improve his time well , as his future success in life <name> depend upon the use which he makes of his advantages while he is young ; and then leaves him at the head of the stairs , each to go to his room .
all this is very well .
advice given under such circumstances and in such a way produces , undoubtedly , a certain good effect , but it does not tend at all to bring the father and son together .
but if , instead of giving this <unk> advice , the father asks  supposing it to be <name> at the time  " which kind of skates are the most popular among the boys nowadays , <name> ? "
then , after hearing his reply , he asks him what his opinion is , and whether any great improvement has been made within a short time , and whether the patent inventions are any of them of much consequence .
the tendency of such a conversation as this , equally brief with the other , <name> be to draw the father and son more together .
even in a moral point of view , the influence would be , indirectly , very salutary ; for although no moral counsel or instruction was given at the time , the effect of such a participation in the thoughts with which the boy 's mind is occupied is to strengthen the bond of union between the heart of the boy and that of his father , and thus to make the boy far more ready to receive and be guided by the advice or <unk> of his father on other occasions .
let no one suppose , from these illustrations , that they are intended to <unk> the idea that a father is to lay aside the parental counsels and instructions that he has been accustomed to give to his children , and replace them by talks about skates !
they are only intended to show one aspect of the difference of effect produced by the two kinds of conversation , and that the father , if he wishes to gain and retain an influence over the hearts of his boys , must descend sometimes into the world in which they live , and with which their thoughts are occupied , and must enter it , not merely as a spectator , or a <unk> , or a counsellor , but as a <unk> , to some extent , in the ideas and feelings which are appropriate to it .
ascendency over the minds of children .
sympathizing with children in their own pleasures and enjoyments , however childish they may seem to us when we do not regard them , as it were , with children 's eyes , is , perhaps , the most powerful of all the means at our command for gaining a powerful ascendency over them .
this <name> lead us not to interfere with their own plans and ideas , but to be willing that they should be happy in their own way .
in respect to their duties , those connected , for example , with their studies , their serious employments , and their compliance with directions of any kind <unk> from superior authority , of course their <name> must be under absolute subjection to that of those who are older and wiser than they .
in all such things they must bring their thoughts and actions into accord with ours .
in these things they must come to us , not we to them .
but in every thing that relates to their <unk> pleasures and joys , their modes of recreation and amusement , their playful <unk> of the mysteries of things , and the various novelties around them in the strange world into which they find themselves ushered  in all these things we must not attempt to bring them to us , but must go to them .
in this , their own sphere , the more perfectly they are at <name> , the better ; and if we join them in it at all , we must do so by bringing our ideas and wishes into accord with theirs .
foolish fears .
the effect of our sympathy with children in winning their confidence and love , is all the more powerful when it is exercised in cases where they are naturally inclined not to expect sympathy  that is , in relation to feelings which they would suppose that older persons would be inclined to condemn .
perhaps the most striking example of this is in what is commonly called foolish fears .
now a fear is foolish or otherwise , not according to the absolute facts involving the supposed danger , but according to the means which the person in question has of knowing the facts .
a <name> , for example , in passing along the sidewalk of a great city comes to a place where workmen are raising an immense and ponderous iron safe , which , slowly rising , hangs suspended twenty feet above the walk .
she is afraid to pass under it .
the foreman , however , who is engaged in directing the operation , passing freely to and fro under the impending weight , as he has occasion , and without the least concern , smiles , perhaps , at the <name> 's " foolish fears . "
but the fears which might , perhaps , be foolish in him , are not so in her , since he knows the nature and the strength of the machinery and securities above , and she does not .
she only knows that accidents do sometimes happen from want of due precaution in raising heavy weights , and she does not know , and has no means of knowing , whether or not the due precautions have been taken in this case .
so she <unk> good sense , and not folly , in going out of her way to avoid all possibility of danger .
this is really the proper explanation of a large class of what are usually termed foolish fears .
viewed in the light of the individual 's knowledge of the facts in the case , they are sensible fears , and not foolish ones at all .
a girl of twelve , from the city , spending the summer in the country , wishes to go down to the river to join her brothers there , but is stopped by observing a cow in a field which she has to cross .
she comes back to the house , and is there laughed at for her foolishness in being ; " afraid of a cow ! "
but why should she not be afraid of a cow ?
she has heard stories of people being <unk> by bulls , and sometimes by cows , and she has no means whatever of estimating the reality or the extent of the danger in any particular case .
the farmer 's daughters , however , who laugh at her , know the cow in question perfectly well .
they have milked her , and fed her , and tied her up to her manger a hundred times ; so , while it would be a very foolish thing for them to be afraid to cross a field where the cow was feeding , it is a very sensible thing for the <unk> from the city to be so .
nor would it certainly change the case much for the child , if the <unk> girls were to assure her that the cow was perfectly peaceable , and that there was no danger ; for she does not know the girls any better than she does the cow , and can not judge how far their statements or opinions are to be relied upon .
it may possibly not be the cow they think it is .
they are very positive , it is true ; but very positive people are often mistaken .
besides , the cow may be peaceable with them , and yet be disposed to attack a stranger .
what a child requires in such a case is sympathy and help , not ridicule .
[ illustration : afraid of the cow . ]
this , in the case supposed , she meets in the form of the farmer 's son , a young man browned in face and plain in attire , who comes along while she stands loitering at the fence looking at the cow , and not daring after all , notwithstanding the assurances she has received at the house , to cross the field .
his name is <name> , and he is a natural gentleman  a class of persons of whom a much larger number is found in this humble guise , and a much smaller number in proportion among the <unk> in elegant life , than is often supposed .
" yes , " says <name> , after hearing the child's statement of the case , " you are right .
cows are sometimes vicious , i know ; and you are perfectly right to be on your guard against such as you do not know when you meet them in the country .
this one , as it happens , is very kind ; but still , i <name> go through the field with you . "
so he goes with her through the field , stopping on the way to talk a little to the cow , and to feed her with an apple which he has in his pocket .
it is in this spirit that the fears , and <unk> , and false imaginations of children are generally to be dealt with ; though , of course , there may be many exceptions to the general rule .
when children are in the wrong .
there is a certain sense in which we should feel a sympathy with children in the wrong that they do .
it would seem paradoxical to say that in any sense there should be sympathy with sin , and yet there is a sense in which this is true , though perhaps , strictly speaking , it is sympathy with the trial and temptation which led to the sin , rather than with the act of transgression itself .
in whatever light a nice metaphysical analysis would lead us to regard it , it is certain that the most successful efforts that have been made by <unk> for reaching the hearts and reforming the conduct of criminals and <unk> have been prompted by a feeling of compassion for them , not merely for the sorrows and sufferings which they have brought upon themselves by their <unk> , but for the mental conflicts which they endured , the fierce impulses of appetite and passion , more or less connected with and dependent upon the material condition of the bodily organs , under the onset of which their feeble moral sense , never really brought into a condition of health and vigor , was <unk> .
these merciful views of the diseased condition and action of the soul in the commission of crime are not only in themselves right views for man to take of the crimes and sins of his <unk> , but they lie at the foundation of all effort that can afford any serious <name> of promoting reformation .
this principle is eminently true in its application to children .
they need the influence of a kind and considerate sympathy when they have done wrong , more , perhaps , than at any other time ; and the effects of the proper manifestation of this sympathy on the part of the mother <name> , perhaps , be greater and more salutary in this case than in any other .
of course the sympathy must be of the right kind , and must be expressed in the right way , so as not to allow the tenderness or compassion for the <unk> to be mistaken for approval or justification of the wrong .
case supposed .
a boy , for instance , comes home from school in a state of great distress , and perhaps of indignation and resentment , on account of having been punished .
mothers sometimes say at once , in such a case , " i do n't pity you at all .
i have no doubt you deserved it . "
this only increases the tumult of commotion in the boy 's mind , without at all tending to help him to feel a sense of his guilt .
his mind , still imperfectly developed , can not take cognizance simultaneously of all the parts and all the aspects of a complicated transaction .
the sense of his wrong-doing , which forms in his teacher 's and in his mother 's mind so essential a part of the transaction , is not present in his conceptions at all .
there is no room for it , so totally engrossed are all his faculties with the stinging recollections of suffering , the tumultuous emotions of anger and resentment , and now with the additional thought that even his mother has taken part against him .
the mother 's <name> of the transaction is equally limited and imperfect , though in a different way .
she thinks only that if she were to treat the child with kindness and sympathy , she would be taking the part of a bad boy against his teacher ; whereas , in reality , she might do it in such a way as only to be taking the part of a suffering boy against his pain .
it would seem that the true and proper course for a mother to take with a child in such a case would be to soothe and calm his agitation , and to listen , if need be , to his account of the affair , without questioning or <unk> it at all , however plainly she may see that , under the blinding and <unk> influence of his excitement , he is <unk> the facts .
let him tell his story .
listen to it patiently to the end .
it is not necessary to express or even to form an opinion on the merits of it .
the ready and willing hearing of one side of a case does not commit the tribunal to a decision in favor of that side .
on the other hand , it is the only way to give weight and a sense of impartiality to a decision against it .
thus the mother may sympathize with her boy in his troubles , appreciate fully the force of the circumstances which led him into the wrong , and help to soothe and calm his agitation , and thus take his part , and place herself closely to him in respect to his suffering , without committing herself at all in regard to the original cause of it ; and then , at a subsequent time , when the tumult of his soul has subsided , she can , if she thinks best , far more easily and effectually lead him to see wherein he was wrong .
chapter xii .
commendation and encouragement .
we are very apt to imagine that the disposition to do right is , or ought to be , the natural and normal condition of childhood , and that doing wrong is something unnatural and exceptional with children .
as a consequence , when they do right we think there is nothing to be said .
that is , or ought to be , a matter of course .
it is only when they do wrong that we notice their conduct , and then , of course , with censure and reproaches .
thus our discipline consists mainly , not in gently leading and encouraging them in the right way , but in <unk> them , by fault-finding and punishment , from going wrong .
now we ought not to forget that in respect to moral conduct as well as to mental attainments children know nothing when they come into the world , but have every thing to learn , either from the instructions or from the example of those around them .
we do not propose to enter at all into the consideration of the various theological and metaphysical theories held by different classes of philosophers in respect to the native constitution and original tendencies of the human soul , but to look at the phenomena of mental and moral action in a plain and practical way , as they present themselves to the observation of mothers in the every-day walks of life .
and in order the better to avoid any complication with these theories , we <name> take first an extremely simple case , namely , the fault of making too much noise in opening and shutting the door in going in and out of a room .
<name> and <name> are two boys , both about five years old , and both prone to the same fault .
we <name> suppose that their mothers take opposite methods to correct them ; <name> 's mother depending upon the influence of commendation and encouragement when he does right , and <name> 's , upon the efficacy of reproaches and punishments when he does wrong .
one method .
<name> , eager to ask his mother some question , or to obtain some permission in respect to his play , bursts into her room some morning with great noise , opening and shutting the door violently , and making much disturbance .
in a certain sense he is not to blame for this , for he is wholly unconscious of the disturbance he makes .
the entire cognizant capacity of his mind is occupied with the object of his request .
he not only had no intention of doing any harm , but has no idea of his having done any .
his mother takes no notice of the noise he made , but answers his question , and he goes away making almost as much noise in going out as he did in coming in .
the next time he comes in it happens  entirely by accident , we <name> suppose  that he makes a little less noise than before .
this furnishes his mother with her opportunity .
" <name> , " she says , " i see you are improving . "
" improving ? "
repeats <name> , not knowing to what his mother refers .
" yes , " said his mother ; " you are improving , in coming into the room without making a noise by opening and shutting the door .
you did not make nearly as much noise this time as you did before when you came in .
some boys , whenever they come into a room , make so much noise in opening and shutting the door that it is very disagreeable .
if you go on improving as you have begun , you <name> soon come in as still as any gentleman . "
the next time that <name> comes in , he takes the utmost pains to open and shut the door as silently as possible .
he makes his request .
his mother shows herself unusually ready to <name> it .
" you opened and shut the door like a gentleman , " she says .
" i ought to do every thing for you that i can , when you take so much pains not to disturb or trouble me . "
another method .
<name> 's mother , on the other hand , acts on a different principle .
<name> comes in sometimes , we <name> suppose , in a quiet and proper manner .
his mother takes no notice of this .
she considers it a matter of course .
by-and-by , however , under the influence of some special eagerness , he makes a great noise .
then his mother <unk> .
she breaks out upon him with , " <name> , what a noise you make !
do n't you know better than to slam the <unk> in that way when you come in ?
if you ca n't learn to make less noise in going in and out , i shall not let you go in and out at all . "
<name> knows very well that this is an empty threat .
still , the utterance of it , and the scolding that accompanies it , irritate him a little , and the only possible good effect that can be expected to result from it is to make him try , the next time he comes in , to see how small an <unk> of the noise he usually makes <name> do , as a kind of make-believe obedience to his mother 's command .
he might , indeed , honestly answer his mother 's angry question by saying that he does not know better than to make such a noise .
he does not know why the noise of the door should be disagreeable to his mother .
it is not disagreeable to him .
on the contrary , it is agreeable .
children always like noise , especially if they make it themselves .
and although <name> has often been told that he must not make any noise , the reason for this  namely , that though noise is a source of pleasure , generally , to children , especially when they make it themselves , it is almost always a source of annoyance and pain to grown persons  has never really entered his mind so as to be actually comprehended us a practical reality .
his ideas in respect to the philosophy of the transaction are , of course , exceedingly vague ; but so far as he forms any idea , it is that his mother 's words are the expression of some mysterious but unreasonable sensitiveness on her part , which awakens in her a spirit of fault-finding and <unk> that vents itself upon him in blaming him for nothing at all ; or , as he would express it more <unk> , if not so elegantly , that she is " very cross . "
in other words , the impression made by the transaction upon his moral sense is that of wrong-doing on his mother 's part , and not at all on his own .
it is evident , when we thus look into the secret workings of this method of curing children of their faults , that even when it is successful in restraining certain kinds of outward misconduct , and is thus the means of effecting some small amount of good , the injury which it does by its reaction on the spirit of the child may be vastly greater , through the irritation and <unk> which it occasions , and the <unk> of his confidence in the justice and goodness of his mother .
before leaving this illustration , it must be carefully observed that in the <unk> case  namely , that of <name>  the work of curing the fault in question is not to be at all considered as effected by the step taken by his mother which has been already described .
that was only a beginning  a right beginning , it is true , but still only a beginning .
it produced in him a cordial willingness to do right , in one instance .
that is a great thing , but it is , after all , only one single step .
the work is not complete until a habit of doing right is formed , which is another thing altogether , and requires special and continual measures directed to this particular end .
children have to be trained in the way they should go  not merely shown the way , and induced to make a beginning of entering it .
we <name> now try to show how the influence of commendation and encouragement may be brought into action in this more essential part of the process .
habit to be formed .
having taken the first step already described , <name> 's mother finds some proper opportunity , when she can have the undisturbed and undivided attention of her boy  perhaps at night , after he has gone to his crib or his <unk> , and just before she leaves him ; or , perhaps , at some time while she is at work , and he is sitting by her side , with his mind calm , quiet , and unoccupied .
" <name> , " she says , " i have a plan to propose to you . "
<name> is eager to know what it is .
" you know how pleased i was when you came in so still to-day . "
<name> remembers it very well .
" it is very curious , " continued his mother , " that there is a great difference between grown people and children about noise .
children like almost all kinds of noises very much , especially , if they make the noises themselves ; but grown people dislike them even more , i think , than children like them .
if there were a number of boys in the house , and i should tell them that they might run back and forth through the rooms , and rattle and slam all the doors as they went as loud as they could , they would like it very much .
they would think it excellent fun . "
" yes , " says <name> , " indeed , they would .
i wish you would let us do it some day . "
" but grown people , " continues his mother , " would not like such an amusement at all .
on the contrary , such a racket would be excessively disagreeable to them , whether they made it themselves or whether somebody else made it .
so , when children come into a room where grown people are sitting , and make a noise in opening and shutting the door , it is very disagreeable .
of course , grown people always like those children the best that come into a room quietly , and in a gentlemanly and <unk> manner . "
as this explanation comes in connection with <name> 's having done right , and with the commendation which he has received for it , his mind and heart are open to receive it , instead of being disposed to resist and exclude it , as he would have been if the same things exactly had been said to him in connection with censure and reproaches for having acted in violation of the principle .
" yes , mother , " says he , " and i mean always to open and shut the door as still as i can . "
" yes , i know you mean to do so , " rejoined his mother , " but you <name> forget , unless you have some plan to make you remember it until the habit is formed .
now i have a plan to propose to help you form the habit .
when you get the habit once formed there <name> be no more difficulty .
" the plan is this : whenever you come into a room making a noise , i <name> simply say , noise .
then you <name> step back again softly and shut the door , and then come in again in a quiet and proper way .
you <name> not go back for punishment , for you would not have made the noise on purpose , and so would not deserve any punishment .
it is only to help you remember , and so to form the habit of coming into a room in a quiet and gentlemanly manner . "
now <name> , especially if all his mother 's management of him is conducted in this spirit , <name> enter into this plan with great cordiality .
" i should not propose this plan , " continued his mother , " if i thought that when i say noise , and you have to go out and come in again , it would put you out of humor , and make you cross or sullen .
i am sure you <name> be good-natured about it , and even if you consider it a kind of punishment , that you <name> go out willingly , and take the punishment like a man ; and when you come in again you <name> come in still , and look pleased and happy to find that you are carrying out the plan honorably . "
then if , on the first occasion when he is sent back , he does take it good-naturedly , this must be noticed and commended .
now , unless we are entirely wrong in all our ideas of the nature and tendencies of the infantile mind , it is as certain that a course of procedure like this <name> be successful in curing the fault which is the subject of treatment , as that water <name> extinguish fire .
it cures it , too , without <unk> any irritation , annoyance , or <unk> in the mind either of mother or child .
on the contrary , it is a source of real satisfaction and pleasure to them both , and increases and strengthens the bond of sympathy by which their hearts are united to each other .
the principle involved .
it must be understood distinctly that this case is given only as an illustration of a principle which is applicable to all cases .
the act of opening and shutting a door in a noisy manner is altogether too insignificant a fault to deserve this long discussion of the method of curing it , were it not that methods founded on the same principles , and conducted in the same spirit , are applicable universally in all that <unk> to the domestic management of children .
and it is a method , too , directly the opposite of that which is often  i <name> not say generally , but certainly very often  pursued .
the child tells the truth many times , and in some cases , perhaps , when the inducement was very strong to tell an untruth .
we take no notice of these cases , considering it a matter of course that he should tell the truth .
we reserve our action altogether for the first case when , overcome by a sudden temptation , he tells a lie , and then interpose with reproaches and punishment .
nineteen times he gives up what belongs to his little brother or sister of his own accord , perhaps after a severe internal struggle .
the twentieth time the result of the struggle goes the wrong way , and he attempts to retain by violence what does not belong to him .
we take no notice of the nineteen cases when the little fellow did right , but come and box his ears in the one case when he does wrong .
origin of the error .
the idea on which this mode of treatment is founded  namely , that it is a matter of course that children should do right , so that when they do right there is nothing to be said , and that doing wrong is the abnormal condition and exceptional action which alone requires the parent to interfere  is , to a great extent , a mistake .
indeed , the matter of course is all the other way .
a babe <name> seize the plaything of another babe without the least <unk> long after it is keenly alive to the injustice and <unk> of having its own playthings taken by any other child .
so in regard to truth .
the first impulse of all children , when they have just acquired the use of language , is to use it in such a way as to effect their object for the time being , without any sense of the sacred obligation of making the words always correspond truly with the facts .
the principles of doing justice to the rights of others to one 's own damage , and of speaking the truth when falsehood would serve the present purpose better , are principles that are developed or acquired by slow degrees , and at a later period .
i say developed or acquired  for different classes of <unk> and <unk> entertain different theories in respect to the way by which the ideas of right and of duty enter into the human mind .
but all <name> agree in this , that whatever may be the origin of the moral sense in man , it does not appear as a practical element of control for the conduct till some time after the animal appetites and passions have begun to exercise their power .
whether we regard this sense as arising from a development within of a latent principle of the soul , or as an essential element of the inherited and native constitution of man , though remaining for a time embryonic and inert , or as a habit acquired under the influence of instruction and example , all <name> admit that the period of its appearance as a perceptible motive of action is so delayed , and the time required for its attaining sufficient strength to exercise any real and effectual control over the conduct extends over so many of the earlier years of life , that no very material help in governing the appetites and passions and impulses can be reasonably expected from it at a very early period .
indeed , conscience , so far as its existence is manifested at all in childhood , seems to show itself chiefly in the form of the simple fear of detection in what there is reason to suppose <name> lead , if discovered , to reproaches or punishment .
at any rate , the moral sense in childhood , whatever may be our philosophy in respect to the origin and the nature of it , can not be regarded as a strong and settled principle on which we can throw the responsibility of regulating the conduct , and holding it sternly to its obligations .
it is , on the contrary , a very tender plant , slowly coming forward to the development of its beauty and its power , and requiring the most gentle <unk> and care on the part of those intrusted with the training of the infant mind ; and the influence of commendation and encouragement when the embryo monitor succeeds in its incipient and feeble efforts , <name> be far more effectual in promoting its development , than that of censure and punishment when it fails .
important caution .
for every good thing there seems to be something in its form and semblance that is <unk> and bad .
the principle brought to view in this chapter has its counterfeit in the <unk> praise and flattery of children by their parents , which only makes them self-conceited and vain , without at all promoting any good end .
the distinction between the two might be easily pointed out , if time and space permitted ; but the intelligent parent , who has rightly comprehended the method of management here described , and the spirit in which the process of applying it is to be made , <name> be in no danger of <unk> one with the other .
this principle of noticing and commending , within proper limits and restrictions , what is right , rather than finding fault with what is wrong , <name> be found to be as important in the work of instruction as in the regulation of conduct .
we have , in fact , a very good opportunity of comparing the two systems , as it is a curious fact that in certain things it is almost the universal custom to adopt one method , and in certain others , the other .
the two methods exemplified .
there are , for example , two arts which children have to learn , in the process of their mental and physical development , in which their faults , errors , and deficiencies are never pointed out , but in the dealings of their parents with them all is commendation and encouragement .
they are the arts of walking and talking .
the first time that a child attempts to walk alone , what a feeble , staggering , and awkward exhibition it makes .
and yet its mother shows , by the excitement of her countenance , and the delight expressed by her exclamations , how pleased she is with the performance ; and she , perhaps , even calls in persons from the next room to see how well the baby can walk !
not a word about <unk> and failings , not a word about the tottering , the awkward reaching out of arms to preserve the balance , the <unk> of the way , the anxious expression of the countenance , or any other faults .
these are left to correct themselves by the continued practice which encouragement is sure to lead to .
it is true that words would not be available in such a case for fault-finding ; for a child when learning to walk would be too young to understand them .
but the parent 's sense of the <unk> of the performance might be expressed in looks and gestures which the child would understand ; but he sees , on the contrary , nothing but indications of satisfaction and pleasure , and it is very manifest how much he is encouraged by them .
seeing the pleasure which his efforts give to the spectators , he is made proud and happy by his success , and goes on making efforts to improve with alacrity and delight .
it is the same with learning to talk .
the mistakes , deficiencies , and errors of the first rude attempts are seldom noticed , and still more seldom pointed out by the parent .
on the contrary , the child takes the impression , from the readiness with which its words are understood and the delight it evidently gives its mother to hear them , that it is going on triumphantly in its work of learning to talk , instead of feeling that its attempts are only tolerated because they are made by such a little child , and that they require a vast amount of correction , alteration , and improvement , before they <name> be at all satisfactory .
indeed , so far from <unk> and pointing out the errors and faults , the mother very frequently meets the child half way in its progress , by actually adopting the faults and errors herself in her replies .
so that when the little beginner in the use of language , as he wakes up in his crib , and stretching out his hands to his mother says , " i want to get up " she comes to take him , and replies , her face beaming with delight , " my little darling !
you shall get up ; " thus filling his mind with happiness at the idea that his mother is not only pleased that he attempts to speak , but is fully satisfied , and more than satisfied , with his success .
the result is , that in learning to walk and to talk , children always go forward with alacrity and ardor .
they practise continually and spontaneously , requiring no promises of reward to allure them to effort , and no threats of punishment to overcome repugnance or aversion .
it might be too much to say that the rapidity of their progress and the pleasure which they experience in making it , are owing wholly to the commendation and encouragement they receive  for other causes may co-operate with these .
but it is certain that these influences contribute very essentially to the result .
there can be no doubt at all that if it were possible for a mother to stop her child in its efforts to learn to walk and to talk , and explain to it , no matter how kindly , all its shortcomings , failures , and mistakes , and were to make this her daily and habitual practice , the consequence would be , not only a great diminution of the ardor and animation of the little pupil , in pressing forward in its work , but also a great retardation in its progress .
example of the other method .
let us now , for the more full understanding of the subject , go to the other extreme , and consider a case in which the management is as far as possible removed from that above referred to .
we can not have a better example than the method often adopted in schools and <unk> for teaching composition ; in other words , the <name> of expressing one 's thoughts in written language  an <name> which one would suppose to be so analogous to that of learning to talk  that is , to express one 's thoughts in oral language  that the method which was found so eminently successful in the one would be naturally resorted to in the other .
instead of that , the method often pursued is exactly the reverse .
the pupil having with infinite difficulty , and with many forebodings and anxious fears , made his first attempt , brings it to his teacher .
the teacher , if he is a kind-hearted and considerate man , perhaps briefly <unk> the effort with some such dubious and equivocal praise as it is " very well for a beginner , " or " as good a composition as could be expected at the first attempt , " and then proceeds to go over the exercise in a cool and deliberate manner , with a view of discovering and bringing out clearly and conspicuously to the view , not only of the little author himself , but often of all his classmates and friends , every imperfection , failure , mistake , omission , or other fault which a rigid scrutiny can detect in the performance .
however kindly he may do this , and however gentle the tones of his voice , still the work is criticism and fault-finding from beginning to end .
the boy sits on thorns and <unk> while submitting to the operation , and when he takes his marked and corrected manuscript to his seat , he feels mortified and ashamed , and is often hopelessly discouraged .
how faults are to be corrected .
some one may , perhaps , say that pointing out the errors and faults of pupils is absolutely essential to their progress , inasmuch as , unless they are made to see what their faults are , they can not be expected to correct them .
i admit that this is true to a certain extent , but by no means to so great an extent as is often supposed .
there are a great many ways of teaching pupils to do better what they are going to do , besides showing them the faults in what they have already done .
thus , without pointing out the errors and faults which he observes , the teacher may only refer to and commend what is right , while he at the same time observes and remembers the prevailing faults , with a view of adapting his future instructions to the removal of them .
these instructions , when given , <name> take the form , of course , of general information on the <name> of expressing one 's thoughts in writing , and on the faults and errors to be avoided , perhaps without any , or , at least , very little allusion to those which the pupils themselves had committed .
instruction thus given , while it <name> have at least an equal tendency with the other mode to form the pupils to habits of correctness and accuracy , <name> not have the effect upon their mind of <unk> of what they have already done , but rather of aid and encouragement for them in regard to what they are next to do .
in following the instructions thus given them , the pupils <name> , as it were , leave the faults previously committed behind them , being even , in many instances , unconscious , perhaps , of their having themselves ever committed them .
the ingenious mother <name> find various modes analogous to this , of leading her children forward into what is right , without at all disturbing their minds by censure of what is wrong  a course which it is perfectly safe to pursue in the case of all errors and faults which result from <unk> or immaturity .
there is , doubtless , another class of faults  those of <unk> carelessness or neglect  which must be specially pointed out to the attention of the <unk> , and a degree of discredit attached to the commission of them , and perhaps , in special cases , some kind of punishment imposed , as the most proper <unk> of the evil .
and yet , even in cases of carelessness and neglect of duty , it <name> generally be found much more easy to awaken ambition , and a <name> to improve , in a child , by discovering , if possible , something good in his work , and commending that , as an encouragement to him to make greater exertion the next time , than to attempt to cure him of his negligence by calling his attention to the faults which he has committed , as subjects of censure , however obvious the faults may be , and however deserving of blame .
the advice , however , made in this chapter , to employ commendation and encouragement to a great extent , rather than criticism and fault-finding , in the management and instruction of children , must , like all other general counsels of the kind , be held subject to all proper limitations and restrictions .
some mother may , perhaps , object to what is here advanced , saying , " if i am always indiscriminately praising my child 's doings , he <name> become self-conceited and vain , and he <name> cease to make progress , being satisfied with what he has already attained . "
of course he <name> , and therefore you must take care not to be always and indiscriminately praising him .
you must exercise tact and good judgment , or at any rate , common sense , in properly <unk> your criticism and your praise .
there are no principles of management , however sound , which may not be so exaggerated , or followed with so blind a disregard of attendant circumstances , as to produce more harm than good .
it must be especially borne in mind that the counsels here given in relation to curing the faults of children by dealing more with what is good in them than what is bad , are intended to apply to faults of ignorance , <unk> , or habit only , and not to acts of known and <unk> wrong .
when we come to cases of deliberate and intentional disobedience to a parent 's commands , or open resistance to his authority , something different , or at least something more , is required .
the principle of universal <unk> in conclusion , it is proper to add that the principle of influencing human character and action by noticing and commending what is right , rather than finding fault with what is wrong , is of universal application , with the mature as well as with the young .
the susceptibility to this influence is in full operation in the minds of all men everywhere , and acting upon it <name> lead to the same results in all the relations of society .
the way to awaken a <unk> man to the performance of generous deeds is not by <unk> with him , however kindly , on his <unk> , but by watching his conduct till we find some act that bears some semblance of liberality , and commending him for that .
if you have a neighbor who is surly and troublesome  tell him that he is so , and you make him worse than ever .
but watch for some occasion in which he shows you some little kindness , and thank him cordially for such a good <unk> act , and he <name> feel a strong <name> to repeat it .
if mankind universally understood this principle , and would generally act upon it in their dealings with others  of course , with such limitations and restrictions as good sense and sound judgment would impose  the world would not only go on much more smoothly and harmoniously than it does now , but the progress of improvement would , i think , in all respects be infinitely more rapid .
chapter xiii .
faults of immaturity .
a great portion of the errors and mistakes , and of what we call the follies , of children arise from simple ignorance .
principles of philosophy , whether pertaining to external nature or to mental action , are involved which have never come home to their minds .
they may have been presented , but they have not been understood and appreciated .
it requires some tact , and sometimes delicate observation , on the part of the mother to determine whether a mode of action which she sees ought to be corrected results from childish ignorance and inexperience , or from <unk> wrong-doing .
whatever may be the proper treatment in the latter case , it is evident that in the former what is required is not censure , but instruction .
boasting .
a mother came into the room one day and found <name> disputing earnestly with his cousin <name> on the question which was the tallest  <name> very strenuously maintaining that he was the tallest , because he was a boy .
his older brother , <name> , who was present at the time , measured them , and found that <name> in reality was the tallest .
now there was nothing wrong in his feeling a pride and pleasure in the thought that he was physically superior to his cousin , and though it was foolish for him to insist himself on this superiority in a boasting way , it was the foolishness of ignorance only .
he had not learned the principle  which half mankind do not seem ever to learn during the whole course of their lives  that it is far wiser and better to let our good qualities appear naturally of themselves , than to claim credit for them beforehand by boasting .
it would have been much wiser for <name> to have admitted at the outset that <name> might possibly be taller than he , and then to have awaited quietly the result of the measuring .
but we can not blame him much for not having learned this particular wisdom at five years of age , when so many full-grown men and women never learn it at all .
nor was there any thing <unk> in him in respect to the false logic involved in his argument , that his being a boy made him necessarily taller than his cousin , a girl of the same age .
there was a semblance of proof in that fact  what the logicians term a presumption .
but the reasoning powers are very slowly developed in childhood .
they are very seldom aided by any instruction really adapted to the improvement of them ; and we ought not to expect that such children can at all clearly distinguish a semblance from a reality in ideas so extremely abstruse as those relating to the logical connection between the premises and the conclusion in a process of <unk> .
in this case as in the other we expect them to understand at once , without instruction , what we find it extremely difficult to learn ourselves ; for a large portion of mankind prove themselves utterly unable ever to discriminate between sound arguments and those which are utterly <unk> and absurd .
in a word , what <name> requires in such a case as this is , not ridicule to shame him out of his false reasoning , nor censure or punishment to cure him of his boasting , but simply instruction .
and this instruction it is much better to give not in direct connection with the occurrence which indicated the want of it .
if you attempt to explain to your boy the folly of boasting in immediate connection with some act of boasting of his own , he feels that you are really finding fault with him ; his mind instinctively puts itself into a position of defense , and the truth which you wish to impart to it finds a much less easy admission .
if , for example , in this case <name> 's mother attempts on the spot to explain to him the folly of boasting , and to show how much wiser it is for us to let our good qualities , if we have any , speak for themselves , without any direct agency of ours in claiming the merit of them , he listens reluctantly and nervously as to a scolding in disguise .
if he is a boy well managed , he waits , perhaps , to hear what his mother has to say , but it makes no impression .
if he is badly trained , he <name> probably interrupt his mother in the midst of what she is saying , or break away from her to go on with his play .
a right mode of <unk> if now , instead of this , the mother waits until the dispute and the transaction of measuring have passed by and been forgotten , and then takes some favorable opportunity to give the required instruction , the result <name> be far more favorable .
at some time , when tired of his play , he comes to stand by her to observe her at her work , or perhaps to ask her for a story ; or , after she has put him to bed and is about to leave him for the night , she says to him as follows : " i 'll tell you a story about two boys , <name> and <name> , and you shall tell me which of them came off best .
they both went to the same school and were in the same class , and there was nobody else in the class but those two .
<name> , who was the most diligent scholar , was at the head of the class , and <name> was below him , and , of course , as there were only two , he was at the foot .
" one day there was company at the house , and one of the ladies asked the boys how they got along at school .
<name> immediately said , 'very well .
i'm next to the head of my class . '
the <name> then praised him , and said that he must be a very good scholar to be so high in his class .
then she asked <name> how high he was in his class .
he said he was next to the foot .
" the <name> was somewhat surprised , for she , as well as the others present , supposed that <name> was the best scholar ; they were all a little puzzled too , for <name> looked a little <unk> and sly when he said it .
but just then the teacher came in , and she explained the case ; for she said that the boys were in the same class , and they were all that were in it ; so that <name> , who was really at the head , was next but one to the foot , while <name> , who was at the foot , was next but one to the head .
on having this explanation made to the company , <name> felt very much confused and ashamed , while <name> , though he said nothing , could not help feeling pleased .
" and now , " asks the mother , in conclusion , " which of these boys do you think came off the best ? "
<name> answers that <name> came out best .
" yes , " adds his mother , " and it is always better that people 's merits , if they have any , should come out in other ways than by their own boasting of them . "
it is true that this case of <name> and <name> does not correspond exactly  not even nearly , in fact  with that of <name> and his cousin .
nor is it necessary that the instruction given in these ways should logically conform to the incident which calls them forth .
it is sufficient that there should be such a degree of analogy between them , that the interest and turn of thought produced by the incident may prepare the mind for appreciating and receiving the lesson .
but the mother may bring the lesson nearer if she pleases .
" i <name> tell you another story , " she says .
" there were two men at a fair .
their names were <name> and <name> .
" <name> was boasting of his strength .
he said he was a great deal stronger than <name> .
'perhaps you are , ' said <name> .
then <name> pointed to a big stone which was lying upon the ground , and dared <name> to try which could throw it the farthest .
'very well , ' said <name> , 'i <name> try , but i think it very likely you <name> beat me , for i know you are very strong . '
so they tried , and it proved that <name> could throw it a great deal farther than <name> could .
then <name> went away looking very much incensed and very much ashamed , while <name> 's triumph was altogether greater for his not having boasted . "
" yes , " says <name> , " i think so . "
the mother may , if she pleases , come still nearer than this , if she wishes to suit <name> 's individual case , without exciting any resistance in his heart to the reception of her lesson .
she may bring his exact case into consideration , provided she changes the names of the actors , so that <name> 's mind may be relieved from the uneasy sensitiveness which it is so natural for a child to feel when his own conduct is directly the object of unfavorable comment .
it is surprising how slight a change in the mere outward incidents of an affair <name> suffice to divert the thoughts of the child from himself in such a case , and enable him to look at the lesson to be imparted without personal feeling , and so to receive it more readily .
<name> 's mother may say , " there might be a story in a book about two boys that were disputing a little about which was the tallest .
what do you think would be good names for the boys , if you were making up such a story ? "
when <name> has proposed the names , his mother could go on and give an almost exact narrative of what took place between <name> and his cousin , offering just such instructions and such advice as she would like to offer ; and she <name> find , if she manages the conversation with ordinary tact and discretion , that the lessons which she desires to impart <name> find a ready admission to the mind of her child , simply from the fact that , by <unk> them of all direct personal application , she has eliminated from them the element of covert censure which they would otherwise have contained .
very slight disguises <name> , in all such cases , be found to be sufficient to veil the personal <unk> of the instruction , so far as to divest it of all that is painful or disagreeable to the child .
he may have a vague feeling that you mean him , but the feeling <name> not produce any effect of irritation or <unk> .
now , the object of these illustrations is to show that those errors and faults which , when we look at their real and intrinsic character , we see to be results of ignorance and inexperience , and not instances of <unk> and intentional wrong-doing , are not to be dealt with harshly , and made occasions of censure and punishment .
the child does not deserve censure or punishment in such cases ; what he requires is instruction .
it is the bringing in of light to illuminate the path that is before him which he has yet to tread , and not the infliction of pain , to impress upon him the evil of the <unk> he made , in consequence of the obscurity , in the path behind him .
indeed , in such cases as this , it is the influence of pleasure rather than pain that the parent <name> find the most efficient means of aiding him ; that is , in these cases , the more pleasant and agreeable the modes by which he can impart the needed knowledge to the child  in other words , the more attractive he can make the paths by which he can lead his little charge onward in its progress towards maturity  the more successful he <name> be .
ignorance of material properties and <unk> in the example already given , the mental immaturity consisted in imperfect acquaintance with the qualities and the action of the mind , and the principles of sound reasoning ; but a far larger portion of the mistakes and failures into which children fall , and for which they incur <unk> censure , are due to their ignorance of the laws of external nature , and of the properties and qualities of material objects .
a boy , for example , seven or eight years old , receives from his father a present of a knife , with a special injunction to be careful of it .
he is , accordingly , very careful of it in respect to such dangers as he understands , but in attempting to bore a hole with it in a piece of wood , out of which he is trying to make a windmill , he breaks the small blade .
the accident , in such a case , is not to be attributed to any <unk> carelessness , but to want of instruction in respect to the strength of such a material as steel , and the nature and effects of the degree of <unk> given to <unk> .
the boy had seen his father bore holes with a <unk> , and the <unk> was larger  in one direction at least , that is , in breadth  than the <unk> , and it was very natural for him to suppose that it was stronger .
what a boy needs in such a case , therefore , is not a scolding , or punishment , but simply information .
a girl of about the same age  a farmer 's daughter , we <name> suppose  under the influence of a dutiful <name> to aid her mother in preparing the table for breakfast , attempts to <name> across the room a pitcher of milk which is too full , and she <unk> a portion of it upon the floor .
the intention good .
[ illustration : the intention good . ]
the mother , forgetting the good intention which prompted the act , and thinking only of the inconvenience which it occasions her , <unk> at once a sharp rebuke .
the cause of the trouble was , simply , that the child was not old enough to understand the laws of momentum and of oscillation that affect the condition of a fluid when subjected to movements more or less irregular .
she has had no theoretical instruction on the subject , and is too young to have acquired the necessary knowledge practically , by experience or observation .
it is so with a very large portion of the accidents which befall children .
they arise not from any evil design , nor even any thing that can properly be called carelessness , on their part , but simply from the immaturity of their knowledge in respect to the properties and qualities of the material objects with which they have to deal .
it is true that children may be , and often , doubtless , are , in fault for these accidents .
the boy may have been warned by his father not to attempt to bore with his <unk> , or the girl forbidden to attempt to <name> the <unk> .
the fault , however , would be , even in these cases , in the disobedience , and not in the damage that accidentally resulted from it .
and it would be far more reasonable and proper to <unk> and punish the fault when no evil followed than when a damage was the result ; for in the latter case the damage itself acts , ordinarily , as a more than sufficient punishment .
misfortunes <unk> men .
these cases are exactly analogous to a large class of accidents and calamities that happen among men .
a <unk> sails from port at a time when there are causes existing in the condition of the atmosphere , and in the agencies in readiness to act upon it , that must certainly , in a few hours , result in a violent storm .
he is consequently caught in the <name> , and his <unk> and upper rigging are carried away .
the owners do not censure him for the loss which they incur , if they are only assured that the <unk> knowledge at the captain 's command at the time of leaving port was not such as to give him warning of the danger ; and provided , also , that his knowledge was as advanced as could reasonably be expected from the opportunities which he had enjoyed .
but we are very much inclined to hold children responsible for as much knowledge of the sources of danger around them as we ourselves , with all our experience , have been able to acquire , and are accustomed to condemn and sometimes even to punish them , for want of this knowledge .
indeed , in many cases , both with children and with men , the means of knowledge in respect to the danger may be fully within reach , and yet the situation may be so novel , and the combination of circumstances so peculiar , that the connection between the causes and the possible evil effects does not occur to the minds of the persons engaged .
an accident which has just occurred at the time of this present writing <name> illustrate this .
a company of workmen constructing a tunnel for a railway , when they had reached the distance of some miles from the entrance , prepared a number of charges for blasting the rock , and accidentally laid the wires connected with the powder in too close proximity to the temporary <unk> already laid in the tunnel .
the charges were intended to be fired from an electric battery provided for the purpose ; but a <unk> came up , and the electric force from it was conveyed by the rails into the tunnel and exploded the charges , and several men were killed .
no one was inclined to censure the unfortunate men for carelessness in not guarding against a contingency so utterly unforeseen by them , though it is plain that , as is often said to children in precisely analogous cases , they might have known .
children 's <unk>  spelling .
there is , perhaps , no department of the management of children in which they incur more <unk> censure , and even punishment , and are treated with so little consideration for faults arising solely from the immaturity of their minds , than in the direction of what may be called school studies .
few people have any proper appreciation of the enormous difficulties which a child has to encounter in learning to read and spell .
how many parents become discouraged , and manifest their discouragement and dissatisfaction to the child in <unk> and complaints , at what they consider his slow progress in learning to spell  forgetting that in the english language there are in common , every-day use eight or ten thousand words , almost all of which are to be learned separately , by a bare and cheerless toil of committing to memory , with comparatively little definite help from the sound .
we have ourselves become so accustomed to seeing the word bear , for example , when denoting the animal , spelt b e a r , that we are very prone to imagine that there is something naturally appropriate in those letters and in that <unk> of them , to represent that sound when used to denote that idea .
but what is there in the nature and power of the letters to aid the child in perceiving  or , when told , in remembering  whether , when referring to the animal , he is to write bear , or bare , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , as in where .
so with the word <unk> it seems to us the most natural thing in the world to spell it y o u .
and when the little pupil , judging by the sound , writes it y u , we <unk> him by our ridicule , as if he had done something in itself absurd .
but how is he to know , except by the hardest , most meaningless , and distasteful toil of the memory , whether he is to write you , or <name> , or <unk> ,  or <unk> , or yew , or <unk> , as in <unk> , or even yo as in do , and to determine when and in what cases respectively he is to use those different forms ?
the truth is , that each elementary sound that enters into the composition of words is represented in our language by so many different combinations of letters , in different cases , that the child has very little clue from the sound of a syllable to guide him in the spelling of it .
we ourselves , from long habit , have become so accustomed to what we call the right spelling  which , of course , means nothing more than the customary one  that we are apt to imagine , as has already been said , that there is some natural fitness in it ; and a mode of representing the same sound , which in one case seems natural and proper , in another appears ludicrous and absurd .
we smile to see laugh spelled <unk> ,  just as we should to see scarf spelled <unk> , or <unk> , as in half ; and we forget that this perception of apparent <unk> is entirely the result of long habit in us , and has no natural foundation , and that children can not be sensible of it , or have any idea of it whatever .
they learn , in learning to talk , what sound serves as the name by which the drops of water that they find upon the grass in the morning is denoted , but they can have no clue whatever to guide them in determining which of the various modes by which precisely that sound is represented in different words , as dew , do , due , du , <unk> , and <unk> , is to be employed in this case , and they become involved in hopeless perplexity if they attempt to imagine " how it ought to be spelled ; " and we think them stupid because they can not extricate themselves from the difficulty on our calling upon them to " think ! "
no doubt there is a reason for the particular mode of spelling each particular word in the language  but that reason is hidden in the past history of the word and in facts connected with its origin and derivation from some barbarous or dead language , and is as utterly beyond the reach of each generation of <unk> as if there were no such reasons in existence .
there can not be the slightest help in any way from the exercise of the thinking or the reasoning powers .
it is true that the variety of the modes by which a given sound may be represented is not so great in all words as it is in these examples , though with respect to a vast number of the words in common use the above are fair specimens .
they were not specially selected , but were taken almost at random .
and there are very few words in the language the sound of which might not be represented by several different modes .
take , for example , the three last words of the last sentence , which , as the words were written without any thought of using them for this purpose , may be considered , perhaps , as a fair specimen of words taken actually at random .
the sound of the word several might be expressed in perfect accordance with the usage of english spelling , as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and in many other different modes .
the combinations <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and many others , would as well represent the sound of the second word as the usual mode .
and so with modes , which , according to the analogy of the language , might as well be expressed by <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , or even <unk> , as in rhodes .
an exceptionally precise speaker might doubtless make some slight difference in the sounds indicated by the different modes of representing the same syllable as given above ; but to the ordinary appreciation of childhood the distinction in sound between such combinations , for example , as a n t in constant and e n t in different would not be perceptible .
now , when we consider the obvious fact that the child has to learn mechanically , without any principles whatever to guide him in discovering which , out of the many different forms , equally probable , judging simply from analogy , by which the sound of the word is to be expressed , is the right one ; and considering how small a portion of his time each day is or can be devoted to this work , and that the number of words in common use , all of which he is expected to know how to spell correctly by the time that he is twelve or fifteen years of age , is probably ten or twelve thousand ( there are in webster 's dictionary considerably over a hundred thousand ) ; when we take these considerations into account , it would seem that a parent , on finding that a letter written by his daughter , twelve or fourteen years of age , has all but three or four words spelled right , ought to be pleased and satisfied , and to express his satisfaction for the encouragement of the <unk> , instead of appearing to think only of the few words that are wrong , and disheartening and discouraging the child by attempts to make her ashamed of her spelling .
the case is substantially the same with the enormous difficulties to be encountered in learning to read and to write .
the names of the letters , as the child <unk> them individually , give very little clue to the sound that is to be given to the word formed by them .
thus , the letters h i t , as the child <unk> them individually  <unk> , eye , <unk>  would naturally spell to him some such word as <unk> , not hit at all .
and as for the labor and difficulty of writing , a mother who is impatient at the slow progress of her children in the attainment of the <name> would be aided very much in obtaining a just idea of the difficulties which they experience by sitting upon a chair and at a table both much too high for her , and trying to copy chinese characters by means of a <unk> , and with her left hand  the work to be closely inspected every day by a stern chinaman of whom she stands in awe , and all the minutest deviations from the copy pointed out to her attention with an air of dissatisfaction and <unk> !
effect of ridicule .
there is , perhaps , no one cause which exerts a greater influence in chilling the interest that children naturally feel in the acquisition of knowledge , than the depression and discouragement which result from having their mistakes and errors  for a large portion of which they are in no sense to blame  made subjects of censure or ridicule .
the effect is still more decided in the case of girls than in that of boys , the gentler sex being naturally so much more sensitive .
i have found in many cases , especially in respect to girls who are far enough advanced to have had a tolerably full experience of the usual influences of schools , that the fear of making mistakes , and of being " thought stupid , " has had more effect in <unk> and retarding progress , by <unk> the natural ardor of the pupil , and destroying all alacrity and courage in the efforts to advance , than all other causes combined .
stupidity .
how ungenerous , and even cruel , it is to reproach or ridicule a child for stupidity , is evident when we reflect that any supposed inferiority in his mental organization can not , by any possibility , be his fault .
the question what degree of natural intelligence he shall be endowed with , in comparison with other children , is determined , not by himself , but by his creator , and depends , probably , upon conditions of organization in his cerebral system as much beyond his control as any thing abnormal in the features of his face , or blindness , or <unk> , or any other physical disadvantage .
the child who shows any indications of inferiority to others in any of these respects should be the object of his parent 's or his teacher 's special tenderness and care .
if he is <unk> , give him , at school , a seat as convenient as possible to the <unk> or the map .
if he is hard of hearing , place him near the teacher ; and for reasons precisely analogous , if you suspect him to be of inferior capacity , help him gently and tenderly in every possible way .
do every thing in your power to encourage him , and to conceal his deficiencies both from others and from himself , so far as these objects can be attained consistently with the general good of the family or of the school .
and , at all events , let those who have in any way the charge of children keep the distinction well defined in their minds between the faults which result from evil intentions , or deliberate and <unk> neglect of known duty , and those which , whatever the inconvenience they may occasion , are in part or in whole the results of mental or physical immaturity .
in all our dealings , whether with plants , or animals , or with the human soul , we ought , in our training , to act very gently in respect to all that <unk> to the embryo condition .
chapter xiv .
the activity of children .
in order rightly to understand the true nature of that extraordinary activity which is so noticeable in all children that are in a state of health , so as to be able to deal with it on the right principles and in a proper manner , it is necessary to turn our attention somewhat carefully to certain scientific truths in respect to the nature and action of force in general which are now abundantly established , and which throw great light on the true character of that peculiar form of it which is so characteristic of childhood , and is , indeed , so abundantly developed by the vital functions of almost all young animals .
one of the fundamental principles of this system of scientific truth is that which is called the persistence of force .
the persistence of force .
by the persistence of force is meant the principle  one now established with so much certainty as to command the assent of every thinking man who examines the subject  that in the ordinary course of nature no force is either ever originated or ever destroyed , but only changed in form .
in other words , that all existing forces are but the continuation or prolongation of other forces preceding them , either of the same or other forms , but precisely equivalent in amount ; and that no force can terminate its action in any other way than by being <unk> into some other force , either of the same or of some other form ; but still , again , precisely equivalent in amount .
it was formerly believed that a force might under certain circumstances be originated  created , as it were  and hence the attempts to contrive machines for perpetual motion  that is , machines for the production of force .
this idea is now wholly renounced by all well-informed men as utterly impossible in the nature of things .
all that human mechanism can do is to provide modes for using advantageously a force previously existing , without the possibility of either increasing or diminishing it .
no existing force can be destroyed .
the only changes possible are changes of direction , changes in the relation of intensity to quantity , and changes of form .
the cases in which a force is apparently increased or diminished , as well as those in which it seems to disappear , are all found , on examination , to be <unk> .
for example , the apparent increase of a man 's power by the use of a lever is really no increase at all .
it is true that , by pressing upon the outer arm with his own weight , he can cause the much greater weight of the stone to rise ; but then it <name> rise only a very little way in comparison with the distance through which his own weight descends .
his own weight must , in fact , descend through a distance as much greater than that by which the stone ascends , as the weight of the stone is greater than his weight .
in other words , so far as the balance of the forces is concerned , the whole amount of the downward motion consists of the smaller weight descending through a greater distance , which <name> be equal to the whole amount of that of the larger one ascending through a smaller distance ; and , to produce a preponderance , the whole amount of the downward force must be somewhat greater .
thus the lever only gathers or <unk> force , as it were , but does not at all increase it .
it is so with all the other contrivances for managing force for the accomplishment of particular purposes .
none of them , increase the force , but only alter its form and character , with a view to its better adaptation to the purpose in view .
nor can any force be extinguished .
when a bullet strikes against a solid wall , the force of its movement , which seems to disappear , is not lost ; it is converted into heat  the temperature of both the bullet and of that part of the wall on which it <unk> being raised by the concussion .
and it is found that the amount of the heat which is thus produced is always in exact proportion to the quantity of mechanical motion which is stopped ; this quantity depending on the weight of the bullet , and on the velocity with which it was moving .
and it has been ascertained , moreover , by the most careful , patient , and many times repeated experiments and calculations , that the quantity of this heat is exactly the same with that which , through the medium of steam , or by any other mode of applying it , may be made to produce the same quantity of mechanical motion that was extinguished in the bullet .
thus the force was not destroyed , but only converted into another form .
and if we should follow out the natural effects of this heat into which the motion of the bullet was transferred , we should find it <unk> the air around the place of concussion , and thus lifting the whole mass of the atmosphere above it , and producing currents of the nature of wind , and through these producing other effects , thus going on forever ; the force changing its form , but neither increasing or diminishing its quantity through a series of changes without end .
the arrest and temporary reservation of force .
now , although it is thus impossible that any force should be destroyed , or in any way cease to exist in one form without setting in action a precisely equal amount in some other form , it may , as it were , pass into a condition of restraint , and remain thus suspended and latent for an indefinite period  ready , however , to break into action again the moment that the restraint is removed .
thus a perfectly elastic spring may be bent by a certain force , and retained in the bent position a long time .
but the moment that it is released it <name> <unk> itself , exercising in so doing precisely the degree of force expended in bending it .
in the same manner air may be compressed in an <unk> , and held thus , with the force , as it were , imprisoned , for any length of time , until at last , when the <unk> is released by the trigger , the elastic force comes into action , exercising in its action a power precisely the same as that with which it was compressed .
force or power may be thus , as it were , stored up in a countless variety of ways , and reserved for future action ; and , when finally released , the whole amount may be set free at once , so as to expend itself in a single impulse , as in case of the arrow or the bullet ; or it may be partially restrained , so as to expend itself gradually , as in the case of a clock or watch .
in either case the total amount expended <name> be precisely the same  namely , the exact equivalent of that which was placed in store .
vegetable and animal life .
there are a vast number of mechanical contrivances in use among men for thus putting force in store , as it were , and then using it more or less gradually , as may be required .
and nature , moreover , does this on a scale so stupendous as to render all human contrivances for this purpose utterly insignificant in comparison .
the great agent which nature employs in this work is vegetation .
indeed , it may truly be said that the great function of vegetable life , in all the infinitude of forms and characters which it assumes , is to receive and store up force derived from the <unk> of the sun .
animal life , on the other hand , exists and <unk> its functions by the expenditure of this force .
animals receive vegetable productions containing these reserves of force into their systems , which systems contain arrangements for <unk> the force , and employing it for the purposes it is intended to <unk> in the animal economy .
the manner in which these processes are performed is in general terms as follows : the vegetable absorbs from the earth and from the air substances existing in their natural condition  that is , united according to their strongest affinities .
these substances are chiefly water , containing various mineral salts in solution , from the ground , and carbonic acid from the air .
these substances , after undergoing certain changes in the vessels of the plant , are exposed to the influence of the rays of the sun in the leaves .
by the power of these rays  including the <unk> , the luminous , and the <unk>  the natural affinities by which the above-mentioned substances were united are overcome , and they are formed into new combinations , in which they are united by very weak affinities .
of course , they have a strong tendency to break away from the new unions , and fall back into the old .
but , by some mysterious and incomprehensible means , the sun has power to lock them , so to speak , in their new forms , so as to require a special condition of things for the releasing of them .
thus they form a reserve of force , which can be held in restraint until the conditions required for their release are realized .
the process can be illustrated more particularly by a single case .
water , one of the substances absorbed by plants , is composed of oxygen and hydrogen , which are united by an affinity of prodigious force .
it is the same with carbon and oxygen , in a compound called carbonic acid , which is also one of the principal substances absorbed by plants from the air .
now the heat and other <unk> from the sun , acting upon these substances in the leaves , forces the hydrogen and the carbon away from their strong bond of union with oxygen , and sets the oxygen free , and then combines the carbon and hydrogen into a sort of unwilling union with each other  a union from which they are always ready and eager to break away , that they may return to their union with the object of their former and much stronger attachment  namely , oxygen ; though they are so locked , by some mysterious means , that they can not break away except when certain conditions necessary to their release are realized .
<unk> .
the substances thus formed by a weak union of carbon with hydrogen are called <unk> .
they <unk> nearly all the highly <unk> vegetable substances .
their being combustible means simply that they have a great disposition to resume their union with oxygen  combustion being nothing other than a more or less violent return of a substance to a union with oxygen or some other such substance , usually one from which it had formerly been separated by force  giving out again by its return , in the form of heat , the force by which the original separation had been effected .
a compound formed thus of substances united by very weak affinities , so that they are always ready to separate from each other and form new unions under the influence of stronger affinities , is said to be in a state of unstable <unk> it is the function of vegetable life to create these unstable combinations by means of the force derived from the sun ; and the combinations , when formed , of course hold the force which formed them in reserve , ready to make itself manifest whenever it is released .
animals receive these substances into their systems in their food .
a portion of them they retain , <unk> the <unk> in some cases so as to form new compounds , but still unstable .
these they use in constructing the tissues of the animal system , and some they reserve for future use .
as fast as they require the heat and the force which are stored in them they expend , them , thus recovering the force which was absorbed in the formation of them , and which now , on being released , <unk> in the three forms of animal heat , muscular motion , and cerebral or nervous energy .
there are other modes besides the processes of animal life by which the reserved force laid up by the vegetable process in these unstable compounds may be released .
in many cases it <unk> itself under ordinary exposures to the oxygen of the atmosphere .
a log of wood  which is composed chiefly of carbon and hydrogen in an unstable union  lying upon the ground <name> gradually decay , as we term it  that is , its elements <name> separate from each other , and form new unions with the elements of the surrounding air , thus returning to their normal condition .
they give out , in so doing , a low degree of heat , which , being protracted through a course of years , makes up , in the end , the precise equivalent of that expended by the sun in forming the wood  that is , the power expended in the formation of the wood is all released in the dissolution of it .
this process may be greatly accelerated by heat .
if a portion of the wood is raised in temperature to a certain point , the elements begin to combine with the oxygen near , with so much violence as to release the reserved power with great rapidity .
and as this force <unk> in the form of heat , the next portions of the wood are at once raised to the right temperature to allow the process of <unk> to go on rapidly with them .
this is the process of combustion .
observations and experiments on decaying wood have been made , showing that the amount of heat developed by the combustion of a mass of wood , though much more intense for a time , is the same in amount as that which is set free by the slower process of <unk> by gradual decay ; both being the equivalent of the amount absorbed by the leaves from the sun , in the process of <unk> the carbon and hydrogen when the wood was formed .
the force imprisoned in these unstable compounds may be held in reserve for an unlimited period , so long as all opportunity is denied them of returning the elements that compose them to their original combinations .
such a case occurs when large beds of vegetable substances are buried under layers of sediment which subsequently become stone , and thus shut the <unk> compounds beneath them from all access to oxygen .
the beds of coal thus formed retain their reserved force for periods of immense duration ; and when at length the material thus protected is brought to the surface , and made to give up its treasured power , it <unk> its efficiency in driving machinery , propelling trains , heating furnaces , or <unk> warmth and comfort around the family fireside .
in all these cases the heat and power developed from the coal is heat and power derived originally from the sun , and now set free , after having lain dormant thousands and perhaps millions of years .
this simple case of the formation of <unk> from the elements furnished by carbonic acid and water is only adduced as an illustration of the general principle .
the modes by which the power of the sun actually takes effect in the decomposition of stable compounds , and the formation of unstable ones from the elements thus obtained , are innumerable , and the processes as well as the combinations that result are extremely complicated .
these processes include not only the first formation of the unstable compounds in the leaf , but also an endless series of modifications and <unk> which they subsequently undergo , as well in the other organs of the plant as in those of the animal when they are finally introduced into an animal system .
in all , however , the general result is substantially the same  namely , the forcing of elements into unnatural combinations , so to speak , by the power of the sun acting through the instrumentality of vegetation , in order that they may subsequently , in the animal system , give out that power again by the effort they make to release themselves from the coercion imposed upon them , and to return to the natural unions in which they can find again stability and repose .
one of the chief elements employed in the formation of these <unk> substances is nitrogen  its compounds being designated as nitrogenous substances , and noted , as a class , for the facility with which they are decomposed .
nitrogen is , in fact , the great <unk> of nature .
young students in chemistry , when they learn that nitrogen is distinguished by the weakness of its affinities for other elements , and its consequent great <unk> as a chemical agent , are often astonished to find that its compounds  such as nitric acid , nitre , which gives its explosive character to gunpowder , <unk> , <unk> , and various other explosive substances which it helps to form  are among the most remarkable in nature for the violence and intensity of their action , and for the extent to which the principle of vitality avails itself of them as magazines of force , upon which to draw in the fulfillment of its various functions .
186 gentle measures .
but this is really just what should be expected .
it is the very weakness of the hold which nitrogen maintains upon the elements combined with it that <unk> their release , and affords them the opportunity to seize with so much avidity and violence on those for which they have a strong attraction .
it is as if a huntsman should conduct a pack of ferocious dogs into a field occupied by a flock of sheep , quietly grazing , holding the dogs securely by very strong <unk> .
the quiet and repose of the field might not be seriously disturbed ; but if , on the other hand , a child comes in , leading the dogs by threads which they can easily <unk> , a scene of the greatest violence and confusion would ensue .
in the same manner , when nitrogen , holding the particles of oxygen with which it is combined in the compounds above named by a very feeble control , brings them into the presence of other substances for which they have a very strong affinity , they release themselves at once from their weak <unk> , and rush into the combinations which their nature demands with so much avidity as to produce <unk> , <unk> , and explosions of the most violent character .
the force which the elements display in these <unk> is always  and this is one aspect of the great discovery of modern times in respect to the persistence or constancy of force which has already been referred to  precisely the same in amount as that which was required for <unk> them from their original combinations with such substances at some previous time .
the processes of vegetation are the chief means employed for effecting the original <unk> , by the power of the sun , and for forming the unstable compounds by which this power is held in reserve .
the animal system , on the other hand , takes in these compounds , <unk> them so far as is required to adapt them to its structure , <unk> them , and then , as occasion requires <unk> , it <unk> the concealed force , which then <unk> itself in the forms of animal heat , of muscular motion , and of cerebral and nervous power .
in what way , and to what extent , the knowledge of these truths should influence us in the management and training of children in respect to their extraordinary activity , is the question we have next to consider .
practical applications of these principles .
if we watch a bird for a little while hopping along upon the ground , and up and down between the ground and the branches of a tree , we shall at first be surprised at his incessant activity , and next , if we reflect a little , at the utter <unk> and uselessness of it .
he runs a little way along the path ; then he hops up upon a twig , then down again upon the ground ; then " makes believe " peck at something which he imagines or pretends that he sees in the grass ; then , <unk> his head to one side and upward , the branch of a tree there happens to strike his eye , upon which he at once flies up to it .
<unk> himself upon it for the moment , he utters a burst of joyous song , and then , instantly afterwards , down he comes upon the ground again , runs along , stops , runs along a little farther , stops again , looks around him a moment , as if wondering what to do next , and then flies off out of our field of view .
if we could follow , and had <name> to watch him so long , we should find him continuing this incessantly changing but <unk> activity all the day long .
we sometimes imagine that the bird 's movements are to be explained by supposing that he is engaged in the search for food in these evolutions .
but when we reflect how small a quantity of food his little crop <name> contain , we shall be at once convinced that a large proportion of his apparent pecking for food is only make-believe , and that he moves thus incessantly not so much on account of the end he seeks to attain by it , as on account of the very pleasure of the motion .
he hops about and <unk> , not for the love of any thing he expects to find , but just for the love of hopping and pecking .
the real explanation is that the food which he has taken is delivering up , within his system , the force stored in it that was received originally from the beams of the sun , while the plant which produced it was growing .
this force must have an outlet , and it finds this outlet in the incessant activity of the bird 's muscles and <name> .
the various objects which attract his attention without , invite the force to expend itself in certain special directions ; but the impelling cause is within , and not without ; and were there nothing without to serve as objects for its action , the necessity of its action would be none the less imperious .
the lion , when imprisoned in his cage , walks to and fro continuously , if there is room for him to take two steps and turn ; and if there is not room for this , he moves his head incessantly from side to side .
the force within him , which his vital organs are setting at <name> from its imprisonment in his food , must in some way find issue .
mothers do not often stop to speculate upon , and may even , perhaps , seldom observe the restless and incessant activity of birds , but that of their children forces itself upon their attention by its effects in disturbing their own quiet avocations and pleasures ; and they often wonder what can be the inducement which leads to such a perpetual succession of movements made apparently without motive or end .
and , not perceiving any possible inducement to account for it , they are apt to consider this restless activity so <unk> and unreasonable as to make it a fault for which the child is to be <unk> or punished , or which they are to attempt to cure by means of artificial restraints .
they would not attempt such <unk> as this if they were aware that all this muscular and mental energy of action in the child is only the outward manifestation of an inward force developed in a manner wholly independent of its <name>  a force , too , which must spend itself in some way or other , and that , if not allowed to do this in its own way , by impelling the limbs and members to outward action , it <name> do so by destroying the delicate mechanism within .
we see this in the case of men who are doomed for long periods to solitary confinement .
the force derived from their food , and released within their systems by the vital processes , being cut off by the silence and solitude of the dungeon from all usual and natural <unk> , begins to work mischief within , by <unk> the cerebral and other vital organs , and producing insanity and death .
common mistake .
we make a great mistake when we imagine that children are influenced in their activity mainly by a <name> for the objects which they attain by it .
it is not the ends attained , but the pleasurable feeling which the action of the internal force , issuing by its natural channels , affords them , and the sense of power which accompanies the action .
an end which presents itself to be attained invites this force to act in one direction rather than another , but it is the action , and not the end , in which the charm resides .
give a child a bow and arrow , and send him out into the yard to try it , and if he does not happen to see any thing to shoot at , he <name> shoot at random into the air .
but if there is any object which <name> serve as a <name> in sight , it seems to have the effect of drawing his aim towards it .
he shoots at the vane on the barn , at an apple on a tree , a knot in a fence  any thing which <name> serve the purpose of a <name> .
this is not because he has any end to accomplish in hitting the vane , the apple , or the knot , but only because there is an impulse within him leading him to shoot , and if there happens to be any thing to shoot at , it gives that impulse a direction .
it is precisely the same with the incessant muscular activity of a child .
he comes into a room and sits down in the first seat that he sees .
then he jumps up and runs to another , then to another , until he has tried all the seats in the room .
this is not because he particularly wishes to try the seats .
he wishes to move , and the seats happen to be at hand , and they simply give direction to the impulse .
if he were out of doors , the same office would be fulfilled by a fence which he might climb over , instead of going through an open gate close by ; or a wall that he could walk upon with difficulty , instead of going , without difficulty , along a path at the foot of it ; or a pole which he could try to climb , when there was no motive for climbing it but a <name> to make muscular exertion ; or a steep bank where he can scramble up , when there is nothing that he wishes for on the top of it .
in other words , the things that children do are not done for the sake of the things , but for the sake of the doing .
parents very often do not understand this , and are accordingly continually asking such foolish questions as , " <name> , what do you wish to climb over that fence for , when there is a gate all open close by ? "
" <name> , what good do you expect to get by climbing up that tree , when you know there is nothing on it , not even a bird 's nest ? "
and , " <name> , what makes you keep jumping up all the time and running about to different places ?
why can't you , when you get a good seat , sit still in it ? "
the children , if they understood the philosophy of the case , might answer , " we do n't climb over the fence at all because we wish to be on the other side of it ; or scramble up the bank for the sake of any thing that is on the top of it ; or run about to different places because we wish to be in the places particularly .
it is the internal force that is in us working itself off , and it works itself off in the ways that come most readily to hand . "
various modes in which the reserved force reappears .
the force thus stored in the food and liberated within the system by the vital processes , finds scope for action in several different ways , prominent among which are , first , in the production of animal heat ; secondly , in muscular <unk> and the motions of the limbs and members resulting from them ; and thirdly , in mental phenomena connected with the action of the <name> and the nerves .
this last branch of the subject is yet enveloped in great mystery ; but the proof seems to be decisive that the nervous system of man <unk> organs which are actively exercised in the performance of mental operations , and that in this exercise they consume important portions of the vital force .
if , for example , a child is actually engaged at play , and we direct him to take a seat and sit still , he <name> find it very difficult to do so .
the inward force <name> soon begin to struggle within him to find an issue .
but if , while he is so sitting , we begin to relate to him some very surprising or exciting story , to occupy his mind , he <name> become motionless , and very likely remain so until the story is ended .
it is supposed that in such cases the force is drawn off , so to speak , through the cerebral organs which it is employed in keeping in play , as the instruments by which the emotions and ideas which the story awakens in the mind are evolved .
this part of the subject , as has already been remarked , is full of mystery ; but the general fact that a portion of the force derived from the food is expended in actions of the <name> and nervous system seems well established .
indeed , the whole subject of the reception and the storing up of force from the sun by the processes of vegetable and animal life , and the subsequent liberation of it in the fulfillment of the various functions of the animal system , is full of difficulties and mysteries .
it is only a very simple view of the general principle which is presented in these articles .
in nature the operations are not simple at all .
they are involved in endless complications which are yet only to a very limited extent <unk> .
the general principle is , however , well established ; and if understood , even as a general principle , by parents and teachers , it <name> greatly modify their action in dealing with the incessant restlessness and activity of the young .
it <name> teach them , among other things , the following practical rules : practical rules .
1 .
never find fault with children for their incapacity to keep still .
you may stop the supply of force , if you <name> , by refusing to give them food ; but if you continue the supply , you must not complain of its manifesting itself in action .
after giving your boy his breakfast , to find fault with him for being incessantly in motion when his system has absorbed it , is simply to find fault with him for being healthy and happy .
to give children food and then to restrain the resulting activity , is conduct very analogous to that of the engineer who should lock the action of his engine , turn all the <unk> , and shut down the <unk> , while he still went on all the time putting in coal under the boiler .
the least that he could expect would be a great hissing and <unk> at all the joints of his machine ; and it would be only by means of such a degree of <unk> in the joints as would allow of the escape of the imprisoned force in this way that could prevent the repression ending in a frightful catastrophe .
now , nine-tenths of the whispering and playing of children in school , and of the noise , the rudeness , and the petty mischief of children at home , is just this hissing and <unk> of an imprisoned power , and nothing more .
in a word , we must favor and promote , by every means in our power , the activity of children , not censure and repress it .
we may endeavor to turn it aside from wrong channels  that is , to prevent its manifesting itself in ways injurious to them or annoying to others .
we must not , however , attempt to divert it from these channels by <unk> it up , but by opening other channels that <name> draw it away in better directions .

in encouraging the activity of children , and in guiding the direction of it in their hours of play , we must not expect to make it available for useful results , other than that of promoting their own physical development and health .
at least , we can do this only in a very limited degree .
almost all useful results require for their attainment a long continuance of efforts of the same kind  that is , expenditure of the vital force by the continued action of the same organs .
now , it is a principle of nature that while the organs of an animal system are in process of formation and growth , they can exercise their power only for a very brief period at a time without exhaustion .
this <unk> on the part of all young animals incessant changes of action , or alternations of action and repose .
a farmer of forty years of age , whose organs are well developed and mature , <name> chop wood all day without excessive fatigue .
then , when he comes home at night , he <name> sit for three hours in the evening upon the settle by his fireside , thinking  his mind occupied , perhaps , upon the details of the management of his farm , or upon his plans for the following day .
the vital force thus <unk> itself for many successive hours through his muscles , and then , while his muscles are at rest , it finds its egress for several other hours through the <name> .
but in the child the mode of action must change every few minutes .
he is made tired with five minutes ' labor .
he is satisfied with five minutes ' rest .
he <name> ride his <unk> , if alone , a short time , and then he comes to you to ask you to tell him a story .
while listening to the story , his muscles are resting , and the force is spending its strength in working the mechanism of the <name> .
if you make your story too long , the <name> , in turn , becomes fatigued , and he feels instinctively impelled to divert the vital force again into muscular action .
if , instead of being alone with his <unk> , he has company there , he <name> seem to continue his bodily effort a long time ; but he does not really do so , for he stops continually , to talk with his companion , thus allowing his muscles to rest for a brief period , during which the vital force <unk> its strength in carrying on trains of thought and emotion through the <name> .
he is not to be blamed for this seeming <unk> .
these frequent changes in the mode of action are a necessity , and this necessity evidently <unk> him for any kind of monotonous or continued exertion  the only kind which , in ordinary cases , can be made <unk> to any useful results .
3 .
parents at home and teachers at school must recognize these physiological laws , relating to the action of the young , and make their plans and arrangements conform to them .
the periods of confinement to any one mode of action in the very young , and especially mental action , must be short ; and they must alternate frequently with other modes .
that rapid succession of bodily movements and of mental ideas , and the emotions mingling and alternating with them , which constitutes what children call play , must be regarded not simply as an indulgence , but as a necessity for them .
the play must be considered as essential as the study , and that not merely for the very young but for all , up to the age of maturity .
for older pupils , in the best institutions of the country , some suitable provision is made for this want ; but the mothers of young children at home are often at a loss by what means to effect this purpose , and many are very imperfectly aware of the <unk> , and even the necessity , of doing this .
as for the means of accomplishing the object  that is , providing channels for the complete expenditure of this force in the safest and most agreeable manner for the child , and the least inconvenient and troublesome for others , much must depend upon the tact , the ingenuity , and the discretion of the mother .
it <name> , however , be a great point gained for her when she once fully <unk> that the tendency to incessant activity , and even to <unk> and noise , on the part of her child , only shows that he is all right in his vital machinery , and that this exuberance of energy is something to be pleased with and directed , not denounced and restrained .
chapter xv .
the imagination in children .
the reader may , perhaps , recollect that in the last chapter there was an intimation that a portion of the force which was produced , or rather liberated and brought into action , by the consumption of food in the vital system , expended itself in the development of thoughts , emotions , and other forms of mental action , through the organization of the <name> and of the nerves .
expenditure of force through the <unk> the whole subject of the expenditure of material force in maintaining those forms of mental action which are carried on through the medium of bodily organs , it must be admitted , is involved in great obscurity ; for it is only a glimmering of light which science has yet been able to throw into this field .
it is , however , becoming the settled opinion , among all well-informed persons , that the soul , during the time of its connection with a material system in this life , performs many of those functions which we class as mental , through the medium , or instrumentality , in some mysterious way , of material organs , just as we all know is the case with the sensations  that is , the impressions made through the organs of sense ; and that the maintaining of these mental organs , so to speak , in action , involves a certain expenditure of some form of physical force , the source of this force being in the food that is consumed in the nourishment of the body .
there is certainly no apparent reason why there should be any <unk> presumption against the supposition that the soul performs the act of remembering or of conceiving an imaginary scene through the instrumentality of a bodily organ , more than that it should receive a sensation of light or of sound through such a channel .
the question of the independent existence and the <unk> of the thinking and feeling principle , which takes cognizance of these thoughts and sensations , is not at all affected by any inquiries into the nature of the instrumentality by means of which , in a particular stage of its existence , it performs these functions .
phenomena explained by this principle .
this truth , if it be indeed a truth , throws great light on what would be otherwise quite inexplicable in the playful activity of the mental faculties of children .
the curious <unk> , imaginings , and <unk>  the pleasure of listening to marvellous and impossible tales , and of hearing odd and <unk> words or combination of words  the love of acting , and of disguises  of the <unk> of inanimate objects  of seeing things as they are not , and of creating and giving reality to what has no existence except in their own minds  are all the <unk> and <unk> , so to speak , of the embryo faculties just becoming conscious of their existence , and affording , like the muscles of motion , so many different issues for the internal force derived from the food .
thus the action of the mind of a child , in holding an imaginary conversation with a doll , or in inventing or in relating an impossible <name> story , or in converting a switch on which he pretends to be riding into a prancing horse , is precisely analogous to that of the muscles of the lamb , or the calf , or any other young animal in its <unk>  that is , it is the result of the force which the vital functions are continually developing within the system , and which flows and must flow continually out through whatever channels are open to it ; and in thus flowing , sets all the various systems of machinery into play , each in its own appropriate manner .
in any other view of the subject than this , many of the phenomena of childhood would be still more wonderful and inexplicable than they are .
one would have supposed , for example , that the imagination  being , as is commonly thought , one of the most exalted and refined of the mental faculties of man  would be one of the latest , in the order of time , to manifest itself in the development of the mind ; instead of which it is , in fact , one of the earliest .
children live , in a great measure , from the earliest age in an ideal world  their pains and their pleasures , their joys and their fears being , to a vast extent , the <unk> of <unk> and illusions having often the slightest bond of connection with the realities around them .
the realities themselves , moreover , often have far greater influence over them by what they suggest than by what they are .
indeed , the younger the child is , within reasonable limits , the more susceptible he seems to be to the power of the imagination , and the more easily his mind and heart are reached and influenced through this avenue .
at a very early period the realities of actual existence and the <unk> of the mind seem <unk> mingled , and it is only after much experience and a considerable development of his powers , that the line of distinction between them becomes defined .
the power of investing an elongated bag of bran with the attributes and qualities of a thinking being , so as to make it an object of solicitude and affection , which would seem to imply a high exercise of one of the most refined and exalted of the human faculties , does not come , as we might have expected , at the end of a long period of progress and development , but springs into existence , as it were , at once , in the very earliest years .
the progress and development are required to enable the child to perceive that the rude and shapeless doll is not a living and lovable thing .
this mingling of the real and imaginary worlds shows itself to the close observer in a thousand curious ways .
the true explanation of the phenomenon seems to be that the various embryo faculties are brought into action by the vital force at first in a very irregular , intermingled , and capricious manner , just as the muscles are in the endless and <unk> play of the limbs and members .
they develop themselves and grow by this very action , and we ought not only to indulge , but to <name> the action in all its beautiful manifestations by every means in our power .
these mental organs , so to speak  that is , the organs of the <name> , through which , while its connection with the body continues , the mind performs its mental functions  grow and thrive , as the muscles do , by being reasonably kept in exercise .
it is evident , from these facts , that the parent should be pleased with , and should encourage the exercise of these embryo powers in his children ; and both father and mother may be greatly aided in their efforts to devise means for reaching and influencing their hearts by means of them , and especially through the action of the imagination , which <name> be found , when properly employed , to be capable of exercising an almost magical power of <unk> great attractiveness and giving great effect to lessons of instruction which , in their simple form , would be dull , tiresome , and <unk> .
precisely what is meant by this <name> be shown more clearly by some examples .
methods exemplified .
one of the simplest and easiest modes by which a mother can avail herself of the vivid imagination of the child in amusing and entertaining him , is by holding conversations with representations of persons , or even of animals , in the pictures which she shows him .
thus , in the case , for example , of a picture which she is showing to her child sitting in her lap  the picture containing , we <name> suppose , a representation of a little girl with books under her arm  she may say , " my little girl , where are you going ?  i am going " ( speaking now in a somewhat altered voice , to represent the voice of the little girl ) " to <unk>  ah !
you are going to school .
you do n't look quite old enough to go to school .
who sits next to you at school ?  <name> <unk>  <name> <name> ?
is he a good boy ?  yes , he 's a very good <unk>  i am glad you have a good boy , and one that is kind to you , to sit by you .
that must be very pleasant . "
and so on , as long as the child is interested in listening .
or , " what is your name , my little girl ?  my name is <unk>  that 's a pretty name !
and where do you live ?  i live in that house under the <unk>  ah !
i see the house .
and where is your room in that house ?  my room is the one where you see the window <unk>  i see it .
what have you got in your room ?  i have a bed , and a table by the window ; and i keep my doll there .
i have got a cradle for my doll , and a little trunk to keep her clothes in .
and i have got  " the mother may go on in this way , and describe a great number and variety of objects in the room , such as are calculated to interest and please the little listener .
it is the pleasurable exercise of some dawning faculty or faculties acting through embryo organs of the <name> , by which the mind can picture to itself , more or less vividly , unreal scenes , which is the source of the enjoyment in such cases as this .
a child may be still more interested , perhaps , by imaginary conversations of this kind with pictures of animals , and by varying the form of them in such a way as to call a new set of mental faculties into play ; as , for example , " here is a picture of a squirrel .
i 'll ask him where he lives .
<unk> !
<name> !
stop a minute ; i want to speak to you .
i want you to tell me where you <unk>  i live in my <unk>  where is your hole ?  it is under that big log that you see back in the woods . '
yes " ( speaking now to the child ) , " i see the log .
do you see it ?
touch it with your finger .
yes , that must be it .
but i do n't see any hole .
<unk> ' ( assuming now the tone of speaking again to the squirrel ) , 'i do n't see your <unk>  no , i did not mean that any body should see it .
i made it in a hidden place in the ground , so as to have it out of <unk>  i wish i could see it , and i wish more that i could look down into it and see what is there .
what is there in your hole , <name> ?  my nest is there , and my little <unk>  how many little <unk> have you got ? ' "
 and so on , to any extent that you <name> .
it is obvious that conversations of this kind may be made the means of conveying , indirectly , a great deal of instruction to young children on a great variety of subjects ; and lessons of duty may be inculcated thus in a very effective manner , and by a method which is at the same time easy and agreeable for the mother , and extremely attractive to the child .
this may seem a very simple thing , and it is really very simple ; but any mother who has never resorted to this method of amusing and instructing her child <name> be surprised to find what an easy and inexhaustible resource for her it may become .
children are always coming to ask for stories , and the mother often has no story at hand , and her mind is too much preoccupied to invent one .
here is a ready resort in every such emergency .
" very well , " replies the mother to such a request , " i 'll tell you a story ; but i must have a picture to my story .
find me a picture in some book . "
the child brings a picture , no matter what .
there is no possible picture that <name> not suggest to a person possessed of ordinary ingenuity an endless number of talks to interest and amuse the child .
to take an extreme case , suppose the picture is a rude pencil drawing of a post , and nothing besides .
you can imagine a boy hidden behind the post , and you can call to him , and finally obtain an answer from him , and have a long talk with him about his play and who he is hiding from , and what other way he has of playing with his friend .
or you can talk with the post directly .
ask him where he came from , who put him in the ground , and what he was put in the ground for , and what kind of a tree he was when he was a part of a tree growing in the woods ; and , following the subject out , the conversation may be the means of not only amusing the child for the moment , but also of gratifying his curiosity , and <unk> a great amount of useful information to him which <name> materially aid in the development of his powers .
or you may ask the post whether he has any relatives , and he may reply that he has a great many cousins .
he has some cousins that live in the city , and they are called <unk> , and their business is to hold lamps to light people along the streets ; and he has some other cousins who stand in a long row and hold up the telegraph-wire to <name> messages from one part of the world to another ; and so on without end .
if all this may done by means of a rude representation of a simple post , it may easily be seen that no picture which the child can possibly bring can fail to serve as a subject for such conversations .
some mothers may , perhaps , think it must require a great deal of ingenuity and skill to <name> out these ideas effectively in practice , and that is true ; or rather , it is true that there is in it scope for the exercise of a great deal of ingenuity and skill , and even of genius , for those who possess these qualities ; but the degree of ingenuity required for a commencement in this method is very small , and that necessary for complete success in it is very easily acquired .
<unk> of inanimate objects .
it <name> at once occur to the mother that any inanimate object may be <unk> in this way and addressed as a living and intelligent being .
your child is sick , i <name> suppose , and is somewhat feverish and fretful .
in adjusting his dress you prick him a little with a pin , and the pain and annoyance acting on his morbid <unk> bring out expressions of irritation and <unk> .
now you may , if you please , tell him that he must not be so impatient , that you did not mean to hurt him , that he must not mind a little prick , and the like , and you <name> meet with the ordinary success that attends such <unk> .
or , in the spirit of the foregoing suggestions , you may say , " did the pin prick you ?
i 'll catch the little rogue , and hear what he has to say for himself .
ah , here he is  i 've caught him !
i 'll hold him fast .
lie still in my lap , and we <name> hear what he has to say .
" 'look up here , my little <unk> , and tell me what your name <unk>  my name is <unk>  ah , your name is pin , is it ?
how bright you are !
how came you to be so bright ?  oh , they brightened me when they made me.  indeed !
and how did they make you ?  they made me in a <unk>  in a machine ?
that 's very curious !
how did they make you in the machine ?
tell us all about it !  they made me out of wire .
first the machine cut off a piece of the wire long enough to make me , and then i was carried around to different parts of the machine to have different things done to me .
i went first to one part to get straightened .
do n't you see how straight i am ?  yes , you are very straight <unk>  then i went to another part of the machine and had my head put on ; and then i went to another part and had my point sharpened ; and then i was polished , and covered all over with a beautiful <unk> , to make me bright and white . ' "
and so on indefinitely .
the mother may continue the talk as long as the child is interested , by letting the pin give an account of the various adventures that happened to it in the course of its life , and finally call it to account for pricking a poor little sick child .
any mother can judge whether such a mode of treating the case , or the more usual one of gravely <unk> the child to <name> and <unk> , when sick , is likely to be most effectual in soothing the nervous irritation of the little patient , and restoring its mind to a condition of calmness and repose .
the mother who reads these suggestions in a cursory manner , and contents herself with saying that they are very good , but makes no resolute and persevering effort to acquire for herself the ability to avail herself of them , <name> have no idea of the immense practical value of them as a means of aiding her in her work , and in promoting the happiness of her children .
but if she <name> make the attempt , she <name> most certainly find enough encouragement in her first effort to induce her to persevere .
[ illustration : the imaginative faculty . ]
she must , moreover , not only originate , herself , modes of amusing the imagination of her children , but must fall in with and aid those which they originate .
if your little daughter is playing with her doll , look up from your work and say a few words to the doll or the child in a grave and serious manner , assuming that the doll is a living and <unk> being .
if your boy is playing horses in the garden while you are there attending to your flowers , ask him with all gravity what he values his horse at , and whether he wishes to sell him .
ask him whether he ever bites , or breaks out of his pasture ; and give him some advice about not driving him too fast up hill , and not giving him oats when he is warm .
he <name> at once enter into such a conversation in the most serious manner , and the pleasure of his play <name> be greatly increased by your joining with him in maintaining the illusion .
there is a still more important advantage than the temporary increase to your children 's happiness by acting on this principle .
by thus joining with them , even for a few moments , in their play , you establish a closer bond of sympathy between your own heart and theirs , and attach them to you more strongly than you can do by any other means .
indeed , in many cases the most important moral lessons can be conveyed in connection with these illusions of children , and in a way not only more agreeable but far more effective than by any other method .
influence without claim to authority .
acting through the imagination of children  if the <name> of doing so is once understood  <name> prove at once an invaluable and an inexhaustible resource for all those classes of persons who are placed in situations requiring them to exercise an influence over children without having any proper authority over them ; such , for example , as uncles and aunts , older brothers and sisters , and even visitors residing more or less permanently in a family , and desirous , from a wish to do good , of promoting the welfare and the improvement of the younger members of it .
it often happens that such a visitor , without any actual right of authority , acquires a greater influence over the minds of the children than the parents themselves ; and many a mother , who , with all her <unk> and <unk> , and even punishments , can not make herself obeyed , is surprised at the absolute ascendency which some inmate residing in the family acquires over them by means so silent , gentle , and unpretending , that they seem mysterious and almost magical .
" what is the secret of it ? "
asks the mother sometimes in such a case .
" you never punish the children , and you never scold them , and yet they obey you a great deal more readily and certainly than they do me . "
there are a great many different means which may be employed in combination with each other for acquiring this kind of ascendency , and among them the use which may be made of the power of the imagination in the young is one of the most important .
the <unk> of the dolls again .
a young teacher , for example , in returning from school some day , finds the children of the family in which she resides , who have been playing with their dolls in the yard , engaged in some angry dispute .
the first impulse with many persons in such a case might be to sit down with the children upon the seat where they were playing , and remonstrate with them , though in a very kind and gentle manner , on the <unk> and folly of such <unk> , to show them that the thing in question is not worth disputing about , that angry feelings are uncomfortable and unhappy feelings , and that it is , consequently , not only a sin , but a folly to indulge in them .
now such a remonstrance , if given in a kind and gentle manner , <name> undoubtedly do good .
the children <name> be somewhat less likely to become involved in such a dispute immediately after it than before , and in process of time , and through many repetitions of such counsels , the fault may be gradually cured .
still , at the time , it <name> make the children uncomfortable , by producing in their minds a certain degree of irritation .
they <name> be very apt to listen in silence , and with a morose and sullen air ; and if they do not call the admonition a scolding , on account of the kind and gentle tones in which it is delivered , they <name> be very apt to consider it much in that light .
suppose , however , that , instead of dealing with the case in this matter-of-fact and naked way , the teacher calls the imagination of the children to her aid , and <unk> her admonition and reproof indirectly , through the dolls .
she takes the dolls in her hand , asks their names , and <unk> which of the two girls is the mother of each .
the dolls ' names are <name> and <unk> , and the mothers ' are <name> and <name> .
" but i might have asked <unk> herself , " she adds ; and , so saying , she holds the doll before her , and enters into a long imaginary conversation with her , more or less spirited and original , according to the talent and ingenuity of the young <name> , but , in any conceivable case , enough so to completely absorb the attention of the children and fully to occupy their minds .
she asks each of them her name , and <unk> of each which of the girls is her mother , and makes first one of them , and then the other , point to her mother in giving her answer .
by this time the illusion is completely established in the children 's minds of regarding their dolls as living beings , responsible to mothers for their conduct and behavior ; and the young <name> can go on and give her <unk> and instructions in respect to the sin and folly of quarrelling to them  the children listening .
and it <name> be found that by this management the impression upon the minds of the children <name> be far greater and more effective than if the counsels were addressed directly to them ; while , at the same time , though they may even take the form of very severe reproof , they <name> produce no <unk> or vexation in the minds of those for whom they are really intended .
indeed , the very reason why the admonition thus given <name> be so much more effective is the fact that it does not tend in any degree to awaken resentment and vexation , but associates the lesson which the teacher wishes to convey with amusement and pleasure .
" you are very pretty "  she says , we <name> suppose , addressing the dolls  " and you look very amiable .
i suppose you are very amiable . "
then , turning to the children , she asks , in a confidential undertone , " do they ever get into disputes and quarrels ? "
" sometimes ,  " says one of the children , entering at once into the idea of the teacher .
" ah ! "
the teacher exclaims , turning again to the dolls .
" i hear that you dispute and quarrel sometimes , and i am very sorry for it .
that is very foolish .
it is only silly little children that we expect <name> dispute and quarrel .
i should not have supposed it possible in the case of such young ladies as you .
it is a great deal better to be yielding and kind .
if one of you says something that the other thinks is not true , let it pass without contradiction ; it is foolish to dispute about it .
and so if one has any thing that the other wants , it is generally much better to wait for it than to quarrel .
it is hateful to quarrel .
besides , it spoils your beauty .
when children are quarrelling they look like little furies . "
the teacher may go on in this way , and give a long moral lecture to the dolls in a tone of mock gravity , and the children <name> listen to it with the most profound attention ; and it <name> have a far greater influence upon them than the same <unk> addressed directly to them .
so effectually , in fact , <name> this element of play in the transaction open their hearts to the reception of good counsel , that even direct <unk> to them <name> be admitted with it , if the same guise is maintained ; for the teacher may add , in conclusion , addressing now the children themselves with the same mock solemnity : " that is a very bad fault of your children  very bad , indeed .
and it is one that you <name> find very hard to correct .
you must give them a great deal of good counsel on the subject , and , above all , you must be careful to set them a good example yourselves .
children always imitate what they see in their mothers , whether it is good or bad .
if you are always amiable and kind to one another , they <name> be so too . "
the thoughtful mother , in following out the suggestions here given , <name> see at once how the interest which the children take in their dolls , and the sense of reality which they feel in respect to all their dealings with them , opens before her a boundless field in respect to modes of reaching and influencing their minds and hearts .
the ball itself made to teach <unk> .
there is literally no end to the modes by which persons having the charge of young children can avail themselves of their vivid imaginative powers in <unk> moral lessons or influencing their conduct .
a boy , we <name> suppose , has a new ball .
just as he is going out to play with it his father takes it from him to examine it , and , after turning it round and looking at it attentively on every side , holds it up to his ear .
the boy asks what his father is doing .
" i am listening to hear what he says . "
" and what does he say , father ? "
" he says that you wo n't have him to play with long . "
" why not ? "
" i <name> ask him , why not ? "
( holding the ball again to his ear ) .
" what does he say , father ? "
" he says he is going to run away from you and hide .
he says you <name> go to play near some building , and he means , when you throw him or knock him , to fly against the windows and break the glass , and then people <name> take your ball away from you . "
" but i wo n't play near any windows . "
" he says , at any rate you <name> play near some building , and when you knock him he means to fly up to the roof and get behind a chimney , or roll down into the gutter where you ca n't get him . "
" but , father , i am not going to play near any building at all . "
" then you <name> play in some place where there are holes in the ground , or thickets of bushes near , where he can hide . "
" no , father , i mean to look well over the ground , and not play in any place where there is any danger at all . "
" well , we shall see ; but the little rogue is determined to hide somewhere . "
the boy takes his ball and goes out to play with it , far more effectually cautioned than he could have been by any direct admonition .
the teacher and the tough logs a teacher who was engaged in a district school in the country , where the arrangement was for the older boys to saw and split the wood for the fire , on coming one day , at the recess , to see how the work was going on , found that the boys had laid one rather <unk> log aside .
they could not split that log , they said .
" yes , " said the teacher , looking at the log , " i do n't wonder .
i know that log .
i saw him before .
his name is old <unk> .
he says he has no idea of coming open for a parcel of boys , even if they have got beetle and wedges .
it takes a man , he says , to split him . "
the boys stood looking at the log with a very grave expression of countenance as they heard these words .
" is that what he says ? "
asked one of them .
" let 's try him again , <name> . "
" it <name> do no good , " said the teacher , " for he wo n't come open , if he can possibly help it .
and there's another fellow ( pointing ) .
his name is <unk> .
if you get a crack in him , you <name> find him full of twisted splinters that he holds himself together with .
the only way is to cut them through with a sharp axe .
but he holds on so tight with them that i don't believe you can get him open .
he says he never gives up to boys . "
so saying , the teacher went away .
it is scarcely necessary to say to any one who knows boys that the teacher was called out not long afterwards to see that old <unk> and old <unk> were both split up fine  the boys standing around the heaps of <unk> <unk> which they had afforded , and regarding them with an air of exultation and triumph .
muscles <unk> through the action of the mind .
an older sister has been taking a walk , with little <name> , four years old , as her companion .
on their return , when within half a mile of home , <name> , tired of gathering flowers and chasing butterflies , comes to his sister , with a fatigued and languid air , and says he can not walk any farther , and wants to be carried .
" i ca n't <name> you very well , " she says , " but i <name> tell you what we <name> do ; we <name> stop at the first tavern we come to and rest .
do you see that large flat stone out there at the turn of the road ?
that is the tavern , and you shall be my courier .
a courier is a man that goes forward as fast as he can on his horse , and tells the <unk> that the traveller is coming , and orders supper .
so you may gallop on as fast as you can go , and , when you get to the tavern , tell the <unk> that the <name> is coming  i am the <name>  and that he must get ready an excellent supper . "
the boy <name> gallop on and wait at the stone .
when his sister arrives she may sit and rest with him a moment , entertaining him by imagining conversations with the <unk> , and then resume their walk .
" now , " she may say , " i must send my courier to the post-office with a letter .
do you see that fence away forward ?
that fence is the post-office .
we <name> play that one of the cracks between the boards is the <unk> .
take this letter ( handing him any little scrap of paper which she has taken from her pocket and folded to represent a letter ) and put it in the <unk> , and speak to the postmaster through the crack , and tell him to send the letter as soon as he can . "
under such management as this , unless the child 's exhaustion is very great , his sense of it <name> disappear , and he <name> accomplish the walk not only without any more complaining , but with a great feeling of pleasure .
the nature of the action in such a case seems to be that the vital force , when , in its direct and ordinary passage to the muscles through the nerves , it has exhausted the resources of that mode of transmission , receives in some mysterious way a <unk> to its strength in passing round , by a new channel , through the organs of intelligence and imagination .
these trivial instances are only given as examples to show how infinitely varied are the applications which may be made of this principle of appealing to the imagination of children , and what a variety of effects may be produced through its instrumentality by a parent or teacher who once takes pains to make himself possessed of it .
but each one must make himself possessed of it by his own practice and experience .
no general instructions can do any thing more than to offer the suggestion , and to show how a beginning is to be made .

truth and falsehood .
the duty of telling the truth seems to us , until we have devoted special consideration to the subject , the most simple thing in the world , both to understand and to perform ; and when we find young children disregarding it we are surprised and shocked , and often imagine that it indicates something peculiar and abnormal in the moral sense of the offender .
a little reflection , however , <name> show us how very different the state of the case really is .
what do we mean by the obligation resting upon us to tell the truth ?
it is simply , in general terms , that it is our duty to make our statements correspond with the realities which they purport to express .
this is , no doubt , our duty , as a general rule , but there are so many exceptions to this rule , and the principles on which the <unk> of the exceptions depend are so complicated and so abstruse , that it is wonderful that children learn to make the necessary distinctions as soon as they do .
natural guidance to the duty of telling the truth .
the child , when he first acquires the <name> of using and understanding language , is filled with wonder and pleasure to find that he can represent external objects that he observes , and also ideas passing through his mind , by means of sounds formed by his organs of speech .
such sounds , he finds , have both these powers  that is , they can represent realities or fancies .
thus , when he utters the sounds i see a bird , they may denote either a mere <name> in his mind , or an outward <unk> .
how is he possibly to know , by any instinct , or intuition , or moral sense when it is right for him to use them as representations of a mere idea , and when it is wrong for him to use them , unless they correspond with some actual reality ?
the fact that vivid images or conceptions may be awakened in his mind by the mere hearing of certain sounds made by himself or another is something strange and wonderful to him ; and though he comes to his consciousness of this susceptibility by degrees , it is still , while he is acquiring it , and extending the scope and range of it , a source of continual pleasure to him .
the necessity of any correspondence of these words , and of the images which they excite , with actual realities , is a necessity which arises from the relations of man to man in the social state , and he has no means whatever of knowing any thing about it except by instruction .
there is not only no ground for expecting that children should perceive any such necessity either by any kind of instinct , or intuition , or embryo moral sense , or by any reasoning process of which his incipient powers are capable ; but even if he should by either of these means be inclined to entertain such an idea , his mind would soon be utterly confused in regard to it by what he observes constantly taking place around him in respect to the use of language by others whose conduct , much more than their precepts , he is accustomed to follow as his guide .
a very nice distinction .
a mother , for example , takes her little son , four or five years old , into her lap to amuse him with a story .
she begins : " when i was a little boy i lived by myself .
all the bread and cheese i got i laid upon the shelf , " and so on to the end .
the mother 's object is accomplished .
the boy is amused .
he is greatly interested and pleased by the wonderful phenomenon taking place within him of curious images awakened in his mind by means of sounds entering his ear  images of a little boy living alone , of his reaching up to put bread and cheese upon a shelf , and finally of his attempting to wheel a little wife home  the story ending with the breaking and downfall of the wheelbarrow , wife and all .
he does not reflect philosophically upon the subject , but the principal element of the pleasure afforded him is the wonderful phenomenon of the formation of such vivid and strange images in his mind by means of the mere sound of his mother 's voice .
he knows at once , if any <unk> reflections arise in his mind at all , that what his mother has told him is not true  that is , that the words and images which they awaken in his mind had no actual realities corresponding with them .
he knows , in the first place , that his mother never was a boy , and does not suppose that she ever lived by herself , and laid up her bread and cheese upon a shelf .
the whole story , he understands , if he exercises any thought about it whatever  wheelbarrow catastrophe and all  consists only of words which his mother speaks to him to give him pleasure .
by-and-by his mother gives him a piece of cake , and he goes out into the garden to play .
his sister is there and asks him to give her a piece of his cake .
he hesitates .
he thinks of the request long enough to form a distinct image in his mind of giving her half of it , but finally concludes not to do so , and eats it all himself .
when at length he comes in , his mother accidentally asks him some question about the cake , and he says he gave half of it to his sister .
his mother seems much pleased .
he knew that she would be pleased .
he said it , in fact , on purpose to please her .
the words represented no actual reality , but only a thought passing through his mind , and he spoke , in a certain sense , for the purpose of giving his mother pleasure .
the case corresponds in all these particulars with that of his mother 's statement in respect to her being once a little boy and living by herself .
those words were spoken by her to give him pleasure , and he said what he did to give her pleasure .
to give her pleasure !
the reader <name> perhaps say , with some surprise , thinking that to assign such a motive as that is not , by any means , putting a fair and proper construction upon the boy 's act .
his design was , it <name> be said , to shield himself from censure , or to procure <unk> praise .
and it is , no doubt , true that , on a nice analysis of the motives of the act , such as we , in our maturity , can easily make , we shall find that design obscurely mingled with them .
but the child does not analyze .
he can not .
he does not look forward to ultimate ends , or look for the hidden springs that lie concealed among the complicated combinations of impulses which animate him .
in the case that we are supposing , all that we can reasonably believe to be present to his mind is a kind of instinctive feeling that for him to say that he ate the cake all himself would bring a frown , or at least a look of pain and distress , to his mother 's face , and perhaps words of displeasure for him ; while , if he says that he gave half to his sister , she <name> look pleased and happy .
this is as far as he sees .
and he may be of such an age , and his mental organs may be in so embryonic a condition , that it is as far as he ought to be expected to look ; so that , as the case presents itself to his mind in respect to the impulse which at the moment <unk> him to act , he said what he did from a <name> to give his mother pleasure , and not pain .
as to the secret motive , which might have been his ultimate end , that lay too deeply concealed for him to be conscious of it .
and we ourselves too often act from the influence of hidden impulses of selfishness , the existence of which we are wholly unconscious of , to judge him too harshly for his blindness .
at length , by-and-by , when his sister <unk> in , and the untruth is discovered , the boy is astonished and bewildered by being called to account in a very solemn manner by his mother on account of the awful wickedness of having told a lie !
how the child sees it .
now i am very ready to admit that , notwithstanding the apparent resemblance between these two cases , this resemblance is only apparent and superficial ; but the question is , whether it is not sufficient to cause such a child to confound them , and to be excusable , until he has been enlightened by appropriate instruction , for not clearly distinguishing the cases where words must be held strictly to conform to actual realities , from those where it is perfectly right and proper that they should only represent images or conceptions of the mind .
a father , playing with his children , says , " now i am a bear , and am going to growl . "
so he growls .
then he says , " now i am a dog , and am going to bark . "
he is not a bear , and he is not a dog , and the children know it .
his words , therefore , even to the apprehension of the children , express an untruth , in the sense that they do not correspond with any actual reality .
it is not a <unk> untruth .
the children understand perfectly well that in such a case as this it is not in any sense wrong to say what is not true .
but how are they to know what kind of <unk> are right , and what kind are wrong , until they are taught what the distinction is and upon what it depends .
unfortunately many parents confuse the ideas , or rather the moral sense of their children , in a much more vital manner by <unk> of a different kind from this  as , for example , when a mother , in the presence of her children , expresses a feeling of vexation and annoyance at seeing a certain visitor coming to make a call , and then , when the visitor enters the room , receives her with pretended pleasure , and says , out of politeness , that she is very glad to see her .
sometimes a father <name> join with his children , when peculiar circumstances seem , as he thinks , to require it , in concealing something from their mother , or deceiving her in regard to it by <unk> or positive <unk> .
sometimes even the mother <name> do this in reference to the father .
of course such management as this must necessarily have the effect of bringing up the children to the idea that deceiving by <unk> is a justifiable resort in certain cases  a doctrine which , though entertained by many well-meaning persons , strikes a fatal blow at all confidence in the veracity of men ; for whenever we know of any persons that they entertain this idea , it is never afterwards safe to trust in what they say , since we never can know that the case in hand is not , for some reason unknown to us , one of those which justify a resort to falsehood .
but to return to the case of the children that are under the training of parents who <name> not themselves , under any circumstances , <unk> their word  that is , <name> never utter words that do not represent actual reality in any of the <unk> ways .
such children can not be expected to know of themselves , or to learn without instruction , what the <unk> ways are , and they never do learn until they have made many failures .
many , it is true , learn when they are very young .
many evince a remarkable tenderness of conscience in respect to this as well as to all their other duties , so fast as they are taught them .
and some become so faithful and scrupulous in respect to truth , at so early an age , that their parents quite forget the progressive steps by which they advanced at the beginning .
we find many a mother who <name> say of her boy that he never told an untruth , but we do not find any man who <name> say of himself , that when he was a boy he never told one .
imaginings and <unk> easily mistaken for each other .
but besides the complicated character of the general subject , as it presents itself to the minds of children  that is , the intricacy to them of the question when there must be a strict correspondence between the words spoken and an actual reality , and when they may rightly represent mere images or fancies of the mind  there is another great difficulty in their way , one that is very little considered and often , indeed , not at all understood by parents  and that is , that in the earliest years the distinction between realities and mere fancies of the mind is very indistinctly drawn .
even in our minds the two things are often confounded .
we often have to pause and think in order to decide whether a mental perception of which we are conscious is a remembrance of a reality , or a revival of some image formed at some previous time , perhaps remote , by a vivid description which we have read or heard , or even by our own fancy .
" is that really so , or did i dream it ? "
how often is such a question heard .
and persons have been known to certify honestly , in courts of justice , to facts which they think they personally witnessed , but which were really pictured in their minds in other ways .
the picture was so distinct and vivid that they lost , in time , the power of distinguishing it from other and , perhaps , similar pictures which had been made by their witnessing the corresponding realities .
indeed , instead of being surprised that these different <unk> of present mental images are sometimes confounded , it is actually wonderful that they can generally be so clearly distinguished ; and we can not explain , even to ourselves , what the difference is by which we do distinguish them .
for example , we can call up to our minds the picture of a house burning and a fireman going up by a ladder to rescue some person appearing at the window .
now the image , in such a case , may have had several different modes of origin .
1 .
we may have actually witnessed such a scene the evening before .
2 .
some one may have given us a vivid description of it .
3 .
we may have fancied it in writing a tale , and 4 .
we may have dreamed it .
here are four different prototypes of a picture which is now renewed , and there is something in the present copy which enables us , in most cases , to determine at once what the real prototype was .
that is , there is something in the picture which now arises in our mind as a renewal or repetition of the picture made the day before , which makes us immediately cognizant of the cause of the original picture  that is , whether it came from a reality that we witnessed , or from a verbal or written description by another person , or whether it was a fanciful creation of our own mind while awake , or a dream .
and it is extremely difficult for us to discover precisely what it is , in the present mental picture , which gives us this information in respect to the origin of its prototype .
it is very easy to say , " oh , we remember . "
but remember is only a word .
we can only mean by it , in such a case as this , that there is some latent difference between the several images made upon our minds to-day of things seen , heard of , fancied , or dreamed yesterday , by which we distinguish each from all the others .
but the most acute <unk>  men who are accustomed to the closest scrutiny of the movements and the mode of action of their minds  find it very difficult to discover what this difference is .
the result in the case of children .
now , in the case of young children , the faculties of perception and consciousness and the power of recognizing the distinguishing characteristics of the different perceptions and sensations of their minds are all immature , and distinctions which even to mature minds are not so clear but that they are often confounded , for them form a bewildering maze .
their minds are occupied with a mingled and blended though beautiful combination of sensations , conceptions , fancies , and remembrances , which they do not attempt to separate from each other , and their vocal organs are animated by a constant impulse to exercise themselves with any utterances which the incessant and playful <unk> of their faculties frame .
in other words , the vital force liberated by the digestion of the food seeks an issue now in this way and now in that , through every variety of mental and bodily action .
of course , to arrange and <unk> these actions , to establish the true relations between all these various faculties and powers , and to regulate the obligations and duties by which the exercise of them should be limited and controlled , is a work of time , and is to be effected , not by the operation of any instinct or early intuition , but by a course of development  effected mainly by the progress of growth and experience , though it is to be aided and guided by <unk> but gentle training and instruction .
if these views are correct , we can safely draw from them the following conclusions .
practical conclusions .
1 .
we must not expect from children that they <name> from the beginning understand and feel the obligation to speak the truth , any more than we look for a recognition , on their part , of the various other principles of duty which arise from the relations of man to man in the social state .
we do not expect that two babies creeping upon the floor towards the same plaything should each feel instinctively impelled to <name> the other the use of it half of the time .
children must be taught to tell the truth , just as they must be taught the principles of justice and equal rights .
they generally get taught by experience  that is , by the rough treatment and hard knocks which they bring upon themselves by their violation of these principles .
but the faithful parent can aid them in acquiring the necessary knowledge in a far easier and more agreeable manner by appropriate instruction .
2 .
the mother must not be distressed or too much troubled when she finds that her children , while very young are prone to fall into deviations from the truth , but only to be made to feel more impressed with the necessity of renewing her own efforts to teach them the duty , and to train them to the performance of it .
3 .
she must not be too stern or severe in punishing the deviations from truth in very young children , or in expressing the displeasure which they awaken in her mind .
it is instruction , not expressions of anger or vindictive punishment , that is required in most cases .
explain to them the evils that would result if we could not believe what people say , and tell them stories of <unk> children on the one hand , and of false and deceitful children on the other .
and , above all , notice , with indications of approval and pleasure , when the child speaks the truth under circumstances which might have tempted him to deviate from it .
one instance of this kind , in which you show that you observe and are pleased by his truthfulness , <name> do more to awaken in his heart a genuine love for the truth than ten <unk> , or even punishments , incurred by the violation of it .
and in the same spirit we must make use of the religious considerations which are appropriate to this subject  that is , we must encourage the child with the approval of his heavenly father , when he <unk> the temptation to deviate from the truth , instead of frightening him , when he falls , by terrible denunciations of the anger of god against liars ; denunciations which , however <unk> in the cases to which they are intended to apply , are not designed for children in whose minds the necessary <unk> , as pointed out in this chapter , are yet scarcely formed .
danger of <unk> <unk> and falsehood .
4 .
do not confound the <unk> of <unk> by acts with falsehood by words , by telling the child , when he resorts to any artifice or deception in order to gain his ends , that it is as bad to deceive as to lie .
it is not as bad , by any means .
there is a marked line of distinction to be drawn between <unk> one 's word and all other forms of deception , for there is such a sacredness in the spoken word , that the violation of it is in general far more reprehensible than the attempt to accomplish the same end by mere action .
if a man has lost a leg , it may be perfectly right for him to wear a wooden one which is so perfectly made as to deceive people  and even to wear it , too , with the intent to deceive people by leading them to suppose that both his legs are genuine  while it would be wrong ; for him to assert in words that this limb was not an artificial one .
it is right to put a chalk egg in a hen 's nest to deceive the hen , when , if the hen could understand language , and if we were to suppose hens " to have any rights that we are bound to respect , " it would be wrong to tell her that it was a real egg .
it would be right for a person , when his house was entered by a robber at night , to point an empty gun at the robber to frighten him away by leading him to think that the gun was loaded ; but it would be wrong , as i think  though i am aware that many persons would think differently  for him to say in words that the gun was loaded , and that he would fire unless the robber went away .
these cases show that there is a great difference between deceiving by false appearances , which is sometimes right , and doing it by false statements , which , as i think , is always wrong .
there is a special and inviolable sacredness , which every lover of the truth should attach to his spoken word .
5 .
we must not allow the <unk> with which , according to the views here presented , we are to regard the <unk> of truth by young persons , while their mental faculties and their powers of discrimination are yet imperfectly developed , to lead us to lower the standard of right in their minds , so as to allow them to <unk> the idea that we think that falsehood is , after all , no great sin , and still less , to suppose that we consider it sometimes , in extreme cases , <unk> .
we may , indeed , say , " the truth is not to be spoken at all times , " but to make the <unk> complete we must add , that falsehood is to be spoken never .
there is no other possible ground for absolute confidence in the word of any man except the conviction that his principle is , that it is never , under any circumstances , or to accomplish any purpose whatever ,  right for him to <unk> it .
a different opinion , i am aware , prevails very extensively among mankind , and especially among the continental nations of europe , where it seems to be very generally believed that in those cases in which falsehood <name> on the whole be <unk> of greater good than the truth it is <unk> to employ it .
but it is easy to see that , so far as we know that those around us hold to this philosophy , all reasonable ground for confidence in their statements is taken away ; for we never can know , in respect to any statement which they make , that the case is not one of those in which , for reasons not manifest to us , they think it is expedient  that is , <unk> in some way to good  to state what is not true .
while , therefore , we must allow children a reasonable time to bring their minds to a full sense of the obligation of making their words always conform to what is true , instead of shaping them so as best to attain their purposes for the time being  which is the course to which their earliest natural instincts prompt them  and must deal gently and <unk> with their incipient failures , we must do all in our power to bring them forward as fast as possible to the adoption of the very highest standard as their rule of duty in this respect ; <unk> it upon them , by example as well as by precept , that we can not innocently , under any circumstances , to escape any evil , or to gain any end , <unk> our word .
for there is no evil so great , and no end to be attained so valuable , as to justify the adoption of a principle which destroys all foundation for confidence between man and man .
chapter xvii .
judgment and reasoning .
it is a very unreasonable thing for parents to expect young children to be reasonable .
being reasonable in one 's conduct or wishes implies the taking into account of those bearings and relations of an act which are more remote and less obvious , in <unk> from being governed exclusively by those which are immediate and near .
now , it is not reasonable to expect children to be influenced by these remote considerations , simply because in them the faculties by which they are brought forward into the mind and invested with the attributes of reality are not yet developed .
these faculties are all in a nascent or formative state , and it is as idle to expect them , while thus immature , to fulfill their functions for any practical purpose , as it would be to expect a baby to expend the strength of its little arms in performing any useful labor .
progress of mental development .
the mother sometimes , when she looks upon her infant lying in her arms , and observes the <unk> with which he seems to gaze upon objects in the room  upon the bright light of the window or of the lamp , or upon the pictures on the wall  wonders what he is thinking of .
the truth probably is that he is not thinking at all ; he is simply seeing  that is to say , the light from external objects is entering his eyes and producing images upon his sensorium , and that is all .
he sees only .
there might have been a similar image of the light in his mind the day before , but the reproduction of the former image which constitutes memory does not probably take place at all in his case if he is very young , so that there is not present to his mind , in connection with the present image , any reproduction of the former one .
still less does he make any mental comparison between the two .
the mother , as she sees the light of to-day , may remember the one of yesterday , and mentally compare the two ; may have many thoughts awakened in her mind by the sensation and the recollection  such as , this is from a new kind of oil , and gives a brighter light than the other ; that she <name> use this kind of oil in all her lamps , and <name> recommend it to her friends , and so on indefinitely .
but the child has none of these thoughts and can have none ; for neither have the faculties been developed within him by which they are conceived , nor has he had the experience of the previous sensations to form the materials for framing them .
he is conscious of the present sensations , and that is all .
as he advances , however , in his experience of sensations , and as his mental powers gradually begin to be unfolded , what may be called thoughts arise , consisting at first , probably , of recollections of past sensations entering into his consciousness in connection with the present ones .
these combinations , and the mental acts of various kinds which are excited by them , multiply as he advances towards maturity ; but the images produced by present realities are infinitely more vivid and have a very much greater power over him than those which memory brings up from the past , or that his fancy can anticipate in the future .
this state of things , though there is , of course , a gradual advancement in the relative influence of what the mind can conceive , as compared with that which the senses make real , continues substantially the same through all the period of childhood and youth .
in other words , the organs of sense and of those mental faculties which are directly occupied with the sensations , are the earliest to be developed , as we might naturally suppose would be the case ; and , by consequence , the sensible properties of objects and the direct and immediate effects of any action , are those which have a controlling influence over the <unk> of the mind during all the earlier periods of its development .
the reason , on the other hand , which , as applied to the practical affairs of life , has for its function the bringing in of the more remote bearings and relations of a fact , or the indirect and less obvious results of an action , is very slowly developed .
it is precisely on this account that the period of immaturity in the human species is so long protracted in comparison with that of the inferior animals .
the lives of these animals are regulated by the cognizance simply of the sensible properties of objects , and by the immediate results of their acts , and they accordingly become mature as soon as their senses and their bodily organs are brought completely into action .
but man , who is to be governed by his reason  that is , by much more far-reaching and comprehensive views of what concerns him  requires a much longer period to fit him for independent action , since he must wait for the development of those higher faculties which are necessary for the attainment of these extended views ; and during this period he must depend upon the reason of his parents instead of being governed by his own .
practical effect of these truths .
the true course , then , for parents to pursue is not to expect too much from the ability of their children to see what is right and proper for them , but to decide all important questions themselves , using their own experience and their own power of foresight as their guide .
they are , indeed , to cultivate and train the reasoning and reflective powers of their children , but are not to expect them in early life to be sufficiently developed and strengthened to bear any heavy strain , or to justify the placing of any serious reliance upon them .
they must , in a word , treat the reason and the judgment of their children as the farmer treats the strength of his colt , which he exercises and , to a certain extent , employs , but never puts upon it any serious burden .
it results from this view of the case that it is not wise for a parent to resort to arguing or reasoning with a child , as a substitute for authority , or even as an aid to make up for a deficiency of authority , in regard to what it is necessary that the child should do .
no doubt it is a good plan sometimes to let the child decide for himself , but when you pretend to allow him to decide let him do it really .
when you go out with him to take a walk , if it is so nearly immaterial which way you go that you are willing that he should determine the question , then lay the case before him , giving him the advantages and disadvantages of the different ways , and let him decide ; and then act according to his decision .
but if you have determined in your own mind which way to go , simply announce your determination ; and if you give reasons at all , do not give them in such a way as to convey the idea to his mind that his obligation to submit is to rest partly on his seeing the force of them .
for every parent <name> find that this principle is a sound one and one of fundamental importance in the successful management of children  namely , that it is much easier for a child to do what he does not like to do as an act of simple submission to superior authority , than for him to bring himself to an accordance with the decision by hearing and considering the reasons .
in other words , it is much easier for him to obey your decision than to bring himself to the same decision against his own <name> .
in serious cases no reliance to be placed on the reason of the child .
in all those cases , therefore , in which the parent can not safely allow the children really to decide , such as the question of going to school , going to church , taking medicine , remaining indoors on account of <unk> or of the weather , making visits , choice of playmates and companions , and a great many others which it would not be safe actually to allow them to decide , it is true kindness to them to spare their minds the painful perplexity of a conflict .
decide for them .
do not say , " oh , i would not do this or that "  whatever it may be  " because "  and then go on to assign reasons thought of perhaps at the moment to meet the emergency , and indeed generally false ; but , " yes , i do n't wonder that you would like to do it .
i should like it if i were you .
but it can not be done . "
when there is medicine to be taken , do not put the child in misery for half an hour while you resort to all sorts of arguments , and perhaps artifices , to bring him to a willingness to take it ; but simply present it to him , saying , " it is something very disagreeable , i know , but it must be taken ; " and if it is refused , allow of no delay , but at once , though without any appearance of displeasure , and in the <unk> possible , force it down .
then , after the excitement of the affair has passed away , and you have your little patient in your lap , and he is in <unk>  this is all , of course , on the supposition that he is not very sick  say to him , " you would not take your medicine a little while ago , and we had to force it down : i <name> it did not hurt you much . "
the child <name> probably make some fretful answer .
[ illustration : story of the horse . ]
" it is not surprising that you did not like to take it .
all children , while they are too young to be reasonable , and all animals , such as horses and cows , when they are sick , are very unwilling to take their medicine , and we often have to force it down .
you <name> , perhaps , refuse to take yours a good many times yet before you are old enough to see that it is a great deal easier to take it willingly than it is to have it forced down . "
and then go on and tell him some amusing story of the difficulty some people had in forcing medicine down the throat of a sick horse , who did not know enough to take it like a man .
the idea is  for this case is only meant as an illustration of a general principle  that the comfort and enjoyment of children , as well as the easy and successful working of parental government , is greatly promoted by deciding for the children at once , and placing their action on the simple ground of obedience to authority in all those cases where the decision can not really and honestly be left to the children themselves .
to listen reluctantly to the persistent arguments of children in favor of their being allowed to do what we are sure that we shall decide in the end that it is not best for them to do , and to meet them with counter arguments which , if they are not actually false , as they are very apt to be in such a case , are utterly powerless , from the incapacity of the children to appreciate them , on account of their being blinded by their wishes , is not to strengthen the reasoning powers , but to confuse and bewilder them , and impede their development .
mode of dealing with the reason of a child .
the effect , however , <name> be excellent of calling into exercise the reason and the judgment of the child in cases where the conclusion which he arrives at can be safely allowed to determine his action .
you can help him in such cases by giving him any information that he desires , but do not embarrass him , and interfere with his exercising his own judgment by <unk> advice .
allow him in this way to lay out his own garden , to plan the course of a walk or a ride , and to decide upon the expenditure of his own <unk> , within certain restrictions in respect to such things as would be dangerous or <unk> to himself , or annoying to others .
as he grows older you can give him the charge of the minor arrangements on a journey , such as taking care of a certain number of the parcels carried in the hand , choosing a seat in the car , selecting and engaging a hand on arriving at the place of destination .
commit such things to his charge only so fast as you can really intrust him with power to act , and then , with slight and not <unk> supervision on your part , leave the responsibility with him , noticing encouragingly whatever of fidelity and success you observe , and taking little notice  generally in fact , none at all  of such errors and failures as result simply from inexperience and immaturity .
in a word , make no attempt to seek support from his judgment , or by convincing his reason , in important cases , where his feelings or wishes are involved , but in all such cases rest your decisions solely upon your own authority .
but then , on the other hand , in unimportant cases , where no serious evil can result whichever of the various possible courses are taken , call his judgment into exercise , and abide by its decisions .
give him the responsibility if he likes to take it , but with the responsibility give him the power .
substantially the same principles as explained above , in their application to the exercise of the judgment , apply to the cultivation of the reasoning powers  that is to say , in the act of arguing , or drawing conclusions from premises .
nothing can be more unprofitable and useless , to say nothing of its irritating and vexatious effect , than maintaining an argument with a child  or with any body else , in fact  to convince him against his <name> .
arguing very soon <unk> , in such a case , into an irritating and utterly useless dispute .
the difference of opinion which gives occasion for such discussions arises generally from the fact that the child sees only certain of the more obvious and immediate relations and bearings of the subject in question , which is , in fact , all that can be reasonably expected of him , and forms his opinion from these alone .
the parent , on the other hand , takes a wider view , and includes among the premises on which his conclusion is founded considerations which have never been brought to the attention of the child .
the proper course , therefore , for him to pursue in order to bring the child 's mind into <name> with his own , is not to ridicule the boy 's reasoning , or chide him for taking so short-sighted a view of the subject , or to tell him it is very foolish for him to talk as he does , or silence him by a <unk> decision , delivered in a dictatorial and overbearing manner , all of which is too often found to characterize the discussions between parents and children , but calmly and quietly to present to him the considerations bearing upon the question which he has not yet seen .
to this end , and to bring the mind of the child into that listening and willing state without which all arguments and even all attempts at instruction are wasted , we must listen candidly to what he says himself , put the best construction upon it , give it its full force ; see it , in a word , as nearly as possible as he sees it , and let him know that we do so .
then he <name> be much more ready to receive any additional considerations which we may present to his mind , as things that must also be taken into account in forming a final judgment on the question .
a boy , for example , who is full of health and increasing vigor , and in whom , of course , those organs on which the consciousness of strength and the impulses of courage depend are in the course of rapid and healthy development , in reading to his mother a story in which a thief that came into a back <unk> of a house in the evening , with a bag , to steal meal , was detected by the owner and frightened away , looks up from his book and says , in a very valiant manner , " if i had been there , and had a gun , i would have shot him on the spot . "
the rough mode of treatment .
now , if the mother wishes to confuse and bewilder , and to crush down , so to speak , the reasoning faculties of her child , she may say , " nonsense , <name> !
it is of no use for you to talk big in that way .
you would not dare to fire a gun in such a case , still less , to shoot a man .
the first thing you would do would be to run away and hide .
and then , besides , it would be very wicked for you to kill a man in that way .
you would be very likely to get yourself <name> for murder .
besides , the bible says that we must not resist evil ; so you should not talk so coolly about shooting a man . "
the poor boy would be overpowered by such a rebuke as this , and perhaps silenced .
the incipient and <unk> ideas in his mind in respect to the right of <unk> , the virtue of courage , the sanctity of life , the nature and the limits of the doctrine of <unk> , would be all thrown together into a jumble of hopeless confusion in his mind , and the only result would be his muttering to himself , after a moment of bewilderment and vexation , " i would shoot him , anyhow . "
such treatment would not only fail to convince him that his idea was wrong , but would effectually close his heart against any such conviction .
the gentle mode of treatment .
but let the mother first see and recognize those bearings and relations of the question which the boy sees  that is , those which are the most direct and immediate  and allow them their full force , and she establishes a sympathy between his mind and hers , and prepares the way for his being led by her to taking into the account other considerations which , though of greater importance , are not so obvious , and which it would be wholly unreasonable to expect that the boy would see himself , since they do not come within the range of observation that could be reached spontaneously by the unaided faculties of such a child .
suppose the mother says , in reply to her boy 's <unk> declaration that he would shoot the robber , " there would be a certain degree of justice in that , no doubt . "
" yes , " <unk> the boy , " it would be no more than he deserved . "
" when a man engages in the commission of a crime , " adds the mother , " he runs the risk of all the perils that he exposes himself to , from the efforts of people to defend their property , and perhaps their lives ; so that , perhaps , he would have no right to complain if people did shoot at him . "
" not a bit of right , " says the boy .
" but then there are some other things to be considered , " says the mother , " which , though they do not show that it would be unjust towards him , might make it bad for us to shoot him . "
" what things ? "
asks the boy .
the mother having candidly admitted whatever there was of truth in the boy 's view of the subject , and thus placed herself , as it were , side by side with him , he is prepared to see and admit what she is going to point out to his observation  not as something directly antagonistic to what he has said , but as something additional , something which is also to be taken into the account .
" in the first place , " continues the mother , " there would be the body to be disposed of , if you were to shoot him .
how should we manage about that ? "
it would make a great difference in such a case in respect to the danger of putting the boy 's mind into a state of antagonism against his mother's presentation of the case , whether she says , " how shall we manage about that ? "
or , " how <name> you manage about that ? "
" oh , " replies the boy , " we would send to where he lives , and let his people come and take him away ; or , if he was in a city , we would call in the police . "
" that would be a good plan , " says his mother .
" we would call in the police , if there were any police at hand .
but then there would be the blood all over the carpet and the floor . "
" there would not be any carpet on the floor in a <unk> , " says the boy .
" true , " replies the mother ; " you are right there ; so that there would not be , after all , any great trouble about the blood .
but the man might not be killed outright , and it might be some time before the policemen would come , and we should see him all that time writhing and struggling in dreadful convulsions , which would fix horrid impressions upon our minds , that would haunt us for a long time afterwards . "
the mother could then go on to explain that , if the man had a wife and children , any one who had killed the husband and father would pity them as long as he lived , and could never see them or hear them spoken of without feeling pain , and even some degree of <unk> ; although , so far as the man himself was concerned , it might be that no injustice had been done .
after the excitement was over , too , he would begin to make excuses for the man , thinking that perhaps he was poor , and his children were suffering for bread , and it was on their account that he was tempted to steal , and this , though it would not justify , might in some degree <unk> the act for which he was slain ; or that he had been badly brought up , having never received any proper instruction , but had been trained and taught from his boyhood to <unk> and steal .
these and many analogous considerations might be presented to the child , going to show that , whatever the rule of strict justice in respect to the criminal may <unk> , it is not right to take the life of a <unk> merely to prevent the commission of a minor offense .
the law of the land recognizes this principle , and does not justify the taking of life except in extreme cases , such as those of imminent personal danger .
a friendly conversation of this kind , carried on , not in a spirit of antagonism to what the boy has said , but in the form of presenting information novel to him in respect to considerations which were to be taken into the account in addition to those which he had himself perceived , <name> have a great effect not only in modifying his opinion in this case , but also in impressing him with the general idea that , before adopting a decisive opinion on any subject , we must take care to acquaint ourselves not merely with the most direct and obvious relations of it , but must look farther into its bearings and results , so that our conclusion may have a solid foundation by reposing upon as many as possible of the considerations which ought really to affect it .
thus , by avoiding all appearance of antagonism , we secure a ready reception for the truths we offer , and cultivate the reasoning powers at the same time .
general principles .
the principles , then , which are meant to be illustrated and enforced in this chapter are these : 1 .
that the mental faculties of children on which the exercise of judgment and of the power of reasoning depend are not among those which are the earliest developed , and they do not attain , in the first years of life , to such a degree of strength or maturity as to justify placing any serious reliance upon them for the conduct of life .
2 .
parents should , accordingly , not put them to any serious test , or impose any heavy burden upon them ; but should rely solely on their own authority , as the expression of their own judgment , and not upon their ability to convince the judgment of the child , in important cases , or in those where its inclinations or its feelings are concerned .
3 .
but they may greatly promote the healthy development of these faculties on the part of their children , by bringing to their view the less obvious bearings and relations of various acts and occurrences on which judgment is to be passed , in cases where their feelings and inclinations are not specially concerned  doing this either in the form of explaining their own parental principles of management , or practically , by <unk> them with responsibility , and giving them a degree of actual power commensurate with it , in cases where it is safe to do so ; and , 4 .
they may enlarge the range of the children 's ideas , and <unk> them to take wider views of the various subjects which occupy their attention , by discussing with them the principles involved in the several cases ; but such discussions must be conducted in a calm , gentle , and considerate manner , the parent looking always upon what the child says in the most favorable light , putting the best construction upon it , and admitting its force , and then presenting such additional views as ought also to be taken into account , with moderate earnestness , and in an unobtrusive manner , thus taking short and easy steps himself in order to accommodate his own rate of progress to the still imperfectly developed <unk> of the child .
in a word , it is with the unfolding of the mental faculties of the young as it is with the development of their muscles and the improvement of their bodily powers ; and just as the way to teach a child to walk is not to drag him along hurriedly and forcibly by the arm faster than he can himself form the necessary steps , but to go slowly , accommodating your movements to those which are natural to him , and encouraging him by letting him perceive that his own efforts produce appreciable and useful results  so , in cultivating any of their thinking and reasoning powers , we must not put at the outset too heavy a burden upon them , but must call them gently into action , within the limits prescribed by the degree of maturity to which they have attained , standing a little aside , as it were , in doing so , and encouraging them to do the work themselves , instead of taking it out of their hands and doing it for them .
chapter xviii .
wishes and requests .
in respect to the course to be pursued in relation to the requests and wishes of children , the following general rules result from the principles inculcated in the chapter on judgment and reasoning , or , at least , are in perfect accordance with them  namely : absolute authority in cases of vital importance .
1 .
in respect to all those questions in the decision of which their permanent and essential welfare are involved , such as those relating to their health , the company they keep , the formation of their characters , the progress of their education , and the like , the parent should establish and maintain in the minds of the children from their earliest years , a distinct understanding that the decision of all such questions is reserved for his own or her own exclusive jurisdiction .
while on any of the details connected with these questions the feelings and wishes of the child ought to be ascertained , and , so far as possible , taken into the account , the course to be pursued should not , in general , be discussed with the child , nor should their objections be replied to in any form .
the parent should simply take such objections as the judge takes the papers in a case which has been tried before him , and reserve his decision .
the principles by which the parent is governed in the course which he pursues , and the reasons for them , may be made the subject of very free conversation , and may be fully explained , provided that care is taken that this is never done when any practical question is pending , such as would give the explanations of the parent the aspect of persuasions , employed to supply the deficiency of authority too weak to enforce obedience to a command .
it is an excellent thing to have children see and appreciate the reasonableness of their parents ' commands , provided that this reasonableness is shown to them in such a way that they are not led to imagine that their being able to see it is in any sense a condition precedent of obedience .
great indulgence in cases not of vital importance .
2 .
the authority of the parent being thus fully established in regard to all those things which , being of paramount importance in respect to the child 's present and future welfare , ought to be regulated by the comparative <unk> wisdom of the parent , with little regard to the evanescent fancies of the child , it is on every account best , in respect to all other things , to allow to the children the largest possible indulgence .
the largest indulgence for them in their occupations , their plays , and even in their caprices and the freaks of their fancy , means freedom of action for their unfolding powers of body and mind ; and freedom of action for these powers means the most rapid and healthy development of them .
the rule is , in a word , that , after all that is essential for their health , the formation of their characters , and their progress in study is secured , by being brought under the dominion of absolute parental authority , in respect to what remains the children are to be indulged and allowed to have their own way as much as possible .
when , in their plays , they come to you for permission to do a particular thing , do not consider whether or not it seems to you that you would like to do it yourself , but only whether there is any real and substantial objection to their doing it .
the hearing to come before the decision , not after it .
the courts of justice adopt what seems to be a very sensible and a very excellent mode of proceeding , though it is exactly the contrary to the one which many parents pursue , and that is , they hear the case first , and decide afterwards .
a great many parents seem to prefer to decide first , and then hear  that is to say , when the children come to them with any request or proposal , they answer at once with a refusal more or less decided , and then allow themselves to be led into a long discussion on the subject , if discussion that may be called which consists chiefly of simple persistence and importunity on one side , and a gradually relaxing resistance on the other , until a reluctant consent is finally obtained .
now , just as it is an excellent way to develop and strengthen the muscles of a child 's arms , for his father to hold the two ends of his cane in his hands while the child <unk> it by the middle , and then for them to pull against each other , about the yard , until , finally , the child is allowed to get the cane away ; so the way to <name> and confirm the habit of " teasing " in children is to maintain a discussion with them for a time in respect to some request which is at first denied , and then finally , after a protracted and gradually weakening resistance , to allow them to gain the victory and <name> their point .
on the other hand , an absolutely certain way of preventing any such habit from being formed , and of effectually breaking it up when it is formed , is the simple process of hearing first , and deciding afterwards .
when , therefore , children come with any request , or express any wish , in cases where no serious interests are involved , in deciding upon the answer to be given , the mother should , in general , simply ask herself , not is it wise ?
<name> they succeed in it ?
<name> they enjoy it ?
would i like to do it if i were they ?  but simply , is there any harm or danger in it ?
if not , readily and cordially consent .
but do not announce your decision till after you have heard all that they have to say , if you intend to hear what they have to say at all .
if there are any objections to what the children propose which affect the question in relation to it as a means of amusement for them , you may state them in the way of information for them , after you have given your consent .
in that way you present the difficulties as subjects for their consideration , and not as objections on your part to their plan .
but , however serious the difficulties may be in the way of the children's accomplishing the object which they have in view , they constitute no objection to their making the attempt , provided that their plans involve no serious harm or damage to themselves , or to any other person or interest .
the wrong way .
two boys , for example , <name> and <name> , who have been playing in the yard with their little sister <name> , come in to their mother with a plan for a <unk> .
they wish for permission to dig a hole in a corner of the yard and fill it with water , and then to get some fish out of the <name> to put into it .
the mother , on hearing the proposal , says at once , without waiting for any explanations , " oh no , i would not do that .
it is a very foolish plan .
you <name> only get yourselves all muddy .
besides , you ca n't catch any fishes to put into it , and if you do , they wo n't live .
and then the grass is so thick that you could not get it up to make your hole . "
but <name> says that they can dig the grass up with their little spades .
they had tried it , and found that they could do so .
and <name> says that they have already tried catching the fishes , and found that they could do it by means of a long-handled dipper ; and <name> says that they <name> all be very careful not to get themselves wet and muddy .
" but you 'll get your feet wet standing on the edge of the <name> , " says the mother .
" you ca n't help it . "
" no , mother , " replies <name> , " there is a large flat stone that we can stand upon , and so keep our feet perfectly dry .
see ! "
so saying , he shows his own feet , which are quite dry .
thus the discussion goes on ; the objections made  being , as usual in such cases , half of them imaginary ones , brought forward only for effect  are one after another disposed of , or at least set aside , until at length the mother , as if beaten off her ground after a contest , gives a reluctant and hesitating consent , and the children go away to commence their work only half pleased , and separated in heart and affection , for the time being , from their mother by not finding in her , as they think , any sympathy with them , or disposition to aid them in their pleasures .
they have , however , by their mother 's management of the case , received an excellent lesson in arguing and teasing .
they have found by it , what they have undoubtedly often found on similar occasions before , that their mother 's first decision is not at all to be taken as a final one ; that they have only to persevere in replying to her objections and answering her arguments , and especially in <unk> in their importunity , and they <name> be pretty sure to gain their end at last .
this mode of management , also , has the effect of fixing the position of their mother in their minds as one of antagonism to them in respect to their childish pleasures .
the right way .
if in such a case as this the mother wishes to avoid these evils , the way is plain .
she must first consider the proposal herself , and come to her own decision in regard to it .
before coming to a decision , she may , if she has leisure and opportunity , make additional inquiries in respect to the details of the plan ; or , if she is otherwise occupied , she may consider them for a moment in her own mind .
if the objections are decisive , she should not state them at the time , unless she specially wishes them not to have a fair hearing ; for when children have a plan in mind which they are eager to <name> out , their very eagerness entirely <unk> them for properly appreciating any objections which may be offered to it .
it is on every account better , therefore  as a general rule  not to offer any such objections at the time , but simply to give your decision .
on the other hand , if there is no serious evil to be apprehended in allowing children to attempt to <name> any particular plan they form into effect , the foolishness of it , in a practical point of view , or even the impossibility of success in accomplishing the object proposed , constitute no valid objection to it ; for children amuse themselves as much , and sometimes learn as much , and promote as effectually the development of their powers and faculties , by their failures as by their successes .
in the case supposed , then , the mother , in order to manage it right , would first consider for a moment whether there was any decisive objection to the plan .
this would depend , perhaps , upon the manner in which the children were dressed at the time , or upon the amount of injury that would be done to the yard ; and this question would in its turn depend , in many cases , on the comparative value set by the mother upon the beauty of her yard , and the health , development , and happiness of her children .
but supposing that she sees  which she can do in most instances at a glance  that there can no serious harm be done by the experiment , but only that it is a foolish plan so far as the attainment of the object is concerned , and utterly hopeless of success , which , considering that the real end to be attained is the healthy development of the children 's powers by the agreeable exercise of them in useless as well as in useful labors , is no objection at all , then she should answer at once , " yes , you can do that if you like ; and perhaps i can help you about planning the work . "
after saying this , any pointing out of obstacles and difficulties on her part does not present itself to their minds in the light of opposition to their plan , but of aid in helping it forward , and so places her , in their view , on their side , instead of in antagonism to them .
" what do you propose to do with the earth that you take out of the hole ? "
she asks .
the children had , perhaps , not thought of that .
" how would it do , " continues the mother , " to put it in your wheelbarrow and let it stay there , so that in case your plan should not succeed  and men , in any thing that they undertake , always consider it wise to take into account the possibility that they may not succeed  you can easily bring it all back and fill up the hole again . "
the children think that would be a very good plan .
" and how are you going to fill your hole with water when you get it dug out ? "
asks the mother .
they were going to <name> the water from the pump in a pail .
" and how are you going to prevent spilling the water over upon your trousers and into your shoes while carrying it ? "
" oh , we <name> be very careful , " replied <name> .
" how would it do only to fill the pail half full each time , " suggests the mother .
" you would have to go more times , it is true , but that would be better than getting splashed with water . "
the boys think that that would be a very good plan .
in this manner the various difficulties to be anticipated may be brought to the notice of the children , while , they and their mother being in <name> and sympathy with each other  and not in opposition  in the consideration of them , she can bring them forward without any difficulty , and make them the means of teaching the children many useful lessons of <name> and precaution .
<unk> in play .
the mother , then , after warning the children that they must expect to encounter many unexpected difficulties in their undertaking , and telling them that they must not be too much disappointed if they should find that they could not succeed , <unk> them to their work .
they proceed to dig the hole , putting the materials in the wheelbarrow , and then fill up the hole with water brought in half <unk> at a time from the pump ; but are somewhat disappointed to find that the water <unk> away pretty rapidly into the ground , and that , moreover , it is so turbid , and the surface is so covered with little leaves , sticks , and dust , as to make it appear very doubtful whether they would be able to see the fishes if they were to succeed in catching any to put in .
however , they take their long-handled dipper and proceed towards the <name> .
on the way they stop to gather some flowers that grow near the path that leads through the field , when the idea suddenly enters <name> 's head that it would be better to make a garden than a <unk> ; flowers , as she says , being so much prettier than fishes .
so they all go back to their mother and explain the change of their plan .
they ask for leave to dig up a place which they had found where the ground was loose and <name> , and easy to dig , and to set out flowers in it which they had found in the field already in bloom .
" we are going to give up the <unk> , " they say in conclusion , " because flowers are so much prettier than fishes . "
the mother , instead of finding fault with them for being so capricious and <unk> in their plans , says , " i think you are right .
fishes look pretty enough when they are swimming in the <name> , but flowers are much prettier to transport and take care of .
but first go and fill up the hole you made for the pond with the earth that is in the wheelbarrow ; and when you have made your garden and moved the flowers into it , i advise you to get the <unk> and give them a good watering . "
it may be said that children ought to be brought up in habits of steadiness and perseverance in what they undertake , and that this kind of indulgence in their <unk> would have a very bad tendency in this respect .
the answer is , that there are times and seasons for all the different kinds of lessons which children have to learn , and that when in their hours of recreation they are amusing themselves in play , lessons in perseverance and system are out of place .
the object to be sought for then is the exercise and growth of their bodily organs and members , the development of their fancy and imagination , and their powers of observation of nature .
the work of training them to habits of system and of steady perseverance in serious pursuits , which , though it is a work that ought by no means to be neglected , is not the appropriate work of such a time .
summary of results .
the general rules for the government of the parent in his treatment of his children 's requests and wishes are these : in all matters of essential importance he is to decide himself and simply announce his decision , without giving any reasons for the purpose of <unk> it , or for inducing submission to it .
and in all matters not of essential importance he is to allow the children the greatest possible freedom of action .
and the rule for children is that they are always to obey the command the first time it is given , without question , and to take the first answer to any request without any objection or <unk> whatever .
it is very easy to see how smoothly and happily the affairs of domestic government would go on if these rules were established and obeyed .
all that is required on the part of parents for their complete establishment is , first , a clear comprehension of them , and then a calm , quiet , and gentle , but still inflexible firmness in maintaining them .
unfortunately , however , such qualities as these , simple as they seem , are the most rare .
if , instead of gentle but firm consistency and steadiness of action , ardent , impulsive , and capricious energy and violence were required , it would be comparatively easy to find them .
how seldom do we see a mother 's management of her children regulated by a calm , quiet , gentle , and considerate decision that thinks before it speaks in all important matters , and when it speaks , is firm ; and yet , which readily and gladly accords to the children every <name> and indulgence which can do themselves or others no harm .
and on the other hand , how often do we see foolish <unk> and indulgence in yielding to importunity in cases of vital importance , alternating with vexatious <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> in respect to desires and wishes the gratification of which could do no injury at all .
chapter xix .
children 's questions .
the disposition to ask questions , which is so universal and so strong a characteristic of childhood , is the open door which presents to the mother the <unk> and most easy access possible to the mind and heart of her child .
the opportunities and facilities thus afforded to her would be the source of the greatest pleasure to herself , and of the greatest benefit to her child , if she understood better how to avail herself of them .
i propose , in this chapter , to give some explanations and general directions for the guidance of mothers , of older brothers and sisters , and of teachers  of all persons , in fact , who may , from time to time , have young children under their care or in their society .
i have no doubt that some of my rules <name> strike parents , at first view , as paradoxical and , perhaps , almost absurd ; but i <name> that on more mature reflection they <name> be found to be reasonable and just .
the curiosity of children not a fault .
1 .
the curiosity of children is not a fault , and therefore we must never censure them for asking questions , or lead them to think that we consider the disposition to do so a fault on their part ; but , on the other hand , this disposition is to be encouraged as much as possible .
we must remember that a child , when his powers of observation begin to be developed , finds every thing around him full of mystery and wonder .
why some things are hard and some are soft  why some things <name> roll and some <name> not  why he is not hurt when he falls on the sofa , and is hurt when he falls on the floor  why a chair <name> tumble over when he climbs up by the rounds of it , while yet the steps of the stairs remain firm and can be ascended without danger  why one thing is black , and another red , and another green  why water <name> all go away of itself from his hands or his dress , while mud <name> not  why he can dig in the ground , but can not dig in a floor  all is a mystery , and the little adventurer is in a continual state of curiosity and wonder , not only to learn the meaning of all these things , but also of <name> to extend his observations , and find out more and more of the astonishing phenomena that are exhibited around him .
the good feeling of the mother , or of any intelligent friend who is willing to aid him in his efforts , is , of course , invaluable to him as a means of promoting his advancement in knowledge and of developing his powers .
remember , therefore , that the disposition of a child to ask questions is not a fault , but only an indication of his increasing mental activity , and of his <name> to avail himself of the only means within his reach of advancing his knowledge and of enlarging the scope of his intelligence in respect to the strange and wonderful phenomena constantly observable around him .
sometimes , perhaps , a source of inconvenience .
of course there <name> be times when it is inconvenient for the parent to attend to the questions of the child , and when he must , consequently , be debarred of the pleasure and privilege of asking them ; but even at such times as these the disposition to ask them must not be attributed to him as a fault .
never tell him that he is " a little tease "  that " you are tired to death of answering his questions "  that he is " a <unk> that would weary the <name> of job ; " or that , if he <name> " sit still for half an hour , without speaking a word , you <name> give him a reward . "
if you are going to be engaged , and so can not attend to him , say to him that you wish you could talk with him , and answer the questions , but that you are going to be busy and can not do it ; and then , after providing him with some other means of occupation , require him to be silent : though even then you ought to relieve the <unk> of silence for him by stopping every ten or fifteen minutes from your reading , or your letter-writing , or the planning of your work , or whatever your employment may be , and giving your attention to him for a minute or two , and affording him an opportunity to relieve the pressure on his mind by a little conversation .
answers to be short and simple .
2 .
give generally to children 's questions the shortest and simplest answers possible .
one reason why parents find the questions of children so fatiguing to them , is that they attempt too much in their answers .
if they would give the right kind of answers , they would find the work of replying very easy , and in most of their avocations it would occasion them very little interruption .
these short and simple answers are all that a child requires .
a full and detailed explanation of any thing they ask about is as tiresome for them to listen to as it is for the mother to frame and give ; while a short and simple reply which advances them one step in their knowledge of the subject is perfectly easy for the mother to give , and is , at the same time , all that they wish to receive .
for example , let us suppose that the father and mother are taking a ride on a summer afternoon after a shower , with little <name> sitting upon the seat between them in the chaise .
the parents are engaged in conversation with each other , we <name> suppose , and would not like to be interrupted .
<name> presently spies a rainbow on a cloud in the east , and , after uttering an exclamation of delight , asks his mother what made the rainbow .
she hears the question , and her mind , glancing for a moment at the difficulty of giving an intelligible explanation of so grand a phenomenon to such a child , experiences an obscure sensation of perplexity and annoyance , but not quite enough to take off her attention from her conversation ; so she goes on and takes no notice of <name> 's inquiry .
<name> , accordingly , soon repeats it , " mother !
mother !
what makes the rainbow ? "
at length her attention is forced to the subject , and she either tells <name> that she ca n't explain it to him  that he is not old enough to understand it ; or , perhaps , <unk> him for interrupting her with so many teasing questions .
in another such case , the mother , on hearing the question , pauses long enough to look kindly and with a smile of encouragement upon her face towards <name> , and to say simply , " the sun , " and then goes on with her conversation .
<name> says " oh ! "
in a tone of satisfaction .
it is a new and grand idea to him that the sun makes the rainbow , and it is enough to fill his mind with contemplation for several minutes , during which his parents go on without interruption in their talk .
presently <name> asks again , " mother , how does the sun make the rainbow ? "
his mother answers in the same way as before , " by shining on the cloud : " and , leaving that additional idea for <name> to reflect upon and receive fully into his mind , turns again to her husband and resumes her conversation with him after a scarcely perceptible interruption .
<name> , after having reflected in silence some minutes , during which he has looked at the sun and at the rainbow , and observed that the cloud on which the arch is formed is exactly opposite to the sun , and fully exposed to his beams , is prepared for another step , and asks , " mother , how does the sun make a rainbow by shining on the cloud ? "
his mother replies that it shines on millions of little drops of rain in the cloud , and makes them of all colors , like drops of dew on the ground , and all the colors together make the rainbow .
here are images presented to <name> 's mind enough to occupy his thoughts for a considerable interval , when perhaps he <name> have another question still , to be answered by an equally short and simple reply ; though , probably , by this time his curiosity <name> have become satisfied in respect to his subject of inquiry , and his attention <name> have been arrested by some other object .
to answer the child 's questions in this way is so easy , and the pauses which the answers lead to on the part of the questioner are usually so long , that very little serious interruption is occasioned by them to any of the ordinary pursuits in which a mother is engaged ; and the little interruption which is caused is greatly <unk> by the pleasure which the mother <name> experience in witnessing the gratification and improvement of the child , if she really loves him , and is seriously interested in the development of his thinking and reasoning powers .
answers should attempt to communicate but little instruction .
3 .
the answers which are given to children should not only be short and simple in form , but each one should be studiously designed to communicate as small an amount of information as possible .
[ illustration : " mother , what makes it snow ? " ]
this may seem , at first view , a strange idea , but the import of it simply is that , in giving the child his intellectual nourishment , you must act as you do in respect to his bodily food  that is , divide what he is to receive into small portions , and administer a little at a time .
if you give him too much at once in either case , you are in danger of choking him .
for example , <name> asks some morning in the early <name> , when the first snow is falling , and he has been watching it for some time from the window in wonder and delight , " mother , what makes it snow ? "
now , if the mother imagines that she must give any thing like a full answer to the question , her attention must be distracted from her work to enable her to frame it ; and if she does not give up the attempt altogether , and rebuke the boy for teasing her with " so many silly questions , " she perhaps <unk> her work , and , after a moment 's perplexing thought , she says the vapor of the water from the rivers and seas and damp ground rises into the air , and there at last <unk> into flakes of snow , and these fall through the air to the ground .
the boy listens and attempts to understand the explanation , but he is bewildered and lost in the endeavor to take in at once this extended and complicated process  one which is , moreover , not only extended and complicated , but which is composed of elements all of which are entirely new to him .
if the mother , however , should act on the principle of communicating as small a portion of the information required as it is possible to give in one answer , <name> 's inquiry would lead , probably , to a conversation somewhat like the following , the answers on the part of the mother being so short and simple as to require no perceptible thought on her part , and so <unk> no serious interruption to her work , unless it should be something requiring special attention .
" mother , " asks <name> , " what makes it snow ? "
" it is the <unk> coming down out of the sky , " says his mother .
" watch them ! "
" oh ! "
says <name> , uttering the child 's little exclamation of satisfaction .
he looks at the flakes as they fall , catching one after another with his eye , and following it in its meandering descent .
he <name> , perhaps , occupy himself several minutes in silence and profound attention , in bringing fully to his mind the idea that a snow-storm consists of a mass of descending flakes of snow falling through the air .
to us , who are familiar with this fact , it seems nothing to observe this , but to him the analyzing of the phenomenon , which before he had looked upon as one grand spectacle filling the whole sky , and only making an impression on his mind by its general effect , and resolving it into its elemental parts of individual flakes fluttering down through the air , is a great step .
it is a step which exercises his nascent powers of observation and reflection very deeply , and gives him full occupation for quite a little interval of time .
at length , when he has <unk> himself with this idea , he asks again , perhaps , " where do the flakes come from , mother ? "
" out of the sky . "
" oh ! "
says <name> again , for the moment entirely satisfied .
one might at first think that these words would be almost unmeaning , or , at least , that they would give the little questioner no real information .
but they do give him information that is both important and novel .
they advance him one step in his inquiry .
out of the sky means , to him , from a great height .
the words give him to understand that the flakes are not formed where they first come into his view , but that they descend from a higher region .
after reflecting on this idea a moment , he asks , we <name> suppose , " how high in the sky , mother ? "
now , perhaps , a mother might think that there was no possible answer to be given to such a question as this except that " she does not know ; " inasmuch as few persons have any accurate ideas of the elevation in the atmosphere at which <unk> usually form .
but this accurate information is not what the child requires .
if the mother possessed it , it would be useless for her to attempt to communicate it to him .
in the sense in which he asks the question she does understand it , and can give him a perfectly satisfactory answer .
" how high is it in the sky , mother , to where the snow comes from ? "
asks the child .
" oh , very high  higher than the top of the house , " replies the mother .
" as high as the top of the chimney ? "
" yes , higher than that . "
" as high as the moon ? "
" no , not so high as the moon . "
" how high is it then , mother ? "
" about as high as birds can fly . "
" oh ! "
says <name> , perfectly satisfied .
the answer is somewhat indefinite , it is true , but its <unk> is the chief element in the value of it .
a definite and precise answer , even if one of that character were ready at hand , would be utterly inappropriate to the occasion .
an answer may even be good which gives no information at all .
4 .
it is not even always necessary that an answer to a child 's question should convey any information at all .
a little conversation on the subject of the inquiry , giving the child an opportunity to hear and to use language in respect to it , is often all that is required .
it must be remembered that the power to express thoughts , or to represent external objects by language , is a new power to young children , and , like all other new powers , the mere exercise of it gives great pleasure .
if a person in full health and vigor were suddenly to acquire the <name> of flying , he would take great pleasure in moving , by means of his wings , through the air from one high point to another , not because he had any object in visiting those high points , but because it would give him pleasure to find that he could do so , and to exercise his newly acquired power .
so with children in their talk .
they talk often , perhaps generally , for the sake of the pleasure of talking , not for the sake of what they have to say .
so , if you <name> only talk with them and allow them to talk to you about any thing that interests them , they are pleased , whether you communicate to them any new information or not .
this single thought , once fully understood by a mother , <name> save her a great deal of trouble in answering the incessant questions of her children .
the only essential thing in many cases is to say something in reply to the question , no matter whether what you say communicates any information or not .
if a child asks , for instance , what makes the stars shine so , and his mother answers , " because they are so bright , " he <name> be very likely to be as well satisfied as if she attempted to give a philosophical explanation of the phenomenon .
so , if he asks what makes him see himself in the looking-glass , she may answer , " you see an image of yourself there .
they call it an image .
hold up a book and see if you can see an image of that in the glass too . "
he is pleased and satisfied .
nor are such answers useless , as might at first be supposed .
they give the child practice in the use of language , and , if properly managed , they may be made the means of greatly extending his knowledge of language and , by necessary consequence , of the ideas and realities which language represents .
" father , " says <name> , as she is walking with her father in the garden , " what makes some roses white and some red ? "
" it is very curious , is it not ? "
says her father .
" yes , father , it is very curious indeed .
what makes it so ? "
" there must be some cause for it " says her father .
" and the apples that grow on some trees are sweet , and on others they are sour .
that is curious too . "
" yes , very curious indeed , " says <name> .
" the leaves of trees seem to be always green , " continues her father , " though the flowers are of various colors . "
" yes , father , " says <name> .
" except , " adds her father , " when they turn yellow , and red , and brown , in the fall of the year . "
a conversation like this , without attempting any thing like an answer to the question with which it commenced , is as satisfactory to the child , and perhaps as useful in developing its powers and increasing its knowledge of language , as any attempt to explain the phenomenon would be ; and the knowledge of this <name> make it easy for the mother to dispose of many a question which might seriously interrupt her if she conceived it necessary either to attempt a satisfactory explanation of the difficulty , or not to answer it at all .
be always ready to say " i do n't know . "
5 .
the mother should be always ready and willing to say " i do n't know , " in answer to children 's questions .
parents and teachers are very often somewhat averse to this , lest , by often confessing their own ignorance , they should lower themselves in the estimation of their pupils or their children .
so they feel bound to give some kind of an explanation to every difficulty , in hopes that it may satisfy the inquirer , though it does not satisfy themselves .
but this is a great mistake .
the sooner that pupils and children understand that the field of knowledge is utterly boundless , and that it is only a very small portion of it that their superiors in age and attainment have yet explored , the better for all concerned .
the kind of superiority , in the estimation of children , which it is chiefly desirable to attain , consists in their always finding that the explanation which we give , whenever we attempt any , is clear , fair , and satisfactory , not in our being always ready to offer an explanation , whether satisfactory or not .
questions on religious <unk> the considerations presented in this chapter relate chiefly to the questions which children ask in respect to what they observe taking place around them in external nature .
there is another class of questions and difficulties which they raise  namely , those that relate to religious and moral subjects ; and to these i have not intended now to refer .
the inquiries which children make on these subjects arise , in a great measure , from the false and <unk> conceptions which they are so apt to form in respect to spiritual things , and from which they deduce all sorts of absurdities .
the false conceptions in which their difficulties originate are due partly to errors and <unk> in our modes of teaching them on these subjects , and partly to the immaturity of their powers , which <unk> them from clearly comprehending any elements of thought that lie beyond the direct cognizance of the senses .
we shall , however , have occasion to refer to this subject in another chapter .
in respect , however , to all that class of questions which children ask in relation to the visible world around them , the principles here explained may render the mother some aid in her intercourse with the little <unk> under her charge , if she clearly understands and intelligently applies them .
and she <name> find the practice of holding frequent conversations with them , in these ways , a source of great pleasure to her , as well as of unspeakable advantage to them .
indeed , the conversation of a kind and intelligent mother is far the most valuable and important means of education for a child during many years of its early life .
a boy whose mother is pleased to have him near her , who likes to hear and answer his questions , to watch the gradual development of his thinking and reasoning powers , and to enlarge and extend his knowledge of language  thus necessarily and of course expanding the range and scope of his ideas  <name> find that though his studies , strictly so called  that is , his learning to read , and the committing to memory lessons from books  may be deferred , yet , when he finally commences them he <name> go at once to the head of his classes at school , through the superior strength and <unk> development which his mental powers <name> have attained .
chapter xx .
the use of money .
the money question in the management and training of children has a distinct bearing on the subjects of some of the preceding chapters .
it is extremely important , first , in respect to opportunities which are afforded in connection with the use of money for cultivating and developing the qualities of sound judgment and of practical wisdom ; and then , in the second place , the true course to be pursued with them in respect to money forms a special point to be considered in its bearing upon the subject of the proper mode of dealing with their wishes and requests .
evil results of a very common method .
if a parent wishes to eradicate from the mind of his boy all feelings of delicacy and manly pride , to train him to the habit of obtaining what he wants by importunity or servility , and to prevent his having any means of acquiring any practical knowledge of the right use of money , any principles of economy , or any of that forethought and thrift so essential to sure prosperity in future life , the best way to accomplish these ends would seem to be to have no system in supplying him with money in his boyish days , but to give it to him only when he asks for it , and in quantities determined only by the frequency and importunity of his calls .
of course under such a system the boy has no inducement to take care of his money , to form any plans of expenditure , to make any calculations , to practise self-denial to-day for the sake of a greater good to-morrow .
the source of supply from which he draws money , fitful and uncertain as it may be in what it yields to him , he considers unlimited ; and as the amount which he can draw from it does not depend at all upon his <unk> , his foresight , or upon any incipient financial skill that he may exercise , but solely upon his adroitness in coaxing , or his persistence in importunity , it is the group of bad qualities , and not the good , which such management tends to <name> .
the effect of such a system is , in other words , not to encourage the development and growth of those qualities on which thrift and <unk> in the management of his affairs in future life , and , in consequence , his success and prosperity , depend ; but , on the contrary , to <name> the growth of all the mean and ignoble propensities of human nature by <unk> him , so far as relates to this subject , to gain his ends by the arts of a <unk> , or by rude pertinacity .
not that this system always produces these results .
it may be , and perhaps generally is , greatly modified by other influences acting upon the mind of the child at the same time , as well as by the natural tendencies of the boy 's character , and by the character and general influence upon him of his father and mother in other respects .
it can not be denied , however , that the above is the tendency of a system which makes a boy 's income of <unk> a matter of mere chance , on which no calculations can be founded , except so far as he can increase it by adroit manoeuvring or by asking for it directly , with more or less of urgency or persistence , as the case may require ; that is to say , by precisely those means which are the most ignoble and most generally despised by <unk> men as means for the attainment of any human end .
now one of the most important parts of the education of both girls and boys , whether they are to inherit riches , or to enjoy a moderate income from the fruits of their own industry , or to spend their lives in extreme poverty , is to teach them the proper management and use of money .
and this may be very effectually done by giving them a fixed and definite income to manage , and then throwing upon them the responsibility of the management of it , with such a degree of guidance , encouragement , and aid as a parent can easily render .
objection to the plan of a regular allowance .
there are no parents among those who <name> be likely to read this book of resources so limited that they <name> not , from time to time , allow their children some amount of <unk> in a year .
all that is necessary , therefore , is to appropriate to them this amount and pay it to them , or credit them with it , in a business-like and regular manner .
it is true that by this system the children <name> soon begin to regard their monthly or weekly allowance as their due ; and the parent <name> lose the pleasure , if it is any pleasure to him or her , of having the money which they give them regarded in each case as a present , and received with a sense of obligation .
this is sometimes considered an objection to this plan .
" when i furnish my children with money , " says the parent , " as a gratification , i wish to have the pleasure of giving it to them .
whereas , on this proposed plan of paying it to them regularly at stated intervals , they <name> come to consider each payment as simply the payment of a debt .
i wish them to consider it as a <unk> on my part , so that it may awaken gratitude and renew their love for me . "
there is some seeming force in this objection , though it is true that the adoption of the plan of a systematic appropriation , as here recommended , does not prevent the making of presents of money , or of any thing else , to the children , whenever either parent desires to do so .
still the plan <name> not generally be adopted , except by parents in whose minds the laying of permanent foundations for their children 's welfare and happiness through life , by training them from their earliest years to habits of forecast and thrift , and the exercise of judgment and skill in the management of money , is entirely paramount to any petty sentimental gratification to themselves , while the children are young .
two methods .
in case the parent  it may be either the father or the mother  decides to adopt the plan of <unk> systematically and regularly a certain sum to be at the disposal of the child , there are two modes by which the business may be transacted  one by paying over the money itself in the amounts and at the stated periods determined upon , and the other by opening an account with the child , and giving him credit from time to time for the amount due , charging on the other side the amounts which he draws .
1 .
paying the money .
this is the simplest plan .
if it is adopted , the money must be ready and be paid at the appointed time with the utmost <unk> and certainty .
having made the arrangement with a child that he is to have a certain sum  six cents , twelve cents , twenty-five cents , or more , as the case may be  every saturday night , the mother  if it is the mother who has charge of the execution of the plan  must consider it a sacred debt , and must be always ready .
she can not expect that her children <name> learn regularity , punctuality , and system in the management of their money affairs , if she sets them the example of <unk> and forgetfulness in fulfilling her engagements , and offering excuses for <unk> when the time comes , instead of having the money ready when it is due .
the money , when paid , should not , in general , be carried by the children about the person , but they should be provided with a purse or other safe receptacle , which , however , should be entirely in their custody , and so exposed to all the accidents to which any carelessness in the custody would expose it .
the mother must remember that the very object of the plan is to have the children learn by experience to take care of money themselves , and that she defeats that object by virtually relieving them of this care .
it should , therefore , be paid to them with the greatest punctuality , especially at the first introduction of the system , and with the distinct understanding that the charge and care of keeping it <unk> entirely upon them from the time of its passing into their hands .
2 .
opening an account .
the second plan , and one that <name> prove much the most satisfactory in its working  though many mothers <name> shrink from it on the ground that it would make them a great deal of trouble  is to keep an account .
for this purpose a small book should be made , with as many leaves as there are children , so that for each account there can be two pages .
the book should be ruled for accounts , and the name of each child should be entered at the head of the two pages appropriated to his account .
then , from time to time , the amount of his allowance that has fallen due should be entered on the credit side , and any payment made to him on the other .
the plan of keeping an account in this way <unk> the necessity of paying money at stated times , for the account <name> show at any time how much is due .
there are some advantages in each of these modes .
much depends on the age of the children , and still more upon the facilities which the father or mother have at hand for making entries in writing .
to a man of business , accustomed to accounts , who could have a book made small enough to go into his wallet , or to a mother who is systematic in her habits , and has in her <unk> or her secretary facilities for writing at any time , the plan of opening an account <name> be found much the best .
it <name> afford an opportunity of giving the children a great deal of useful knowledge in respect to <unk>  or , rather , by <unk> them from an early age to the management of their affairs in this systematic manner , <name> train them from the beginning to habits of system and exactness .
a very perceptible effect in this direction <name> be produced on the minds of children , even while they have not yet learned to read , and so can not understand at all the written record made of their pecuniary transactions .
they <name> , at any rate , understand that a written record is made ; they <name> take a certain pride and pleasure in it , and impressions <name> be produced which may have an effect upon their habits of accuracy and system in their pecuniary transactions through all future life .
interest on balances .
one great advantage of the plan of having an account over that of paying cash at stated times is , that it affords an opportunity for the father or mother to allow interest for any balances left from time to time in their hands , so as to <unk> the children into a knowledge of the nature and the advantages of productive investments , and <unk> them with the idea that money reserved has within it a principle of increase .
the interest allowed should be altogether greater than the regular rate , so as to make the advantage of it in the case of such small sums appreciable to the children  but not too great .
some judgment and discretion must be exercised on this as on all other points connected with the system .
the arrangements for the keeping of an account being made , and the account opened , there is , of course , no necessity , as in the case of payments made simply in cash , that the business should be transacted at stated times .
at any time when convenient , the entry may be made of the amount which has become due since the time of the last entry .
and when , from time to time , the child wishes for money , the parent <name> look at his account and see if there is a balance to his credit .
if there is , the child <name> be entitled to receive whatever he desires up to the amount of the balance .
once in a month , or at any other times when convenient , the account can be settled , and the balance , with the <unk> interest , carried to a new account .
all this , instead of being a trouble , <name> only be a source of interest and pleasure to the parent , as well as to the children themselves , and , without occupying any sensible portion of time , <name> be the means of gradually communicating a great deal of very useful instruction .
employment of the money .
it <name> have a great effect in " training up children in the way in which they should go , " in respect to the employment of money , if a rule is made for them that a certain portion , <unk> or one-half , for example , of all the money which comes into their possession , both from their regular allowance and from <unk> , is to be laid aside as a permanent investment , and an account at some savings bank be opened , or some other formal mode of placing it be adopted  the <unk> or other <unk> evidence of the amount so laid up to be deposited among the child's treasures .
in respect to the other portion of the money  namely , that which is to be employed by the children themselves as <unk> , the <unk> of it should be left entirely at their discretion , subject only to the <unk> that they are not to buy any thing that <name> be injurious or dangerous to themselves , or a means of disturbance or annoyance to others .
the mother may give them any information or any counsel in regard to the employment of their money , provided she does not do it in the form of expressing any wish , on her part , in regard to it .
for the very object of the whole plan is to bring out into action , and thus to develop and strengthen , the judgment and discretion of the child ; and just as children can not learn to walk by always being carried , so they can not learn to be good managers without having the responsibility of actual management , on a scale adapted to their years , thrown really upon them .
if a boy wishes to buy a bow and arrow , it may in some cases be right not to give him permission to do it , on account of the danger accompanying the use of such a plaything .
but if he wishes to buy a kite which the mother is satisfied is too large for him to manage , or if she thinks there are so many trees about the house that he can not prevent its getting entangled in them , she must not object to it on that account .
she can explain these dangers to the boy , if he is inclined to listen , but not in a way to show that she herself wishes him not to buy the kite .
" those are the difficulties which you may meet with , " she may say , " but you may buy the kite if you think best . "
then when he meets with the difficulties , when he finds that he can not manage the kite , or that he loses it among the trees , she must not triumph over him , and say , " i told you how it would be .
you would not take my advice , and now you see how it is . "
on the contrary , she must help him , and try to <unk> his disappointment , saying , " never mind .
it is a loss , certainly .
but you did what you thought was best at the time , and we all meet with losses sometimes , even when we have done what we thought was best .
you <name> make a great many other mistakes , probably , hereafter in spending money , and meet with losses ; and this one <name> give you an opportunity of learning to bear them like a man . "
the most implicit <name> to be kept with children in money transactions .
i <name> not say that a father , if he is a man of business , ought to be as jealous of his credit with his children as he is of his credit at the bank ; but i think , if he takes a right view of the subject , he <name> be extremely sensitive in respect to both .
if he is a man of high and honorable sentiments , and especially if he looks forward to future years when his children shall have arrived at maturity , or shall be approaching towards it , and sees how important and how delicate the pecuniary relations between himself and them may be at that time , he <name> feel the importance of beginning by establishing , at the very commencement , not only by means of precept , but by example , a habit of precise , systematic , and scrupulous <unk> in the fulfillment of every pecuniary obligation .
it is not necessary that he should do any thing mean or small in his dealings with them in order to accomplish this end .
he may be as liberal and as generous with them in many ways as he pleases , but he must keep his accounts with them correctly .
he must always , without any <unk> or any excuse , be ready to fulfill his engagements , and teach them to fulfill theirs .
possible range of transactions between parents and children .
the parent , after having initiated his children into the regular transaction of business by his mode of managing their <unk> , may very advantageously extend the benefits of the system by engaging with them from time to time in other affairs , to be regulated in a business-like and systematic manner .
for example , if one of his boys has been reserving a portion of his <unk> as a <unk> , and has already half enough for the purchase , the father may offer to lend him the balance and take a mortgage of the watch , to stand until the boy shall have taken it up out of future savings ; and he can make out a <unk> expressing in a few and simple words the fact that the watch is pledged to him as security for the sum advanced , and is not to become the absolute property of the boy till the money for which it is pledged is paid .
in the course of years , a great number of transactions in this way may take place between the father or mother and their boy , each of which <name> not only be a source of interest and enjoyment to both parties , but <name> afford the best possible means of <unk> , not only to the child directly interested in them , but to the other children , a practical knowledge of financial transactions , and of forming in them the habit of conducting all their affairs in a systematic and business-like manner .
the number and variety of such transactions in which the modes of doing business among men may be imitated with children , greatly to their enjoyment and interest , is endless .
i could cite an instance when what was called a bank was in operation for many years among a certain number of children , with excellent effect .
one was appointed president , another cashier , another <unk> .
there was a ledger under the charge of the cashier , with a list of stockholders , and the number of shares held by each , which was in proportion to the respective ages of the children .
the bank building was a little toy secretary , something in the form of a safe , into which there mysteriously appeared , from time to time , small sums of money ; the stockholders being as ignorant of the source from which the profits of the bank were derived as most stockholders probably are in the case of larger and more serious institutions .
once in six months , or at other periods , the money was counted , a dividend was declared , and the stockholders were paid in a regular and business-like manner .
the effect of such methods as these is not only to make the years of childhood pass more pleasantly , but also to prepare them to enter , when the time comes , upon the serious business of life with some considerable portion of that practical wisdom in the management of money which is often , when it is deferred to a later period , acquired only by bitter experience and through much suffering .
indeed , any parent who appreciates and fully enters into the views presented in this chapter <name> find , in ordinary cases , that his children make so much progress in business capacity that he can extend the system so as to embrace subjects of real and serious importance before the children arrive at maturity .
a boy , for instance , who has been trained in this way <name> be found competent , by the time that he is ten or twelve years old , to take the contract for furnishing himself with caps , or boots and shoes , and , a few years later , with all his clothing , at a specified annual sum .
the sum fixed upon in the case of caps , for example , should be intermediate between that which the caps of a boy of ordinary <unk> would cost , and that which would be sufficient with special care , so that both the father and the son could make money , as it were , by the transaction .
of course , to manage such a system successfully , so that it could afterwards be extended to other classes of expenses , requires tact , skill , system , <name> , and steadiness on the part of the father or mother who should attempt it ; but when the parent possesses these qualities , the time and attention that would be required would be as nothing compared with the trouble , the vexation , the endless dissatisfaction on both sides , that attend upon the ordinary methods of supplying children 's wants  to say nothing of the incalculable benefit to the boy himself of such a training , as a part of his preparation for future life .
evil results to be feared .
nor is it merely upon the children themselves , and that after they enter upon the responsibilities of active life , that the evils resulting from their having had no practical training in youth in respect to pecuniary responsibilities and obligations , that evil consequences <name> fall .
the great cities are full of wealthy men whose lives are rendered miserable by the recklessness in respect to money which is displayed by their sons and daughters as they advance towards maturity , and by the utter want , on their part , of all sense of delicacy , and of obligation or of responsibility of any kind towards their parents in respect to their pecuniary transactions .
of course this must , in a vast number of cases , be the result when the boy is brought up from infancy with the idea that the only limit to his supply of money is his ingenuity in devising modes of putting a pressure upon his father .
fifteen or twenty years spent in managing his affairs on this principle must , of course , produce the fruit naturally to be expected from such seed .
the great difficulty .
it would seem , perhaps , at first view , from what has been said in this chapter , that it would be a very simple and easy thing to train up children thus to correct ideas and habits in respect to the use of money ; and it would be so  for the principles involved seem to be very plain and simple  were it not that the qualities which it requires in the parent are just those which are most rare .
<unk> in forming the plan , calmness and quietness in proposing it , inflexible but mild and gentle firmness in carrying it out , perfect honesty in allowing the children to exercise the power and responsibility promised them , and an indulgent spirit in relation to the faults and errors into which they fall in the exercise of it  these and other such qualities are not very easily found .
to make an arrangement with a child that he is to receive a certain sum every saturday , and then after two or three weeks to forget it , and when the boy comes to call for it , to say , petulantly , " oh , do n't come to bother me about that now  i am busy ; and besides , i have not got the money now ; " or , when a boy has spent all his allowance on the first two or three days of the week , and comes to beg <unk> for more , to say , " it was very wrong in you to spend all your money at once , and i have a great mind not to give you any more .
i <name> , however , do it just this time , but i shall not again , you may depend ; " or , to borrow money in some sudden emergency out of the fund which a child has accumulated for a special purpose , and then to forget or neglect to repay it  to manage loosely and capriciously in any such ways as these <name> be sure to make the attempt a total failure ; that is to say , such management <name> be sure to be a failure in respect to teaching the boy to act on right principles in the management of money , and training him to habits of exactness and faithfulness in the fulfillment of his obligations .
but in making him a thoughtless , wasteful , teasing , and selfish boy while he remains a boy , and fixing him , when he comes to manhood , in the class of those who are utterly untrustworthy , faithless in the performance of their promises , and wholly unscrupulous in respect to the means by which they obtain money , it may very probably turn out to be a splendid success .

it might , perhaps , be thought that , in a book which professes to show how an efficient government can be established and maintained by gentle measures , the subject of corporal punishment could have no place .
it seems important , however , that there should be here introduced a brief though distinct presentation of the light in which , in a philosophical point of view , this instrumentality is to be regarded .
the teachings of scripture .
the resort to corporal punishment in the training of children seems to be spoken of in many passages contained in the scriptures as of fundamental necessity .
but there can be no doubt that the word <name> , as used in those passages , is used simply as the emblem of parental authority .
this is in accordance with the ordinary custom of hebrew writers in those days , and with the <unk> of their language , by which a single visible or tangible object was employed as the representative or expression of a general idea  as , for example , the sword is used as the emblem of <unk> authority , and the sun and the rain , which are spoken of as being sent with their genial and <unk> power upon the evil and the good , denote not specially and exclusively those agencies , but all the beneficent influences of nature which they are employed to represent .
the injunctions , therefore , of <name> in respect to the use of the <name> are undoubtedly to be understood as simply <unk> upon parents the necessity of bringing up their children in complete subjection to their authority .
no one can imagine that he could wish the <name> to be used when complete subjection to the parental authority could be secured by more gentle means .
and how this is to be done it is the object precisely of this book to show .
in this sense , therefore  and it is undoubtedly the true sense  namely , that children must be governed by the authority of the parent , the passages in question express a great and most essential truth .
it is sometimes said that children must be governed by reason , and this is true , but it is the reason of their parents , and not their own which must hold the control .
if children were endowed with the capacity of seeing what is best for them , and with sufficient self-control to pursue what is best against the <unk> of their animal instincts and propensities , there would be no necessity that the period of subjection to parental authority should be extended over so many years .
but so long as their powers are yet too immature to be safely relied upon , they must , of necessity , be subject to the parental <name> ; and the sooner and the more perfectly they are made to understand this , and to yield a willing submission to the necessity , the better it <name> be , not only for their parents , but also for themselves .
the parental authority must , therefore , be established  by gentle means , if possible  but it must by all means be established , and be firmly maintained .
if you can not govern your child without corporal punishment , it is better to resort to it than not to govern him at all .
taking a wide view of the field , i think there may be several cases in which a resort to the infliction of physical pain as the only available means of establishing authority may be the only alternative .
there are three cases of this kind that are to be specially considered .
[ illustration : the runaway ] possible cases in which it is the only <unk>  savages .
1 .
in savage or <unk> life , and even , perhaps , in so rude a state of society as must have existed in some parts of judea when the proverbs of <name> were written , it is conceivable that many parents , owing to their own ignorance , and low animal condition , would have no other means at their command for establishing their authority over their children than <unk> and blows .
it must be so among savages .
and it is certainly better , if the mother knows no other way of inducing her boy to keep within her sight , that she should whip him when he runs away , than that he should be bitten by serpents or devoured by bears .
she must establish her authority in some way , and if this is the best that she is capable of pursuing , she must use it .
teachers whose tasks surpass their skill .
2 .
a teacher , in entering upon the charge of a large school of boys made <unk> by previous <unk> , may , perhaps , possibly find himself unable to establish submission to his authority without this resource .
it is true that if it is so , it is due , in a certain sense , to want of skill on the teacher 's part ; for there are men , and women too , who <name> take any company of boys that you can give them , and , by a certain skill , or tact , or knowledge of human nature , or other qualities which seem sometimes to other persons almost magical , <name> have them all completely under subjection in a week , and that without violence , without scolding , almost without even a frown .
the time may , perhaps , come when every teacher , to be considered qualified for his work , must possess this skill .
indeed , the world is evidently making great and rapid progress in this direction .
the methods of instruction and the modes by which the teacher gains and holds his influence over his pupils have been wonderfully improved in recent times , so that where there was one teacher , fifty years ago , who was really beloved by his pupils , we have fifty now .
in dr. <name> 's time , which was about a hundred and fifty years ago , it would seem that there was no other mode but that of violent coercion recognized as worthy to be relied upon in <unk> instruction , for he said that he knew of no way by which latin could be taught to boys in his day but " by having it flogged into them . "
from such a state of things to that which prevails at the present day there has been an astonishing change .
and now , whether a teacher is able to manage an average school of boys without physical force is simply a question of tact , knowledge of the right principles , and skill in applying them on his part .
it is , perhaps , yet too soon to expect that all teachers can possess , or can acquire , these qualifications to such a degree as to make it safe to forbid the infliction of bodily pain in any case , but the time for it is rapidly approaching , and in some parts of the country it has , perhaps , already arrived .
until that time comes , every teacher who finds himself under the necessity of beating a boy 's body in order to attain certain moral or intellectual ends ought to understand that the reason is the <unk> of his understanding and skill in dealing directly with his mind ; though for this <unk> he may not himself be personally at all to blame .
children spoiled by neglect and <unk> .
3 .
i am even willing to admit that one or more boys in a family may reach such a condition of rudeness and insubordination , in consequence of neglect or <unk> on the part of their parents in their early years , and the present <unk> and incapacity of the father in dealing with the <unk> and impulses of the human soul , that the question <name> lie between keeping them within some kind of subordination by bodily punishment or not controlling them at all .
if a father has been so engrossed in his business that he has neglected his children , has never established any common bond of sympathy between himself and them , has taken no interest in their enjoyments , nor brought them by moral means to an habitual subjection to his <name> ; and if their mother is a weak , irresolute woman , occupying herself with the pursuits and pleasures of fashionable society , and leaving her children to the management of servants , the children <name> , of course , in general , grow up exacting , turbulent , and ungovernable ; and when , with advancing maturity , their increasing strength and vigor makes this <unk> and disorder intolerable in the house , and there is , as of course there usually <name> be in such a case , no proper knowledge and skill in the management of the young on the part of either parent to remedy the evil by gentle measures , the only alternative in many cases may be either a resort to violent punishment , or the sending away of the unmanageable subjects to school .
the latter part of the alternative is the best , and , fortunately , it is the one generally adopted .
but where it can not be adopted , it is certainly better that the boys should be governed by the <name> than to grow up under no government at all .
gentle measures effectual where rightfully and faithfully employed .
however it may be with respect to the exceptional cases above enumerated , and perhaps some others , there can , i think , be no doubt that parents who should train their children from the beginning on the principles explained in this volume , and upon others analogous to them , would never , in any case , have to strike a blow .
they would accomplish the end enjoined by the precepts of <name> , namely , the complete subjection of their children to their authority , by improved methods not known in his day , or , at least , not so fully developed that they could then be relied upon .
they who imagine that parents are bound to use the <name> as the instrumentality , because the scriptures speak of the <name> as the means of establishing parental authority best known in those days , instead of employing the more effective methods which the progress of improvement has developed and made available at the present day , ought , in order to be consistent , to insist on the retention of the harp in religious worship , because <name> <unk> it upon believers to " praise the lord with harp : " to " sing unto him with <unk> , and an instrument of ten strings . "
the truth is , that what we are to look at in such injunctions is the end that is to be attained , which is , in this last case , the impressive and <unk> exaltation of almighty god in our minds by the acts of public worship ; and if , with the improvements in musical instruments which have been made in modern times , we can do this more satisfactorily by employing in the place of a <unk> or a harp of ten strings an organ of ten or a hundred stops , we are bound to make the <unk> .
in a word , we must look at the end and not at the means , remembering that in questions of scripture interpretation the " letter <unk> , the spirit maketh alive . "
protracted contests with obstinacy .
it seems to me , though i am aware that many excellent persons think differently , that it is never wise for the parent to allow himself to be drawn into a contest with a child in attempting to compel him to do something that from <unk> or obstinacy he refuses to do .
if the attempt is successful , and the child yields under a moderate severity of coercion , it is all very well .
but there is something mysterious and unaccountable in the strength of the obstinacy sometimes manifested in such cases , and the degree of endurance which it <name> often inspire , even in children of the most tender age .
we observe the same inexplicable <unk> sometimes in the lower animals  in the horse , for example ; which is the more unaccountable from the fact that we can not suppose , in his case , that peculiar combination of intelligence and <unk> which we generally consider the sustaining power of the protracted obstinacy on the part of the child .
the degree of persistence which is manifested by children in contests of this kind is something wonderful , and can not easily be explained by any of the ordinary theories in respect to the influence of motives on the human mind .
a state of cerebral excitement and exaltation is not unfrequently produced which seems akin to insanity , and instances have been known in which a child has suffered itself to be beaten to death rather than yield obedience to a very simple command .
and in vast <name> of instances , the parent , after a protracted contest , gives up in despair , and is compelled to invent some plausible pretext for bringing it to an end .
indeed , when we reflect upon the subject , we see what a difficult task we undertake in such contests  it being nothing less than that of forcing the formation of a volition in a human mind .
we can easily control the bodily movements and actions of another person by means of an external coercion that we can apply , and we have various indirect means of inducing <unk> ; but in these contests we seem to come up squarely to the work of attempting , by outward force , to compel the forming of a volition in the mind ; and it is not surprising that this should , at least sometimes , prove a very difficult undertaking .
no necessity for these contests .
there seems to be no necessity that a parent or teacher should ever become involved in struggles of this kind in maintaining his authority .
the way to avoid them , as it seems to me , is , when a child refuses out of obstinacy to do what is required of him , to impose the proper punishment or penalty for the refusal , and let that close the transaction .
do not attempt to enforce his compliance by continuing the punishment until he yields .
a child , for example , going out to play , wishes for his blue cap .
his mother chooses that he shall wear his gray one .
she hangs the blue cap up in its place , and gives him the gray one .
he declares that he <name> not wear it , and throws it down upon the floor .
the temptation now is for the mother , indignant , to punish him , and then to order him to take up the cap which he had thrown down , and to feel that it is her duty , in case he refuses , to persist in the punishment until she conquers his <name> , and compels him to take it up and put it upon his head .
but instead of this , a safer and a better course , it seems to me , is to avoid a contest altogether by considering the offense complete , and the transaction on his part finished by the single act of rebellion against her authority .
she may take the cap up from the floor herself and put it in its place , and then simply consider what punishment is proper for the wrong already done .
perhaps she forbids the boy to go out at all .
perhaps she reserves the punishment , and sends him to bed an hour earlier that night .
the age of the boy , or some other circumstances connected with the case , may be such as to demand a severer treatment still .
at any rate , she limits the transaction to the single act of disobedience and rebellion already committed , without giving an opportunity for a repetition of it by renewing the command , and <unk> for it the proper punishment , and that is the end of the affair .
and so a boy in reciting a lesson <name> not repeat certain words after his mother .
she enters into no controversy with him , but shuts the book and puts it away .
he , knowing his mother 's usual mode of management in such cases , and being sure that some penalty , privation , or punishment <name> sooner or later follow , <unk> , and tells his mother that he <name> say the words if she <name> try him again .
" no , my son , " she should reply , " the opportunity is past .
you should have done your duty at the right time .
you have disobeyed me , and i must take time to consider what to do . "
if , at the proper time , in such a case , when all the excitement of the affair is over , a penalty or punishment <unk> to the fault , or some other appropriate measures in relation to it , are certain to come , and if this method is always pursued in a calm and quiet manner but with inflexible firmness in act , the spirit of rebellion <name> be much more effectually subdued than by any protracted struggles at the time , though ending in victory however complete .
but all this is a digression , though it seemed proper to allude to the subject of these contests here , since it is on these occasions , perhaps , that parents are most frequently led , or , as they think , irresistibly impelled , to the infliction of bodily punishments as the last resort , when they would , in general , be strongly inclined to avoid them .
the infliction of pain sometimes the <unk> remedy .
there are , moreover , some cases , perhaps , in the ordinary exigencies of domestic life , as the world goes , when some personal infliction is the shortest way of disposing of a case of discipline , and may appear , for the time being , to be the most effectual .
a slap is very quickly given , and a mother may often think that she has not time for a more gentle mode of managing the case , even though she may admit that if she had the time at her command the gentle mode would be the best .
and it is , indeed , doubtless true that the principles of management advocated in this work are such as require that the parents should devote some time and attention , and , still more essentially , some heart to the work ; and they who do not consider the welfare and happiness of their children in future life , and their own happiness in connection with them as they advance towards their declining years , as of sufficient importance to call for the <unk> of this time and attention , <name> doubtless often resort to more summary methods in their discipline than those here recommended .
the sting that it leaves behind .
indeed , the great objection , after all , to the occasional resort to the infliction of bodily pain in extreme cases is , as it seems to me , the sting which it leaves behind ; not that , which it leaves in the heart of the child who may suffer it  for that soon passes away  but in the heart of the parent who <unk> it .
the one is , or may be , very evanescent ; the other may very long remain ; and what is worse , the anguish of it may be revived and made very poignant in future years .
this consideration makes it specially imperative on every parent never , for any cause , to inflict punishment by violence when himself under the influence of any irritation or anger awakened by the offense .
for though the anger which the fault of the child naturally awakens in you carries you through the act of punishing well enough , it soon afterwards passes away , while the memory of it remains , and in after years , like any other sin , it may come back to exact a painful retribution .
when the little loved one who now puts you out of <name> with her <unk> , her <unk> , and , perhaps , by worse faults and failings  all , however , faults which may very possibly , in part or in whole , be the result of the immature and undeveloped condition of her mental or bodily powers  falls sick and dies , and you follow her as she is borne away , and with a bursting heart see her laid in her little grave , it <name> be a great comfort to you then to reflect that you did all in your power , by means of the gentlest measures at your command , to train her to truth and duty , that you never lost <name> with her , and that she never felt from your hand any thing but gentle assistance or a loving caress .
and your boy  now so ardent and impulsive , and often , perhaps , noisy , troublesome , and rude , from the <unk> action of his growing powers  when these powers shall have received their full development , and he has passed from your control to his place in the world as a man , and he comes back from time to time to the maternal home in grateful remembrance of his obligations to his mother , bringing with him tokens of his affection and love , you <name> think with pain of the occasions when you subjected him to the torture of the <name> under the impulse of irritation or anger , or to accomplish the ends of discipline which might have been attained in other ways .
time , as you then look back over the long interval of years which have elapsed , <name> greatly soften the recollection of the fault , but it <name> greatly <unk> that of the pain which was made the retribution of it .
you <name> say to yourself , it is true , i did it for the best .
if i had not done it , my son would perhaps not be what he is .
he , if he remembers the transaction , <name> doubtless say so too ; but there <name> be none the less for both a certain sting in the recollection , and you <name> wish that the same end could have been accomplished by gentler means .
the substance of it is that children must , at all events , be governed .
the proper authority over them must be maintained ; but it is a great deal better to secure this end by gentle measures , if the parent have or can acquire the skill to employ them .
chapter xxii .
gratitude in children .
mothers are very often pained at what seems to them the ingratitude of their children .
they long , above all things , for their love .
they do every thing in their power  i mean , of course , that some mothers do  to win it .
they make every sacrifice , and give every possible evidence of affection ; but they seem to fail entirely of bringing out any of those evidences of gratitude and affection in return which , if they could only witness them , would fill their hearts with gladness and <name> .
but the only feeling which their children manifest towards them seems to be a selfish one .
they come to them when in trouble , they even fly to them eagerly when in danger , and they consider their parents the chief resource for procuring nearly all their means of gratification .
but they think little , as it often seems , of the mother 's comfort and enjoyment in return , and seldom or never do any thing voluntarily to give her pleasure .
it would be a great exaggeration to say that this is always the feeling of the mother in respect to her children .
i only mean that this is sometimes , and i might probably say very often , the case .
two forms of <unk> now there are two distinct forms which the feeling of love may assume in the mature mind , both of which are gratifying to the object of it , though they are very different , and indeed in some sense exactly the opposite of each other .
there is the receiving and the bestowing love .
it is true that the two forms are often conjoined , or rather they often exist in intimate combination with each other ; but in their nature they are essentially distinct .
a young <name> , for example , may feel a strong attachment for the gentleman to whom she is engaged  or a wife for her husband  in the sense of liking to receive kindness and attention from him more than from any other man .
she may be specially pleased when he invites her to ride with him , or makes her presents , or shows in any way that he thinks of her and seeks her happiness  more so than she would be to receive the same attentions from any other person .
this is love .
it may be very genuine love ; but it is love in the form of taking special pleasure in the kindness and favor bestowed by the object of it .
yet it is none the less true , as most persons have had occasion to learn from their own experience , that this kind of love may be very strong without being accompanied by any corresponding <name> on the part of the person manifesting it to make sacrifices of her own ease and comfort in order to give happiness to the object of her love in return .
in the same manner a gentleman may feel a strong sentiment of love for a <name> , which shall take the form of enjoying her society , of being happy when he is near her , and greatly pleased at her making sacrifices for his sake , or manifesting in any way a strong attachment for him .
there may be also united with this the other form of love  namely , that which would lead him to deny himself and make sacrifices for her .
but the two , though they may often  perhaps generally  exist together , are in their nature so essentially different that they may be entirely separated , and we may have one in its full strength while there is very little of the other .
you may love a person in the sense of taking greater pleasure in receiving attentions and favors from him than from all the world beside , while yet you seldom think of making efforts to promote his comfort and happiness in any thing in which you are not yourself personally concerned .
on the other hand , you may love him with the kind of affection which renders it the greatest pleasure of your life to make sacrifices and endure self-denial to promote his welfare in any way .
in some cases these two forms are in fact entirely separated , and one or the other can exist entirely distinct from the other  as in the case of the kind feelings of a good man towards the poor and miserable .
it is quite possible to feel a very strong interest in such objects , and to be willing to put ourselves to considerable inconvenience to make them comfortable and happy , and to take great pleasure in learning that our efforts have been effectual , without feeling any love for them at all in the other form  that is , any <name> to have them with us , to receive attentions and kindness from them , and to enjoy their society .
on the other hand , in the love of a young child for his mother the case is reversed .
the love of the child consists chiefly in liking to be with his mother , in going to her rather than to any one else for relief from pain or for comfort in sorrow , and is accompanied with very few and very faint desires to make efforts , or to submit to privations , or to make sacrifices , for the promotion of her good .
order of their development .
now the qualities and characteristics of the soul on which the capacity for these two forms of love depend seem to be very different , and they advance in development and come to maturity at different periods of life ; so that the mother , in feeling dejected and sad because she can not awaken in the mind of her child the gratitude and the consideration for her comfort and happiness which she desires , is simply looking for a certain kind of fruit at the wrong time .
you have one of the forms of love for you on the part of the child now while he is young .
in due time , when he arrives at maturity , if you <name> wait patiently , you <name> assuredly have the other .
now he runs to you in every emergency .
he asks you for every thing that he wants .
he can find comfort nowhere else but in your arms , when he is in distress or in suffering from pain , disappointment , or sorrow .
but he <name> not make any effort to be still when you are sick , or to avoid interrupting you when you are busy ; and insists , perhaps , on your carrying him when he is tired , without seeming to think or care whether you may not be tired too .
but in due time all this <name> be changed .
twenty years hence he <name> conceal all his troubles from you instead of coming with them to you for comfort .
he <name> be off in the world engaged in his pursuits , no longer bound closely to your side .
but he <name> think all the time of your comfort and happiness .
he <name> bring you presents , and pay you innumerable attentions to cheer your heart in your declining years .
he <name> not run to you when he has hurt himself ; but if any thing happens to you , he <name> leave every thing to hasten to your relief , and bring with him all the comforts and means of enjoyment for you that his resources can command .
the time <name> thus come when you <name> have his love to your heart 's content , in the second form .
you must be satisfied , while he is so young , with the first form of it , which is all that his powers and faculties in their present stage are capable of developing .
the truth of the case seems to be that the faculties of the human mind  or i should perhaps rather say , the <unk> of the soul  like the instincts of animals , are developed in the order in which they are required for the good of the subject of them .
indeed , it is very interesting and curious to observe how striking the analogy in the order of development , in respect to the nature of the bond of attachment which binds the offspring to the parent , runs through all those ranks of the animal creation in which the young for a time depend upon the mother for food or for protection .
the chickens in any moment of alarm run to the hen ; and the lamb , the calf , and the colt to their respective mothers ; but none of them would feel the least inclination to come to the rescue of the parent if the parent was in danger .
with the mother herself it is exactly the reverse .
her heart  if we can speak of the seat of the maternal affections of such creatures as a heart  is filled with desires to bestow good upon her offspring , without a <name> , or even a thought , of receiving any good from them in return .
there is this difference , however , between the race of man and those of the inferior animals  namely , that in his case the instinct , or at least a natural <name> which is in some respects analogous to an instinct , <unk> him to repay to his parents the benefits which he received from them in youth , comes in due time ; while in that of the lower animals it seems never to come at all .
the little birds , after opening their mouths so wide every time the mother comes to the nest during all the weeks while their wings are growing , fly away when they are grown , without the least care or concern for the anxiety and distress of the mother occasioned by their imprudent flights ; and once away and free , never come back , so far as we know , to make any return to their mother for watching over them , sheltering them with her body , and working so <unk> to provide them with food during the helpless period of their infancy  and still less to seek and protect and feed her in her old age .
but the boy , reckless as he sometimes seems in his boyhood , insensible apparently to his obligations to his mother , and little mindful of her wishes or of her feelings  his affection for her showing itself mainly in his readiness to go to her with all his wants , and in all his troubles and sorrows  <name> begin , when he has arrived at maturity and no longer needs her aid , to remember with gratitude the past aid that she has rendered him .
the current of affection in his heart <name> turn and flow the other way .
instead of wishing to receive , he <name> now only wish to give .
if she is in want , he <name> do all he can to supply her .
if she is in sorrow , he <name> be happy if he can do any thing to comfort her .
he <name> send her memorials of his gratitude , and objects of comfort and embellishment for her home , and <name> watch with solicitude and sincere affection over her declining years .
and all this change , if not the result of a new instinct which reaches its development only when the period of maturity arrives , is the unfolding of a sentiment of the heart belonging essentially to the nature of the subject of it as man .
it is true that this capacity may , under certain circumstances , be very feebly developed .
in some cases , indeed , it would seem that it was scarcely developed at all ; but there is a provision for it in the nature of man , while there is no provision for it at all in the <unk> principles of the lower animals .
advancing the development of the sentiment of <unk> now , although parents must not be impatient at the slow appearance of this feeling in their children , and must not be troubled in its not appearing before its time , they can do much by proper efforts to cultivate its growth , and give it an earlier and a more powerful influence over them than it would otherwise manifest .
the mode of doing this is the same as in all other cases of the cultivation of moral sentiments in children , and that is by the influence over them of sympathy with those they love .
just as the way to cultivate in the minds of children a feeling of pity for those who are in distress is not to preach it as a duty , but to make them love you , and then show such pity yourself ; and the way to make them angry and <unk> in character  if we can conceive of your being actuated by so unnatural a <name>  would be often to express violent resentment yourself , with scowling looks and fierce denunciations against those who have offended you ; so , to awaken them to sentiments of gratitude for the favors they receive , you must gently lead them to sympathize with you in the gratitude which you feel for the favors that you receive .
when a child shows some special unwillingness to comply with her mother's desires , her mother may address to her a kind but direct and plain expostulation on the obligations of children to their parents , and the duty incumbent on them of being grateful for their kindness , and to be willing to do what they can in return .
such an address would probably do no good at all .
the child would receive it simply as a scolding , no matter how mildly and gently the reproof might be expressed , and would shut her heart against it .
it is something which she must stand still and endure , and that is all .
but let the mother say the same things precisely when the child has shown a willingness to make some little sacrifice to aid or to gratify her mother , so that the sentiment expressed may enter her mind in the form of approval and not of condemnation , and the effect <name> be very different .
the sentiments <name> , at any rate , now not be rejected from the mind , but the way <name> be open for them to enter , and the conversation <name> have a good effect , so far as <unk> teaching can have effect in such a case .
but now to bring in the element of sympathy as a means of reaching and influencing the mind of the child : the mother , we <name> suppose , standing at the door some morning before breakfast in spring , with her little daughter , seven or eight years old , by her side , hears a bird singing on a tree near by .
she points to the tree , and says , in a <unk> , " hark ! "
when the sound ceases , she looks to the child with an expression of pleasure upon her countenance , and says , " suppose we give that bird some crumbs because he has been singing us such a pretty song . "
" well ! "
says the child .
" would you ? "
asks the mother .
" yes , mother , i should like to give him some very much .
do you suppose he sang the song for us ? "
" i do n't know that he did , " replies the mother .
" we do n't know exactly what the birds mean by all their singing .
they take some pleasure in seeing us , i think , or else they would not come so much around our house ; and i do n't know but that this bird 's song may come from some kind of <name> or gladness he felt in seeing us come to the door .
at any rate , it <name> be a pleasure to us to give him some crumbs to pay him for his song . "
the child <name> think so too , and <name> run off joyfully to bring a piece of bread to form crumbs to be scattered upon the path .
and the whole transaction <name> have the effect of awakening and <unk> the sentiment of gratitude in her heart .
the effect <name> not be great , it is true , but it <name> be of the right kind .
it <name> be a drop of water upon the unfolding cotyledons of a seed just peeping up out of the ground , which <name> <unk> below after you have gone away , and give the little roots a new impulse of growth .
for when you have left the child seated upon the door-step , occupied in throwing out the crumbs to the bird , her heart <name> be occupied with the thoughts you have put into it , and the sentiment of gratitude for kindness received <name> commence its course of development , if it had not commenced it before .
the case of older children .
of course the employment of such an occasion as this of the singing of a little bird and such a conversation in respect to it for cultivating the sentiment of gratitude in the heart , is adapted only to the case of quite a young child .
for older children , while the principle is the same , the circumstances and the manner of treating the case must be adapted to a <unk> age .
<name> , for example  twelve years of age  had been sick , and during his convalescence his sister <name> , two years older than himself , had been very <unk> in her attendance upon him .
she had waited upon him at his meals , and brought him books and playthings , from time to time , to amuse him .
after he had fully recovered his health , he was sitting in the garden , one <name> morning in the spring , with his mother , and she said , " how kind <name> was to you while you were sick ! "
