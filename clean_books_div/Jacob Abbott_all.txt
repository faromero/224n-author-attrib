preface .
the history of the life of every individual who has , for any reason , attracted extensively the attention of mankind , has been written in a great variety of ways by a multitude of authors , and persons sometimes wonder why we should have so many different accounts of the same thing .
the reason is , that each one of these accounts is intended for a different set of readers , who read with ideas and purposes widely dissimilar from each other .
among the twenty millions of people in the united states , there are perhaps two millions , between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five , who wish to become acquainted , in general , with the leading events in the history of the old world , and of ancient times , but who , coming upon the stage in this land and at this period , have ideas and conceptions so widely different from those of other nations and of other times , that a mere <unk> of existing accounts is not what they require .
the story must be told expressly for them .
the things that are to be explained , the points that are to be brought out , the comparative degree of prominence to be given to the various particulars , <name> all be different , on account of the difference in the situation , the ideas , and the objects of these new readers , compared with those of the various other classes of readers which former authors have had in view .
it is for this reason , and with this view , that the present series of historical narratives is presented to the public .
the author , having had some opportunity to become acquainted with the position , the ideas , and the intellectual wants of those whom he addresses , presents the result of his labors to them , with the <name> that it may be found successful in accomplishing its design .

<name> the great died when he was quite young .
he was but thirty-two years of age when he ended his career , and as he was about twenty when he commenced it , it was only for a period of twelve years that he was actually engaged in performing the work of his life .
<name> was nearly three times as long on the great field of human action .
notwithstanding the <unk> of <name> 's career , he ran through , during that short period , a very brilliant series of exploits , which were so bold , so romantic , and which led him into such adventures in scenes of the greatest magnificence and splendor , that all the world looked on with astonishment then , and mankind have continued to read the story since , from age to age , with the greatest interest and attention .
the secret of <name> 's success was his character .
he possessed a certain combination of mental and personal attractions , which in every age gives to those who exhibit it a mysterious and almost unbounded ascendency over all within their influence .
<name> was characterized by these qualities in a very remarkable degree .
he was finely formed in person , and very prepossessing in his manners .
he was active , athletic , and full of ardor and enthusiasm in all that he did .
at the same time , he was calm , collected , and considerate in emergencies requiring caution , and thoughtful and <unk> in respect to the bearings and consequences of his acts .
he formed strong attachments , was grateful for kindnesses shown to him , considerate in respect to the feelings of all who were connected with him in any way , faithful to his friends , and generous toward his foes .
in a word , he had a <name> character , though he devoted its energies unfortunately to conquest and war .
he lived , in fact , in an age when great personal and mental powers had scarcely any other field for their exercise than this .
he entered upon his career with great ardor , and the position in which he was placed gave him the opportunity to act in it with prodigious effect .
there were several circumstances combined , in the situation in which <name> was placed , to afford him a great opportunity for the exercise of his vast powers .
his native country was on the confines of europe and <name> .
now europe and <name> were , in those days , as now , marked and distinguished by two vast masses of social and civilized life , widely dissimilar from each other .
the asiatic side was occupied by the persians , the medes , and the <unk> .
the european side by the greeks and romans .
they were separated from each other by the waters of the hellespont , the Ã¦gean sea , and the mediterranean , as <name> be seen by the map .
these waters constituted a sort of natural barrier , which kept the two races apart .
the races formed , accordingly , two vast organizations , distinct and widely different from each other , and of course rivals and enemies .
it is hard to say whether the asiatic or european civilization was the highest .
the two were so different that it is difficult to compare them .
on the asiatic side there was wealth , luxury , and splendor ; on the european , energy , genius , and force .
on the one hand were vast cities , splendid palaces , and gardens which were the wonder of the world ; on the other , strong <unk> , military roads and bridges , and compact and <unk> towns .
the persians had enormous armies , perfectly provided for , with beautiful tents , horses elegantly caparisoned , arms and munitions of war of the finest workmanship , and officers magnificently dressed , and accustomed to a life of luxury and splendor .
the greeks and romans , on the other hand , prided themselves on their compact bodies of troops , inured to hardship and thoroughly disciplined .
their officers gloried not in luxury and parade , but in the courage , the steadiness , and implicit obedience of their troops , and in their own science , skill , and powers of military calculation .
thus there was a great difference in the whole system of social and military organization in these two quarters of the globe .
now <name> was born the heir to the throne of one of the grecian kingdoms .
he possessed , in a very remarkable degree , the energy , and enterprise , and military skill so characteristic of the greeks and romans .
he organized armies , crossed the boundary between europe and <name> , and spent the twelve years of his career in a most triumphant military incursion into the very center and seat of asiatic power , destroying the asiatic armies , conquering the most splendid cities , <unk> or taking captive the kings , and princes , and generals that opposed his progress .
the whole world looked on with wonder to see such a course of conquest , pursued so successfully by so young a man , and with so small an army , gaining continual victories , as it did , over such vast <name> of foes , and making conquests of such accumulated treasures of wealth and splendor .
the name of <name> 's father was <name> .
the kingdom over which he reigned was called macedon .
macedon was in the northern part of greece .
it was a kingdom about twice as large as the state of massachusetts , and one third as large as the state of new york .
the name of <name> 's mother was olympias .
she was the daughter of the king of epirus , which was a kingdom somewhat smaller than macedon , and lying westward of it .
both macedon and epirus <name> be found upon the map at the commencement of this volume .
olympias was a woman of very strong and determined character .
<name> seemed to inherit her energy , though in his case it was combined with other qualities of a more attractive character , which his mother did not possess .
he was , of course , as the young <name> , a very important personage in his father 's court .
every one knew that at his father 's death he would become king of macedon , and he was consequently the object of a great deal of care and attention .
as he gradually advanced in the years of his boyhood , it was observed by all who knew him that he was <unk> with extraordinary qualities of mind and of character , which seemed to indicate , at a very early age , his future greatness .
although he was a <name> , he was not brought up in habits of luxury and <unk> .
this would have been contrary to all the ideas which were entertained by the greeks in those days .
they had then no <unk> , so that in battle the combatants could not stand quietly , as they can now , at a distance from the enemy , coolly discharging musketry or cannon .
in ancient battles the soldiers rushed toward each other , and fought hand to hand , in close combat , with swords , or spears , or other weapons requiring great personal strength , so that headlong bravery and muscular force were the qualities which generally carried the day .
the duties of officers , too , on the field of battle , were very different then from what they are now .
an officer now must be calm , collected , and quiet .
his business is to plan , to calculate , to direct , and arrange .
he has to do this sometimes , it is true , in circumstances of the most imminent danger , so that he must be a man of great self-possession and of undaunted courage .
but there is very little occasion for him to exert any great physical force .
in ancient times , however , the great business of the officers , certainly in all the subordinate grades , was to lead on the men , and set them an example by performing themselves deeds in which their own great personal prowess was displayed .
of course it was considered extremely important that the child destined to be a general should become robust and powerful in constitution from his earliest years , and that he should be inured to hardship and fatigue .
in the early part of <name> 's life this was the main object of attention .
the name of the nurse who had charge of our hero in his infancy was <unk> .
she did all in her power to give strength and hardihood to his constitution , while , at the same time , she treated him with kindness and gentleness .
<name> acquired a strong affection for her , and he treated her with great consideration as long as he lived .
he had a governor , also , in his early years , named <unk> , who had the general charge of his education .
as soon as he was old enough to learn , they appointed him a <unk> also , to teach him such branches as were generally taught to young princes in those days .
the name of this <unk> was lysimachus .
they had then no printed books , but there were a few writings on parchment rolls which young scholars were taught to read .
some of these writings were treatises on philosophy , others were romantic histories , <unk> the exploits of the heroes of those days  of course , with much exaggeration and embellishment .
there were also some poems , still more romantic than the histories , though generally on the same themes .
the greatest productions of this kind were the writings of <name> , an ancient poet who lived and wrote four or five hundred years before <name> 's day .
the young <name> was greatly delighted with <name> 's tales .
these tales are <unk> of the exploits and adventures of certain great warriors at the siege of <name>  a siege which lasted ten years  and they are written with so much beauty and force , they contain such admirable <unk> of character , and such graphic and vivid descriptions of romantic adventures , and picturesque and striking scenes , that they have been admired in every age by all who have learned to understand the language in which they are written .
<name> could understand them very easily , as they were written in his mother tongue .
he was greatly excited by the <unk> themselves , and pleased with the flowing smoothness of the verse in which the tales were told .
in the latter part of his course of education he was placed under the charge of aristotle , who was one of the most eminent philosophers of ancient times .
aristotle had a beautiful copy of <name> 's poems prepared expressly for <name> , taking great pains to have it <unk> with perfect correctness , and in the most elegant manner .
<name> carried this copy with him in all his campaigns .
some years afterward , when he was obtaining conquests over the persians , he took , among the spoils of one of his victories , a very beautiful and costly casket , which king <name> had used for his jewelry or for some other <name> treasures .
<name> determined to make use of this box as a <unk> for his beautiful copy of <name> , and he always carried it with him , thus protected , in all his subsequent campaigns .
<name> was full of energy and spirit , but he was , at the same time , like all who ever become truly great , of a reflective and considerate turn of mind .
he was very fond of the studies which aristotle led him to pursue , although they were of a very abstruse and difficult character .
he made great progress in metaphysical philosophy and mathematics , by which means his powers of calculation and his judgment were greatly improved .
he early evinced a great degree of ambition .
his father <name> was a powerful warrior , and made many conquests in various parts of greece , though he did not cross into <name> .
when news of <name> 's victories came into macedon , all the rest of the court would be filled with rejoicing and delight ; but <name> , on such occasions , looked thoughtful and disappointed , and complained that his father would conquer every country , and leave him nothing to do .
at one time some embassadors from the persian court arrived in macedon when <name> was away .
these embassadors saw <name> , of course , and had opportunities to converse with him .
they expected that he would be interested in hearing about the splendors , and pomp , and parade of the persian monarchy .
they had stories to tell him about the famous hanging gardens , which were artificially constructed in the most magnificent manner , on arches raised high in the air ; and about a vine made of gold , with all sorts of precious stones upon it instead of fruit , which was wrought as an ornament over the throne on which the king of persia often gave audience ; of the splendid palaces and vast cities of the persians ; and the banquets , and <unk> , and magnificent entertainments and celebrations which they used to have there .
they found , however , to their surprise , that <name> was not interested in hearing about any of these things .
he would always turn the conversation from them to inquire about the geographical position of the different persian countries , the various routes leading into the interior , the organization of the asiatic armies , their system of military tactics , and , especially , the character and habits of <unk> , the persian king .
the embassadors were very much surprised at such evidences of maturity of mind , and of <unk> and reflective powers on the part of the young <name> .
they could not help comparing him with <unk> .
" <name> , " said they , " is great , while our king is only <name> . "
the truth of the judgment which these embassadors thus formed in respect to the qualities of the young macedonian , compared with those held in highest estimation on the asiatic side , was fully confirmed in the subsequent stages of <name> 's career .
in fact , this combination of a calm and calculating <unk> , with the ardor and energy which formed the basis of his character , was one great secret of <name> 's success .
the story of bucephalus , his famous horse , illustrates this in a very striking manner .
this animal was a <unk> of very spirited character , which had been sent as a present to <name> while <name> was young .
they took the horse out into one of the parks connected with the palace , and the king , together with many of his courtiers , went out to view him .
the horse pranced about in a very furious manner , and seemed entirely unmanageable .
no one dared to mount him .
<name> , instead of being gratified at the present , was rather disposed to be displeased that they had sent him an animal of so fiery and apparently vicious a nature that nobody dared to attempt to subdue him .
in the mean time , while all the other by-standers were joining in the general condemnation of the horse , <name> stood quietly by , watching his motions , and attentively studying his character .
he perceived that a part of the difficulty was caused by the agitations which the horse experienced in so strange and new a scene , and that he appeared , also , to be somewhat frightened by his own shadow , which happened at that time to be thrown very strongly and distinctly upon the ground .
he saw other indications , also , that the high excitement which the horse felt was not <unk> , but the excess of <name> and generous impulses .
it was courage , ardor , and the consciousness of great nervous and muscular power .
<name> had decided that the horse was useless , and had given orders to have him sent back to thessaly , whence he came .
<name> was very much concerned at the prospect of losing so fine an animal .
he begged his father to allow him to make the experiment of mounting him .
<name> at first refused , thinking it very presumptuous for such a youth to attempt to subdue an animal so vicious that all his experienced horsemen and grooms condemned him ; however , he at length consented .
<name> went up to the horse and took hold of his bridle .
he patted him upon the neck , and soothed him with his voice , showing , at the same time , by his easy and unconcerned manner , that he was not in the least afraid of him .
a spirited horse knows immediately when any one approaches him in a timid or cautious manner .
he appears to look with contempt on such a master , and to determine not to submit to him .
on the contrary , horses seem to love to yield obedience to man , when the individual who <unk> the obedience possesses those qualities of coolness and courage which their instincts enable them to appreciate .
[ illustration : <name> and bucephalus . ]
at any rate , bucephalus was calmed and subdued by the presence of <name> .
he allowed himself to be caressed .
<name> turned his head in such a direction as to prevent his seeing his shadow .
he quietly and gently laid off a sort of cloak which he wore , and sprang upon the horse 's back .
then , instead of attempting to restrain him , and worrying and checking him by useless efforts to hold him in , he gave him the rein freely , and animated and encouraged him with his voice , so that the horse flew across the plains at the top of his speed , the king and the courtiers looking on , at first with fear and trembling , but soon afterward with feelings of the greatest admiration and pleasure .
after the horse had satisfied himself with his run it was easy to rein him in , and <name> returned with him in safety to the king .
the courtiers overwhelmed him with their praises and congratulations .
<name> commended him very highly : he told him that he deserved a larger kingdom than macedon to govern .
<name> 's judgment of the true character of the horse proved to be correct .
he became very <unk> and docile , yielding a ready submission to his master in every thing .
he would kneel upon his fore legs at <name> 's command , in order that he might mount more easily .
<name> retained him for a long time , and made him his favorite war horse .
a great many stories are related by the historians of those days of his sagacity and his feats of war .
whenever he was equipped for the field with his military trappings , he seemed to be highly elated with pride and pleasure , and at such times he would not allow any one but <name> to mount him .
what became of him at last is not certainly known .
there are two accounts of his end .
one is , that on a certain occasion <name> got carried too far into the midst of his enemies , on a battle field and that , after fighting desperately for some time , bucephalus made the most extreme exertions to <name> him away .
he was severely wounded again and again , and though his strength was nearly gone , he would not stop , but pressed forward till he had carried his master away to a place of safety , and that then he dropped down exhausted , and died .
it may be , however , that he did not actually die at this time , but slowly recovered ; for some historians relate that he lived to be thirty years old  which is quite an old age for a horse  and that he then died .
<name> caused him to be buried with great ceremony , and built a small city upon the spot in honor of his memory .
the name of this city was <unk> .
<name> 's character matured rapidly , and he began very early to act the part of a man .
when he was only sixteen years of age , his father , <name> , made him regent of macedon while he was absent on a great military campaign among the other states of greece .
without doubt <name> had , in this regency , the counsel and aid of high officers of state of great experience and ability .
he acted , however , himself , in this high position , with great energy and with complete success ; and , at the same time , with all that modesty of deportment , and that delicate consideration for the officers under him  who , though inferior in rank , were yet his superiors in age and experience  which his position rendered proper , but which few persons so young as he would have manifested in circumstances so well calculated to awaken the feelings of vanity and elation .
afterward , when <name> was about eighteen years old , his father took him with him on a campaign toward the south , during which <name> fought one of his great battles at <unk> , in <unk> .
in the arrangements for this battle , <name> gave the command of one of the wings of the army to <name> , while he reserved the other for himself .
he felt some solicitude in giving his young son so important a charge , but he endeavored to guard against the danger of an unfortunate result by putting the ablest generals on <name> 's side , while he reserved those on whom he could place less reliance for his own .
thus organized , the army went into battle .
<name> soon ceased to feel any solicitude for <name> 's part of the duty .
boy as he was , the young <name> acted with the utmost bravery , coolness , and discretion .
the wing which he commanded was victorious , and <name> was obliged to urge himself and the officers with him to greater exertions , to avoid being outdone by his son .
in the end <name> was completely victorious , and the result of this great battle was to make his power paramount and supreme over all the states of greece .
notwithstanding , however , the extraordinary discretion and wisdom which characterized the mind of <name> in his early years , he was often haughty and headstrong , and in cases where his pride or his resentment were aroused , he was sometimes found very impetuous and uncontrollable .
his mother olympias was of a haughty and imperious temper , and she quarreled with her husband , king <name> ; or , perhaps , it ought rather to be said that he quarreled with her .
each is said to have been unfaithful to the other , and , after a bitter contention , <name> repudiated his wife and married another <name> .
among the festivities held on the occasion of this marriage , there was a great banquet , at which <name> was present , and an incident occurred which strikingly illustrates the impetuosity of his character .
one of the guests at this banquet , in saying something complimentary to the new <name> , made use of expressions which <name> considered as in <unk> of the character of his mother and of his own birth .
his anger was immediately aroused .
he threw the cup from which he had been drinking at the offender 's head .
<unk> , for this was his name , threw his cup at <name> in return ; the guests at the table where they were sitting rose , and a scene of uproar and confusion ensued .
<name> , incensed at such an interruption of the order and <name> of the wedding feast , <name> his sword and rushed toward <name> but by some accident he stumbled and fell upon the floor .
<name> looked upon his fallen father with contempt and scorn , and exclaimed , " what a fine hero the states of greece have to lead their armies  a man that can not get across the floor without tumbling down . "
he then turned away and left the palace .
immediately afterward he joined his mother olympias , and went away with her to her native country , epirus , where the mother and son remained for a time in a state of open quarrel with the husband and father .
in the mean time <name> had been planning a great expedition into <name> .
he had arranged the affairs of his own kingdom , and had formed a strong combination among the states of greece , by which powerful armies had been raised , and he had been designated to command them .
his mind was very intently engaged in this vast enterprise .
he was in the flower of his years , and at the height of his power .
his own kingdom was in a very prosperous and thriving condition , and his ascendency over the other kingdoms and states on the european side had been fully established .
he was excited with ambition , and full of <name> .
he was proud of his son <name> , and was relying upon his efficient aid in his schemes of conquest and aggrandizement .
he had married a youthful and beautiful bride , and was surrounded by scenes of festivity , <unk> , and rejoicing .
he was looking forward to a very brilliant career considering all the deeds that he had done and all the <name> which he had acquired as only the introduction and prelude to the far more distinguished and conspicuous part which he was intending to perform .
<name> , in the mean time , ardent and impetuous , and eager for <name> as he was , looked upon the position and prospects of his father with some envy and jealousy .
he was impatient to be monarch himself .
his taking sides so promptly with his mother in the domestic quarrel was partly owing to the feeling that his father was a <unk> and an obstacle in the way of his own greatness and fame .
he felt within himself powers and capacities <unk> him to take his father's place , and reap for himself the harvest of <name> and power which seemed to await the grecian armies in the coming campaign .
while his father lived , however , he could be only a <name> ; influential , accomplished , and popular , it is true , but still without any substantial and independent power .
he was restless and uneasy at the thought that , as his father was in the prime and vigor of manhood , many long years must elapse before he could emerge from this confined and subordinate condition .
his restlessness and uneasiness were , however , suddenly ended by a very extraordinary occurrence , which called him , with scarcely an hour 's notice , to take his father 's place upon the throne .

<name> was suddenly called upon to succeed his father on the macedonian throne , in the most unexpected manner , and in the midst of scenes of the greatest excitement and agitation .
the circumstances were these : <name> had felt very desirous , before setting out upon his great expedition into <name> , to become reconciled to <name> and olympias .
he wished for <name> 's co-operation in his plans ; and then , besides , it would be dangerous to go away from his own dominions with such a son left behind , in a state of resentment and hostility .
so <name> sent kind and conciliatory messages to olympias and <name> , who had gone , it <name> be recollected , to epirus , where her friends resided .
the brother of olympias was king of epirus .
he had been at first incensed at the indignity which had been put upon his sister by <name> 's treatment of her ; but <name> now tried to appease his anger , also , by friendly negotiations and messages .
at last he arranged a marriage between this king of epirus and one of his own daughters , and this completed the reconciliation .
olympias and <name> returned to macedon , and great preparations were made for a very splendid wedding .
<name> wished to make this wedding not merely the means of confirming his reconciliation with his former wife and son , and establishing friendly relations with the king of epirus : he also prized it as an occasion for paying marked and honorable attention to the princes and great generals of the other states of greece .
he consequently made his preparations on a very extended and sumptuous scale , and sent invitations to the influential and prominent men far and near .
these great men , on the other hand , and all the other public authorities in the various grecian states , sent compliments , congratulations , and presents to <name> , each seeming ambitious to contribute his share to the splendor of the celebration .
they were not wholly disinterested in this , it is true .
as <name> had been made commander-in-chief of the grecian armies which were about to undertake the conquest of <name> , and as , of course , his influence and power in all that related to that vast enterprise would be paramount and supreme ; and as all were ambitious to have a large share in the <name> of that expedition , and to participate , as much as possible , in the power and in the renown which seemed to be at <name> 's disposal , all were , of course , very anxious to secure his favor .
a short time before , they were contending against him ; but now , since he had established his ascendency , they all eagerly joined in the work of <unk> it and making it illustrious .
nor could <name> justly complain of the <unk> and <unk> of these professions of friendship .
the compliments and favors which he offered to them were equally hollow and heartless .
he wished to secure their favor as a means of aiding him up the steep path to fame and power which he was attempting to climb .
they wished for his , in order that he might , as he ascended himself , help them up with him .
there was , however , the greatest appearance of cordial and devoted friendship .
some cities sent him presents of golden crowns , beautifully wrought , and of high cost .
others dispatched <unk> , expressing their good wishes for him , and their confidence in the success of his plans .
athens , the city which was the great seat of literature and science in greece sent a poem , in which the history of the expedition into persia was given by anticipation .
in this poem <name> was , of course , triumphantly successful in his enterprise .
he conducted his armies in safety through the most dangerous passes and defiles ; he fought glorious battles , gained magnificent victories , and possessed himself of all the treasures of asiatic wealth and power .
it ought to be stated , however , in justice to the poet , that , in <unk> these imaginary exploits , he had sufficient delicacy to represent <name> and the persian monarch by fictitious names .
the wedding was at length celebrated , in one of the cities of macedon , with great pomp and splendor .
there were games , and shows , and military and civic spectacles of all kinds to amuse the thousands of spectators that assembled to witness them .
in one of these spectacles they had a procession of statues of the gods .
there were twelve of these statues , sculptured with great <name> , and they were borne along on elevated <unk> , with <unk> , and incense , and various ceremonies of homage , while vast multitudes of spectators lined the way .
there was a thirteenth statue , more magnificent than the other twelve , which represented <name> himself in the character of a god .
this was not , however , so impious as it would at first view seem , for the gods whom the ancients worshiped were , in fact , only <unk> of old heroes and kings who had lived in early times , and had acquired a reputation for supernatural powers by the fame of their exploits , exaggerated in descending by tradition in superstitious times .
the ignorant multitude accordingly , in those days , looked up to a living king with almost the same reverence and homage which they felt for their <unk> heroes ; and these <unk> heroes furnished them with all the ideas they had of god .
making a monarch a god , therefore , was no very extravagant flattery .
after the procession of the statues passed along , there came bodies of troops , with trumpets sounding and banners flying .
the officers rode on horses elegantly caparisoned , and prancing proudly .
these troops escorted princes , embassadors , generals , and great officers of state , all gorgeously decked in their robes , and wearing their badges and insignia .
at length king <name> himself appeared in the procession .
he had arranged to have a large space left , in the middle of which he was to walk .
this was done in order to make his position the more conspicuous , and to <name> more strongly his own high distinction above all the other potentates present on the occasion .
guards preceded and followed him , though at considerable distance , as has been already said .
he was himself clothed with white robes , and his head was adorned with a splendid crown .
the procession was moving toward a great theater , where certain games and spectacles were to be exhibited .
the statues of the gods were to be taken into the theater , and placed in conspicuous positions there , in the view of the assembly , and then the procession itself was to follow .
all the statues had entered except that of <name> , which was just at the door , and <name> himself was advancing in the midst of the space left for him , up the avenue by which the theater was approached , when an occurrence took place by which the whole character of the scene , the <name> of <name> , and the fate of fifty nations , was suddenly and totally changed .
it was this .
an officer of the guards , who had his position in the procession near the king , was seen advancing impetuously toward him , through the space which separated him from the rest , and , before the spectators had time even to wonder what he was going to do , he stabbed him to the heart .
<name> fell down in the street and died .
a scene of indescribable tumult and confusion ensued .
the murderer was immediately cut to pieces by the other guards .
they found , however , before he was dead , that it was <unk> , a man of high standing and influence , a general officer of the guards .
he had had horses provided , and other assistance ready , to enable him to make his escape , but he was cut down by the guards before he could avail himself of them .
an officer of state immediately hastened to <name> , and announced to him his father 's death and his own accession to the throne .
an assembly of the leading counselors and statesmen was called , in a hasty and tumultuous manner , and <name> was proclaimed king with prolonged and general acclamations .
<name> made a speech in reply .
the great assembly looked upon his youthful form and face as he arose , and listened with intense interest to hear what he had to say .
he was between nineteen and twenty years of age ; but , though thus really a boy , he spoke with all the decision and confidence of an energetic man .
he said that he should at once assume his father 's position , and <name> forward his plans .
he hoped to do this so efficiently that every thing would go directly onward , just as if his father had continued to live , and that the nation would find that the only change which had taken place was in the name of the king .
the motive which induced <unk> to murder <name> in this manner was never fully ascertained .
there were various opinions about it .
one was , that it was an act of private revenge , occasioned by some neglect or injury which <unk> had received from <name> .
others thought that the murder was <unk> by a party in the states of greece , who were hostile to <name> , and unwilling that he should command the allied armies that were about to penetrate into <name> .
demosthenes , the celebrated orator , was <name> 's great enemy among the greeks .
many of his most powerful orations were made for the purpose of arousing his countrymen to resist his ambitious plans and to curtail his power .
these orations were called his <unk> , and from this origin has arisen the practice , which has prevailed ever since that day , of applying the term <unk> to denote , in general , any strongly <unk> <unk> .
now demosthenes , it is said , who was at this time in athens , announced the death of <name> in an athenian assembly before it was possible that the news could have been conveyed there .
he accounted for his early possession of the intelligence by saying it was communicated to him by some of the gods .
many persons have accordingly supposed that the plan of <unk> <name> was devised in greece ; that demosthenes was a party to it ; that <unk> was the agent for carrying it into execution ; and that demosthenes was so confident of the success of the plot , and exulted so much in this certainty , that he could not resist the temptation of thus anticipating its announcement .
there were other persons who thought that the persians had plotted and accomplished this murder , having induced <unk> to execute the deed by the promise of great rewards .
as <unk> himself , however , had been instantly killed , there was no opportunity of gaining any information from him on the motives of his conduct , even if he would have been disposed to impart any .
at all events , <name> found himself suddenly elevated to one of the most conspicuous positions in the whole political world .
it was not simply that he succeeded to the throne of macedon ; even this would have been a lofty position for so young a man ; but macedon was a very small part of the realm over which <name> had extended his power .
the ascendency which he had acquired over the whole grecian empire , and the vast arrangements he had made for an incursion into <name> , made <name> the object of universal interest and attention .
the question was , whether <name> should attempt to take his father 's place in respect to all this general power , and undertake to sustain and <name> on his vast projects , or whether he should content himself with ruling , in quiet , over his native country of macedon .
most prudent persons would have advised a young <name> , under such circumstances , to have decided upon the latter course .
but <name> had no idea of bounding his ambition by any such limits .
he resolved to spring at once completely into his father 's seat , and not only to possess himself of the whole of the power which his father had acquired , but to commence , immediately , the most energetic and vigorous efforts for a great extension of it .
his first plan was to punish his father 's murderers .
he caused the circumstances of the case to be investigated , and the persons suspected of having been connected with <unk> in the plot to be tried .
although the designs and motives of the murderers could never be fully ascertained , still several persons were found guilty of <unk> in it , and were condemned to death and publicly executed .
<name> next decided not to make any change in his father's appointments to the great offices of state , but to let all the departments of public affairs go on in the same hands as before .
how sagacious a line of conduct was this !
most ardent and enthusiastic young men , in the circumstances in which he was placed , would have been elated and vain at their elevation , and would have replaced the old and <unk> servants of the father with personal favorites of their own age , inexperienced and incompetent , and as conceited as themselves .
<name> , however , made no such changes .
he continued the old officers in command , endeavoring to have every thing go on just as if his father had not died .
there were two officers in particular who were the ministers on whom <name> had mainly relied .
their names were antipater and parmenio .
antipater had charge of the civil , and parmenio of military affairs .
parmenio was a very distinguished general .
he was at this time nearly sixty years of age .
<name> had great confidence in his military powers , and felt a strong personal attachment for him .
parmenio entered into the young king 's service with great readiness , and accompanied him through almost the whole of his career .
it seemed strange to see men of such age , standing , and experience , obeying the orders of such a boy ; but there was something in the genius , the power , and the enthusiasm of <name> 's character which inspired ardor in all around him , and made every one eager to join his standard and to aid in the execution of his plans .
macedon , as <name> be seen on the following map , was in the northern part of the country occupied by the greeks , and the most powerful states of the confederacy and all the great and influential cities were south of it .
there was athens , which was magnificently built , its splendid citadel crowning a <name> hill in the center of it .
it was the great seat of literature , philosophy , and the arts , and was thus a center of attraction for all the civilized world .
there was corinth , which was distinguished for the gayety and pleasure which reigned there .
all possible means of luxury and amusement were concentrated within its walls .
the lovers of knowledge and of <name> , from all parts of the earth , flocked to athens , while those in pursuit of pleasure , dissipation , and indulgence chose corinth for their home .
corinth was beautifully situated on the isthmus , with prospects of the sea on either hand .
it had been a famous city for a thousand years in <name> 's day .
[ illustration : map of macedon and greece . ]
there was also thebes .
thebes was farther north than athens and corinth .
it was situated on an elevated plain , and had , like other ancient cities , a strong citadel , where there was at this time a macedonian garrison , which <name> had placed there .
thebes was very wealthy and powerful .
it had also been celebrated as the <unk> of many poets and philosophers , and other eminent men .
among these was pindar , a very celebrated poet who had flourished one or two centuries before the time of <name> .
his descendants still lived in thebes , and <name> , some time after this , had occasion to confer upon them a very distinguished honor .
there was sparta also , called sometimes <unk> .
the inhabitants of this city were famed for their courage , hardihood , and physical strength , and for the energy with which they devoted themselves to the work of war .
they were nearly all soldiers , and all the arrangements of the state and of society , and all the plans of education , were designed to promote military ambition and pride among the officers and fierce and indomitable courage and endurance in the men .
these cities and many others , with the states which were attached to them , formed a large , and flourishing , and very powerful community , extending over all that part of greece which lay south of macedon .
<name> , as has been already said , had established his own ascendency over all this region , though it had cost him many perplexing negotiations and some <unk> battles to do it .
<name> considered it somewhat uncertain whether the people of all these states and cities would be disposed to transfer readily , to so youthful a <name> as he , the high commission which his father , a very powerful monarch and soldier , had extorted from them with so much difficulty .
what should he do in the case ?
should he give up the expectation of it ?
should he send embassadors to them , presenting his claims to occupy his father 's place ?
or should he not act at all , but wait quietly at home in macedon until they should decide the question ?
instead of doing either of these things , <name> decided on the very bold step of setting out himself , at the head of an army , to march into southern greece , for the purpose of presenting in person , and , if necessary , of enforcing his claim to the same post of honor and power which had been conferred upon his father .
considering all the circumstances of the case , this was perhaps one of the boldest and most decided steps of <name> 's whole career .
many of his macedonian advisers counseled him not to make such an attempt ; but <name> would not listen to any such <unk> .
he collected his forces , and set forth at the head of them .
between macedon and the southern states of greece was a range of lofty and almost impassable mountains .
these mountains extended through the whole interior of the country , and the main route leading into southern greece passed around to the eastward of them , where they terminated in cliffs , leaving a narrow passage between the cliffs and the sea .
this pass was called the pass of thermopylÃ¦ , and it was considered the key to greece .
there was a town named <unk> near the pass , on the outward side .
there was in those days a sort of general congress or assembly of the states of greece , which was held from time to time , to decide questions and disputes in which the different states were continually getting involved with each other .
this assembly was called the <unk> council , on account , as is said , of its having been established by a certain king named <unk> .
a meeting of this council was appointed to receive <name> .
it was to be held at thermopylÃ¦ , or , rather , at <unk> , which was just without the pass , and was the usual place at which the council assembled .
this was because the pass was in an intermediate position between the northern and southern portions of greece , and thus equally accessible from either .
in proceeding to the southward , <name> had first to pass through thessaly , which was a very powerful state immediately south of macedon .
he met with some show of resistance at first , but not much .
the country was impressed with the boldness and decision of character manifested in the taking of such a course by so young a man .
then , too , <name> , so far as he became personally known , made a very favorable impression upon every one .
his manly and athletic form , his <name> and open manners , his spirit , his generosity , and a certain air of confidence , independence , and conscious superiority , which were combined , as they always are in the case of true greatness , with an unaffected and unassuming modesty  these and other traits , which were obvious to all who saw him , in the person and character of <name> , made every one his friend .
common men take pleasure in yielding to the influence and ascendency of one whose spirit they see and feel stands on a higher eminence and <unk> higher powers than their own .
they like a leader .
it is true , they must feel confident of his superiority ; but when this superiority stands out so clearly and distinctly marked , combined , too , with all the graces and attractions of youth and manly beauty , as it was in the case of <name> , the minds of men are brought very easily and rapidly under its sway .
the <unk> gave <name> a very favorable reception .
they expressed a cordial readiness to <unk> him in the position which his father had occupied .
they joined their forces to his , and proceeded southward toward the pass of thermopylÃ¦ .
here the great council was held .
<name> took his place in it as a member .
of course , he must have been an object of universal interest and attention .
the impression which he made here seems to have been very favorable .
after this assembly separated , <name> proceeded southward , accompanied by his own forces , and tended by the various princes and potentates of greece , with their attendants and followers .
the feelings of exultation and pleasure with which the young king defiled through the pass of thermopylÃ¦ , thus attended , must have been exciting in the extreme .
the pass of thermopylÃ¦ was a scene strongly associated with ideas of military <name> and renown .
it was here that , about a hundred and fifty years before , leonidas , a spartan general , with only three hundred soldiers , had attempted to withstand the pressure of an immense persian force which was at that time invading greece .
he was one of the kings of sparta , and he had the command , not only of his three hundred spartans , but also of all the allied forces of the greeks that had been assembled to repel the persian invasion .
with the help of these allies he withstood the persian forces for some time , and as the pass was so narrow between the cliffs and the sea , he was enabled to resist them successfully .
at length , however , a strong detachment from the immense persian army contrived to find their way over the mountains and around the pass , so as to establish themselves in a position from which they could come down upon the small greek army in their rear .
leonidas , perceiving this , ordered all his allies from the other states of greece to withdraw , leaving himself and his three hundred countrymen alone in the defile .
he did not expect to repel his enemies or to defend the pass .
he knew that he must die , and all his brave followers with him , and that the torrent of invaders would pour down through the pass over their bodies .
but he considered himself stationed there to defend the passage , and he would not desert his post .
when the battle came on he was the first to fall .
the soldiers gathered around him and defended his dead body as long as they could .
at length , overpowered by the immense <name> of their foes , they were all killed but one man .
he made his escape and returned to sparta .
a monument was erected on the spot with this inscription : " go , traveler , to sparta , and say that we lie here , on the spot at which we were stationed to defend our country . "
<name> passed through the defile .
he advanced to the great cities south of it  to athens , to thebes , and to corinth .
another great assembly of all the monarchs and potentates of greece was convened in corinth ; and here <name> attained the object of his ambition , in having the command of the great expedition into <name> conferred upon him .
the impression which he made upon those with whom he came into connection by his personal qualities must have been favorable in the extreme .
that such a youthful <name> should be selected by so powerful a confederation of nations as their leader in such an enterprise as they were about to engage in , indicates a most extraordinary power on his part of acquiring an ascendency over the minds of men , and of impressing all with a sense of his commanding superiority .
<name> returned to macedon from his expedition to the southward in triumph , and began at once to arrange the affairs of his kingdom , so as to be ready to enter , unembarrassed , upon the great career of conquest which he imagined was before him .

the country which was formerly occupied by macedon and the other states of greece is now turkey in europe .
in the northern part of it is a vast chain of mountains called now the <unk> .
in <name> 's day it was mount <unk> .
this chain forms a broad belt of lofty and <unk> land , and extends from the black sea to the adriatic .
a branch of this mountain range , called <unk> , extends <unk> from about the middle of its length , as may be seen by the map .
<unk> separated macedonia from a large and powerful country , which was occupied by a somewhat rude but warlike race of men .
this country was thrace .
thrace was one great fertile basin or valley , sloping toward the center in every direction , so that all the streams from the mountains , increased by the rains which fell over the whole surface of the ground , flowed together into one river , which <unk> through the center of the valley , and flowed out at last into the Ã¦gean sea .
the name of this river was the <unk> .
all this may be seen distinctly upon the map .
[ illustration : map of macedon and greece . ]
the <unk> , or mount <unk> , as it was then called , formed the great northern frontier of macedon and thrace .
from the summits of the range , looking northward , the eye surveyed a vast extent of land , constituting one of the most extensive and fertile valleys on the globe .
it was the valley of the danube .
it was inhabited , in those days , by rude tribes whom the greeks and romans always designated as barbarians .
they were , at any rate , wild and warlike , and , as they had not the <name> of writing , they have left us no records of their institutions or their history .
we know nothing of them , or of the other <unk> nations that occupied the central parts of europe in those days , except what their inveterate and perpetual enemies have thought fit to tell us .
according to their story , these countries were filled with nations and tribes of a wild and half-savage character , who could be kept in check only by the most vigorous exertion of military power .
soon after <name> 's return into macedon , he learned that there were symptoms of revolt among these nations .
<name> had subdued them , and established the kind of peace which the greeks and romans were accustomed to enforce upon their neighbors .
but now , as they had heard that <name> , who had been so terrible a warrior , was no more , and that his son , scarcely out of his teens , had succeeded to the throne , they thought a suitable occasion had arrived to try their strength .
<name> made immediate arrangements for moving northward with his army to settle this question .
he conducted his forces through a part of thrace without meeting with any serious resistance , and approached the mountains .
the soldiers looked upon the rugged precipices and lofty summits before them with awe .
these northern mountains were the seat and throne , in the imaginations of the greeks and romans , of old <unk> , the hoary god of the north wind .
they conceived of him as dwelling among those cold and <name> summits , and making excursions in <name> , carrying with him his vast stores of frost and snow , over the southern valleys and plains .
he had wings , a long beard , and white locks , all powdered with flakes of snow .
instead of feet , his body terminated in tails of serpents , which , as he flew along , lashed the air , writhing from under his robes .
he was violent and impetuous in temper , rejoicing in the devastation of <name> , and in all the sublime phenomena of tempests , cold , and snow .
the greek <name> of <unk> made an impression upon the human mind that twenty centuries have not been able to efface .
the north wind of <name> is <unk> as <unk> to the present day in the literature of every nation of the western world .
the <unk> forces had assembled in the defiles , with other troops from the northern countries , to arrest <name> 's march , and he had some difficulty in <unk> them .
they had got , it is said , some sort of loaded wagons upon the summit of an ascent , in the pass of the mountains , up which <name> 's forces would have to march .
these wagons were to be run down upon them as they ascended .
<name> ordered his men to advance , notwithstanding this danger .
he directed them , where it was practicable , to open to one side and the other , and allow the descending wagon to pass through .
when this could not be done , they were to fall down upon the ground when they saw this strange military engine coming , and locking their shields together over their heads , allow the wagon to roll on over them , bracing up energetically against its weight .
notwithstanding these precautions , and the prodigious muscular power with which they were carried into effect , some of the men were crushed .
the great body of the army was , however , unharmed ; as soon as the force of the wagons was spent , they rushed up the ascent , and attacked their enemies with their pikes .
the barbarians fled in all directions , terrified at the force and <unk> of men whom loaded wagons , rolling over their bodies down a steep descent , could not kill .
<name> advanced from one conquest like this to another , moving toward the northward and eastward after he had crossed the mountains , until at length he approached the mouths of the danube .
here one of the great chieftains of the barbarian tribes had taken up his position , with his family and court , and a principal part of his army , upon an island called <unk> , which may be seen upon the map at the beginning of this chapter .
this island divided the current of the stream , and <name> , in attempting to attack it , found that it would be best to endeavor to effect a landing upon the upper point of it .
to make this attempt , he collected all the boats and vessels which he could obtain , and embarked his troops in them above , directing them to fall down with the current , and to land upon the island .
this plan , however , did not succeed very well ; the current was too rapid for the proper management of the boats .
the shores , too , were lined with the forces of the enemy , who discharged showers of spears and arrows at the men , and pushed off the boats when they attempted to land .
<name> at length gave up the attempt , and concluded to leave the island , and to cross the river itself further above , and thus <name> the war into the very heart of the country .
it is a serious undertaking to get a great body of men and horses across a broad and rapid river , when the people of the country have done all in their power to remove or destroy all possible means of transit , and when hostile bands are on the opposite bank , to embarrass and impede the operations by every mode in their power .
<name> , however , advanced to the undertaking with great resolution .
to cross the danube especially , with a military force , was , in those days , in the estimation of the greeks and romans , a very great exploit .
the river was so distant , so broad and rapid , and its banks were bordered and defended by such ferocious foes , that to cross its <unk> tide , and penetrate into the unknown and unexplored regions beyond , leaving the broad , and deep , and rapid stream to cut off the hopes of retreat , implied the possession of extreme self-reliance , courage , and decision .
<name> collected all the canoes and boats which he could obtain up and down the river .
he built large rafts , attaching to them the skins of beasts sewed together and inflated , to give them buoyancy .
when all was ready , they began the transportation of the army in the night , in a place where the enemy had not expected that the attempt would have been made .
there were a thousand horses , with their riders , and four thousand foot soldiers , to be conveyed across .
it is customary , in such cases , to swim the horses over , leading them by lines , the ends of which are held by men in boats .
the men themselves , with all the arms , ammunition , and baggage , had to be carried over in the boats or upon the rafts .
before morning the whole was accomplished .
the army landed in a field of grain .
this circumstance , which is casually mentioned by historians , and also the story of the wagons in the passes of mount <unk> , proves that these northern nations were not absolute barbarians in the sense in which that term is used at the present day .
the arts of cultivation and of construction must have made some progress among them , at any rate ; and they proved , by some of their conflicts with <name> , that they were <unk> and <unk> soldiers .
the macedonians swept down the waving grain with their pikes , to open a way for the advance of the cavalry , and early in the morning <name> found and attacked the army of his enemies , who were utterly astonished at finding him on their side of the river .
as may be easily anticipated , the barbarian army was beaten in the battle that ensued .
their city was taken .
the booty was taken back across the danube to be distributed among the soldiers of the army .
the neighboring nations and tribes were overawed and subdued by this exhibition of <name> 's courage and energy .
he made satisfactory treaties with them all ; took hostages , where necessary , to secure the observance of the treaties , and then recrossed the danube and set out on his return to macedon .
he found that it was time for him to return .
the southern cities and states of greece had not been unanimous in raising him to the office which his father had held .
the spartans and some others were opposed to him .
the party thus opposed were inactive and silent while <name> was in their country , on his first visit to southern greece ; but after his return they began to contemplate more decisive action , and afterward , when they heard of his having undertaken so desperate an enterprise as going northward with his forces , and actually crossing the danube , they considered him as so completely out of the way that they grew very courageous , and meditated open rebellion .
the city of thebes did at length rebel .
<name> had conquered this city in former struggles , and had left a macedonian garrison there in the citadel .
the name of the citadel was <unk> .
the officers of the garrison , supposing that all was secure , left the soldiers in the citadel , and came , themselves , down to the city to reside .
things were in this condition when the rebellion against <name> 's authority broke out .
they killed the officers who were in the city , and summoned the garrison to surrender .
the garrison refused , and the <unk> besieged it .
this outbreak against <name> 's authority was in a great measure the work of the great orator demosthenes , who spared no exertions to arouse the southern states of greece to resist <name> 's dominion .
he especially exerted all the powers of his eloquence in athens in the endeavor to bring over the athenians to take sides against <name> .
while things were in this state  the <unk> having understood that <name> had been killed at the north , and supposing that , at all events , if this report should not be true , he was , without doubt , still far away , involved in contentions with the barbarian nations , from which it was not to be expected that he could be very speedily extricated  the whole city was suddenly thrown into consternation by the report that a large macedonian army was approaching from the north , with <name> at its head , and that it was , in fact , close upon them .
it was now , however , too late for the <unk> to repent of what they had done .
they were far too deeply impressed with a conviction of the decision and energy of <name> 's character , as manifested in the whole course of his proceedings since he began to reign , and especially by his sudden reappearance among them so soon after this outbreak against his authority , to imagine that there was now any <name> for them except in determined and successful resistance .
they shut themselves up , therefore , in their city , and prepared to defend themselves to the last extremity .
<name> advanced , and , passing round the city toward the southern side , established his head-quarters there , so as to cut off effectually all communication with athens and the southern cities .
he then extended his posts all around the place so as to invest it entirely .
these preparations made , he paused before he commenced the work of subduing the city , to give the inhabitants an opportunity to submit , if they would , without compelling him to resort to force .
the conditions , however , which he imposed were such that the <unk> thought it best to take their chance of resistance .
they refused to surrender , and <name> began to prepare for the onset .
he was very soon ready , and with his characteristic ardor and energy he determined on attempting to <name> the city at once by assault .
fortified cities generally require a siege , and sometimes a very long siege , before they can be subdued .
the army within , sheltered behind the <unk> of the walls , and standing there in a position above that of their assailants , have such great advantages in the contest that a long time often <unk> before they can be compelled to surrender .
the besiegers have to invest the city on all sides to cut off all supplies of provisions , and then , in those days , they had to construct engines to make a breach somewhere in the walls , through which an assaulting party could attempt to force their way in .
the time for making an assault upon a besieged city depends upon the comparative strength of those within and without , and also , still more , on the ardor and resolution of the besiegers .
in warfare , an army , in investing a fortified place , spends ordinarily a considerable time in burrowing their way along in trenches , half under ground , until they get near enough to plant their cannon where the balls can take effect upon some part of the wall .
then some time usually <unk> before a breach is made , and the garrison is sufficiently weakened to render an assault advisable .
when , however , the time at length arrives , the most bold and desperate portion of the army are designated to lead the attack .
bundles of small branches of trees are provided to fill up ditches with , and ladders for mounting embankments and walls .
the city , sometimes , seeing these preparations going on , and convinced that the assault <name> be successful , <unk> before it is made .
when the besieged do thus surrender , they save themselves a vast amount of suffering , for the carrying of a city by assault is perhaps the most horrible scene which the passions and crimes of men ever offer to the view of heaven .
it is horrible , because the soldiers , exasperated to fury by the resistance which they meet with , and by the awful malignity of the passions always excited in the hour of battle , if they succeed , burst suddenly into the precincts of domestic life , and find sometimes thousands of families  mothers , and children , and defenseless maidens  at the <name> of passions excited to phrensy .
soldiers , under such circumstances , can not be restrained , and no imagination can conceive the horrors of the sacking of a city , carried by assault , after a protracted siege .
tigers do not spring upon their prey with greater ferocity than man springs , under such circumstances , to the <unk> of every possible cruelty upon his fellow man .
after an ordinary battle upon an open field , the conquerors have only men , armed like themselves , to wreak their vengeance upon .
the scene is awful enough , however , here .
but in carrying a city by storm , which takes place usually at an unexpected time , and often in the night , the maddened and victorious <unk> suddenly burst into the sacred scenes of domestic peace , and seclusion , and love  the very worst of men , filled with the worst of passions , stimulated by the resistance they have encountered , and <unk> by their victory to give all these passions the fullest and most <unk> gratification .
to plunder , burn , destroy , and kill , are the lighter and more harmless of the crimes they perpetrate .
thebes was carried by assault .
<name> did not wait for the slow operations of a siege .
he watched a favorable opportunity , and burst over and through the outer line of fortifications which defended the city .
the attempt to do this was very desperate , and the loss of life great ; but it was triumphantly successful .
the <unk> were driven back toward the inner wall , and began to crowd in , through the gates , into the city , in terrible confusion .
the macedonians were close upon them , and pursuers and pursued , struggling together , and trampling upon and killing each other as they went , flowed in , like a boiling and raging torrent which nothing could resist , through the open <unk> .
it was impossible to close the gates .
the whole macedonian force were soon in full possession of the now defenseless houses , and for many hours screams , and <unk> , and cries of horror and despair testified to the awful atrocity of the crimes attendant on the sacking of a city .
at length the soldiery were restrained .
order was restored .
the army retired to the posts assigned them , and <name> began to deliberate what he should do with the conquered town .
he determined to destroy it  to offer , once for all , a terrible example of the consequences of rebellion against him .
the case was not one , he considered , of the ordinary conquest of a foe .
the states of greece  thebes with the rest  had once solemnly conferred upon him the authority against which the <unk> had now rebelled .
they were traitors , therefore , in his judgment , not mere enemies , and he determined that the penalty should be utter destruction .
but , in carrying this terrible decision into effect , he acted in a manner so deliberate , discriminating , and cautious , as to diminish very much the irritation and resentment which it would otherwise have caused , and to give it its full moral effect as a measure , not of angry resentment , but of calm and deliberate retribution  just and proper , according to the ideas of the time .
in the first place , he released all the priests .
then , in respect to the rest of the population , he <unk> carefully between those who had favored the rebellion and those who had been true to their allegiance to him .
the latter were allowed to depart in safety .
and if , in the case of any family , it could be shown that one individual had been on the macedonian side , the single instance of fidelity <unk> the treason of the other members , and the whole family was saved .
and the officers appointed to <name> out these provisions were liberal in the interpretation and application of them , so as to save as many as there could be any possible pretext for saving .
the descendants and family connections of pindar , the celebrated poet , who has been already mentioned as having been born in thebes , were all pardoned also , whichever side they may have taken in the contest .
the truth was , that <name> , though he had the sagacity to see that he was placed in circumstances where prodigious moral effect in strengthening his position would be produced by an act of great severity , was swayed by so many generous impulses , which raised him above the ordinary excitements of irritation and revenge , that he had every <name> to make the suffering as light , and to limit it by as narrow bounds , as the nature of the case would allow .
he doubtless also had an instinctive feeling that the moral effect itself of so dreadful a retribution as he was about to inflict upon the devoted city would be very much increased by forbearance and generosity , and by extreme regard for the security and protection of those who had shown themselves his friends .
after all these exceptions had been made , and the persons to whom they applied had been dismissed , the rest of the population were sold into slavery , and then the city was utterly and entirely destroyed .
the number thus sold was about thirty thousand , and six thousand had been killed in the assault and storming of the city .
thus thebes was made a ruin and a desolation , and it remained so , a monument of <name> 's terrible energy and decision , for twenty years .
the effect of the destruction of thebes upon the other cities and states of greece was what might have been expected .
it came upon them like a <unk> .
although thebes was the only city which had openly revolted , there had been strong symptoms of disaffection in many other places .
demosthenes , who had been silent while <name> was present in greece , during his first visit there , had again been endeavoring to arouse opposition to macedonian ascendency , and to concentrate and bring out into action the influences which were hostile to <name> .
he said in his speeches that <name> was a mere boy , and that it was disgraceful for such cities as athens , sparta , and thebes to submit to his sway .
<name> had heard of these things , and , as he was coming down into greece , through the straits of thermopylÃ¦ , before the destruction of thebes , he said , " they say i am a boy .
i am coming to teach them that i am a man . "
he did teach them that he was a man .
his unexpected appearance , when they imagined him entangled among the mountains and wilds of unknown regions in the north ; his sudden <unk> of thebes ; the assault ; the calm deliberations in respect to the <name> of the city , and the slow , cautious , discriminating , but inexorable energy with which the decision was carried into effect , all coming in such rapid succession , impressed the grecian commonwealth with the conviction that the personage they had to deal with was no boy in character , whatever might be his years .
all symptoms of disaffection against the rule of <name> instantly disappeared , and did not soon revive again .
nor was this effect due entirely to the terror inspired by the retribution which had been visited upon thebes .
all greece was impressed with a new admiration for <name> 's character as they witnessed these events , in which his impetuous energy , his cool and calm decision , his forbearance , his magnanimity , and his faithfulness to his friends , were all so conspicuous .
his <unk> the priests , whether they had been for him or against him , made every friend of religion incline to his favor .
the same interposition in behalf of the poet 's family and descendants spoke directly to the heart of every poet , orator , historian , and philosopher throughout the country , and tended to make all the lovers of literature his friends .
his magnanimity , also , in deciding that one single friend of his in a family should save that family , instead of <unk> , as a more short-sighted conqueror would have done , that a single enemy should condemn it , must have awakened a strong feeling of gratitude and regard in the hearts of all who could appreciate fidelity to friends and generosity of spirit .
thus , as the news of the destruction of thebes , and the selling of so large a portion of the inhabitants into slavery , spread over the land , its effect was to turn over so great a part of the population to a feeling of admiration of alexander's character , and confidence in his extraordinary powers , as to leave only a small minority disposed to take sides with the punished rebels , or resent the destruction of the city .
from thebes <name> proceeded to the southward .
<unk> from the cities were sent to him , congratulating him on his victories , and offering their adhesion to his cause .
his influence and ascendency seemed firmly established now in the country of the greeks , and in due time he returned to macedon , and celebrated at <unk> , which was at this time his capital , the establishment and confirmation of his power , by games , shows , spectacles , illuminations , and sacrifices to the gods , offered on a scale of the greatest pomp and magnificence .
he was now ready to turn his thoughts toward the <unk> plan of the expedition into <name> .

on <name> 's arrival in macedon , he immediately began to turn his attention to the subject of the invasion of <name> .
he was full of ardor and enthusiasm to <name> this project into effect .
considering his extreme youth , and the <unk> character of the enterprise , it is strange that he should have exercised so much deliberation and caution as his conduct did really evince .
he had now settled every thing in the most thorough manner , both within his dominions and among the nations on his borders , and , as it seemed to him , the time had come when he was to commence active preparations for the great asiatic campaign .
he brought the subject before his ministers and counselors .
they , in general , concurred with him in opinion .
there were , however , two who were in doubt , or rather who were , in fact , opposed to the plan , though they expressed their <unk> in the form of doubts .
these two persons were antipater and parmenio , the venerable officers who have been already mentioned as having served <name> so faithfully , and as transferring , on the death of the father , their attachment and allegiance at once to the son .
antipater and parmenio represented to <name> that if he were to go to <name> at that time , he would put to extreme hazard all the interests of macedon .
as he had no family , there was , of course , no direct heir to the crown , and , in case of any misfortune happening by which his life should be lost , macedon would become at once the prey of contending factions , which would immediately arise , each presenting its own candidate for the vacant throne .
the sagacity and foresight which these statesmen evinced in these suggestions were abundantly confirmed in the end .
<name> did die in <name> , his vast kingdom at once fell into pieces , and it was desolated with internal commotions and civil wars for a long period after his death .
parmenio and antipater accordingly advised the king to postpone his expedition .
they advised him to seek a wife among the princesses of greece , and then to settle down quietly to the duties of domestic life , and to the government of his kingdom for a few years ; then , when every thing should have become settled and consolidated in greece , and his family was established in the hearts of his countrymen , he could leave macedon more safely .
public affairs would go on more steadily while he lived , and , in case of his death , the crown would descend , with comparatively little danger of civil commotion , to his heir .
but <name> was fully decided against any such policy as this .
he resolved to embark in the great expedition at once .
he concluded to make antipater his <unk> in macedon during his absence , and to take parmenio with him into <name> .
it <name> be remembered that antipater was the statesman and parmenio the general ; that is , antipater had been employed more by <name> in civil , and parmenio in military affairs , though in those days every body who was in public life was more or less a soldier .
<name> left an army of ten or twelve thousand men with antipater for the protection of macedon .
he organized another army of about thirty-five thousand to go with him .
this was considered a very small army for such a vast undertaking .
one or two hundred years before this time , <name> , a king of persia , had invaded greece with an army of five hundred thousand men , and yet he had been defeated and driven back , and now <name> was undertaking to <unk> with a great deal less than one tenth part of the force .
of <name> 's army of thirty-five thousand , thirty thousand were foot soldiers , and about five thousand were horse .
more than half the whole army was from macedon .
the remainder was from the southern states of greece .
a large body of the horse was from thessaly , which , as <name> be seen on the map , [ a ] was a country south of macedon .
it was , in fact , one broad expanded valley , with mountains all around .
torrents descended from these mountains , forming streams which flowed in currents more and more deep and slow as they descended into the plains , and combining at last into one central river , which flowed to the eastward , and escaped from the <unk> of mountains through a most celebrated <name> called the vale of <unk> .
on the north of this valley is olympus , and on the south the two twin mountains <unk> and <unk> .
there was an ancient story of a war in thessaly between the giants who were imagined to have lived there in very early days , and the gods .
the giants piled <unk> upon <unk> to enable them to get up to heaven in their assault upon their celestial enemies .
the fable has led to a proverb which prevails in every language in europe , by which all extravagant and unheard-of exertions to accomplish an end is said to be a piling of <unk> upon <unk> .
[ footnote a : at the commencement of chapter iii . ]
thessaly was famous for its horses and its horsemen .
the slopes of the mountains furnished the best of pasturage for the rearing of the animals , and the plains below afforded broad and open fields for training and exercising the bodies of cavalry formed by means of them .
the <unk> horses were famous throughout all greece .
bucephalus was reared in thessaly .
<name> , as king of macedon , possessed extensive estates and revenues , which were his own personal property , and were independent of the revenues of the state .
before setting out on his expedition , he <unk> these among his great officers and generals , both those who were to go and those who were to remain .
he evinced great generosity in this , but it was , after all , the spirit of ambition , more than that of generosity , which led him to do it .
the two great impulses which animated him were the pleasure of doing great deeds , and the fame and <name> of having done them .
these two principles are very distinct in their nature , though often conjoined .
they were paramount and supreme in <name> 's character , and every other human principle was subordinate to them .
money was to him , accordingly , only a means to enable him to accomplish these ends .
his distributing his estates and revenues in the manner above described was only a judicious appropriation of the money to the promotion of the great ends he wished to attain ; it was expenditure , not gift .
it answered admirably the end he had in view .
his friends all looked upon him as extremely generous and self-sacrificing .
they asked him what he had reserved for himself .
" <name> , " said <name> .
at length all things were ready , and <name> began to celebrate the religious sacrifices , spectacles , and shows which , in those days , always preceded great undertakings of this kind .
there was a great ceremony in honor of jupiter and the nine muses , which had long been celebrated in macedon as a sort of annual national festival .
<name> now caused great preparations for this festival .
in the days of the greeks , public worship and public amusement were combined in one and the same series of spectacles and ceremonies .
all worship was a theatrical show , and almost all shows were forms of worship .
the religious instincts of the human heart demand some sort of sympathy and aid , real or imaginary , from the invisible world , in great and solemn undertakings , and in every momentous crisis in its history .
it is true that <name> 's soldiers , about to leave their homes to go to another quarter of the globe , and into scenes of danger and death from which it was very improbable that many of them would ever return , had no other celestial protection to look up to than the spirits of ancient heroes , who , they imagined , had , somehow or other , found their final home in a sort of heaven among the summits of the mountains , where they reigned , in some sense , over human affairs ; but this , small as it seems to us , was a great deal to them .
they felt , when sacrificing to these gods , that they were <unk> their presence and sympathy .
these deities having been engaged in the same enterprises themselves , and animated with the same hopes and fears , the soldiers imagined that the semi-human divinities invoked by them would take an interest in their dangers , and rejoice is their success .
the muses , in honor of whom , as well as jupiter , this great macedonian festival was held , were nine singing and dancing maidens , beautiful in countenance and form , and <unk> graceful in all their movements .
they came , the ancients imagined , from thrace , in the north , and went first to jupiter upon mount olympus , who made them goddesses .
afterward they went southward , and spread over greece , making their residence , at last , in a palace upon mount <unk> , which <name> be found upon the map just north of the gulf of corinth and west of <unk> .
they were worshiped all over greece and italy as the goddesses of music and dancing .
in later times particular sciences and arts were assigned to them respectively , as history , astronomy , tragedy , & c. , though there was no distinction of this kind in early days .
the festivities in honor of jupiter and the muses were continued in macedon nine days , a number corresponding with that of the dancing goddesses .
<name> made very magnificent preparations for the celebration on this occasion .
he had a tent made , under which , it is said , a hundred tables could be spread ; and here he entertained , day after day , an enormous company of princes , potentates , and generals .
he offered sacrifices to such of the gods as he supposed it would please the soldiers to imagine that they had <unk> .
connected with these sacrifices and <unk> , there were athletic and military spectacles and shows  races and <unk>  and mock contests , with blunted spears .
all these things encouraged and quickened the ardor and animation of the soldiers .
it aroused their ambition to distinguish themselves by their exploits , and gave them an increased and stimulated <name> for honor and fame .
thus <unk> by new desires for human praise , and trusting in the sympathy and protection of powers which were all that they conceived of as divine , the army prepared to set forth from their native land , bidding it a long , and , as it proved to most of them , a final farewell .
by following the course of <name> 's expedition upon the map at the commencement of chapter iii. , it <name> be seen that his route lay first along the northern coasts of the Ã¦gean sea .
he was to pass from europe into <name> by crossing the hellespont between <unk> and <unk> .
he sent a fleet of a hundred and fifty galleys , of three banks of oars each , over the Ã¦gean sea , to land at <unk> , and be ready to transport his army across the straits .
the army , in the mean time , marched by land .
they had to cross the rivers which flow into the Ã¦gean sea on the northern side ; but as these rivers were in macedon , and no opposition was encountered upon the banks of them , there was no serious difficulty in effecting the passage .
when they reached <unk> , they found the fleet ready there , awaiting their arrival .
it is very strikingly characteristic of the mingling of poetic sentiment and enthusiasm with calm and calculating business efficiency , which shone conspicuously so often in <name> 's career , that when he arrived at <unk> , and found that the ships were there , and the army safe , and that there was no enemy to oppose his landing on the asiatic shore , he left parmenio to conduct the transportation of the troops across the water , while he himself went away in a single galley on an excursion of sentiment and romantic adventure .
a little south of the place where his army was to cross , there lay , on the asiatic shore , an extended plain , on which were the ruins of <name> .
now <name> was the city which was the scene of <name> 's poems  those poems which had excited so much interest in the mind of <name> in his early years ; and he determined , instead of crossing the hellespont with the main body of his army , to proceed southward in a single galley , and land , himself , on the asiatic shore , on the very spot which the romantic imagination of his youth had dwelt upon so often and so long .
[ illustration : the plain of <name> . ]
<name> was situated upon a plain .
<name> describes an island off the coast , named <unk> , and a mountain near called mount <name> .
there was also a river called the <unk> .
the island , the mountain , and the river remain , preserving their original names to the present day , except that the river is now called the <unk> , but , although various vestiges of ancient ruins are found scattered about the plain , no spot can be identified as the site of the city .
some scholars have maintained that there probably never was such a city ; that <name> invented the whole , there being nothing real in all that he describes except the river , the mountain , and the island .
his story is , however , that there was a great and powerful city there , with a kingdom attached to it , and that this city was besieged by the greeks for ten years , at the end of which time it was taken and destroyed .
the story of the origin of this war is substantially this .
priam was king of <name> .
his wife , a short time before her son was born , dreamed that at his birth the child turned into a torch and set the palace on fire .
she told this dream to the soothsayers , and asked them what it meant .
they said it must mean that her son would be the means of bringing some terrible calamities and disasters upon the family .
the mother was terrified , and , to avert these calamities , gave the child to a slave as soon as it was born , and ordered him to destroy it .
the slave pitied the helpless babe , and , not liking to destroy it with his own hand , carried it to mount <name> , and left it there in the forests to die .
a she bear , roaming through the woods , found the child , and , experiencing a feeling of maternal tenderness for it , she took care of it , and reared it as if it had been her own offspring .
the child was found , at last , by some shepherds who lived upon the mountain , and they adopted it as their own , robbing the brute mother of her charge .
they named the boy <name> .
he grew in strength and beauty , and gave early and extraordinary proofs of courage and energy , as if he had imbibed some of the qualities of his fierce <name> mother with the milk she gave him .
he was so remarkable for athletic beauty and manly courage , that he not only easily won the heart of a <unk> of mount <name> , named <unk> , whom he married , but he also attracted the attention of the goddesses in the heavens .
at length these goddesses had a dispute which they agreed to refer to him .
the origin of the dispute was this .
there was a wedding among them , and one of them , irritated at not having been invited , had a golden apple made , on which were engraved the words , " to be given to the most beautiful . "
she threw this apple into the assembly : her object was to make them quarrel for it .
in fact , she was herself the goddess of discord , and , independently of her cause of pique in this case , she loved to promote disputes .
it is in allusion to this ancient tale that any subject of dispute , brought up unnecessarily among friends , is called to this day an apple of discord .
three of the goddesses claimed the apple , each insisting that she was more beautiful than the others , and this was the dispute which they agreed to refer to <name> .
they accordingly exhibited themselves before him in the mountains , that he might look at them and decide .
they did not , however , seem willing , either of them , to trust to an impartial decision of the question , but each offered the judge a bribe to induce him to decide in her favor .
one promised him a kingdom , another great fame , and the third , <name> , promised him the most beautiful woman in the world for his wife .
he decided in favor of <name> ; whether because she was justly entitled to the decision , or through the influence of the bribe , the story does not say .
all this time <name> remained on the mountain , a simple shepherd and herdsman , not knowing his relationship to the monarch who reigned over the city and kingdom on the plain below .
king priam , however , about this time , in some games which he was celebrating , offered , as a prize to the <name> , the finest bull which could be obtained on mount <name> .
on making examination , <name> was found to have the finest bull and the king , exercising the despotic power which kings in those days made no scruple of assuming in respect to helpless peasants , took it away .
<name> was very indignant .
it happened , however , that a short time afterward there was another opportunity to contend for the same bull , and <name> , <unk> himself as a <name> , appeared in the lists , conquered every competitor , and bore away the bull again to his home in the fastnesses of the mountain .
in consequence of this his appearance at court , the daughter of priam , whose name was <name> , became acquainted with him , and , inquiring into his story , succeeded in ascertaining that he was her brother , the long-lost child , that had been supposed to be put to death .
king priam was convinced by the evidence which she brought forward , and <name> was brought home to his father 's house .
after becoming established in his new position , he remembered the promise of <name> that he should have the most beautiful woman in the world for his wife , and he began , accordingly , to inquire where he could find her .
[ illustration : <name> and <name> . ]
there was in sparta , one of the cities of southern greece , a certain king <unk> , who had a youthful bride named <name> , who was famed far and near for her beauty .
<name> came to the conclusion that she was the most lovely woman in the world , and that he was entitled , in virtue of <name> 's promise , to obtain possession of her , if he could do so by any means whatever .
he accordingly made a journey into greece , visited sparta , formed an acquaintance with <name> , persuaded her to abandon her husband and her duty , and <unk> with him to <name> .
<unk> was indignant at this outrage .
he called on all greece to take up arms and join him in the attempt to recover his bride .
they responded to this demand .
they first sent to priam , demanding that he should restore <name> to her husband .
priam refused to do so , taking part with his son .
the greeks then raised a fleet and an army , and came to the plains of <name> , encamped before the city , and persevered for ten long years in besieging it , when at length it was taken and destroyed .
these stories relating to the origin of the war , however , marvelous and entertaining as they are , were not the points which chiefly interested the mind of <name> .
the portions of <name> 's narratives which most excited his enthusiasm were those relating to the characters of the heroes who fought , on one side and on the other , at the siege , their various adventures , and the <unk> of their motives and principles of conduct , and the emotions and excitements they experienced in the various circumstances in which they were placed .
<name> described with great beauty and force the workings of ambition , of resentment , of pride , of rivalry , and all those other impulses of the human heart which would excite and control the action of impetuous men in the circumstances in which his heroes were placed .
each one of the heroes whose history and adventures he gives , possessed a well-marked and striking character , and differed in temperament and action from the rest .
achilles was one .
he was fiery , impetuous , and implacable in character , fierce and merciless ; and , though perfectly undaunted and fearless , entirely destitute of magnanimity .
there was a river called the <unk> , the waters of which were said to have the property of making any one invulnerable .
the mother of achilles dipped him into it in his infancy , holding him by the heel .
the heel , not having been immersed , was the only part which could be wounded .
thus he was safe in battle , and was a terrible warrior .
he , however , quarreled with his comrades and withdrew from their cause on slight pretexts , and then became reconciled again , influenced by equally frivolous reasons .
[ illustration : achilles . ]
<unk> was the commander-in-chief of the greek army .
after a certain victory , by which some captives were taken , and were to be divided among the victors , <unk> was obliged to restore one , a <name> <name> , who had fallen to his share , and he took away the one that had been assigned to achilles to replace her .
this incensed achilles , and he withdrew for a long time from the contest ; and , in consequence of his absence , the trojans gained great and continued victories against the greeks .
for a long time nothing could induce achilles to return .
at length , however , though he would not go himself , he allowed his intimate friend , whose name was <unk> , to take his armor and go into battle .
<unk> was at first successful , but was soon killed by <name> , the brother of <name> .
this aroused anger and a spirit of revenge in the mind of achilles .
he gave up his quarrel with <unk> and returned to the combat .
he did not <unk> his exertions till he had slain <name> , and then he expressed his brutal exultation , and satisfied his revenge , by dragging the dead body at the wheels of his chariot around the walls of the city .
he then sold the body to the distracted father for a ransom .
it was such stories as these , which are related in the poems of <name> with great beauty and power , that had chiefly interested the mind of <name> .
the subjects interested him ; the accounts of the contentions , the rivalries , the exploits of these warriors , the <unk> of their character and springs of action , and the <unk> of the various incidents and events to which such a war gave rise , were all calculated to <unk> the imagination of a young martial hero .
<name> accordingly resolved that his first landing in <name> should be at <name> .
he left his army under the charge of parmenio , to cross from <unk> to <unk> , while he himself set forth in a single galley to proceed to the southward .
there was a port on the trojan shore where the greeks had been accustomed to <unk> , and he steered his course for it .
he had a bull on board his galley which he was going to offer as a sacrifice to neptune when half way from shore to shore .
neptune was the god of the sea .
it is true that the hellespont is not the open ocean , but it is an arm of the sea , and thus belonged properly to the dominions which the ancients assigned to the divinity of the waters .
neptune was conceived of by the ancients as a monarch dwelling on the seas or upon the coasts , and riding over the waves seated in a great shell , or sometimes in a chariot , drawn by <unk> or <unk> .
in these excursions he was attended by a train of <unk> and <unk> , who , half floating , half swimming , followed him over the billows .
instead of a scepter neptune carried a <unk> .
a <unk> was a sort of <unk> harpoon , such as was used in those days by the fishermen of the mediterranean .
it was from this circumstance , probably , that it was chosen as the badge of authority for the god of the sea .
<name> took the helm , and steered the galley with his own hands toward the asiatic shore .
just before he reached the land , he took his place upon the prow , and threw a javelin at the shore as he approached it , a symbol of the spirit of defiance and hostility with which he advanced to the frontiers of the eastern world .
he was also the first to land .
after <unk> his company , he offered sacrifices to the gods , and then proceeded to visit the places which had been the scenes of the events which <name> had described .
<name> had written five hundred years before the time of <name> , and there is some doubt whether the ruins and the remains of cities which our hero found there were really the scenes of the narratives which had interested him so deeply .
he , however , at any rate , believed them to be so , and he was filled with enthusiasm and pride as he wandered among them .
he seems to have been most interested in the character of achilles , and he said that he envied him his happy lot in having such a friend as <unk> to help him perform his exploits , and such a poet as <name> to celebrate them .
after completing his visit upon the plain of <name> , <name> moved toward the northeast with the few men who had accompanied him in his single galley .
in the mean time parmenio had crossed safely , with the main body of the army , from <unk> to <unk> .
<name> overtook them on their march , not far from the place of their landing .
to the northward of this place , on the left of the line of march which <name> was taking , was the city of <unk> .
now a large portion of <name> minor , although for the most part under the dominion of persia , had been in a great measure settled by greeks , and , in previous wars between the two nations , the various cities had been in possession , sometimes of one power and sometimes of the other .
in these contests the city of <unk> had incurred the high displeasure of the greeks by <unk> , as they said , on one occasion , against them .
<name> determined to destroy it as he passed .
the inhabitants were aware of this intention , and sent an embassador to <name> to implore his <name> .
when the embassador approached , <name> , knowing his errand , uttered a declaration in which he bound himself by a solemn oath not to <name> the request he was about to make .
" i have come , " said the embassador , " to implore you to destroy <unk> . "
<name> , pleased with the readiness of the embassador in giving his language such a sudden turn , and perhaps influenced by his oath , spared the city .
he was now fairly in <name> .
the persian forces were gathering to attack him , but so unexpected and sudden had been his invasion that they were not prepared to meet him at his arrival , and he advanced without opposition till he reached the banks of the little river <unk> .

although <name> had landed safely on the asiatic shore , the way was not yet fairly open for him to advance into the interior of the country .
he was upon a sort of plain , which was separated from the territory beyond by natural barriers .
on the south was the range of lofty land called mount <name> .
from the northeastern slopes of this mountain there descended a stream which flowed north into the sea , thus <unk> <name> 's army in .
he must either scale the mountain or cross the river before he could penetrate into the interior .
he thought it would be easiest to cross the river .
it is very difficult to get a large body of horsemen and of <unk> soldiers , with all their attendants and baggage , over high elevations of land .
this was the reason why the army turned to the northward after landing upon the asiatic shore .
<name> thought the <unk> less of an obstacle than mount <name> .
it was not a large stream , and was easily <unk> .
[ illustration : the <unk> . ]
it was the custom in those days , as it is now when armies are marching , to send forward small bodies of men in every direction to explore the roads , remove obstacles , and discover sources of danger .
these men are called , in modern times , scouts ; in <name> 's day , and in the greek language , they were called <unk> , which means <unk> .
it is the duty of these pioneers to send messengers back continually to the main body of the army , informing the officers of every thing important which comes under their observation .
in this case , when the army was gradually drawing near to the river , the <unk> came in with the news that they had been to the river , and found the whole opposite shore , at the place of crossing , lined with persian troops , collected there to dispute the passage .
the army continued their advance , while <name> called the leading generals around him , to consider what was to be done .
parmenio recommended that they should not attempt to pass the river immediately .
the persian army consisted chiefly of cavalry .
now cavalry , though very terrible as an enemy on the field of battle by day , are peculiarly exposed and defenseless in an encampment by night .
the horses are scattered , feeding or at rest .
the arms of the men are light , and they are not accustomed to fighting on foot ; and on a sudden incursion of an enemy at midnight into their camp , their horses and their horsemanship are alike useless , and they fall an easy prey to resolute invaders .
parmenio thought , therefore , that the persians would not dare to remain and encamp many days in the vicinity of <name> 's army , and that , accordingly , if they waited a little , the enemy would retreat , and <name> could then cross the river without <unk> the danger of a battle .
but <name> was unwilling to adopt any such policy .
he felt confident that his army was courageous and strong enough to march on , directly through the river , ascend the bank upon the other side , and force their way through all the opposition which the persians could make .
he knew , too , that if this were done it would create a strong sensation throughout the whole country , impressing every one with a sense of the energy and power of the army which he was conducting , and would thus tend to intimidate the enemy , and facilitate all future operations .
but this was not all ; he had a more powerful motive still for wishing to march right on , across the river , and force his way through the vast bodies of cavalry on the opposite shore , and this was the pleasure of performing the exploit .
accordingly , as the army advanced to the banks , they <unk> to form in order of battle , and prepared to continue their march as if there were no obstacle to oppose them .
the general order of battle of the macedonian army was this .
there was a certain body of troops , armed and organized in a peculiar manner , called the phalanx .
this body was placed in the center .
the men composing it were very heavily armed .
they had shields upon the left arm , and they carried spears sixteen feet long , and pointed with iron , which they held firmly in their two hands , with the points projecting far before them .
the men were arranged in lines , one behind the other , and all facing the enemy  sixteen lines , and a thousand in each line , or , as it is expressed in military phrase , a thousand in rank and sixteen in file , so that the phalanx contained sixteen thousand men .
the spears were so long that when the men stood in close order , the rear ranks being brought up near to those before them , the points of the spears of eight or ten of the ranks projected in front , forming a bristling wall of points of steel , each one of which was held in its place by the strong arms of an athletic and <unk> soldier .
this wall no force which could in those days be brought against it could penetrate .
men , horses , elephants , every thing that attempted to rush upon it , rushed only to their own destruction .
every spear , feeling the impulse of the vigorous arms which held it , seemed to be alive , and darted into its enemy , when an enemy was at hand , as if it felt itself the fierce hostility which directed it .
if the enemy remained at a distance , and threw javelins or darts at the phalanx , they fell harmless , stopped by the shields which the soldiers wore upon the left arm , and which were held in such a manner as to form a system of scales , which covered and protected the whole mass , and made the men almost invulnerable .
the phalanx was thus , when only defending itself and in a state of rest , an army and a fortification all in one , and it was almost impregnable .
but when it took an aggressive form , put itself in motion , and advanced to an attack , it was infinitely more formidable .
it became then a terrible monster , covered with scales of brass , from beneath which there projected forward ten thousand living , darting points of iron .
it advanced deliberately and calmly , but with a prodigious momentum and force .
there was nothing human in its appearance at all .
it was a huge animal , ferocious , dogged , stubborn , insensible to pain , knowing no fear , and bearing down with resistless and merciless destruction upon every thing that came in its way .
the phalanx was the center and soul of <name> 's army .
powerful and impregnable as it was , however , in ancient days , it would be helpless and defenseless on a modern battle-field .
solid balls of iron , flying through the air with a velocity which makes them invisible , would tear their way through the pikes and the shields , and the bodies of the men who bore them , without even feeling the obstruction .
the phalanx was subdivided into brigades , regiments , and battalions , and regularly officered .
in marching , it was separated into these its constituent parts , and sometimes in battle it acted in divisions .
it was stationed in the center of the army on the field , and on the two sides of it were bodies of cavalry and foot soldiers , more lightly armed than the soldiers of the phalanx , who could accordingly move with more <unk> and speed , and <name> their action readily wherever it might be called for .
those troops on the sides were called the wings .
<name> himself was accustomed to command one wing and parmenio the other , while the phalanx crept along slowly but terribly between .
the army , thus arranged and organized , advanced to the river .
it was a broad and shallow stream .
the persians had assembled in vast <name> on the opposite shore .
some historians say there were one hundred thousand men , others say two hundred thousand , and others six hundred thousand .
however this may be , there is no doubt their <name> were vastly superior to those of <name> 's army , which it <name> be recollected was less than forty thousand .
there was a narrow plain on the opposite side of the river , next to the shore , and a range of hills beyond .
the persian cavalry covered the plain , and were ready to dash upon the macedonian troops the moment they should emerge from the water and attempt to ascend the bank .
the army , led by <name> , descended into the stream , and moved on through the water .
they encountered the onset of their enemies on the opposite shore .
a terrible and a protracted struggle ensued , but the coolness , courage , and strength of <name> 's army carried the day .
the persians were driven back , the greeks effected their landing , reorganized and formed on the shore , and the persians , finding that all was lost , fled in all directions .
<name> himself took a conspicuous and a very active part in the contest .
he was easily recognized on the field of battle by his dress , and by a white plume which he wore in his helmet .
he exposed himself to the most imminent danger .
at one time , when desperately engaged with a troop of horse , which had galloped down upon him , a persian horseman aimed a blow at his head with a sword .
<name> saved his head from the blow , but it took off his plume and a part of his helmet .
<name> immediately thrust his antagonist through the body .
at the same moment , another horseman , on another side , had his sword raised , and would have killed <name> before he could have turned to defend himself , had no help intervened ; but just at this instant a third <unk> , one of <name> 's friends , seeing the danger , brought down so terrible a blow upon the shoulder of this second assailant as to separate his arm from his body .
such are the stories that are told .
they may have been literally and fully true , or they may have been exaggerations of circumstances somewhat resembling them which really occurred , or they may have been fictitious altogether .
great generals , like other great men , have often the credit of many exploits which they never perform .
it is the special business of poets and historians to magnify and embellish the actions of the great , and this <name> was understood as well in ancient days as it is now .
we must remember , too , in reading the accounts of these transactions , that it is only the greek side of the story that we hear .
the persian narratives have not come down to us .
at any rate , the persian army was defeated , and that , too , without the assistance of the phalanx .
the horsemen and the light troops were alone engaged .
the phalanx could not be formed , nor could it act in such a position .
the men , on emerging from the water , had to climb up the banks , and rush on to the attack of an enemy consisting of squadrons of horse ready to dash at once upon them .
the persian army was defeated and driven away .
<name> did not pursue them .
he felt that he had struck a very heavy blow .
the news of this defeat of the persians would go with the speed of the wind all over <name> minor , and operate most powerfully in his favor .
he sent home to greece an account of the victory , and with the account he forwarded three hundred suits of armor , taken from the persian horsemen killed on the field .
these suits of armor were to be <name> up in the parthenon , a great <name> at athens ; the most conspicuous position for them , perhaps , which all europe could afford .
the name of the persian general who commanded at the battle of the <unk> was <unk> .
he had been opposed to the plan of <unk> a battle .
<name> had come to <name> with no provisions and no money .
he had relied on being able to sustain his army by his victories .
<unk> , therefore , strongly urged that the persians should retreat slowly , carrying off all the valuable property , and destroying all that could not be removed , taking especial care to leave no provisions behind them .
in this way he thought that the army of <name> would be reduced by privation and want , and would , in the end , fall an easy prey .
his opinion was , however , overruled by the views of the other commanders , and the battle of the <unk> was the consequence .
<name> encamped to refresh his army and to take care of the wounded .
he went to see the wounded men one by one , inquired into the circumstances of each case , and listened to each one who was able to talk , while he gave an account of his adventures in the battle , and the manner in which he received his wound .
to be able thus to tell their story to their general , and to see him listening to it with interest and pleasure , filled their hearts with pride and <name> ; and the whole army was inspired with the highest spirit of enthusiasm , and with eager desires to have another opportunity occur in which they could encounter danger and death in the service of such a leader .
it is in such traits as these that the true greatness of the soul of <name> shines .
it must be remembered that all this time he was but little more than twenty-one .
he was but just of age .
from his encampment on the <unk> <name> turned to the southward , and moved along on the eastern shores of the Ã¦gean sea .
the country generally surrendered to him without opposition .
in fact , it was hardly persian territory at all .
the inhabitants were mainly of greek extraction , and had been sometimes under greek and sometimes under persian rule .
the conquest of the country resulted simply in a change of the executive officer of each province .
<name> took special pains to lead the people to feel that they had nothing to fear from him .
he would not allow the soldiers to do any injury .
he protected all private property .
he took possession only of the <unk> , and of such governmental property as he found there , and he continued the same taxes , the same laws , and the same <unk> as had existed before his invasion .
the cities and the provinces accordingly surrendered to him as he passed along , and in a very short time all the western part of <name> minor submitted peacefully to his sway .
the narrative of this progress , as given by the ancient historians , is diversified by a great variety of adventures and incidents , which give great interest to the story , and strikingly illustrate the character of <name> and the spirit of the times .
in some places there would be a contest between the greek and the persian parties before <name> 's arrival .
at ephesus the animosity had been so great that a sort of civil war had broken out .
the greek party had gained the ascendency , and were threatening a general massacre of the persian inhabitants .
<name> promptly interposed to protect them , though they were his enemies .
the intelligence of this act of forbearance and generosity spread all over the land , and added greatly to the influence of <name> 's name , and to the estimation in which he was held .
it was the custom in those days for the mass of the common soldiers to be greatly influenced by what they called omens , that is , signs and tokens which they observed in the flight or the actions of birds , and other similar appearances .
in one case , the fleet , which had come along the sea , accompanying the march of the army on land , was pent up in a harbor by a stronger persian fleet outside .
one of the vessels of the macedonian fleet was aground .
an eagle lighted upon the mast , and stood perched there for a long time , looking toward the sea .
parmenio said that , as the eagle looked toward the sea , it indicated that victory lay in that quarter , and he recommended that they should arm their ships and push boldly out to attack the persians .
but <name> maintained that , as the eagle alighted on a ship which was aground , it indicated that they were to look for their success on the shore .
the omens could thus almost always be interpreted any way , and sagacious generals only sought in them the means of confirming the courage and confidence of their soldiers , in respect to the plans which they adopted under the influence of other considerations altogether .
<name> knew very well that he was not a sailor , and had no <name> to embark in contests from which , however they might end , he would himself personally obtain no <name> .
when the <name> came on , <name> and his army were about three or four hundred miles from home ; and , as he did not intend to advance much farther until the spring should open , he announced to the army that all those persons , both officers and soldiers who had been married within the year , might go home if they chose , and spend the <name> with their brides , and return to the army in the spring .
no doubt this was an admirable stroke of policy ; for , as the number could not be large , their absence could not materially weaken his force , and they would , of course , fill all greece with tales of alexander's energy and courage , and of the nobleness and generosity of his character .
it was the most effectual way possible of <unk> through europe the most brilliant accounts of what he had already done .
besides , it must have awakened a new bond of sympathy and <unk> between himself and his soldiers , and greatly increased the attachment to him felt both by those who went and those who remained .
and though <name> must have been aware of all these advantages of the act , still no one could have thought of or adopted such a plan unless he was accustomed to consider and regard , in his dealings with others , the feelings and affections of the heart , and to <name> a warm sympathy for them .
the bridegroom soldiers , full of exultation and pleasure , set forth on their return to greece , in a detachment under the charge of three generals , themselves <unk> too .
<name> , however , had no idea of remaining idle during the <name> .
he marched on from province to province , and from city to city , meeting with every variety of adventures .
he went first along the southern coast , until at length he came to a place where a mountain chain , called <unk> , comes down to the sea-coast , where it terminates abruptly in cliffs and precipices , leaving only a narrow beach between them and the water below .
this beach was sometimes covered and sometimes bare .
it is true , there is very little tide in the mediterranean , but the level of the water along the shores is altered considerably by the long-continued pressure exerted in one direction or another by winds and storms .
the water was up when <name> reached this pass ; still he determined to march his army through it .
there was another way , back among the mountains , but <name> seemed disposed to gratify the love of adventure which his army felt , by introducing them to a novel scene of danger .
they accordingly defiled along under these cliffs , marching , as they say , sometimes up to the waist in water , the swell rolling in upon them all the time from the offing .
having at length succeeded in passing safely round this frowning <unk> of the mountains , <name> turned northward , and advanced into the very heart of <name> minor .
in doing this he had to pass over the range which he had come round before ; and , as it was <name> , his army were , for a time , enveloped in snows and storms among the wild and frightful defiles .
they had here , in addition to the dangers and hardships of the way and of the season , to encounter the hostility of their foes , as the tribes who inhabited these mountains assembled to dispute the passage .
<name> was victorious , and reached a valley through which there flows a river which has handed down its name to the english language and literature .
this river was the <unk> .
its beautiful windings through verdant and fertile valleys were so renowned , that every stream which imitates its example is said to <unk> to the present day .
during all this time parmenio had remained in the western part of <name> minor with a considerable body of the army .
as the spring approached , <name> sent him orders to go to <unk> , whither he was himself proceeding , and meet him there .
he also directed that the detachment which had gone home should , on <unk> the hellespont , on their return , proceed eastward to <unk> , thus making that city the general rendezvous for the commencement of his next campaign .
one reason why <name> desired to go to <unk> was that he wished to untie the famous <unk> knot .
the story of the <unk> knot was this .
<unk> was a sort of mountain farmer .
one day he was plowing , and an eagle came down and alighted upon his yoke , and remained there until he had finished his plowing .
this was an omen , but what was the signification of it ?
<unk> did not know , and he accordingly went to a neighboring town in order to consult the prophets and soothsayers .
on his way he met a damsel , who , like <name> in the days of <name> , was going forth to draw water .
<unk> fell into conversation with her , and related to her the occurrence which had interested him so strongly .
the maiden advised him to go back and offer a sacrifice to jupiter .
finally , she consented to go back with him and aid him .
the affair ended in her becoming his wife , and they lived together in peace for many years upon their farm .
they had a son named <unk> .
the father and mother were accustomed to go out sometimes in their cart or wagon , drawn by the oxen , <unk> driving .
one day they were going into the town in this way , at a time when it happened that there was an assembly convened , which was in a state of great perplexity on account of the civil dissensions and contests which prevailed in the country .
they had just inquired of an oracle what they should do .
the oracle said that " a cart would bring them a king , who would terminate their eternal <unk> . "
just then <unk> came up , driving the cart in which his father and mother were seated .
the assembly thought at once that this must be the cart meant by the oracle , and they made <unk> king by <unk> .
they took the cart and the yoke to preserve as sacred relics , <unk> them to jupiter ; and <unk> tied the yoke to the pole of the cart by a thong of leather , making a knot so close and complicated that nobody could untie it again .
it was called the <unk> knot .
the oracle afterward said that whoever should untie this knot should become monarch of all <name> .
thus far , nobody had succeeded .
<name> felt a great <name> to see this knot and try what he could do .
he went , accordingly , into the <name> where the sacred cart had been deposited , and , after looking at the knot , and satisfying himself that the task of <unk> it was hopeless , he cut it to pieces with his sword .
how far the circumstances of this whole story are true , and how far fictitious , no one can tell ; the story itself , however , as thus related , has come down from generation to generation , in every country of europe , for two thousand years , and any <unk> of one 's self from a difficulty by violent means has been called cutting the <unk> knot to the present day .
[ illustration : the bathing in the river <unk> . ]
at length the whole army was assembled , and the king recommenced his progress .
he went on successfully for some weeks , moving in a <unk> direction , and bringing the whole country under his dominion , until , at length , when he reached tarsus , an event occurred which nearly terminated his career .
there were some circumstances which caused him to press forward with the utmost effort in approaching tarsus , and , as the day was warm , he got very much overcome with heat and fatigue .
in this state , he went and plunged suddenly into the river <unk> to bathe .
now the <unk> is a small stream , flowing by tarsus , and it comes down from mount <unk> at a short distance back from the city .
such streams are always very cold .
<name> was immediately seized with a very violent chill , and was taken out of the water shivering excessively , and , at length , fainted away .
they thought he was dying .
they bore him to his tent , and , as tidings of their leader 's danger spread through the camp , the whole army , officers and soldiers , were thrown into the greatest consternation and grief .
a violent and protracted fever came on .
in the course of it , an incident occurred which strikingly illustrates the boldness and originality of <name> 's character .
the name of his physician was <name> .
<name> had been preparing a particular medicine for him , which , it seems , required some days to make ready .
just before it was presented , <name> received a letter from parmenio , informing him that he had good reason to believe that <name> had been bribed by the persians to murder him , during his sickness , by administering poison in the name of medicine .
he wrote , he said , to put him on his guard against any medicine which <name> might offer him .
<name> put the letter under his pillow , and communicated its contents to no one .
at length , when the medicine was ready , <name> brought it in .
<name> took the cup containing it with one hand , and with the other he handed <name> the communication which he had received from parmenio , saying , " read that letter . "
as soon as <name> had finished reading it , and was ready to look up , <name> drank off the draught in full , and laid down the cup with an air of perfect confidence that he had nothing to fear .
some persons think that <name> watched the countenance of his physician while he was reading the letter , and that he was led to take the medicine by his confidence in his power to determine the guilt or the innocence of a person thus accused by his looks .
others suppose that the act was an expression of his implicit <name> in the integrity and fidelity of his servant , and that he intended it as testimony , given in a very pointed and decisive , and , at the same time , delicate manner , that he was not suspicious of his friends , or easily led to distrust their faithfulness .
<name> was , at any rate , extremely gratified at the procedure , and <name> recovered .
<name> had now traversed the whole extent of <name> minor , and had subdued the entire country to his sway .
he was now advancing to another district , that of syria and palestine , which lies on the eastern shores of the mediterranean sea .
to enter this new territory , he had to pass over a narrow plain which lay between the mountains and the sea , at a place called <unk> .
here he was met by the main body of the persian army , and the great battle of <unk> was fought .
this battle <name> be the subject of the next chapter .
chapter <name> .

thus far <name> had had only the lieutenants and generals of the persian monarch to contend with .
<name> had at first looked upon the invasion of his vast dominions by such a mere boy , as he called him , and by so small an army , with contempt .
he sent word to his generals in <name> minor to seize the young fool , and send him to persia bound hand and foot .
by the time , however , that <name> had possessed himself of all <name> minor , <name> began to find that , though young , he was no fool , and that it was not likely to be very easy to seize him .
accordingly , <name> collected an immense army himself , and advanced to meet the macedonians in person .
nothing could exceed the pomp and magnificence of his preparations .
there were immense <name> of troops , and they were of all nations .
there were even a great many greeks among his forces , many of them enlisted from the greeks of <name> minor .
there were some from greece itself  <unk> , as they were called ; that is , soldiers who fought for pay , and who were willing to enter into any service which would pay them best .
there were even some greek officers and counselors in the family and court of <name> .
one of them , named <unk> , offended the king very much by the free opinion which he expressed of the uselessness of all his pomp and parade in preparing for an encounter with such an enemy as <name> .
" perhaps , " said <unk> , " you may not be pleased with my speaking to you plainly , but if i do not do it now , it <name> be too late hereafter .
this great parade and pomp , and this enormous multitude of men , might be formidable to your asiatic neighbors ; but such sort of preparation <name> be of little avail against <name> and his greeks .
your army is resplendent with purple and gold .
no one who had not seen it could conceive of its magnificence ; but it <name> not be of any avail against the terrible energy of the greeks .
their minds are bent on something very different from idle show .
they are intent on securing the substantial excellence of their weapons , and on acquiring the discipline and the hardihood essential for the most efficient use of them .
they <name> despise all your parade of purple and gold .
they <name> not even value it as plunder .
they <name> in their ability to dispense with all the luxuries and conveniences of life .
they live upon the <unk> food .
at night they sleep upon the bare ground .
by day they are always on the march .
they brave hunger , cold , and every species of exposure with pride and pleasure , having the greatest contempt for any thing like softness and <unk> of character .
all this pomp and pageantry , with inefficient weapons , and inefficient men to wield them , <name> be of no avail against their invincible courage and energy ; and the best disposition that you can make of all your gold , and silver , and other treasures , is to send it away and procure good soldiers with it , if indeed gold and silver <name> procure them . "
the greeks were habituated to energetic speaking as well as acting , but <unk> did not sufficiently consider that the persians were not accustomed to hear such plain language as this .
<name> was very much displeased .
in his anger he condemned him to death .
" very well , " said <unk> , " i can die .
but my avenger is at hand .
my advice is good , and <name> <name> soon punish you for not regarding it . "
very gorgeous descriptions are given of the pomp and magnificence of the army of <name> , as he commenced his march from the euphrates to the mediterranean .
the persians worship the sun and fire .
over the king 's tent there was an image of the sun in <name> , and supported in such a manner as to be in the view of the whole army .
they had also silver altars , on which they kept constantly burning what they called the sacred fire .
these altars were borne by persons appointed for the purpose , who were clothed in magnificent costumes .
then came a long procession of priests and magi , who were dressed also in very splendid robes .
they performed the services of public worship .
following them came a chariot consecrated to the sun .
it was drawn by white horses , and was followed by a single white horse of large size and <name> form , which was a sacred animal , being called the horse of the sun .
the <unk> , that is , the attendants who had charge of this horse , were also all dressed in white , and each carried a golden <name> in his hand .
there were bodies of troops distinguished from the rest , and occupying positions of high honor , but these were selected and advanced above the others , not on account of their courage , or strength , or superior martial efficiency , but from considerations connected with their birth , and rank , and other aristocratic qualities .
there was one body called the kinsmen , who were the relatives of the king , or , at least , so considered , though , as there were fifteen thousand of them , it would seem that the relationship could not have been , in all cases , very near .
they were dressed with great magnificence , and prided themselves on their rank , their wealth , and the splendor of their armor .
there was also a corps called the immortals .
they were ten thousand in number .
they wore a dress of gold tissue , which glittered with <unk> and precious stones .
these bodies of men , thus dressed , made an appearance more like that of a civic procession , on an occasion of ceremony and rejoicing , than like the march of an army .
the appearance of the king in his chariot was still more like an exhibition of pomp and parade .
the carriage was very large , elaborately carved and gilded , and ornamented with statues and sculptures .
here the king sat on a very elevated seat , in sight of all .
he was clothed in a vest of purple , striped with silver , and over his vest he wore a robe glittering with gold and precious stones .
around his waist was a golden girdle , from which was suspended his <unk>  a species of sword  the scabbard of which was resplendent with gems .
he wore a <name> upon his head of very costly and elegant workmanship , and enriched , like the rest of his dress , with brilliant ornaments .
the guards who preceded and followed him had pikes of silver , mounted and tipped with gold .
it is very extraordinary that king <name> took his wife and all his family with him , and a large portion of his treasures , on this expedition against <name> .
his mother , whose name was <unk> , was in his family , and she and his wife came , each in her own chariot , immediately after the king .
then there were fifteen carriages filled with the children and their attendants , and three or four hundred ladies of the court , all dressed like queens .
after the family there came a train of many hundreds of camels and mules , carrying the <name> treasures .
it was in this style that <name> set out upon his expedition , and he advanced by a slow progress toward the westward , until at length he approached the shores of the mediterranean sea .
he left his treasures in the city of damascus , where they were deposited under the charge of a sufficient force to protect them , as he supposed .
he then advanced to meet <name> , going himself from syria toward <name> minor just at the time that <name> was coming from <name> minor into syria .
[ illustration : plain of <unk> . ]
it <name> be observed by looking upon the map , that the chain of mountains called mount <unk> extends down near to the coast , at the northeastern corner of the mediterranean .
among these mountains there are various tracts of open country , through which an army may march to and fro , between syria and <name> minor .
now it happened that <name> , in going toward the west , took a more inland route than <name> , who , on coming eastward , kept nearer to the sea .
<name> did not know that <name> was so near ; and as for <name> , he was confident that <name> was retreating before him ; for , as the macedonian army was so small , and his own forces constituted such an innumerable host , the idea that <name> would remain to brave a battle was , in his opinion , entirely out of the question .
he had , therefore , no doubt that <name> was retreating .
it is , of course , always difficult for two armies , fifty miles apart , to obtain correct ideas of each other's movements .
all the ordinary <unk> of the country are of course stopped , and each general has his scouts out , with orders to intercept all travelers , and to interrupt the communication of intelligence by every means in their power .
in consequence of these and other circumstances of a similar nature , it happened that <name> and <name> actually passed each other , without either of them being aware of it .
<name> advanced into syria by the plains of <unk> , marked a upon the map , and a narrow pass beyond , called the gates of syria , while <name> went farther to the north , and arrived at <unk> after <name> had left it .
here each army learned to their astonishment that their enemy was in their rear .
<name> could not credit this report when he first heard it .
he dispatched a galley with thirty oars along the shore , up the gulf of <unk> , to ascertain the truth .
the galley soon came back and reported that , beyond the gates of syria , they saw the whole country , which was nearly level land , though gently rising from the sea , covered with the vast encampments of the persian army .
the king then called his generals and counselors together , informed them of the facts , and made known to them his determination to return immediately through the gates of syria and attack the persian army .
the officers received the intelligence with enthusiastic expressions of <name> .
it was now near the evening .
<name> sent forward a strong reconnoitering party , ordering them to proceed cautiously , to ascend <unk> and look far before them , to guard carefully against surprise , and to send back word immediately if they came upon any traces of the enemy .
at the present day the operations of such a reconnoitering party are very much aided by the use of <unk> , which are made now with great care expressly for military purposes .
the instrument , however , was not known in <name> 's day .
when the evening came on , <name> followed the reconnoitering party with the main body of the army .
at midnight they reached the defile .
when they were secure in the possession of it , they halted .
strong watches were stationed on all the surrounding heights to guard against any possible surprise .
<name> himself ascended one of the <unk> , from whence he could look down upon the great plain beyond , which was dimly illuminated in every part by the smouldering fires of the persian encampment .
an encampment at night is a spectacle which is always grand , and often sublime .
it must have appeared sublime to <name> in the highest degree , on this occasion .
to stand stealthily among these dark and somber mountains , with the defiles and passes below filled with the columns of his small but undaunted army , and to look onward , a few miles beyond , and see the countless fires of the vast hosts which had got between him and all <name> of retreat to his native land ; to feel , as he must have done , that his fate , and that of all who were with him , depended upon the events of the day that was soon to <name>  to see and feel these things must have made this night one of the most exciting and solemn scenes in the conqueror 's life .
he had a soul to enjoy its excitement and sublimity .
he gloried in it ; and , as if he wished to add to the solemnity of the scene , he caused an altar to be erected , and offered a sacrifice , by <unk> , to the deities on whose aid his soldiers imagined themselves most dependent for success on the morrow .
of course a place was selected where the lights of the torches would not attract the attention of the enemy , and sentinels were stationed at every advantageous point to watch the persian camp for the slightest indications of movement or alarm .
in the morning , at break of day , <name> commenced his march down to the plain .
in the evening , at sunset , all the valleys and defiles among the mountains around the plain of <unk> were thronged with vast masses of the persian army , broken , disordered , and in confusion , all pressing forward to escape from the victorious macedonians .
they crowded all the roads , they choked up the mountain passes , they trampled upon one another , they fell , exhausted with fatigue and mental agitation .
<name> was among them , though his flight had been so sudden that he had left his mother , and his wife , and all his family behind .
he pressed on in his chariot as far as the road allowed his chariot to go , and then , leaving every thing behind , he mounted a horse and rode on for his life .
<name> and his army soon abandoned the pursuit , and returned to take possession of the persian camp .
the tents of king <name> and his household were inconceivably splendid , and were filled with gold and silver vessels , <unk> , vases , boxes of perfumes , and every imaginable article of luxury and show .
the mother and wife of <name> <unk> their hard fate with cries and tears , and continued all the evening in an agony of consternation and despair .
<name> , hearing of this , sent <unk> , his former teacher , a man of years and gravity , to quiet their fears and comfort them , so far as it was possible to comfort them .
in addition to their own captivity , they supposed that <name> was killed , and the mother was mourning bitterly for her son , and the wife for her husband .
<unk> , attended by some soldiers , advanced toward the tent where these mourners were dwelling .
the attendants at the door ran in and informed them that a body of greeks were coming .
this threw them into the greatest consternation .
they anticipated violence and death , and threw themselves upon the ground in agony .
<unk> waited some time at the door for the attendants to return .
at length he entered the tent .
this renewed the terrors of the women .
they began to entreat him to spare their lives , at least until there should be time for them to see the remains of the son and husband whom they mourned , and to pay the last sad tribute to his memory .
<unk> soon relieved their fears .
he told them that he was charged by <name> to say to them that <name> was alive , having made his escape in safety .
as to themselves , <name> assured them , he said , that they should not be injured ; that not only were their persons and lives to be protected , but no change was to be made in their condition or mode of life ; they should continue to be treated like queens .
he added , moreover , that <name> wished him to say that he felt no animosity or ill <name> whatever against <name> .
he was but technically his enemy , being only engaged in a generous and honorable contest with him for the empire of <name> .
saying these things , <unk> raised the disconsolate ladies from the ground , and they gradually regained some degree of composure .
<name> himself went to pay a visit to the captive princesses the next day .
he took with him <unk> .
<unk> was alexander's personal friend .
the two young men were of the same age , and , though <name> had the good sense to retain in power all the old and experienced officers which his father had employed , both in the court and army , he showed that , after all , ambition had not overwhelmed and stifled all the <unk> feelings of the heart , by his strong attachment to this young companion .
<unk> was his confidant , his associate , his personal friend .
he did what very few monarchs have done , either before or since ; in securing for himself the pleasures of friendship , and of intimate social communion with a heart kindred to his own , without ruining himself by committing to a favorite powers which he was not qualified to wield .
<name> left the wise and experienced parmenio to manage the camp , while he took the young and handsome <unk> to accompany him on his visit to the captive queens .
when the two friends entered the tent , the ladies were , from some cause , deceived , and mistook <unk> for <name> , and addressed him , accordingly , with tokens of high respect and homage .
one of their attendants immediately <unk> the mistake , telling them that the other was <name> .
the ladies were at first overwhelmed with confusion , and attempted to apologize ; but the king reassured them at once by the easy and good-natured manner with which he passed over the mistake , saying it was no mistake at all .
" it is true , " said he , " that i am <name> , but then he is <name> too . "
the wife of <name> was young and very beautiful , and they had a little son who was with them in the camp .
it seems almost unaccountable that <name> should have brought such a helpless and defenseless charge with him into camps and fields of battle .
but the truth was that he had no idea of even a battle with <name> , and as to defeat , he did not contemplate the remotest possibility of it .
he regarded <name> as a mere boy  energetic and daring it is true , and at the head of a desperate band of adventurers ; but he considered his whole force as altogether too insignificant to make any stand against such a vast military power as he was bringing against him .
he presumed that he would retreat as fast as possible before the persian army came near him .
the idea of such a boy coming down at break of day , from narrow defiles of the mountains , upon his vast encampment covering all the plains , and in twelve hours putting the whole mighty mass to flight , was what never entered his imagination at all .
the exploit was , indeed , a very extraordinary one .
<name> 's forces may have consisted of forty or fifty thousand men , and , if we may believe their story , there were over a hundred thousand persians left dead upon the field .
many of these were , however , killed by the dreadful confusion and violence of the retreat as vast bodies of horsemen , pressing through the defiles , rode over and trampled down the foot soldiers who were toiling in awful confusion along the way , having fled before the horsemen left the field .
<name> had heard that <name> had left the greater part of his <name> treasures in damascus , and he sent parmenio there to seize them .
this expedition was successful .
an enormous amount of gold and silver fell into <name> 's hands .
the plate was coined into money , and many of the treasures were sent to greece .
<name> got together a small remnant of his army and continued his flight .
he did not stop until he had crossed the euphrates .
he then sent an embassador to <name> to make propositions for peace .
he remonstrated with him , in the communication which he made , for coming thus to invade his dominions , and urged him to withdraw and be satisfied with his own kingdom .
he offered him any sum he might name as a ransom for his mother , wife , and child , and agreed that if he would deliver them up to him on the payment of the ransom , and depart from his dominions , he would thenceforth regard him as an ally and a friend .
<name> replied by a letter , expressed in brief but very decided language .
he said that the persians had , under the ancestors of <name> , crossed the hellespont , invaded greece , laid waste the country , and destroyed cities and towns , and had thus done them incalculable injury ; and that <name> himself had been plotting against his ( <name> 's ) life , and offering rewards to any one who would kill him .
" i am acting , then , " continued <name> , " only on the defensive .
the gods , who always favor the right , have given me the victory .
i am now monarch of a large part of <name> , and your sovereign king .
if you <name> admit this , and come to me as my subject , i <name> restore to you your mother , your wife , and your child , without any ransom .
and , at any rate , whatever you decide in respect to these proposals , if you wish to communicate with me on any subject hereafter , i shall pay no attention to what you send unless you address it to me as your king . "
one circumstance occurred at the close of this great victory which illustrates the magnanimity of <name> 's character , and helps to explain the very strong personal attachment which every body within the circle of his influence so obviously felt for him .
he found a great number of envoys and embassadors from the various states of greece at the persian court , and these persons fell into his hands among the other captives .
now the states and cities of greece , all except sparta and thebes , which last city he had destroyed , were combined ostensibly in the confederation by which <name> was sustained .
it seems , however , that there was a secret enmity against him in greece , and various parties had sent messengers and agents to the persian court to aid in plots and schemes to interfere with and defeat <name> 's plans .
the <unk> , scattered and disorganized as they were , had sent envoys in this way .
now <name> , in considering what disposition he should make of these emissaries from his own land , decided to regard them all as traitors except the <unk> .
all except the <unk> were traitors , he maintained , for acting secretly against him , while ostensibly , and by solemn <unk> , they were his friends .
" the case of the <unk> is very different , " said he .
" i have destroyed their city , and they have a right to consider me their enemy , and to do all they can to oppose my progress , and to regain their own lost existence and their former power . "
so he gave them their <name> and sent them away with marks of consideration and honor .
as the vast army of the persian monarch had now been defeated , of course none of the smaller kingdoms or provinces thought of resisting .
they yielded one after another , and <name> appointed governors of his own to rule over them .
he advanced in this manner along the eastern shores of the mediterranean sea , meeting with no obstruction until he reached the great and powerful city of tyre .

the city of tyre stood on a small island , three or four miles in diameter , [ b ] on the eastern shores of the mediterranean sea .
it was , in those days , the greatest commercial city in the world , and it exercised a great maritime power by means of its fleets and ships , which traversed every part of the mediterranean .
[ footnote b : there are different statements in respect to the size of this island , varying from three to nine miles in circumference . ]
tyre had been built originally on the <unk> ; but in some of the wars which it had to encounter with the kings of babylon in the east , this old city had been abandoned by the inhabitants , and a new one built upon an island not far from the shore , which could be more easily defended from an enemy .
the old city had gone to ruin , and its place was occupied by old walls , fallen towers , stones , columns , arches , and other remains of the ancient magnificence of the place .
the island on which the tyre of <name> 's day had been built was about half a mile from the shore .
the water between was about eighteen feet deep , and formed a harbor for the vessels .
the great business of the <unk> was commerce .
they bought and sold merchandise in all the ports of the mediterranean sea , and transported it by their merchant vessels to and fro .
they had also fleets of war galleys , which they used to protect their interests on the high seas , and in the various ports which their merchant vessels visited .
they were thus wealthy and powerful , and yet they lived shut up upon their little island , and were almost entirely independent of the <unk> .
the city itself , however , though contracted in extent on account of the small dimensions of the island , was very compactly built and strongly fortified , and it contained a vast number of stately and magnificent edifices , which were filled with stores of wealth that had been accumulated by the mercantile enterprise and thrift of many generations .
extravagant stories are told by the historians and <unk> of those days , in respect to the scale on which the structures of tyre were built .
it was said , for instance , that the walls were one hundred and fifty feet high .
it is true that the walls rose directly from the surface of the water , and of course a considerable part of their elevation was required to bring them up to the level of the surface of the land ; and then , in addition to this , they had to be carried up the whole ordinary height of a city wall to afford the usual protection to the edifices and dwellings within .
there might have been some places where the walls themselves , or structures connected with them , were carried up to the elevation above named , though it is scarcely to be supposed that such could have been their ordinary dimensions .
at any rate , tyre was a very wealthy , magnificent , and powerful city , intent on its commercial operations , and well furnished with means of protecting them at sea , but feeling little interest , and taking little part , in the contentions continually arising among the rival powers which had possession of the land .
their policy was to retain their independence , and yet to keep on good terms with all other powers , so that their commercial intercourse with the ports of all nations might go on undisturbed .
it was , of course , a very serious question with <name> , as his route lay now through <unk> and in the neighborhood of tyre , what he should do in respect to such a port .
he did not like to leave it behind him and proceed to the eastward ; for , in case of any reverses happening to him , the <unk> would be very likely to act decidedly against him , and their power on the mediterranean would enable them to act very efficiently against him on all the coasts of greece and <name> minor .
on the other hand , it seemed a desperate undertaking to attack the city .
he had none but land forces , and the island was half a mile from the shore .
besides its enormous walls , rising perpendicularly out of the water , it was defended by ships well armed and manned .
it was not possible to surround the city and starve it into submission , as the inhabitants had wealth to buy , and ships to bring in , any quantity of provisions and stores by sea .
<name> , however , determined not to follow <name> toward the east , and leave such a stronghold as this behind him .
the <unk> wished to avoid a quarrel if it were possible .
they sent complimentary messages to <name> , congratulating him on his conquests , and <unk> all feelings of hostility to him .
they also sent him a golden crown , as many of the other states of <name> had done , in token of their yielding a general submission to his authority .
<name> returned very gracious replies , and expressed to them his intention of coming to tyre for the purpose of offering sacrifices , as he said , to hercules , a god whom the <unk> worshiped .
the <unk> knew that wherever <name> went he went at the head of his army , and his coming into tyre at all implied necessarily his taking military possession of it .
they thought it might , perhaps , be somewhat difficult to <unk> such a visitor after he should once get installed in their castles and palaces .
so they sent him word that it would not be in their power to receive him in the city itself , but that he could offer the sacrifice which he intended on the <unk> , as there was a <name> sacred to hercules among the ruins there .
<name> then called a council of his officers , and stated to them his views .
he said that , on reflecting fully upon the subject , he had come to the conclusion that it was best to postpone pushing his expedition forward into the heart of persia until he should have subdued tyre completely , and made himself master of the mediterranean sea .
he said , also , that he should take possession of egypt before turning his arms toward the forces that <name> was gathering against him in the east .
the generals of the army concurred in this opinion , and <name> advanced toward tyre .
the <unk> prepared for their defense .
after examining carefully all the circumstances of the case , <name> conceived the very bold plan of building a broad causeway from the <unk> to the island on which the city was founded , out of the ruins of old tyre , and then marching his army over upon it to the walls of the city , where he could then plant his engines and make a breach .
this would seem to be a very desperate undertaking .
it is true the stones remaining on the site of the old city afforded sufficient materials for the construction of the pier , but then the work must go on against a tremendous opposition , both from the walls of the city itself and from the <unk> ships in the harbor .
it would seem to be almost impossible to protect the men from these attacks so as to allow the operations to proceed at all , and the difficulty and danger must increase very rapidly as the work should approach the walls of the city .
but , notwithstanding these objections , <name> determined to proceed .
tyre must be taken , and this was obviously the only possible mode of taking it .
the soldiers advanced to undertake the work with great readiness .
their strong personal attachment to <name> ; their confidence that whatever he should plan and attempt would succeed ; the novelty and boldness of this design of reaching an island by building an isthmus to it from the <unk>  these and other similar considerations excited the ardor and enthusiasm of the troops to the highest degree .
in constructing works of this kind in the water , the material used is sometimes stone and sometimes earth .
so far as earth is employed , it is necessary to resort to some means to prevent its spreading under the water , or being washed away by the dash of the waves at its sides .
this is usually effected by driving what are called piles , which are long beams of wood , pointed at the end , and driven into the earth by means of powerful engines .
<name> sent parties of men into the mountains of lebanon , where were vast forests of cedars , which were very celebrated in ancient times , and which are often alluded to in the sacred scriptures .
they cut down these trees , and brought the stems of them to the shore , where they sharpened them at one end and drove them into the sand , in order to protect the sides of their embankment .
others brought stones from the ruins and tumbled them into the sea in the direction where the pier was to be built .
it was some time before the work made such progress as to attract much attention from tyre .
at length , however , when the people of the city saw it gradually increasing in size and advancing toward them , they concluded that they must engage in <name> in the work of arresting its progress .
they accordingly constructed engines on the walls to throw heavy darts and stones over the water to the men upon the pier .
they sent secretly to the tribes that inhabited the valleys and ravines among the mountains , to attack the parties at work there , and they landed forces from the city at some distance from the pier , and then marched along the shore , and attempted to drive away the men that were engaged in carrying stones from the ruins .
they also fitted up and manned some galleys of large size , and brought them up near to the pier itself , and attacked the men who were at work upon it with stones , darts , arrows , and missiles of every description .
but all was of no avail .
the work , though impeded , still went on .
<name> built large screens of wood upon the pier , covering them with hides , which protected his soldiers from the weapons of the enemy , so that they could <name> on their operations safely behind them .
by these means the work advanced for some distance further .
as it advanced , various structures were erected upon it , especially along the sides and at the end toward the city .
these structures consisted of great engines for driving piles , and machines for throwing stones and darts , and towers carried up to a great height , to enable the men to throw stones and heavy weapons down upon the galleys which might attempt to approach them .
at length the <unk> determined on attempting to destroy all these wooden works by means of what is called in modern times a fire ship .
they took a large galley , and filled it with combustibles of every kind .
they loaded it first with light dry wood , and they poured pitch , and tar , and oil over all this wood to make it burn with fiercer flames .
they saturated the sails and the cordage in the same manner , and laid trains of combustible materials through all parts of the vessel , so that when fire should be set in one part it would immediately spread every where , and set the whole mass in flames at once .
they towed this ship , on a <name> day , near to the enemy 's works , and on the side from which the wind was blowing .
they then put it in motion toward the pier at a point where there was the greatest collection of engines and machines , and when they had got as near as they dared to go themselves , the men who were on board set the trains on fire , and made their escape in boats .
the flames ran all over the vessel with inconceivable rapidity .
the vessel itself drifted down upon <name> 's works , notwithstanding the most strenuous exertions of his soldiers to keep it away .
the frames and engines , and the enormous and complicated machines which had been erected , took fire , and the whole mass was soon enveloped in a general conflagration .
the men made desperate attempts to defend their works , but all in vain .
some were killed by arrows and darts , some were burned to death , and others , in the confusion , fell into the sea .
finally , the army was obliged to draw back , and to abandon all that was combustible in the vast construction they had reared , to the devouring flames .
[ illustration : the siege of tyre . ]
not long after this the sea itself came to the aid of the <unk> .
there was a storm ; and , as a consequence of it , a heavy swell rolled in from the offing , which soon undermined and washed away a large part of the pier .
the effects of a heavy sea on the most massive and substantial structures , when they are fairly exposed to its impulse , are far greater than would be conceived possible by those who had not witnessed them .
the most ponderous stones are removed , the strongest fastenings are torn asunder , and embankments the most compact and solid are undermined and washed away .
the storm , in this case , destroyed in a few hours the work of many months , while the army of <name> looked on from the shore witnessing its ravages in dismay .
when the storm was over , and the first shock of chagrin and disappointment had passed from the minds of the men , <name> prepared to resume the work with fresh vigor and energy .
the men commenced repairing the pier and widening it , so as to increase its strength and capacity .
they dragged whole trees to the edges of it , and sunk them , branches and all , to the bottom , to form a sort of platform there , to prevent the stones from sinking into the slime .
they built new towers and engines , covering them with green hides to make them fire-proof ; and thus they were soon advancing again , and gradually drawing nearer to the city , and in a more threatening and formidable manner than ever .
<name> , finding that his efforts were impeded very much by the ships of the <unk> , determined on collecting and <unk> a fleet of his own .
this he did at <unk> , which was a town a short distance north of tyre .
he embarked on board this fleet himself , and came down with it into the <unk> seas .
with this fleet he had various success .
he chained many of the ships together , two and two , at a little distance apart , covering the inclosed space with a platform , on which the soldiers could stand to fight .
the men also erected engines on these platforms to attack the city .
these engines were of various kinds .
there was what they called the battering ram , which was a long and very heavy beam of wood , headed with iron or brass .
this beam was suspended by a chain in the middle , so that it could be swung back and forth by the soldiers , its head striking against the wall each time , by which means the wall would sometimes be soon battered down .
they had also machines for throwing great stones , or beams of wood , by means of the elastic force of strong bars of wood , or of steel , or that of twisted ropes .
the part of the machine upon which the stone was placed would be drawn back by the united strength of many of the soldiers , and then , as it recovered itself when released , the stone would be thrown off into the air with prodigious velocity and force .
<name> 's double galleys answered very well as long as the water was smooth ; but sometimes , when they were caught out in a swell , the rolling of the waves would rack and twist them so as to tear the platforms asunder , and sink the men in the sea .
thus difficulties unexpected and formidable were continually arising .
<name> , however , persevered through them all .
the <unk> , finding themselves pressed more and more , and seeing that the dangers impending became more and more formidable every day , at length concluded to send a great number of the women and children away to carthage , which was a great commercial city in africa .
they were determined not to submit to <name> , but to <name> their resistance to the very last extremity .
and as the closing scenes of a siege , especially if the place is at last taken by storm , are awful beyond description , they wished to save their wives , and daughters , and helpless babes from having to witness them .
in the mean time , as the siege advanced , the parties became more and more incensed against each other .
they treated the captives which they took on either side with greater and greater cruelty , each thinking that they were only <unk> worse injuries from the other .
the macedonians approached nearer and nearer .
the resources of the unhappy city were gradually cut off and its strength worn away .
the engines approached nearer and nearer to the walls , until the battering rams bore directly upon them , and breaches began to be made .
at length one great breach on the southern side was found to be " practicable , " as they call it .
<name> began to prepare for the final assault , and the <unk> saw before them the horrible prospect of being taken by storm .
still they would not submit .
submission would now have done but little good , though it might have saved some of the final horrors of the scene .
<name> had become greatly exasperated by the long resistance which the <unk> had made .
they probably could not now have averted destruction , but they might , perhaps , have prevented its coming upon them in so terrible a shape as the irruption of thirty thousand frantic and infuriated soldiers through the breaches in their walls to take their city by storm .
the breach by which <name> proposed to force his entrance was on the southern side .
he prepared a number of ships , with platforms raised upon them in such a manner that , on getting near the walls , they could be let down , and form a sort of bridge , over which the men could pass to the broken fragments of the wall , and thence ascend through the breach above .
the plan succeeded .
the ships advanced to the proposed place of landing .
the bridges were let down .
the men crowded over them to the foot of the wall .
they clambered up through the breach to the battlements above , although the <unk> thronged the passage and made the most desperate resistance .
hundreds were killed by darts , and arrows , and falling stones , and their bodies tumbled into the sea .
the others , paying no attention to their falling comrades , and drowning the horrid screams of the crushed and the dying with their own frantic shouts of rage and fury , pressed on up the broken wall till they reached the battlements above .
the vast throng then rolled along upon the top of the wall till they came to stairways and slopes by which they could descend into the city , and , pouring down through all these avenues , they spread over the streets , and <unk> the hatred and rage , which had been gathering strength for seven long months , in bursting into houses , and killing and destroying all that came in their way .
thus the city was stormed .
after the soldiers were weary with the work of slaughtering the wretched inhabitants of the city , they found that many still remained alive , and <name> tarnished the character for generosity and forbearance for which he had thus far been distinguished by the cruelty with which he treated them .
some were executed , some thrown into the sea ; and it is even said that two thousand were crucified along the sea-shore .
this may mean that their bodies were placed upon crosses after life had been destroyed by some more humane method than crucifixion .
at any rate , we find frequent indications from this time that prosperity and power were beginning to exert their usual unfavorable influence upon <name> 's character .
he became haughty , imperious , and cruel .
he lost the modesty and gentleness which seemed to characterize him in the earlier part of his life , and began to assume the moral character , as well as perform the exploits , of a military hero .
a good illustration of this is afforded by the answer that he sent to <name> , about the time of the storming of tyre , in reply to a second communication which he had received from him proposing terms of peace .
<name> offered him a very large sum of money for the ransom of his mother , wife , and child , and agreed to give up to him all the country he had conquered , including the whole territory west of the euphrates .
he also offered him his daughter <unk> in marriage .
he recommended to him to accept these terms , and be content with the possessions he had already acquired ; that he could not expect to succeed , if he should try , in crossing the mighty rivers of the east , which were in the way of his march toward the persian dominions .
<name> replied , that if he wished to marry his daughter he could do it without his consent ; as to the ransom , he was not in want of money ; in respect to <name> 's offering to give him up all west of the euphrates , it was absurd for a man to speak of giving what was no longer his own ; that he had crossed too many seas in his military expeditions , since he left macedon , to feel any concern about the rivers that he might find in his way ; and that he should continue to pursue <name> wherever he might retreat in search of safety and protection , and he had no fear but that he should find and conquer him at last .
it was a harsh and cruel message to send to the unhappy monarch whom he had already so greatly injured .
parmenio advised him to accept <name> 's offers .
" i would , " said he , " if i were <name> . "
" yes , " said <name> , " and so would i if i were parmenio . "
what a reply from a youth of twenty-two to a venerable general of sixty , who had been so tried and faithful a friend , and so efficient a <unk> both to his father and to himself , for so many years .
the siege and storming of tyre has always been considered one of the greatest of <name> 's exploits .
the boldness , the perseverance , the indomitable energy which he himself and all his army manifested , during the seven months of their <unk> toil , attracted the admiration of the world .
and yet we find our feelings of sympathy for his character , and interest in his fate , somewhat alienated by the indications of pride , <unk> , and cruelty which begin to appear .
while he rises in our estimation as a military hero , he begins to sink somewhat as a man .
and yet the change was not sudden .
he bore during the siege his part in the privations and difficulties which the soldiers had to endure ; and the dangers to which they had to be exposed , he was always willing to share .
one night he was out with a party upon the mountains .
among his few immediate attendants was lysimachus , one of his former teachers , who always loved to accompany him at such times .
lysimachus was advanced in life , and somewhat infirm , and consequently could not keep up with the rest in the march .
<name> remained with lysimachus , and ordered the rest to go on .
the road at length became so rugged that they had to dismount from their horses and walk .
finally they lost their way , and found themselves obliged to stop for the night .
they had no fire .
they saw , however , at a distance , some camp fires blazing which belonged to the barbarian tribes against whom the expedition was directed .
<name> went to the nearest one .
there were two men lying by it , who had been stationed to take care of it .
he advanced stealthily to them and killed them both , probably while they were asleep .
he then took a brand from their fire , carried it back to his own encampment , where he made a blazing fire for himself and lysimachus , and they passed the night in comfort and safety .
this is the story .
how far we are to give credit to it , each reader must judge for himself .
one thing is certain , however , that there are many military heroes of whom such stories would not be even <unk> .

after completing the subjugation of tyre , <name> commenced his march for egypt .
his route led him through judea .
the time was about three hundred years before the birth of christ , and , of course , this passage of the great conqueror through the land of <name> took place between the historical periods of the old testament and of the new , so that no account of it is given in the sacred volume .
there was a jewish writer named josephus , who lived and wrote a few years after christ , and , of course , more than three hundred years after <name> .
he wrote a history of the jews , which is a very entertaining book to read ; but he liked so much to magnify the importance of the events in the history of his country , and to embellish them with marvelous and supernatural incidents , that his narratives have not always been received with implicit <name> .
josephus says that , as <name> passed through palestine , he went to pay a visit to jerusalem .
the circumstances of this visit , according to his account , were these .
the city of tyre , before <name> besieged it , as it lived entirely by commerce , and was surrounded by the sea , had to depend on the neighboring countries for a supply of food .
the people were accordingly accustomed to purchase grain in <unk> , in judea , and in egypt , and transport it by their ships to the island .
<name> , in the same manner , when besieging the city , found that he must depend upon the neighboring countries for supplies of food ; and he accordingly sent <unk> for such supplies to several places , and , among others , to judea .
the jews , as josephus says , refused to send any such supplies , saying that it would be inconsistent with fidelity to <name> , under whose government they were .
<name> took no notice of this reply at the time , being occupied with the siege of tyre ; but , as soon as that city was taken , and he was ready to pass through judea , he directed his march toward jerusalem with the intention of destroying the city .
now the chief magistrate at jerusalem at this time , the one who had the command of the city , ruling it , of course , under a general responsibility to the persian government , was the high priest .
his name was <unk> .
in the time of christ , about three hundred years after this , the name of the <unk> , as the reader <name> recollect , was <unk> .
<unk> and all the inhabitants of jerusalem were very much alarmed .
they knew not what to do .
the siege and capture of tyre had impressed them all with a strong sense of <name> 's terrible energy and martial power , and they began to anticipate certain destruction .
<unk> caused great sacrifices to be offered to almighty god , and public and solemn prayers were made , to implore his guidance and protection .
the next day after these services , he told the people that they had nothing to fear .
god had appeared to him in a dream , and directed him what to do .
" we are not to resist the conqueror , " said he , " but to go forth to meet him and welcome him .
we are to <unk> the city with flowers , and adorn it as for a festive celebration .
the priests are to be dressed in their <unk> robes and go forth , and the inhabitants are to follow them in a civic procession .
in this way we are to go out to meet <name> as he advances  and all <name> be well . "
these directions were followed .
<name> was coming on with a full determination to destroy the city .
when , however , he saw the procession , and came near enough to distinguish the appearance and dress of the high priest , he stopped , seemed surprised and pleased , and advanced toward him with an air of the profoundest deference and respect .
he seemed to pay him almost religious homage and adoration .
every one was astonished .
parmenio asked him for an explanation .
<name> made the following extraordinary statement : " when i was in macedon , before setting out on this expedition , while i was revolving the subject in my mind , musing day after day on the means of conquering <name> , one night i had a remarkable dream .
in my dream this very priest appeared before me , dressed just as he is now .
he <unk> me to banish every fear , to cross the hellespont boldly , and to push forward into the heart of <name> .
he said that god would march at the head of my army , and give me the victory over all the persians .
i recognize this priest as the same person that appeared to me then .
he has the same countenance , the same dress , the same stature , the same air .
it is through his encouragement and aid that i am here , and i am ready to worship and adore the god whose service he <unk> . "
<name> joined the high priest in the procession , and they returned to jerusalem together .
there <name> united with them and with the jews of the city in the celebration of religious rites , by offering sacrifices and <unk> in the jewish manner .
the writings which are now printed together in our bibles , as the old testament , were , in those days , written separately on parchment rolls , and kept in the <name> .
the priests produced from the rolls the one containing the prophecies of <name> , and they read and interpreted some of these prophecies to <name> , which they considered to have reference to him , though written many hundred years before .
<name> was , as josephus relates , very much pleased at the sight of these ancient predictions , and the interpretation put upon them by the priests .
he assured the jews that they should be protected in the exercise of all their rights , and especially in their religious worship , and he also promised them that he would take their brethren who resided in media and babylon under his special charge when he should come into possession of those places .
these jews of media and babylon were the descendants of captives which had been carried away from their native land in former wars .
such is the story which josephus relates .
the greek historians , on the other hand , make no mention of this visit to jerusalem ; and some persons think that it was never made , but that the story arose and was propagated from generation to generation among the jews , through the influence of their <name> to magnify the importance and influence of their worship , and that josephus incorporated the account into his history without sufficiently <unk> the facts .
however it may be in regard to jerusalem , <name> was delayed at <unk> , which , as may be seen upon the map , is on the shore of the mediterranean sea .
it was a place of considerable commerce and wealth , and was , at this time , under the command of a governor whom <name> had stationed there .
his name was <unk> .
<unk> refused to surrender the place .
<name> stopped to <unk> it , and the siege delayed him two months .
he was very much exasperated at this , both against <unk> and against the city .
his unreasonable anger was very much increased by a wound which he received .
he was near a mound which his soldiers had been constructing near the city , to place engines upon for an attack upon the walls , when an arrow shot from one of the engines upon the walls struck him in the breast .
it penetrated his armor , and wounded him deeply in the shoulder .
the wound was very painful for some time , and the suffering which he endured from it only added fuel to the flame of his anger against the city .
at last breaches were made in the walls , and the place was taken by storm .
<name> treated the wretched captives with extreme cruelty .
he cut the garrison to pieces , and sold the inhabitants to slavery .
as for <unk> , he dealt with him in a manner almost too horrible to be described .
the reader <name> recollect that achilles , at the siege of <name> , after killing <name> , dragged his dead body around the walls of the city .
<name> , growing more cruel as he became more accustomed to war and bloodshed , had been intending to imitate this example so soon as he could find an enemy worthy of such a fate .
he now determined to <name> his plan into execution with <unk> .
he ordered him into his presence .
a few years before , he would have rewarded him for his fidelity in his master 's service ; but now , grown selfish , hard hearted , and <unk> , he looked upon him with a countenance full of vindictive exultation , and said , " you are not going to die the simple death that you <name> .
you have got the worst torments that revenge can invent to suffer . "
<unk> did not reply , but looked upon <name> with a calm , and composed , and <unk> air , which incensed the conqueror more and more .
" observe his dumb arrogance , " said <name> ; " but i <name> conquer him .
i <name> show him that i can draw groans from him , if nothing else . "
he then ordered holes to be made through the heels of his unhappy captive , and , passing a rope through them , had the body fastened to a chariot , and dragged about the city till no life remained .
<name> found many <name> treasures in <unk> .
he sent a large part of them to his mother olympias , whom he had left in macedon .
alexander's affection for his mother seems to have been more permanent than almost any other good trait in his character .
he found , in addition to other stores of valuable merchandise , a large quantity of <unk> and <unk> .
these are gums which were brought from arabia , and were very costly .
they were used chiefly in making offerings and in burning incense to the gods .
when <name> was a young man in macedon , before his father 's death , he was one day present at the offering of sacrifices , and one of his teachers and guardians , named <unk> , who was standing by , thought he was rather profuse in his consumption of <unk> and <unk> .
he was taking it up by handfuls and throwing it upon the fire .
<unk> reproved him for this extravagance , and told him that when he became master of the countries where these costly gums were procured , he might be as prodigal of them as he pleased , but that in the mean time it would be proper for him to be more prudent and economical .
<name> remembered this reproof , and , finding vast stores of these expensive gums in <unk> , he sent the whole quantity to <unk> , telling him that he sent him this abundant supply that he might not have occasion to be so reserved and sparing for the future in his sacrifices to the gods .
after this conquest and destruction of <unk> , <name> continued his march southward to the frontiers of egypt .
he reached these frontiers at the city of pelusium .
the egyptians had been under the persian dominion , but they abhorred it , and were very ready to submit to <name> 's sway .
they sent embassadors to meet him upon the frontiers .
the governors of the cities , as he advanced into the country , finding that it would be useless to resist , and warned by the terrible example of thebes , tyre , and <unk> , surrendered to him as fast as he summoned them .
he went to memphis .
memphis was a great and powerful city , situated in what was called lower egypt , on the nile , just above where the branches which form the mouths of the nile separate from the main stream .
all that part of egypt is flat country , having been formed by the deposits brought down by the nile .
such land is called alluvial ; it is always level , and , as it consists of successive deposits from the turbid waters of the river , made in the successive inundations , it forms always a very <name> soil , deep and inexhaustible , and is , of course , extremely fertile .
egypt has been celebrated for its <unk> fertility from the earliest times .
it waves with fields of corn and grain , and is adorned with groves of the most luxuriant growth and richest verdure .
it is only , however , so far as the land is formed by the deposits of the nile , that this scene of verdure and beauty extends .
on the east it is bounded by ranges of barren and <name> hills , and on the west by vast deserts , consisting of moving sands , from which no animal or vegetable life can derive the means of existence .
the reason of this sterility seems to be the absence of water .
the geological formation of the land is such that it furnishes few springs of water , and no streams , and in that climate it seldom or never rains .
if there is water , the most barren sands <name> clothe themselves with some species of vegetation , which , in its decay , <name> form a soil that <name> nourish more and more fully each succeeding generation of plants .
but in the absence of water , any surface of earth <name> soon become a barren sand .
the wind <name> drive away every thing <unk> , leaving only the heavy sands , to drift in storms , like fields of snow .
among these african deserts , however , there are some fertile spots .
they are occasioned by springs which arise in little <unk> , and which <unk> the ground with moisture for some distance around them .
the water from these springs flows for some distance , in many cases , in a little stream , before it is finally lost and absorbed in the sands .
the whole tract under the influence of this irrigation clothes itself with verdure .
trees grow up to shade it .
it forms a spot whose beauty , absolutely great , is heightened by the contrast which it presents to the gloomy and desolate desert by which it is surrounded .
such a green spot in the desert is called an oasis .
they are the resort and the refuge of the traveler and the pilgrim , who seek shelter and repose upon them in their weary journeys over the trackless wilds .
nor must it be supposed that these islands of fertility and verdure are always small .
some of them are very extensive , and contain a considerable population .
there is one called the great oasis , which consists of a chain of fertile tracts of about a hundred miles in length .
another , called the oasis of <unk> , has , in modern times , a population of eight thousand souls .
this last is situated not far from the shores of the mediterranean sea  at least not very far : perhaps two or three hundred miles  and it was a very celebrated spot in <name> 's day .
the cause of its celebrity was that it was the seat and center of the worship of a famous deity called jupiter ammon .
this god was said to be the son of jupiter , though there were all sorts of stories about his origin and early history .
he had the form of a ram , and was worshiped by the people of egypt , and also by the carthaginians , and by the people of northern africa generally .
his <name> was in this oasis , and it was surrounded by a considerable population , which was supported , in a great degree , by the expenditures of the <unk> who came as pilgrims , or otherwise , to sacrifice at his shrine .
it is said that <name> , finding that the various objects of human ambition which he had been so rapidly attaining by his victories and conquests for the past few years were insufficient to satisfy him , began now to aspire for some supernatural honors , and he accordingly conceived the design of having himself declared to be the son of a god .
the heroes of <name> were sons of the gods .
<name> envied them the fame and honor which this distinction gave them in the opinion of mankind .
he determined to visit the <name> of jupiter ammon in the oasis of <unk> , and to have the declaration of his divine origin made by the priests there .
he proceeded , accordingly , to the mouth of the nile , where he found a very eligible place , as he believed , for the foundation of a commercial city , and he determined to build it on his return .
thence he marched along the shores of the mediterranean , toward the west , until he reached a place called <unk> , which <name> be found upon the map .
he then left the sea-shore and marched south , striking at once into the desert when he left the sea .
he was accompanied by a small detachment of his army as an escort , and they journeyed eleven days before they reached the oasis .
they had a variety of perilous adventures in crossing the desert .
for the first two days the soldiers were excited and pleased with the novelty and romantic grandeur of the scene .
the desert has , in some degree , the sublimity of the ocean .
there is the same boundless expanse , the same vast , unbroken curve of the horizon , the same <unk> , the same solitude .
there is , in addition , a certain profound and awful stillness and repose , which imparts to it a new element of impressiveness and grandeur .
its dread and solemn silence is far more imposing and sublime than the loudest thunders of the seas .
the third day the soldiers began to be weary of such a march .
they seemed afraid to penetrate any further into such boundless and terrible solitudes .
they had been obliged to bring water with them in <unk> , which were carried by camels .
the camel is the only beast of burden which can be employed upon the deserts .
there is a peculiarity in the anatomical structure of this animal by which he can take in , at one time , a supply of water for many days .
he is formed , in fact , for the desert .
in his native state he lives in the <unk> and in the valleys .
he eats the herbage which grows among the rocks and hills that alternate with the great <name> plains in all these countries .
in passing from one of his scanty pasturages to another , he has long journeys to make across the sands , where , though he can find food here and there , there is no water .
providence has formed him with a structure adapted to this <unk> , and by means of it he becomes extremely useful to man .
the soldiers of <name> did not take a sufficient supply of water , and were reduced , at one time , to great distress .
they were relieved , the story says , by a rain , though rain is extremely unusual in the deserts .
<name> attributed this supply to the miraculous interposition of heaven .
they catch the rain , in such cases , with cloths , and afterward wring out the water ; though in this instance , as the historians of that day say , the soldiers did not wait for this tardy method of supply , but the whole detachment held back their heads and opened their mouths , to catch the drops of rain as they fell .
there was another danger to which they were exposed in their march , more terrible even than the scarcity of water .
it was that of being overwhelmed in the clouds of sand and dust which sometimes swept over the desert in gales of wind .
these were called <unk> .
the fine sand flew , in such cases , in driving clouds , which filled the eyes and stopped the breath of the traveler , and finally buried his body under its drifts when he laid down to die .
a large army of fifty thousand men , under a former persian king , had been overwhelmed and destroyed in this way , some years before , in some of the egyptian deserts .
<name> 's soldiers had heard of this calamity , and they were threatened sometimes with the same fate .
they , however , at length escaped all the dangers of the desert , and began to approach the green and fertile land of the oasis .
the change from the barren and dismal loneliness of the <name> plains to the groves and the villages , the beauty and the verdure of the oasis , was delightful both to <name> himself and to all his men .
the priests at the great <name> of jupiter ammon received them all with marks of great distinction and honor .
the most solemn and magnificent ceremonies were performed , with offerings , <unk> , and sacrifices .
the priests , after conferring in secret with the god in the <name> , came out with the annunciation that <name> was indeed his son , and they paid him , accordingly , almost divine honors .
he is supposed to have bribed them to do this by presents and pay .
<name> returned at length to memphis , and in all his subsequent orders and decrees he styled himself <name> king , son of jupiter ammon .
[ illustration : a focus . ]
but , though <name> was thus willing to impress his ignorant soldiers with a mysterious veneration for his fictitious divinity , he was not deceived himself on the subject ; he sometimes even made his pretensions to the divine character a subject of joke .
for instance , they one day brought him in too little fire in the focus .
the focus , or fire-place used in <name> 's day was a small metallic stand , on which the fire was built .
it was placed wherever convenient in the tent , and the smoke escaped above .
they had put upon the focus too little fuel one day when they brought it in .
<name> asked the officer to let him have either some wood or some <unk> ; they might consider him , he said , as a god or as a man , whichever they pleased , but he wished to be treated either like one or the other .
on his return from the oasis <name> carried forward his plan of building a city at the mouth of the nile .
he <name> the plan , it is said , with his own hands .
he superintended the constructions , and invited artisans and mechanics from all nations to come and reside in it .
they accepted the invitation in great <name> , and the city soon became large , and wealthy , and powerful .
it was intended as a commercial post , and the wisdom and sagacity which <name> manifested in the selection of the site , is shown by the fact that the city rose immediately to the rank of the great seat of trade and commerce for all those shores , and has continued to hold that rank now for twenty centuries .
there was an island near the coast , opposite the city , called the island of pharos .
they built a most magnificent <unk> upon one extremity of this island , which was considered , in those days , one of the wonders of the world .
it was said to be five hundred feet high .
this may have been an exaggeration .
at any rate , it was celebrated throughout the world in its day , and its existence and its greatness made an impression on the human mind which has not yet been effaced .
pharos is the name for <unk> , in many languages , to the present day .
in building the city of <name> , <name> laid aside , for a time , his natural and proper character , and assumed a mode of action in strong contrast with the ordinary course of his life .
he was , throughout most of his career , a destroyer .
he roamed over the world to interrupt commerce , to break in upon and disturb the peaceful pursuits of industry , to batter down city walls , and burn dwellings , and kill men .
this is the true vocation of a hero and a conqueror ; but at the mouth of the nile <name> laid aside this character .
he turned his energies to the work of planning means to do good .
he constructed a port ; he built warehouses ; he provided accommodations and protection for merchants and artisans .
the nations exchanged their commodities far more easily and extensively in consequence of these facilities , and the means of comfort and enjoyment were multiplied and increased in thousands and thousands of huts in the great cities of egypt , and in the rural districts along the banks of the nile .
the good , too , which he thus commenced , has perpetuated itself .
<name> has continued to fulfill its beneficent function for two thousand years .
it is the only monument of his greatness which remains .
every thing else which he accomplished perished when he died .
how much better would it have been for the happiness of mankind , as well as for his own true fame and <name> , if doing good had been the rule of his life instead of the exception .

all the western part of <name> was now in <name> 's power .
he was undisputed master of <name> minor , <unk> , judea , and egypt .
he returned from egypt to tyre , leaving governors to rule in his name in all the conquered provinces .
the injuries which had been done to tyre , during the siege and at the assault , were repaired , and it was again a wealthy , powerful , and prosperous city .
<name> rested and refreshed his army there , and spent some weeks in most splendid festivities and rejoicings .
the princes and potentates of all the neighboring countries assembled to partake of his hospitality , to be entertained by the games , the plays , the spectacles , and the <unk> , and to unite in swelling his court and doing him honor .
in a word , he was the general center of attraction for all eyes , and the object of universal homage .
all this time , however , he was very far from being satisfied , or feeling that his work was done .
<name> , whom he considered his great enemy , was still in the field <unk> .
he had retreated across the euphrates , and was employed in assembling a vast collection of forces from all the eastern nations which were under his sway , to meet <name> in the final contest .
<name> therefore made arrangements at tyre for the proper government of the various kingdoms and provinces which he had already conquered , and then began to prepare for marching eastward with the main body of his army .
during all this time the ladies of <name> 's family , who had been taken captive at <unk> , had been retained in captivity , and made to accompany <name> 's army in its marches .
<name> refused to accede to any of the plans and propositions which <name> made and offered for the redemption of his wife and mother , but insisted on retaining them as his prisoners .
he , however , treated them with respect and high consideration .
he provided them with <name> tents of great magnificence , and had them conveyed from place to place , when his army moved , with all the <name> state to which they had been accustomed when in the court of <name> .
it has been generally thought a proof of nobleness of spirit and generosity in <name> that he treated his captives in this manner .
it would seem , however , that true generosity would have prompted the restoration of these unhappy and harmless prisoners to the husband and father who mourned their separation from him , and their cruel sufferings , with bitter grief .
it is more probable , therefore , that policy , and a regard for his own aggrandizement , rather than compassion for the suffering , led him to honor his captive queens .
it was a great <name> to him , in a martial point of view , to have such trophies of his victory in his train ; and , of course , the more highly he honored the personages , the more glorious the trophy appeared .
accordingly , <name> did every thing in his power to magnify the importance of his <name> captives , by the splendor of their retinue , and the pomp and pageantry with which he invested their movements .
a short time after leaving tyre , on the march eastward , <unk> , the wife of <name> , was taken suddenly ill and died .
[ c ] the tidings were immediately brought to <name> , and he repaired without delay to <unk> 's tent .
<unk> was the mother of <name> .
she was in the greatest agony of grief .
she was lying upon the floor of her tent , surrounded by the ladies of her court , and entirely overwhelmed with sorrow .
<name> did all in his power to calm and comfort her .
[ footnote c : it was the birth of an infant that caused her death , exhausted and worn down as she doubtless was , by her captivity and her sorrows . ]
one of the officers of <name> <unk> 's household [ d ] made his escape from the camp immediately after his mistress 's death , and fled across the country to <name> , to <name> him the heavy tidings .
<name> was overwhelmed with affliction .
the officer , however , in farther interviews , gave him such an account of the kind and respectful treatment which the ladies had received from <name> , during all the time of their captivity , as greatly to relieve his mind , and to afford him a high degree of comfort and consolation .
he expressed a very strong sense of gratitude to <name> for his generosity and kindness , and said that if his kingdom of persia must be conquered , he sincerely wished that it might fall into the hands of such a conqueror as <name> .
[ footnote d : a <unk> , a sort of officer employed in eastern nations in attendance upon ladies of high rank . ]
by looking at the map at the commencement of the volume , it <name> be seen that the <unk> and the euphrates are parallel streams , flowing through the heart of the western part of <name> toward the southeast , and emptying into the persian gulf .
the country between these two rivers , which was extremely populous and fertile , was called <unk> .
<name> had collected an immense army here .
the various detachments filled all the plains of <unk> .
<name> turned his course a little northward , intending to pass the river euphrates at a famous ancient crossing at <unk> , which may be seen upon the map .
when he arrived at this place he found a small persian army there .
they , however , retired as he approached .
<name> built two bridges across the river , and passed his army safely over .
in the mean time , <name> , with his enormous host , passed across the <unk> , and moved toward the northward , along the eastern side of the river .
he had to cross the various branches of the <unk> as he advanced .
at one of them , called the <unk> , which may also be seen upon the map , there was a bridge .
it took the vast host which <name> had collected five days to pass this bridge .
while <name> had been thus advancing to the northward into the latitude where he knew that <name> must cross the rivers , <name> himself , and his small but compact and fearless body of grecian troops , were moving eastward , toward the same region to which <name> 's line of march was tending .
<name> at length reached the <unk> .
he was obliged to ford this stream .
the banks were steep and the current was rapid , and the men were in great danger of being swept away .
to prevent this danger , the ranks , as they advanced , linked their arms together , so that each man might be sustained by his comrades .
they held their shields above their heads to keep them from the water .
<name> waded like the rest , though he kept in front , and reached the bank before the others .
standing there , he indicated to the advancing column , by <unk> , where to land , the noise of the water being too great to allow his voice to be heard .
to see him standing there , safely landed , and with an expression of confidence and triumph in his attitude and air , awakened fresh energy in the heart of every soldier in the columns which were crossing the stream .
notwithstanding this encouragement , however , the passage of the troops and the landing on the bank produced a scene of great confusion .
many of the soldiers had tied up a portion of their clothes in bundles , which they held above their heads , together with their arms , as they waded along through the swift current of the stream .
they , however , found it impossible to <name> these bundles , but had to abandon them at last in order to save themselves , as they staggered along through deep and rapid water , and over a concealed bottom of slippery stones .
thousands of these bundles , mingled with spears , darts , and every other sort of weapon that would float , were swept down by the current , to impede and embarrass the men who were passing below .
at length , however , the men themselves succeeded in getting over in safety , though a large quantity of arms and of clothing was lost .
there was no enemy upon the bank to oppose them .
<name> could not , in fact , well meet and oppose <name> in his attempt to cross the river , because he could not determine at what point he would probably make the attempt , in season to concentrate so large an army to oppose him .
<name> 's troops , being a comparatively small and compact body , and being accustomed to move with great promptness and celerity , could easily evade any attempt of such an unwieldy mass of forces to oppose his crossing at any particular point upon the stream .
at any rate , <name> did not make any such attempt , and <name> had no difficulties to encounter in crossing the <unk> other than the physical obstacles presented by the current of the stream .
<name> 's plan was , therefore , not to intercept <name> on his march , but to choose some great and convenient battle-field , where he could collect his forces , and marshal them advantageously , and so await an attack there .
he knew very well that his enemy would seek him out , wherever he was , and , consequently , that he might choose his position .
he found such a field in an extensive plain at <unk> , not far from the city of <unk> .
the spot has received historical immortality under the name of the plain of <unk> .
<name> was several days in concentrating his vast armies upon this plain .
he constructed encampments ; he leveled the inequalities which would interfere with the movements of his great bodies of cavalry ; he guarded the approaches , too , as much as possible .
there is a little instrument used in war called a <unk> .
[ e ] it consists of a small ball of iron , with several sharp points projecting from it one or two inches each way .
if these instruments are thrown upon the ground at random , one of the points must necessarily be upward , and the horses that tread upon them are lamed and disabled at once .
<name> caused <unk> to be scattered in the grass and along the roads , wherever the army of <name> would be likely to approach his troops on the field of battle .
[ footnote e : it receives its name from a kind of thistle called the <unk> . ]
[ illustration : the <unk> . ]
<name> , having crossed the river , encamped for a day or two on the banks , to rest and refresh , and to <unk> his army .
while here , the soldiers were one night thrown into consternation by an eclipse of the moon .
whenever an eclipse of the moon takes place , it is , of course , when the moon is full , so that the eclipse is always a sudden , and , among an ignorant people , an unexpected waning of the orb in the height of its splendor ; and as such people know not the cause of the phenomenon , they are often extremely terrified .
<name> 's soldiers were thrown into consternation by the eclipse .
they considered it the manifestation of the displeasure of heaven at their presumptuous daring in crossing such rivers , and penetrating to such a distance to invade the territories of another king .
in fact , the men were <unk> to fear .
having wandered to a vast distance from home , having passed over such mountains and deserts , and now , at last , having crossed a deep and dangerous river , and thrown themselves into the immediate vicinity of a foe ten times as numerous as themselves , it was natural that they should feel some misgivings .
and when , at night , impressed with the sense of solemnity which night always imparts to strange and novel scenes , they looked up to the bright round moon , pleased with the expression of cheerfulness and companionship which beams always in her light , to find her suddenly waning , changing her form , withdrawing her bright beams , and looking down upon them with a lurid and murky light , it was not surprising that they felt an emotion of terror .
in fact , there is always an element of terror in the emotion excited by looking upon an eclipse , which an instinctive feeling of the heart inspires .
it <unk> the spectacle with a solemn grandeur .
it holds the spectator , however cultivated and refined , in silence while he gazes at it .
it <unk> with a scientific appreciation of the vastness of the movements and <unk> by which the effect is produced , and while the one occupies the intellect , the other impresses the soul .
the mind that has lost , through its philosophy , the power of feeling this emotion of awe in such scenes , has sunk , not risen .
its possessor has made himself inferior , not superior , to the rest of his species , by having paralyzed one of his <unk> of pleasure .
to him an eclipse is only curious and wonderful ; to others it is sublime .
the soldiers of <name> were extremely terrified .
a great panic spread throughout the encampment .
<name> himself , instead of attempting to allay their fears by reasoning , or treating them as of no importance , immediately gave the subject his most serious attention .
he called together the soothsayers , and directed them to consult together , and let him know what this great phenomenon portended .
this mere committing of the subject to the attention of the soothsayers had a great effect among all the soldiers of the army .
it calmed them .
it changed their agitation and terror into a feeling of suspense , in awaiting the answer of the soothsayers , which was far less painful and dangerous ; and at length , when the answer came , it allayed their anxiety and fear altogether .
the soothsayers said that the sun was on <name> 's side , and the moon on that of the persians , and that this sudden waning of her light <unk> the defeat and destruction which the persians were about to undergo .
the army were satisfied with this decision , and were inspired with new confidence and ardor .
it is often idle to attempt to oppose ignorance and absurdity by such feeble instruments as truth and reason , and the wisest managers of mankind have generally been most successful when their plan has been to counteract one folly by means of the influence of another .
<name> 's army consisted of about fifty thousand men , with the phalanx in the center .
this army moved along down the eastern bank of the <unk> , the scouts pressing forward as far as possible in every direction in front of the main army , in order to get intelligence of the foe .
it is in this way that two great armies feel after each other , as it were , like insects creeping over the ground , exploring the way before them with their antennÃ¦ .
at length , after three days' advance , the scouts came in with intelligence of the enemy .
<name> pressed forward with a detachment of his army to meet them .
they proved to be , however , not the main body of <name> 's army , but only a single corps of a thousand men , in advance of the rest .
they retreated as <name> approached .
he , however , succeeded in capturing some horsemen , who gave the information that <name> had assembled his vast forces on the plain of <unk> , and was waiting there in readiness to give his advancing enemy battle .
<name> halted his troops .
he formed an encampment , and made arrangements for depositing his baggage there .
he refreshed the men , examined and repaired their arms , and made the arrangements for battle .
these operations consumed several days .
at the end of that time , early one morning , long before day , the camp was in motion , and the columns , armed and equipped for immediate contest , moved forward .
they expected to have reached the camp of <name> at daybreak , but the distance was greater than they had supposed .
at length , however , the macedonians , in their march , came upon the brow of a range of hills , from which they looked down upon numberless and endless lines of infantry and cavalry , and ranges after ranges of tents , which filled the plain .
here the army paused while <name> examined the field , studying for a long time , and with great attention , the <name> and disposition of the enemy .
they were four miles distant still , but the murmuring sounds of their voices and movements came to the ears of the macedonians through the calm autumnal air .
<name> called the leading officers together , and held a consultation on the question whether to march down and attack the persians on the plain that night , or to wait till the next day .
parmenio was in favor of a night attack , in order to surprise the enemy by coming upon them at an unexpected time .
but <name> said no .
he was sure of victory .
he had got his enemies all before him ; they were fully in his power .
he would , therefore , take no advantage , but would attack them fairly and in open day .
<name> had fifty thousand men ; the persians were variously estimated between five hundred thousand and a million .
there is something sublime in the idea of such a pause , made by the macedonian phalanx and its wings , on the slopes of the hills , <unk> its attack upon ten times its number , to give the mighty mass of their enemies the chances of a fair and equal contest .
<name> made <unk> addresses to his soldiers on the occasion of their having now at last before them , what they had so long toiled and labored to attain , the whole concentrated force of the persian empire .
they were now going to contend , not for single provinces and kingdoms , as heretofore , but for general empire ; and the victory which they were about to achieve would place them on the summit of human <name> .
in all that he said on the subject , the unquestionable certainty of victory was assumed .
<name> completed his arrangements , and then retired to rest .
he went to sleep  at least he appeared to do so .
early in the morning parmenio arose , summoned the men to their posts , and arranged every thing for the march .
he then went to <name> 's tent .
<name> was still asleep .
he awoke him , and told him that all was ready .
parmenio expressed surprise at his sleeping so quietly at a time when such vast issues were at stake .
" you seem as calm , " said he , " as if you had had the battle and gained the victory . "
" i have done so , " said <name> .
" i consider the whole work done when we have gained access to <name> and his forces , and find him ready to give us battle . "
<name> soon appeared at the head of his troops .
of course this day was one of the most important ones of his life , and one of the historians of the time has preserved an account of his dress as he went into battle .
he wore a short tunic , girt close around him , and over it a linen <unk> , strongly <unk> .
the belt by which the tunic was held was <unk> with figures of beautiful workmanship .
this belt was a present to him from some of the people of the conquered countries through which he had passed , and it was very much admired .
he had a helmet upon his head , of polished steel , with a neck piece , also of steel , ornamented with precious stones .
his helmet was surmounted with a white plume .
his sword , which was a present to him from the king of cyprus , was very light and slender , and of the most perfect temper .
he carried , also , a shield and a <name> , made in the best possible manner for use , not for display .
thus his dress corresponded with the character of his action .
it was simple , compact , and whatever of value it possessed consisted in those substantial excellencies which would give the bearer the greatest efficiency on the field of battle .
the persians were accustomed to make use of elephants in their wars .
they also had chariots , with <unk> placed at the <unk> , which they were accustomed to drive among their enemies and <unk> them down .
<name> resorted to none of these contrivances .
there was the phalanx  the terrible phalanx  advancing irresistibly either in one body or in detachments , with columns of infantry and flying troops of horsemen on the wings .
<name> relied simply on the strength , the courage , the energy , and the calm and steady , but resistless ardor of his men , arranging them in simple combinations , and leading them forward directly to their work .
the macedonians cut their way through the mighty mass of their enemies with irresistible force .
the elephants turned and fled .
the foot soldiers seized the horses of some of the <unk> chariots and cut the traces .
in respect to others , they opened to the right and left and let them pass through , when they were easily captured by the men in the rear .
in the mean time the phalanx pressed on , enjoying a great advantage in the level nature of the ground .
the persian troops were broken in upon and driven away wherever they were attacked .
in a word , before night the whole mighty mass was scattering every where in confusion , except some hundreds of thousands left trampled upon and dead , or else writhing upon the ground , and groaning in their dying agonies .
<name> himself fled .
<name> pursued him with a troop of horse as far as <unk> , which had been <name> 's head-quarters , and where he had deposited immense treasures .
<name> had gone through and escaped when <name> arrived at <unk> , but the city and the treasures fell into <name> 's hands .
although <name> had been so completely victorious over his enemies on the day of battle , and had maintained his ground against them with such invincible power , he was , nevertheless , a few days afterward , driven entirely off the field , and completely away from the region where the battle had been fought .
what the living men , standing erect in arms , and full of martial vigor , could not do , was easily and effectually accomplished by their dead bodies <unk> on the plain .
the corpses of three hundred thousand men , and an equal bulk of the bodies of elephants and horses , was too enormous a mass to be buried .
it had to be abandoned ; and the horrible <unk> and pestilence which it emitted drove all the inhabitants of the country away .
<name> marched his troops rapidly off the ground , leaving , as the direct result of the battle , a wide extent of country <unk> and desolate , with this vast mass of <unk> and pestilence reigning in awful silence and solitude in the midst of it .
<name> went to babylon .
the governor of the city prepared to receive him as a conqueror .
the people came out in throngs to meet him , and all the avenues of approach were crowded with spectators .
all the city walls , too , were covered with men and women , assembled to witness the scene .
as for <name> himself , he was filled with pride and pleasure at thus arriving at the full accomplishment of his earliest and <unk> dreams of <name> .
the great <unk> of the <name> treasures of persia was at susa , a strong city east of babylon .
susa was the <name> residence of the persian kings , as <unk> , further north , among the mountains , was their summer residence .
there was a magnificent palace and a very strong citadel at susa , and the treasures were kept in the citadel .
it is said that in times of peace the persian monarchs had been accustomed to collect coin , melt it down , and cast the gold in earthen jars .
the jars were afterward broken off from the gold , leaving the bullion in the form of the interior of the jars .
an enormous amount of gold and silver , and of other treasures , had been thus collected .
<name> was aware of this <unk> before he advanced to meet <name> , and , on the day of the battle of <unk> , as soon as the victory was decided , he sent an officer from the very field to summon susa to surrender .
they obeyed the summons , and <name> , soon after his great public entrance into babylon , marched to susa , and took possession of the vast stores of wealth accumulated there .
the amount was enormous , both in quantity and value , and the seizing of it was a very magnificent act of plunder .
in fact , it is probable that <name> 's slaughter of the persian army at <unk> , and subsequent <unk> of susa , constitute , taken together , the most gigantic case of murder and robbery which was ever committed by man ; so that , in performing these deeds , the great hero attained at last to the <name> of having perpetrated the grandest and most imposing of all human crimes .
that these deeds were really crimes there can be no doubt , when we consider that <name> did not pretend to have any other motive in this invasion than love of conquest , which is , in other words , love of violence and plunder .
they are only technically <unk> from being called crimes by the fact that the earth has no laws and no <unk> high enough to condemn such enormous <unk> as that of one quarter of the globe breaking violently and <unk> in upon and robbing the other .
besides the treasures , <name> found also at susa a number of trophies which had been brought by xerxes from greece ; for xerxes had invaded greece some hundred years before <name> 's day , and had brought to susa the spoils and the trophies of his victories .
<name> sent them all back to greece again .
from susa the conqueror moved on to <unk> , the great persian capital .
on his march he had to pass through a defile of the mountains .
the mountaineers had been accustomed to exact tribute here of all who passed , having a sort of right , derived from ancient usage , to the payment of a toll .
they sent to <name> when they heard that he was approaching , and informed him that he could not pass with his army without paying the customary toll .
<name> sent back word that he would meet them at the pass , and give them their due .
they understood this , and prepared to defend the pass .
some persian troops joined them .
they built walls and <unk> across the narrow passages .
they collected great stones on the <unk> of precipices , and on the declivities of the mountains , to roll down upon the heads of their enemies .
by these and every other means they attempted to stop <name> 's passage .
but he had contrived to send detachments around by circuitous and precipitous paths , which even the mountaineers had deemed impracticable , and thus attack his enemies suddenly and unexpectedly from above their own positions .
as usual , his plan succeeded .
the mountaineers were driven away , and the conqueror advanced toward the great persian capital .

<name> 's march from susa to <unk> was less a march than a triumphal progress .
he felt the pride and elation so naturally resulting from success very strongly .
the moderation and forbearance which had characterized him in his earlier years , gradually disappeared as he became great and powerful .
he was intoxicated with his success .
he became haughty , vain , capricious , and cruel .
as he approached <unk> , he conceived the idea that , as this city was the capital and center of the persian monarchy , and , as such , the point from which had <unk> all the persian hostility to greece , he owed it some signal retribution .
accordingly , although the inhabitants made no opposition to his entrance , he marched in with the phalanx formed , and gave the soldiers <name> to kill and plunder as they pleased .
there was another very striking instance of the capricious recklessness now beginning to appear in <name> 's character , which occurred soon after he had taken possession of <unk> .
he was giving a great banquet to his friends , the officers of the army , and to persians of distinction among those who had submitted to him .
there was , among other women at this banquet , a very beautiful and accomplished female named <unk> .
<name> made her his favorite and companion , though she was not his wife .
<unk> did all in her power to <unk> and please <name> during the feast by her vivacity , her wit , her adroit attentions to him , and the display of her charms , and at length , when he himself , as well as the other guests , were excited with wine , she asked him to allow her to have the pleasure of going herself and setting fire , with her own hands , to the great palace of the persian kings in the city .
<unk> was a native of attica in greece , a kingdom of which athens was the capital .
xerxes , who had built the great palace of <unk> , had formerly invaded greece and had burned athens , and now <unk> desired to burn his palace in <unk> , to gratify her revenge , by making of its conflagration an evening spectacle to entertain the macedonian party after their supper .
<name> agreed to the proposal , and the whole company moved forward .
taking the torches from the <unk> halls , they sallied forth , alarming the city with their shouts , and with the flashing of the lights they bore .
the plan of <unk> was carried fully into effect , every <unk> guest assisting , by putting fire to the immense pile wherever they could get access to it .
they performed the barbarous deed with shouts of vengeance and exultation .
there is , however , something very solemn and awful in a great conflagration at night , and very few <unk> can gaze upon the fury of the lurid and frightful flames which they have caused to ascend without some misgivings and some remorse .
<name> was sobered by the grand and sublime , but terrible spectacle .
he was awed by it .
he repented .
he ordered the fire to be extinguished ; but it was too late .
the palace was destroyed , and one new blot , which has never since been effaced , was cast upon <name> 's character and fame .
and yet , notwithstanding these increasing proofs of pride and cruelty , which were beginning to be developed , <name> still preserved some of the early traits of character which had made him so great a favorite in the commencement of his career .
he loved his mother , and sent her presents continually from the treasures which were falling all the time into his possession .
she was a woman of a proud , imperious , and ungovernable character , and she made antipater , whom <name> had left in command in macedon , infinite trouble .
she wanted to exercise the powers of government herself , and was continually urging this .
<name> would not comply with these wishes , but he paid her personally every attention in his power , and bore all her invectives and reproaches with great <name> and good humor .
at one time he received a long letter from antipater , full of complaints against her ; but <name> , after reading it , said that they were heavy charges it was true , but that a single one of his mother 's tears would <unk> ten thousand such accusations .
olympias used to write very frequently to <name> , and in these letters she would criticise and discuss his proceedings , and make comments upon the characters and actions of his generals .
<name> kept these letters very secret , never showing them to any one .
one day , however , when he was reading one of these letters , <unk> , the personal friend and companion who has been already several times mentioned , came up , half playfully , and began to look over his shoulder .
<name> went on , allowing him to read , and then , when the letter was finished he took the <unk> ring from his finger and pressed it upon <unk> 's lips , a signal for silence and secrecy .
<name> was very kind to <unk> , the mother of <name> , and also to <name> 's children .
he would not give these unhappy captives their <name> , but in every other respect he treated them with the greatest possible kindness and consideration .
he called <unk> mother , loaded her with presents  presents , it is true , which he had plundered from her son , but to which it was considered , in those days , that he had acquired a just and perfect title .
when he reached susa , he established <unk> and the children there in great state .
this had been their usual residence in most seasons of the year , when not at <unk> , so that here they were , as it were , at home .
<unk> [ f ] was , as has been already mentioned , further north , among the mountains .
after the battle of <unk> , while <name> marched to babylon and to susa , <name> had fled to <unk> , and was now there , his family being thus at one of the <name> palaces under the command of the conqueror , and he himself independent , but <unk> , in the other .
he had with him about forty thousand men , who still remained faithful to his fallen fortunes .
among these were several thousand greeks , whom he had collected in <name> minor and other grecian countries , and whom he had attached to his service by means of pay .
[ footnote f : the modern <unk> . ]
he called the officers of his army together , and explained to them the determination that he had come to in respect to his future movements .
" a large part of those , " said he , " who formerly served as officers of my government have abandoned me in my adversity , and gone over to <name> 's side .
they have surrendered to him the towns , and <unk> , and provinces which i intrusted to their fidelity .
you alone remain faithful and true .
as for myself , i might yield to the conqueror , and have him assign to me some province or kingdom to govern as his subordinate ; but i <name> never submit to such a degradation .
i can die in the struggle , but never <name> yield .
i <name> wear no crown which another puts upon my brow , nor give up my right to reign over the empire of my ancestors till i give up my life .
if you agree with me in this determination , let us act energetically upon it .
we have it in our power to terminate the injuries we are suffering , or else to avenge them . "
the army responded most cordially to this appeal .
they were ready , they said , to follow him wherever he should lead .
all this apparent enthusiasm , however , was very <unk> and <unk> .
a general named bessus , combining with some other officers in the army , conceived the plan of seizing <name> and making him a prisoner , and then taking command of the army himself .
if <name> should pursue him , and be likely to overtake and conquer him , he then thought that , by giving up <name> as a prisoner , he could <unk> for <name> and safety , and perhaps great rewards , both for himself and for those who acted with him .
if , on the other hand , they should succeed in increasing their own forces so as to make head against <name> , and finally to drive him away , then bessus was to usurp the throne , and dispose of <name> by <unk> him , or <unk> him for life in some remote and solitary castle .
bessus communicated his plans , very cautiously at first , to the leading officers of the army .
the greek soldiers were not included in the plot .
they , however , heard and saw enough to lead them to suspect what was in preparation .
they warned <name> , and urged him to rely upon them more than he had done ; to make them his body-guard ; and to pitch his tent in their part of the encampment .
but <name> declined these proposals .
he would not , he said , distrust and abandon his countrymen , who were his natural <unk> , and put himself in the hands of strangers .
he would not betray and desert his friends in anticipation of their deserting and betraying him .
in the mean time , as <name> advanced toward <unk> , <name> and his forces retreated from it toward the eastward , through the great tract of country lying south of the caspian sea .
there is a mountainous region here , with a defile traversing it , through which it would be necessary for <name> to pass .
this defile was called the caspian gates , [ g ] the name referring to rocks on each side .
the marching of an army through a narrow and dangerous defile like this always causes detention and delay , and <name> hastened forward in hopes to overtake <name> before he should reach it .
he advanced with such speed that only the strongest and most robust of his army could keep up .
thousands , worn out with exertion and toil , were left behind , and many of the horses sank down by the road side , exhausted with heat and fatigue , to die .
<name> pressed desperately on with all who were able to follow .
[ footnote g : <unk> <unk> on the map , which means the caspian gates . ]
it was all in vain , however ; it was too late when he arrived at the pass .
<name> had gone through with all his army .
<name> stopped to rest his men , and to allow time for those behind to come up .
he then went on for a couple of days , when he encamped , in order to send out <unk> parties  that is to say , small detachments , dispatched to explore the surrounding country in search of grain and other food for the horses .
food for the horses of an army being too bulky to be transported far , has to be collected day by day from the neighborhood of the line of march .
while halting for these <unk> parties to return , a persian nobleman came into the camp , and informed <name> that <name> and the forces accompanying him were encamped about two days ' march in advance , but that bessus was in command  the conspiracy having been successful , and <name> having been deposed and made a prisoner .
the greeks , who had adhered to their fidelity , finding that all the army were combined against them , and that they were not strong enough to resist , had abandoned the persian camp , and had retired to the mountains , where they were awaiting the result .
<name> determined to set forward immediately in pursuit of bessus and his prisoner .
he did not wait for the return of the <unk> parties .
he selected the ablest and most active , both of foot soldiers and horsemen , ordered them to take two days ' provisions , and then set forth with them that very evening .
the party pressed on all that night , and the next day till noon .
they halted till evening , and then set forth again .
very early the next morning they arrived at the encampment which the persian nobleman had described .
they found the remains of the camp-fires , and all the marks usually left upon a spot which has been used as the bivouac of an army .
the army itself , however , was gone .
the pursuers were now too much fatigued to go any further without rest .
<name> remained here , accordingly , through the day , to give his men and his horses refreshment and repose .
that night they set forward again , and the next day at noon they arrived at another encampment of the persians , which they had left scarcely twenty-four hours before .
the officers of <name> 's army were excited and animated in the highest degree , as they found themselves thus drawing so near to the great object of their pursuit .
they were ready for any exertions , any privation and fatigue , any measures , however extraordinary , to accomplish their end .
<name> inquired of the inhabitants of the place whether there were not some shorter road than the one along which the enemy were moving .
there was one <unk> , but it led through a desolate and desert tract of land , destitute of water .
in the march of an army , as the men are always heavily loaded with arms and provisions , and water can not be carried , it is always considered essential to choose routes which <name> furnish supplies of water by the way .
<name> , however , disregarded this consideration here , and prepared at once to push into the <unk> with a small detachment .
he had been now two years advancing from macedon into the heart of <name> , always in quest of <name> as his great opponent and enemy .
he had conquered his armies , taken his cities , plundered his palaces , and made himself master of his whole realm .
still , so long as <name> himself remained at <name> and in the field , no victories could be considered as complete .
to capture <name> himself would be the last and crowning act of his conquest .
he had now been pursuing him for eighteen hundred miles , advancing slowly from province to province , and from kingdom to kingdom .
during all this time the strength of his flying foe had been wasting away .
his armies had been broken up , his courage and <name> had gradually failed , while the animation and <name> of the pursuer had been gathering fresh and increasing strength from his successes , and were excited to wild enthusiasm now , as the hour for the final consummation of all his desires seemed to be drawing nigh .
guides were ordered to be furnished by the inhabitants , to show the detachment the way across the solitary and desert country .
the detachment was to consist of horsemen entirely , that they might advance with the utmost celerity .
to get as efficient a corps as possible , <name> dismounted five hundred of the cavalry , and gave their horses to five hundred men  officers and others  selected for their strength and courage from among the foot soldiers .
all were ambitious of being designated for this service .
besides the honor of being so selected , there was an intense excitement , as usual toward the close of a <name> , to arrive at the end .
this body of horsemen were ready to set out in the evening .
<name> took the command , and , following the guides , they trotted off in the direction which the guides indicated .
they traveled all night .
when the day dawned , they saw , from an elevation to which they had attained , the body of the persian troops moving at a short distance before them , foot soldiers , chariots , and horsemen pressing on together in great confusion and disorder .
as soon as bessus and his company found that their pursuers were close upon them , they attempted at first to hurry forward , in the vain <name> of still effecting their escape .
<name> was in a chariot .
they urged this chariot on , but it moved heavily .
then they concluded to abandon it , and they called upon <name> to mount a horse and ride off with them , leaving the rest of the army and the baggage to its fate .
but <name> refused .
he said he would rather trust himself in the hands of <name> than in those of such traitors as they .
rendered desperate by their situation , and exasperated by this reply , bessus and his confederates thrust their spears into <name> 's body , as he sat in his chariot , and then galloped away .
they divided into different parties , each taking a different road .
their object in doing this was to increase their chances of escape by confusing <name> in his plans for pursuing them .
<name> pressed on toward the ground which the enemy were abandoning , and sent off separate detachments after the various divisions of the flying army .
in the mean time <name> remained in his chariot wounded and bleeding .
he was worn out and exhausted , both in body and mind , by his complicated sufferings and sorrows .
his kingdom lost ; his family in captivity ; his beloved wife in the grave , where the sorrows and sufferings of separation from her husband had borne her ; his cities sacked ; his palaces and treasures plundered ; and now he himself , in the last hour of his extremity , abandoned and betrayed by all in whom he had placed his confidence and trust , his heart sunk within him in despair .
at such a time the soul turns from <unk> friends to an open foe with something like a feeling of confidence and attachment .
<name> 's exasperation against bessus was so intense , that his hostility to <name> became a species of friendship in comparison .
he felt that <name> was a sovereign like himself , and would have some sympathy and <unk> for a sovereign 's misfortunes .
he thought , too , of his mother , his wife , and his children , and the kindness with which <name> had treated them went to his heart .
he lay there , accordingly , faint and bleeding in his chariot , and looking for the coming of <name> as for that of a protector and friend , the only one to whom he could now look for any relief in the extremity of his distress .
the macedonians searched about in various places , thinking it possible that in the sudden dispersion of the enemy <name> might have been left behind .
at last the chariot in which he was lying was found .
<name> was in it , pierced with spears .
the floor of the chariot was covered with blood .
they raised him a little , and he spoke .
he called for water .
men wounded and dying on the field of battle are tormented always with an insatiable and intolerable thirst , the manifestations of which constitute one of the greatest horrors of the scene .
they cry piteously to all who pass to bring them water , or else to kill them .
they crawl along the ground to get at the <unk> of their dead companions , in hopes to find , remaining in them , some drops to drink ; and if there is a little <name> meandering through the battle-field , its bed gets filled and choked up with the bodies of those who crawled there , in their agony , to <unk> their horrible thirst , and die .
<name> was suffering this thirst .
it bore down and silenced , for the time , every other suffering , so that his first cry , when his enemies came around him with shouts of exultation , was not for his life , not for <name> , not for relief from the pain and anguish of his wounds  he begged them to give him some water .
he spoke through an interpreter .
the interpreter was a persian prisoner whom the macedonian army had taken some time before , and who had learned the greek language in the macedonian camp .
anticipating some occasion for his services , they had brought him with them now , and it was through him that <name> called for water .
a macedonian soldier went immediately to get some .
others hurried away in search of <name> , to bring him to the spot where the great object of his hostility , and of his long and protracted pursuit , was dying .
<name> received the drink .
he then said that he was extremely glad that they had an interpreter with them , who could understand him , and bear his message to <name> .
he had been afraid that he should have had to die without being able to communicate what he had to say .
" tell <name> , " said he , then , " that i feel under the strongest obligations to him which i can now never repay , for his kindness to my wife , my mother , and my children .
he not only spared their lives , but treated them with the greatest consideration and care , and did all in his power to make them happy .
the last feeling in my heart is gratitude to him for these favors .
i <name> now that he <name> go on prosperously , and finish his conquests as triumphantly as he has begun them . "
he would have made one last request , he added , if he had thought it necessary , and that was , that <name> would pursue the traitor bessus , and avenge the murder he had committed ; but he was sure that <name> would do this of his own accord , as the punishment of such treachery was an object of common interest for every king .
<name> then took <unk> , the macedonian who had brought him the water , by the hand , saying , " give <name> thy hand as i now give thee mine ; it is the pledge of my gratitude and affection . "
<name> was too weak to say much more .
they gathered around him , endeavoring to sustain his strength until <name> should arrive ; but it was all in vain .
he sank gradually , and soon ceased to breathe .
<name> came up a few minutes after all was over .
he was at first shocked at the spectacle before him , and then overwhelmed with grief .
he wept bitterly .
some <unk> of conscience may have visited his heart at seeing thus before him the ruin he had made .
<name> had never injured him or done him any wrong , and yet here he lay , hunted to death by a persevering and relentless hostility , for which his conqueror had no excuse but his innate love of dominion over his fellow-men .
<name> spread his own military cloak over the dead body .
he immediately made arrangements for having the body embalmed , and then sent it to susa , for <unk> , in a very costly coffin , and with a procession of <name> magnificence .
he sent it to her that she might have the satisfaction of seeing it deposited in the tombs of the persian kings .
what a present !
the killer of a son sending the dead body , in a splendid coffin , to the mother , as a token of respectful regard !
<name> pressed on to the northward and eastward in pursuit of bessus , who had soon collected the scattered remains of his army , and was doing his utmost to get into a posture of defense .
he did not , however , overtake him till he had crossed the <unk> , a large river which <name> be found upon the map , flowing to the northward and westward into the caspian sea .
he had great difficulty in crossing this river , as it was too deep to be forded , and the banks and bottom were so <name> and yielding that he could not make the foundations of bridges stand .
he accordingly made floats and rafts , which were supported by skins made buoyant by inflation , or by being stuffed with straw and hay .
after getting his army , which had been in the mean time greatly <unk> and strengthened , across this river , he moved on .
the generals under bessus , finding all <name> of escape failing them , resolved on betraying him as he had betrayed his commander .
they sent word to <name> that if he would send forward a small force where they should indicate , they would give up bessus to his hands .
<name> did so , <unk> the command to an officer named ptolemy .
ptolemy found bessus in a small walled town whither he had fled for refuge , and easily took him prisoner .
he sent back word to <name> that bessus was at his disposal , and asked for orders .
the answer was , " put a rope around his neck and send him to me . "
when the wretched prisoner was brought into <name> 's presence , <name> demanded of him how he could have been so base as to have seized , bound , and at last murdered his kinsman and benefactor .
it is a curious instance in proof of the permanence and stability of the great characteristics of human nature , through all the changes of civilization and lapses of time , that bessus gave the same answer that <unk> almost always give when brought to account for their wrongs .
he laid the fault upon his accomplices and friends .
it was not his act , it was theirs .
<name> ordered him to be publicly scourged ; then he caused his face to be mutilated in a manner customary in those days , when a tyrant wished to stamp upon his victim a perpetual <name> of infamy .
in this condition , and with a mind in an agony of suspense and fear at the thought of worse tortures which he knew were to come , <name> sent him as a second present to <unk> , to be dealt with , at susa , as her revenge might direct .
she inflicted upon him the most extreme tortures , and finally , when <unk> with the pleasure of seeing him suffer , the story is that they chose four very elastic trees , growing at a little distance from each other , and bent down the tops of them toward the central point between them .
they fastened the exhausted and dying bessus to these trees , one limb of his body to each , and then releasing the stems from their confinement , they flew upward , tearing the body asunder , each holding its own dissevered portion , as if in triumph , far over the heads of the multitude assembled to witness the spectacle .
chapter xi .
deterioration of character .
b.c .
329 <name> at the summit of his <unk>  sad <unk>  <name> becomes <unk>  his officers became <unk>  character of <unk>  his services to alexander.  parmenio 's son , <unk>  his dissolute character.  <unk>  plot of <unk>  <unk> destroys <unk>  philotas <unk>  the council of <unk>  philotas <unk>  arrest of <unk>  the body of <unk>  alexander's address to the army.  philotas brought to <unk>  defense of <unk>  he is put to the <unk>  confession of <unk>  he is stoned to death.  parmenio condemned to death.  mission of <unk>  <unk>  brutal murder of <unk>  story of <unk>  he saves <name> 's life.  services of <unk>  occurrences at the <unk>  clitus reproaches alexander.  alexander's <unk>  <name> <unk> <unk>  his remorse .
<name> was now twenty-six years of age .
he had accomplished fully the great objects which had been the aim of his ambition .
<name> was dead , and he was himself the undisputed master of all western <name> .
his wealth was almost boundless .
his power was supreme over what was , in his view , the whole known world .
but , during the process of rising to this ascendency , his character was sadly changed .
he lost the simplicity , the temperance , the moderation , and the sense of justice which characterized his early years .
he adopted the dress and the luxurious manners of the persians .
he lived in the palaces of the persian kings , imitating all their state and splendor .
he became very fond of <unk> entertainments and of wine , and often drank to excess .
he provided himself a <unk> of three hundred and sixty young females , in whose company he spent his time , giving himself up to every form of <unk> and dissipation .
in a word , he was no longer the same man .
the decision , the energy of character , the steady pursuit of great ends by <name> , forethought , patient effort , and self-denial , all disappeared ; nothing now seemed to interest him but banquets , <unk> , parties of pleasure , and whole days and nights spent in dissipation and vice .
this state of things was a great cause of mortification and chagrin to the officers of his army .
many of them were older than himself , and better able to resist these temptations to luxury , <unk> , and vice .
they therefore remained firm in their original simplicity and integrity , and after some respectful but ineffectual remonstrances , they stood aloof , alienated from their commander in heart , and condemning very strongly , among themselves , his wickedness and folly .
on the other hand , many of the younger officers followed alexander's example , and became as vain , as irregular , and as fond of vicious indulgence as he .
but then , though they joined him in his pleasures , there was no strong bond of union between him and them .
the tie which binds mere companions in pleasure together is always very slight and frail .
thus <name> gradually lost the confidence and affection of his old friends , and gained no new ones .
his officers either disapproved his conduct , and were distant and cold , or else joined him in his dissipation and vice , without feeling any real respect for his character , or being bound to him by any principle of fidelity .
parmenio and his son philotas were , respectively , striking examples of these two kinds of character .
parmenio was an old general , now considerably advanced in life .
he had served , as has already been stated , under <name> , <name> 's father , and had acquired great experience and great fame before <name> succeeded to the throne .
during the whole of <name> 's career parmenio had been his principal lieutenant general , and he had always placed his greatest reliance upon him in all trying emergencies .
he was cool , calm , intrepid , sagacious .
he held <name> back from many rash enterprises , and was the efficient means of his accomplishing most of his plans .
it is the custom among all nations to give kings the <name> of all that is effected by their generals and officers ; and the writers of those days would , of course , in <unk> the exploits of the macedonian army , exaggerate the share which <name> had in their performances , and <unk> those of parmenio .
but in modern times , many impartial readers , in reviewing calmly these events , think that there is reason to doubt whether <name> , if he had set out on his great expedition without parmenio , would have succeeded at all .
philotas was the son of parmenio , but he was of a very different character .
the difference was one which is very often , in all ages of the world , to be observed between those who inherit greatness and those who acquire it for themselves .
we see the same analogy reigning at the present day , when the sons of the wealthy , who are born to fortune , substitute pride , and arrogance , and vicious <unk> and waste for the modesty , and <name> , and virtue of their <unk> , by means of which the fortune was acquired .
philotas was proud , <unk> , extravagant , and addicted , like <name> his master , to every species of indulgence and dissipation .
he was universally hated .
his father , out of <name> with his haughty airs , his <unk> , and his pomp and parade , advised him , one day , to " make himself less . "
but <unk> prudent advice to his son was thrown away .
philotas spoke of himself as <name> 's great reliance .
" what would <name> have been or have done , " said he , " without my father parmenio ?
and what would <name> have been or have done , without me ? "
these things were reported to <name> , and thus the mind of each was filled with suspicion , fear , and hatred toward the other .
courts and camps are always the scenes of conspiracy and treason , and <name> was continually hearing of conspiracies and plots formed against him .
the strong sentiment of love and devotion with which he inspired all around him at the commencement of his career , was now gone , and his generals and officers were continually planning schemes to depose him from the power which he seemed no longer to have the energy to wield ; or , at least , <name> was continually suspecting that such plans were formed , and he was kept in a continual state of uneasiness and anxiety in discovering and punishing them .
at last a conspiracy occurred in which philotas was implicated .
<name> was informed one day that a plot had been formed to depose and destroy him ; that philotas had been made acquainted with it by a friend of <name> 's , in order that he might make it known to the king ; that he had neglected to do so , thus making it probable that he was himself in league with the conspirators .
<name> was informed that the leader and originator of this conspiracy was one of his generals named <unk> .
he immediately sent an officer to <unk> to summon him into his presence .
<unk> appeared to be struck with consternation at this summons .
instead of obeying it , he <name> his sword , thrust it into his own heart , and fell dead upon the ground .
<name> then sent for philotas , and asked him if it was indeed true that he had been informed of this conspiracy , and had neglected to make it known .
philotas replied that he had been told that such a plot was formed , but that he did not believe it ; that such stories were continually invented by the malice of <unk> men , and that he had not considered the report which came to his ears as worthy of any attention .
he was , however , now convinced , by the terror which <unk> had manifested , and by his suicide , that all was true , and he asked <name> 's pardon for not having taken immediate measures for communicating promptly the information he had received .
<name> gave him his hand , said that he was convinced that he was innocent , and had acted as he did from disbelief in the existence of the conspiracy , and not from any guilty participation in it .
so philotas went away to his tent .
<name> , however , did not drop the subject here .
he called a council of his ablest and best friends and advisers , consisting of the principal officers of his army , and laid the facts before them .
they came to a different conclusion from his in respect to the guilt of philotas .
they believed him implicated in the crime , and demanded his trial .
trial in such a case , in those days , meant putting the accused to the torture , with a view of forcing him to confess his guilt .
<name> yielded to this proposal .
perhaps he had secretly <unk> it .
the advisers of kings and conquerors , in such circumstances as this , generally have the sagacity to discover what advice <name> be agreeable .
at all events , <name> followed the advice of his counselors , and made arrangements for arresting philotas on that very evening .
these circumstances occurred at a time when the army was preparing for a march , the various generals lodging in tents pitched for the purpose .
<name> placed extra guards in various parts of the encampment , as if to impress the whole army with a sense of the importance and solemnity of the occasion .
he then sent officers to the tent of philotas , late at night , to arrest him .
the officers found their unhappy victim asleep .
they awoke him , and made known their errand .
philotas arose , and obeyed the summons , dejected and distressed , aware , apparently , that his destruction was impending .
the next morning <name> called together a large assembly , consisting of the principal and most important portions of the army , to the number of several thousands .
they came together with an air of impressive solemnity , expecting , from the preliminary preparations , that business of very solemn moment was to come before them , though they knew not what it was .
these impressions of awe and solemnity were very much increased by the spectacle which first met the eyes of the assembly after they were convened .
this spectacle was that of the dead body of <unk> , bloody and ghastly , which <name> ordered to be brought in and exposed to view .
the death of <unk> had been kept a secret , so that the appearance of his body was an unexpected as well as a shocking sight .
when the first feeling of surprise and wonder had a little subsided , <name> explained to the assembly the nature of the conspiracy , and the circumstances connected with the <unk> of one of the guilty <unk> in it .
the spectacle of the body , and the statement of the king , produced a scene of great and universal excitement in the assembly , and this excitement was raised to the highest pitch by the announcement which <name> now made , that he had reason to believe that philotas and his father parmenio , officers who had enjoyed his highest favor , and in whom he had placed the most unbounded confidence , were the authors and <unk> of the whole design .
he then ordered philotas to be brought in .
he came guarded as a criminal , with his hands tied behind him , and his head covered with a coarse cloth .
he was in a state of great dejection and despondency .
it is true that he was brought forward for trial , but he knew very well that trial meant torture , and that there was no <name> for him as to the result .
<name> said that he would leave the accused to be dealt with by the assembly , and withdrew .
the authorities of the army , who now had the proud and domineering spirit which had so long excited their hatred and envy completely in their power , listened for a time to what philotas had to say in his own justification .
he showed that there was no evidence whatever against him , and appealed to their sense of justice not to condemn him on mere vague surmises .
in reply , they decided to put him to the torture .
there was no evidence , it was true , and they wished , accordingly , to supply its place by his own confession , extorted by pain .
of course , his most inveterate and implacable enemies were appointed to conduct the operation .
they put philotas upon the rack .
the rack is an instrument of wheels and pulleys , into which the victim is placed , and his limbs and <unk> are stretched by it in a manner which produces most excruciating pain .
philotas bore the beginning of his torture with great resolution and fortitude .
he made no complaint , he uttered no cry : this was the signal to his executioners to increase the tension and the agony .
of course , in such a trial as this , there was no question of guilt or innocence at issue .
the only question was , which could stand out the longest , his enemies in witnessing horrible sufferings , or he himself in enduring them .
in this contest the unhappy philotas was vanquished at last .
he begged them to release him from the rack , saying he would confess whatever they required , on condition of being allowed to die in peace .
they accordingly released him , and , in answer to their questions , he confessed that he himself and his father were involved in the plot .
he said yes to various other inquiries relating to the circumstances of the conspiracy , and to the guilt of various individuals whom those that managed the torture had suspected , or who , at any rate , they wished to have condemned .
the answers of philotas to all these questions were written down , and he was himself sentenced to be stoned .
the sentence was put in execution without any delay .
during all this time parmenio was in media , in command of a very important part of <name> 's army .
it was decreed that he must die ; but some careful management was necessary to secure his execution while he was at so great a distance , and at the head of so great a force .
the affair had to be conducted with great secrecy as well as dispatch .
the plan adopted was as follows : there was a certain man , named <unk> , who was regarded as parmenio 's particular friend .
<unk> was commissioned to go to media and see the execution performed .
he was selected , because it was supposed that if any enemy , or a stranger , had been sent , parmenio would have received him with suspicion or at least with caution , and kept himself on his guard .
they gave <unk> several letters to parmenio , as if from his friends , and to one of them they attached the seal of his son philotas , the more completely to deceive the unhappy father .
<unk> was eleven days on his journey into media .
he had letters to <unk> , the governor of the province of media , which contained the king 's warrant for parmenio 's execution .
he arrived at the house of <unk> in the night .
he delivered his letters , and they together concerted the plans for carrying the execution into effect .
after having taken all the precautions necessary , <unk> went , with many attendants accompanying him , to the quarters of parmenio .
the old general , for he was at this time eighty years of age , was walking in his grounds .
<unk> being admitted , ran up to accost him , with great appearance of cordiality and friendship .
he delivered to him his letters , and parmenio read them .
he seemed much pleased with their contents , especially with the one which had been written in the name of his son .
he had no means of detecting the imposture , for it was very customary in those days for letters to be written by secretaries , and to be authenticated solely by the seal .
parmenio was much pleased to get good tidings from <name> , and from his son , and began conversing upon the contents of the letters , when <unk> , watching his opportunity , <name> forth a dagger which he had concealed upon his person , and plunged it into parmenio 's side .
he <name> it forth immediately and struck it at his throat .
the attendants rushed on at this signal , and thrust their swords again and again into the fallen body until it ceased to breathe .
the death of parmenio and of his son in this violent manner , when , too , there was so little evidence of their guilt , made a very general and a very unfavorable impression in respect to <name> ; and not long afterward another case occurred , in some respects still more painful , as it evinced still more strikingly that the mind of <name> , which had been in his earlier days filled with such <name> and lofty sentiments of justice and generosity , was gradually getting to be under the supreme dominion of selfish and ungovernable passions : it was the case of clitus .
clitus was a very celebrated general of <name> 's army , and a great favorite with the king .
he had , in fact , on one occasion saved <name> 's life .
it was at the battle of the <unk> .
<name> had exposed himself in the thickest of the combat , and was surrounded by enemies .
the sword of one of them was actually raised over his head , and would have fallen and killed him on the spot , if clitus had not rushed forward and cut the man down just at the instant when he was about striking the blow .
such acts of fidelity and courage as this had given <name> great confidence in clitus .
it happened , shortly after the death of parmenio , that the governor of one of the most important provinces of the empire resigned his post .
<name> appointed clitus to fill the vacancy .
the evening before his departure to take charge of his government , <name> invited him to a banquet , made , partly at least , in honor of his elevation .
clitus and the other guests assembled .
they drank wine , as usual , with great freedom .
<name> became excited , and began to speak , as he was now often accustomed to do , <unk> of his own exploits , and to <unk> those of his father <name> in comparison .
men half intoxicated are very prone to quarrel , and not the less so for being excellent friends when sober .
clitus had served under <name> .
he was now an old man , and , like other old men , was very tenacious of the <name> that belonged to the exploits of his youth .
he was very restless and uneasy at hearing <name> claim for himself the merit of his father <name> 's victory at <unk> , and began to murmur something to those who sat next to him about kings claiming and getting a great deal of <name> which did not belong to them .
<name> asked what it was that clitus said .
no one replied .
clitus , however , went on talking , speaking more and more audibly as he became gradually more and more excited .
he praised the character of <name> , and applauded his military exploits , saying that they were far superior to any of the enterprises of their day .
the different parties at the table took up the subject , and began to dispute , the old men taking the part of <name> and former days , and the younger defending <name> .
clitus became more and more excited .
he praised parmenio , who had been <name> 's greatest general , and began to <unk> the justice of his late condemnation and death .
<name> retorted and clitus , rising from his seat , and losing now all self-command , reproached him with severe and bitter words .
" here is the hand , " said he , extending his arm , " that saved your life at the battle of the <unk> , and the fate of parmenio shows what sort of gratitude and what rewards faithful servants are to expect at your hands . "
<name> , burning with rage , commanded clitus to leave the table .
clitus obeyed , saying , as he moved away , " he is right not to bear <unk> men at his table who can only tell him the truth .
he is right .
it is fitting for him to pass his life among barbarians and slaves , who <name> be proud to pay their adoration to his persian girdle and his splendid robe . "
<name> seized a javelin to hurl at clitus 's head .
the guests rose in confusion , and with many outcries pressed around him .
some seized <name> 's arm , some began to hurry clitus out of the room , and some were engaged in loudly <unk> and threatening each other .
they got clitus out of the apartment , but as soon as he was in the hall he broke away from them , returned by another door , and began to renew his insults to <name> .
the king hurled his javelin and struck clitus down , saying , at the same time , " go , then , and join <name> and parmenio . "
the company rushed to the rescue of the unhappy man , but it was too late .
he died almost immediately .
<name> , as soon as he came to himself was overwhelmed with remorse and despair .
he mourned bitterly , for many days , the death of his <unk> and faithful friend , and <unk> the intoxication and passion , on his part , which had caused it .
he could not , however , restore clitus to life , nor remove from his own character the indelible stains which such deeds necessarily fixed upon it .

after the events narrated in the last chapter , <name> continued , for two or three years , his expeditions and conquests in <name> , and in the course of them he met with a great variety of adventures which can not be here particularly described .
he penetrated into <name> as far as the banks of the indus , and , not content with this , was preparing to cross the indus and go on to the ganges .
his soldiers , however , resisted this design .
they were alarmed at the stories which they heard of the indian armies , with elephants bearing castles upon their backs , and soldiers armed with strange and unheard-of weapons .
these rumors , and the natural <name> of the soldiers not to go away any further from their native land , produced almost a mutiny in the army .
at length , <name> , learning how strong and how extensive the spirit of insubordination was becoming , summoned his officers to his own tent , and then ordering the whole army to gather around , he went out to meet them .
he made an address to them , in which he <unk> all their past exploits , praised the courage and perseverance which they had shown thus far , and endeavored to animate them with a <name> to proceed .
they listened in silence , and no one attempted to reply .
this solemn pause was followed by marks of great agitation throughout the assembly .
the army loved their commander , notwithstanding his faults and failings .
they were extremely unwilling to make any resistance to his authority ; but they had lost that extreme and unbounded confidence in his energy and virtue which made them ready , in the former part of his career , to press forward into any difficulties and dangers whatever , where he led the way .
at last one of the army approached the king and addressed him somewhat as follows : " we are not changed , sir , in our affection for you .
we still have , and shall always retain , the same zeal and the same fidelity .
we are ready to follow you at the hazard of our lives , and to march wherever you may lead us .
still we must ask you , most respectfully , to consider the circumstances in which we are placed .
we have done all for you that it was possible for man to do .
we have crossed seas and land .
we have marched to the end of the world , and you are now meditating the conquest of another , by going in search of new <unk> , unknown to the indians themselves .
such a thought may be worthy of your courage and resolution , but it <unk> ours , and our strength still more .
look at these ghastly faces , and these bodies covered with wounds and scars .
remember how numerous we were when first we set out with you , and see how few of us remain .
the few who have escaped so many toils and dangers have neither courage nor strength to follow you any further .
they all long to <unk> their country and their homes , and to enjoy , for the remainder of their lives , the fruits of all their toils .
forgive them these desires , so natural to man . "
the expression of these sentiments confirmed and strengthened them in the minds of all the soldiers .
<name> was greatly troubled and distressed .
a disaffection in a small part of an army may be put down by decisive measures ; but when the determination to resist is universal , it is useless for any commander , however imperious and absolute in temper , to attempt to withstand it .
<name> , however , was extremely unwilling to yield .
he remained two days shut up in his tent , the prey to disappointment and chagrin .
the result , however , was , that he abandoned plans of further conquest , and turned his steps again toward the west .
he met with various adventures as he went on , and incurred many dangers , often in a rash and foolish manner , and for no good end .
at one time , while attacking a small town , he seized a scaling ladder and mounted with the troops .
in doing this , however , he put himself forward so rashly and <unk> that his ladder was broken , and while the rest retreated he was left alone upon the wall , whence he descended into the town , and was immediately surrounded by enemies .
his friends raised their ladders again , and pressed on desperately to find and rescue him .
some gathered around him and defended him , while others contrived to open a small gate , by which the rest of the army gained admission .
by this means <name> was saved ; though , when they brought him out of the city , there was an arrow three feet long , which could not be extracted , sticking into his side through his coat of mail .
the surgeons first very carefully cut off the wooden shaft of the arrow , and then , enlarging the wound by <unk> , they <name> out the barbed point .
the soldiers were indignant that <name> should expose his person in such a <unk> way , only to endanger himself , and to compel them to rush into danger to rescue him .
the wound very nearly proved fatal .
the loss of blood was attended with extreme exhaustion ; still , in the course of a few weeks he recovered .
<name> 's habits of intoxication and vicious excess of all kinds were , in the mean time , continually increasing .
he not only indulged in such excesses himself , but he encouraged them in others .
he would offer prizes at his banquets to those who would drink the most .
on one of these occasions , the man who conquered drank , it is said , eighteen or twenty pints of wine , after which he lingered in misery for three days , and then died ; and more than forty others , present at the same entertainment , died in consequence of their excesses .
<name> returned toward babylon .
his friend <unk> was with him , sharing with him every where in all the vicious indulgences to which he had become so prone .
<name> gradually separated himself more and more from his old macedonian friends , and linked himself more and more closely with persian associates .
he married <unk> , the oldest daughter of <name> , and gave the youngest daughter to <unk> .
he encouraged similar marriages between macedonian officers and persian maidens , as far as he could .
in a word , he seemed intent in <unk> , in every way , his original character and habits of action in the <unk> , luxury , and vice of the eastern world , which he had at first so looked down upon and despised .
<name> 's entrance into babylon , on his return from his indian campaigns , was a scene of great magnificence and splendor .
embassadors and princes had assembled there from almost all the nations of the earth to receive and welcome him , and the most ample preparations were made for processions , shows , parades , and spectacles to do him honor .
the whole country was in a state of extreme excitement , and the most expensive preparations were made to give him a reception worthy of one who was the conqueror and monarch of the world , and the son of a god .
when <name> approached the city , however , he was met by a deputation of <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> were a class of philosophers who pretended , in those days , to foretell human events by means of the motions of the stars .
the motions of the stars were studied very closely in early times , and in those eastern countries , by the shepherds , who had often to remain in the open air , through the summer nights , to watch their flocks .
these shepherds observed that nearly all the stars were fixed in relation to each other , that is , although they rose successively in the east , and , passing over , set in the west , they did not change in relation to each other .
there were , however , a few that wandered about among the rest in an irregular and unaccountable manner .
they called these stars the wanderers  that is , in their language , the planets  and they watched their mysterious movements with great interest and awe .
they naturally imagined that these changes had some connection with human affairs , and they endeavored to <unk> from them the events , whether prosperous or adverse , which were to befall mankind .
whenever a comet or an eclipse appeared , they thought it portended some terrible calamity .
the study of the motions and appearances of the stars , with a view to foretell the course of human affairs , was the science of <unk> .
the <unk> came , in a very solemn and imposing procession , to meet <name> on his march .
they informed him that they had found <unk> evidence in the stars that , if he came into babylon , he would hazard his life .
they accordingly begged him not to approach any nearer , but to choose some other city for his capital .
<name> was very much perplexed by this announcement .
his mind , weakened by <unk> and dissipation , was very susceptible to superstitious fears .
it was not merely by the <unk> influence of vicious indulgence on the nervous constitution that this effect was produced .
it was , in part , the moral influence of conscious guilt .
guilt makes men afraid .
it not only increases the power of real dangers , but <unk> the mind to all sorts of imaginary fears .
<name> was very much troubled at this announcement of the <unk> .
he suspended his march , and began anxiously to consider what to do .
at length the greek philosophers came to him and reasoned with him on the subject , persuading him that the science of <unk> was not worthy of any belief .
the greeks had no <name> in <unk> .
they foretold future events by the flight of birds , or by the appearances presented in the dissection of beasts offered in sacrifice !
at length , however , <name> 's fears were so far allayed that he concluded to enter the city .
he advanced , accordingly , with his whole army , and made his entry under circumstances of the greatest possible parade and splendor .
as soon , however , as the excitement of the first few days had passed away , his mind relapsed again , and he became anxious , troubled , and unhappy .
<unk> , his great personal friend and companion , had died while he was on the march toward babylon .
he was brought to the grave by diseases produced by dissipation and vice .
<name> was very much moved by his death .
it threw him at once into a fit of despondency and gloom .
it was some time before he could at all overcome the melancholy reflections and forebodings which this event produced .
he determined that , as soon as he arrived in babylon , he would do all possible honor to <unk> 's memory by a magnificent funeral .
he accordingly now sent orders to all the cities and kingdoms around , and collected a vast sum for this purpose .
he had a part of the city wall pulled down to furnish a site for a monumental edifice .
this edifice was constructed of an enormous size and most elaborate architecture .
it was ornamented with long rows of <unk> of ships , taken by <name> in his victories , and by statues , and columns , and sculptures , and gilded ornaments of every kind .
there were images of <unk> on the <unk> near the roof , which , by means of a mechanism concealed within , were made to sing <unk> and mournful songs .
the expense of this edifice , and of the games , shows , and spectacles connected with its consecration , is said by the historians of the day to have been a sum which , on calculation , is found equal to about ten millions of dollars .
there were , however , some limits still to <name> 's extravagance and folly .
there was a mountain in greece , mount <unk> , which a certain <unk> said could be carved and fashioned into the form of a man  probably in a <unk> posture .
there was a city on one of the declivities of the mountain , and a small river , issuing from springs in the ground , came down on the other side .
the artist who conceived of this prodigious piece of sculpture said that he would so shape the figure that the city should be in one of its hands , and the river should flow out from the other .
[ illustration : proposed improvement of mount <unk> . ]
<name> listened to this proposal .
the name mount <unk> recalled to his mind the attempt of xerxes , a former persian king , who had attempted to cut a road through the rocks upon a part of mount <unk> , in the invasion of greece .
he did not succeed , but left the unfinished work a lasting memorial both of the attempt and the failure .
<name> concluded at length that he would not attempt such a sculpture .
" mount <unk> , " said he , " is already the monument of one king 's folly ; i <name> not make it that of another . "
as soon as the excitement connected with the funeral obsequies of <unk> were over , <name> 's mind relapsed again into a state of gloomy melancholy .
this depression , caused , as it was , by previous dissipation and vice , seemed to admit of no remedy or relief but in new excesses .
the traces , however , of his former energy so far remained that he began to form magnificent plans for the improvement of babylon .
he commenced the execution of some of these plans .
his time was spent , in short , in strange alternations : resolution and energy in forming vast plans one day , and utter abandonment to all the excesses of dissipation and vice the next .
it was a mournful spectacle to see his former greatness of soul still struggling on , though more and more faintly , as it became gradually overborne by the resistless inroads of intemperance and sin .
the scene was at length suddenly terminated in the following manner : on one occasion , after he had spent a whole night in drinking and carousing , the guests , when the usual time arrived for separating , proposed that , instead of this , they should begin anew , and commence a second banquet at the end of the first .
<name> , half intoxicated already , entered warmly into this proposal .
they assembled , accordingly , in a very short time .
there were twenty present at this new feast .
<name> , to show how far he was from having exhausted his powers of drinking , began to pledge each one of the company individually .
then he drank to them all together .
there was a very large cup , called the bowl of hercules , which he now called for , and , after having filled it to the brim , he drank it off to the health of one of the company present , a macedonian named <unk> .
this feat being received by the company with great applause , he ordered the great bowl to be filled again , and drank it off as before .
the work was now done .
his faculties and his strength soon failed him , and he sank down to the floor .
they bore him away to his palace .
a violent fever intervened , which the physicians did all in their power to allay .
as soon as his reason returned a little , <name> aroused himself from his lethargy , and tried to persuade himself that he should recover .
he began to issue orders in regard to the army , and to his ships , as if such a turning of his mind to the thoughts of power and empire would help bring him back from the brink of the grave toward which he had been so obviously tending .
he was determined , in fact , that he would not die .
he soon found , however , notwithstanding his efforts to be vigorous and resolute , that his strength was fast ebbing away .
the vital powers had received a fatal wound , and he soon felt that they could sustain themselves but little longer .
he came to the conclusion that he must die .
he <name> his <unk> ring off from his finger ; it was a token that he felt that all was over .
he handed the ring to one of his friends who stood by his <unk> .
" when i am gone , " said he , " take my body to the <name> of jupiter ammon , and inter it there . "
the generals who were around him advanced to his <unk> , and one after another kissed his hand .
their old affection for him revived as they saw him about to take leave of them forever .
they asked him to whom he wished to leave his empire .
" to the most worthy , " said he .
he meant , doubtless , by this evasion , that he was too weak and exhausted to think of such affairs .
he knew , probably , that it was useless for him to attempt to control the government of his empire after his death .
he said , in fact , that he foresaw that the decision of such questions would give rise to some strange funeral games after his decease .
soon after this he died .
the palaces of babylon were immediately filled with cries of mourning at the death of the <name> , followed by bitter and interminable disputes about the succession .
it had not been the aim of alexander's life to establish firm and <unk> governments in the countries that he conquered , to encourage order , and peace , and industry among men , and to introduce system and regularity in human affairs , so as to leave the world in a better condition than he found it .
in this respect his course of conduct presents a strong contrast with that of washington .
it was washington 's aim to mature and perfect organizations which would move on prosperously of themselves , without him ; and he was continually withdrawing his hand from action and control in public affairs , taking a higher pleasure in the independent working of the institutions which he had formed and protected , than in exercising , himself , a high personal power .
<name> , on the other hand , was all his life intent solely on enlarging and strengthening his own personal power .
he was all in all .
he wished to make himself so .
he never thought of the welfare of the countries which he had subjected to his sway , or did any thing to guard against the anarchy and civil wars which he knew full well would break out at once over all his vast dominions , as soon as his power came to an end .
the result was as might have been foreseen .
the whole vast field of his conquests became , for many long and weary years after alexander's death , the prey to the most ferocious and protracted civil wars .
each general and governor seized the power which <name> 's death left in his hands , and endeavored to defend himself in the possession of it against the others .
thus the devastation and misery which the making of these conquests brought upon europe and <name> were continued for many years , during the slow and terrible process of their return to their original condition .
in the <unk> of the moment , however , at <name> 's death , the generals who were in his court at the time assembled forthwith , and made an attempt to appoint some one to take the immediate command .
they spent a week in <name> debates on this subject .
<name> had left no legitimate heir , and he had declined when on his death-bed , as we have already seen , to appoint a successor .
among his wives  if , indeed , they may be called wives  there was one named <name> , who had a son not long after his death .
this son was ultimately named his successor ; but , in the mean time , a certain relative named <unk> was chosen by the generals to assume the command .
the selection of <unk> was a sort of compromise .
he had no talents or capacity whatever , and was chosen by the rest on that very account , each one thinking that if such an imbecile as <unk> was nominally the king , he could himself manage to get possession of the real power .
<unk> accepted the appointment , but he was never able to make himself king in any thing but the name .
in the mean time , as the tidings of <name> 's death spread over the empire , it produced very various effects , according to the personal feelings in respect to <name> entertained by the various personages and powers to which the intelligence came .
some , who had admired his greatness , and the splendor of his exploits , without having themselves experienced the bitter fruits of them , mourned and lamented his death .
others , whose fortunes had been ruined , and whose friends and relatives had been destroyed , in the course , or in the sequel of his victories , rejoiced that he who had been such a scourge and curse to others , had himself sunk , at last under the just judgment of heaven .
we should have expected that <unk> , the bereaved and widowed mother of <name> , would have been among those who would have exulted most highly at the conqueror 's death ; but history tells us that , instead of this , she mourned over it with a protracted and <unk> grief .
<name> had been , in fact , though the implacable enemy of her son , a faithful and generous friend to her .
he had treated her , at all times , with the utmost respect and consideration , had supplied all her wants , and <unk> , in every way , to her comfort and happiness .
she had gradually learned to think of him and to love him as a son ; he , in fact , always called her mother ; and when she learned that he was gone , she felt as if her last earthly protector was gone .
her life had been one continued scene of affliction and sorrow , and this last blow brought her to her end .
she pined away , perpetually restless and distressed .
she lost all <name> for food , and refused , like others who are suffering great mental anguish , to take the sustenance which her friends and attendants offered and urged upon her .
at length she died .
they said she starved herself to death ; but it was , probably , grief and despair at being thus left , in her declining years , so hopelessly friendless and alone , and not hunger , that destroyed her .
in striking contrast to this mournful scene of sorrow in the palace of <unk> , there was an exhibition of the most wild and tumultuous <name> in the streets , and in all the public places of resort in the city of athens , when the tidings of the death of the great macedonian king arrived there .
the athenian commonwealth , as well as all the other states of southern greece , had submitted very reluctantly to the macedonian supremacy .
they had resisted <name> , and they had resisted <name> .
their opposition had been at last suppressed and silenced by <name> 's terrible vengeance upon thebes , but it never was really subdued .
demosthenes , the orator , who had exerted so powerful an influence against the macedonian kings , had been sent into banishment , and all outward expressions of discontent were restrained .
the discontent and hostility existed still , however , as inveterate as ever , and was ready to break out anew , with redoubled violence , the moment that the terrible energy of <name> himself was no longer to be feared .
when , therefore , the rumor arrived at athens  for at first it was a mere rumor  that <name> was dead in babylon , the whole city was thrown into a state of the most tumultuous <name> .
the citizens assembled in the public places , and congratulated and <unk> each other with expressions of the greatest exultation .
they were for proclaiming their independence and declaring war against macedon on the spot .
some of the older and more sagacious of their counselors were , however , more composed and calm .
they recommended a little delay , in order to see whether the news was really true .
<unk> , in particular , who was one of the prominent statesmen of the city , endeavored to quiet the excitement of the people .
" do not let us be so precipitate , " said he .
" there is time enough .
if <name> is really dead to-day , he <name> be dead to-morrow , and the next day , so that there <name> be time enough for us to act with deliberation and discretion . "
just and true as this view of the subject was , there was too much of rebuke and satire in it to have much influence with those to whom it was addressed .
the people were resolved on war .
they sent commissioners into all the states of the peloponnesus to organize a league , offensive and defensive , against macedon .
they recalled demosthenes from his banishment , and adopted all the necessary military measures for establishing and maintaining their freedom .
the consequences of all this would doubtless have been very serious , if the rumor of <name> 's death had proved false ; but , fortunately for demosthenes and the athenians , it was soon abundantly confirmed .
the return of demosthenes to the city was like the triumphal entry of a conqueror .
at the time of his recall he was at the island of Ã¦gina , which is about forty miles southwest of athens , in one of the <unk> of the Ã¦gean sea .
they sent a public galley to receive him , and to bring him to the land .
it was a galley of three banks of oars , and was fitted up in a style to do honor to a public guest .
athens is situated some distance back from the sea , and has a small port , called the <unk> , at the shore  a long , straight avenue leading from the port to the city .
the galley by which demosthenes was conveyed landed at the <unk> .
all the civil and religious authorities of the city went down to the port , in a grand procession , to receive and welcome the exile on his arrival , and a large portion of the population followed in the train , to witness the spectacle , and to swell by their acclamations the general expression of <name> .
in the mean time , the preparations for <name> 's funeral had been going on , upon a great scale of magnificence and splendor .
it was two years before they were complete .
the body had been given , first , to be embalmed , according to the egyptian and <unk> <name> , and then had been placed in a sort of sarcophagus , in which it was to be conveyed to its long home .
<name> , it <name> be remembered , had given directions that it should be taken to the <name> of jupiter ammon , in the egyptian oasis , where he had been pronounced the son of a god .
it would seem incredible that such a mind as his could really admit such an absurd superstition as the story of his divine origin , and we must therefore suppose that he gave this direction in order that the place of his interment might confirm the idea of his superhuman nature in the general opinion of mankind .
at all events , such were his orders , and the authorities who were left in power at babylon after his death , prepared to execute them .
it was a long journey .
to convey a body by a regular funeral procession , formed as soon after the death as the arrangements could be made , from babylon to the eastern frontiers of egypt , a distance of a thousand miles , was perhaps as grand a plan of interment as was ever formed .
it has something like a parallel in the removal of <unk> body from st. <name> to <name> , though this was not really an interment , but a transfer .
<name> 's was a simple burial procession , going from the palace where he died to the proper cemetery  a march of a thousand miles , it is true , but all within his own dominions the greatness of it resulted simply from the magnitude of the scale on which every thing pertaining to the mighty here was performed , for it was nothing but a simple passage from the dwelling to the <unk> on his own estates , after all .
a very large and elaborately constructed carriage was built to convey the body .
the accounts of the richness and splendor of this vehicle are almost incredible .
the spokes and staves of the wheels were overlaid with gold , and the extremities of the <unk> , where they appeared outside at the centers of the wheels , were adorned with massive golden ornaments .
the wheels and <unk> were so large , and so far apart , that there was supported upon them a platform or floor for the carriage twelve feet wide and eighteen feet long .
upon this platform there was erected a magnificent pavilion , supported by <unk> columns , and profusely ornamented , both within and without , with purple and gold .
the interior constituted an apartment , more or less open at the sides , and resplendent within with gems and precious stones .
the space of twelve feet by eighteen forms a chamber of no inconsiderable size , and there was thus ample room for what was required within .
there was a throne , raised some steps , and placed back upon the platform , profusely carved and gilded .
it was empty ; but crowns , representing the various nations over whom <name> had reigned , were <name> upon it .
at the foot of the throne was the coffin , made , it is said , of solid gold , and containing , besides the body , a large quantity of the most costly spices and <unk> perfumes , which filled the air with their odor .
the arms which <name> wore were laid out in view , also , between the coffin and the throne .
on the four sides of the carriage were <unk> <unk> , that is , sculptured figures raised from a surface , representing <name> himself , with various military <unk> .
there were macedonian columns , and persian squadrons , and elephants of <name> , and troops of horse , and various other emblems of the departed hero 's greatness and power .
around the pavilion , too , there was a fringe or net-work of golden lace , to the <unk> of which were attached bells , which <unk> continually , with a mournful sound , as the carriage moved along .
a long column of mules , sixty-four in number , arranged in sets of four , <name> this ponderous car .
these mules were all selected for their great size and strength , and were splendidly caparisoned .
they had collars and harnesses mounted with gold , and enriched with precious stones .
before the procession set out from babylon an army of pioneers and workmen went forward to repair the roads , strengthen the bridges , and remove the obstacles along the whole line of route over which the train was to pass .
at length , when all was ready , the solemn procession began to move , and passed out through the gates of babylon .
no pen can describe the enormous throngs of spectators that assembled to witness its departure , and that gathered along the route , as it passed slowly on from city to city , in its long and weary way .
notwithstanding all this pomp and parade , however , the body never reached its intended destination .
ptolemy , the officer to whom egypt fell in the division of <name> 's empire , came forth with a grand escort of troops to meet the funeral procession as it came into egypt .
he preferred , for some reason or other , that the body should be interred in the city of <name> .
it was accordingly deposited there , and a great monument was erected over the spot .
this monument is said to have remained standing for fifteen hundred years , but all vestiges of it have now disappeared .
the city of <name> itself , however , is the conqueror 's real monument ; the greatest and best , perhaps , that any conqueror ever left behind him .
it is a monument , too , that time <name> not destroy ; its position and character , as <name> foresaw , by bringing it a continued <unk> , secure its perpetuity .
<name> earned well the name and reputation of the great .
he was truly great in all those powers and capacities which can elevate one man above his fellows .
we can not help applauding the extraordinary energy of his genius , though we condemn the selfish and cruel ends to which his life was devoted .
he was simply a robber , but yet a robber on so vast a scale , that mankind , in contemplating his career , have generally lost sight of the wickedness of his crimes in their admiration of the enormous magnitude of the scale on which they were perpetrated .

the object of this little work , and of others of its family , which may perhaps follow , is , like that of the " rollo books , " to furnish useful and instructive reading to young children .
the aim is not so directly to communicate knowledge , as it is to develop the moral and intellectual powers ,  to cultivate habits of discrimination and correct reasoning , and to establish sound principles of moral conduct .
the " rollo books " embrace principally intellectual and moral discipline ; " <name> , " and the others of its family , <name> include also religious training , according to the <unk> views of <name> truth which the author has been accustomed to entertain , and which he has inculcated in his more serious writings .

<name> was a <unk> , blue-eyed boy , with <unk> hair and happy countenance .
and yet he was rather pale and slender .
he had been sick .
his father and mother lived in boston , but now he was spending the summer at <name> river country , with his grandmother .
his father thought that if he could run about a few months in the open air , and play among the rocks and under the trees , he would grow more strong and healthy , and that his cheeks would not look so pale .
his grandmother made him a blue jacket with bright buttons .
she liked metal buttons , because they would wear longer than covered ones , but he liked them because they were more beautiful .
" besides , " said he , " i can see my face in them , grandmother . "
little <name> then went to the window , so as to see his face plainer .
he stood with his back to the window , and held the button so that the light from the window could shine directly upon it .
" why grandmother , " said <name> , " i can not see now so well as i could before . "
" that is because your face is turned away from the light , " said she .
" and the button is turned towards the light , " said <name> .
" but when you want to see any thing reflected in a glass , you must have the light shine upon the thing you want to see reflected , not upon the glass itself ; and i suppose it is so with a bright button . "
then <name> turned around , so as to have his face towards the light ; and he found that he could then see it reflected very distinctly .
his grandmother went on with her work , and <name> sat for some time in silence .
the house that <name> lived in was in a narrow <name> valley .
a stream of water ran over a <name> bed , in front of the house , and a rugged mountain towered behind it .
across the stream , too , there was a high , <name> hill , which was in full view from the parlour window .
this hill was covered with wild evergreens , which clung to their sides , and to the interstices of the rocks ; and mosses , green and brown , in long <unk> , <name> from their limbs .
here and there crags and precipices peeped out from among the foliage , and a grey old <name> towered above , at the summit .
<name> turned his button round again towards the window , and of course turned his face from the window .
the reflection of his face was now dim , as before , but in a moment his eye caught the reflection of the crags and trees across the little valley .
" o , grandmother , " said he again , " i can see the rocks in my buttons , and the trees .
and there is an old stump , " he continued , his voice falling to a low tone , as if he was talking to himself ,  " and there is a tree ,  and ,  why  why , what is that ?
it is a bear , <unk> , "  calling aloud to her ,  " i see a bear upon the mountain . "
" nonsense , <name> , " said the grandmother .
" i do certainly , " said <name> , and he dropped the corner of his jacket , which had the button attached to it , and looked out of the window directly at the mountain .
presently <name> turned away from the window , and ran to the door .
there was a little green yard in front of the house , with a large , smooth , flat stone for a door-step .
<name> stood on this step , and looked intently at the mountain .
in a moment he ran back to his grandmother , and said , " grandmother , do come and see this black bear . "
" why , child , " said she , smiling , " it is nothing but some old black stump or log . "
" but it moves , grandmother .
it certainly moves . "
so his grandmother smiled , and said , " well , i suppose i must come and see . "
so she laid down her work , and took off her spectacles , and <name> took hold of her hand , and trotted along before her to the step of the door .
it was a beautiful <name> morning in <name> .
" there , " said <name> , triumphantly pointing to a spot among the rocks and bushes half-way up the mountain ,  " there , what do you call that ? "
his grandmother looked a moment intently in silence , and then said , " i do see something there under the bushes . "
" and is n't it moving ? "
said <name> .
" why , yes , " said she .
" and is n't it black ? "
" yes , " said she .
" then it is a bear , " said <name> , <unk> , and half afraid , " isn't it , grandmother ?
i 'll go and get the gun . "
there was an old gun behind the high desk , in the back sitting-room ; but it had not been loaded for twenty years , and had no back upon it .
still <name> always supposed that some how or other it would shoot .
" shall i , grandmother ? "
said he eagerly , " no , " said she .
" i do n't think it is a bear . "
" what then ? "
said <name> .
" i think it is <name> . "
" <name> ! "
said <name> .
" yes , <name> , " said she .
" run and see if you can find the boys . "
<name> was the cow .
she had strayed from the pasture the day before , and they could not find her .
she was called <name> from her colour ; for although she had looked almost black , as <name> had seen her in the bushes , she was really a <name> colour .
<name> saw at once , as soon as his grandmother said that it was <name> , that she was correct .
in fact , he could see her head and horns , as she was holding her head up to eat the leaves from the bushes .
however he did not stop to talk about it , but , obeying his grandmother immediately , he ran off after the boys .
he went out to the back door , where the boys had been at play , and shouted out , " <name> !
da  <unk> !
<unk>  <unk> !
da  <unk> ! "
but there was no reply , except a distant <name> of " <name> " and " <name> " from the rocks and mountains .
so <name> came back , and said that he could not find the boys , and that he supposed that they had gone to school .
" then we must call <name> , " said she .
" and may i ring for him , grandmother ? "
said <name> .
grandmother said he might : and so <name> ran off to the porch at the back door , and took down quite a large <name> , which was hanging there .
<name> stood upon the steps of the porch , and grasping the great handle of the <name> with both hands , he rang it with all his might .
in a minute or two he stopped ; and then he heard a faint and distant " <unk> " coming , from a field .
<name> put the <name> back into its place , and then went again to his grandmother .
in a few minutes <name> came in .
he was a <unk> and rather tall young man , broad-shouldered and strong ,  slow in his motions , and of a very sober countenance .
<name> heard his heavy step in the entry , though he came slowly and carefully , as if he tried to walk without making a noise .
" did you want me , madam <name> ? "
said he , holding his hat in his hand .
<name> 's grandmother was generally called madam <name> .
" yes , " said she .
" <name> has got up on the rocks .
<name> spied her there ; he <name> shew you where , and i should like to have you go and drive her down . "
<name> wanted to go too ; but his grandmother said it would not do very well , for he could not keep up with <name> ; and besides , she said that she wanted him .
so <name> went out with <name> under the great elm before the house , and pointed out the place among the rocks , where he had seen <name> .
she was not there then , at least she was not in sight ; but <name> knew that she could not have gone far from the place , so he walked down over the bridge , and soon disappeared .
while <name> stood watching <name> , as he walked off with long strides towards the mountain , his grandmother came to the door and said , " come , <name> . "
<name> turned and ran to his grandmother .
she had in her hand a little red morocco book , and taking <name> 's hand , she went slowly up stairs , he <unk> and capering around her all the way .
there was a bed in the room , with a white covering , and by the window an easy chair , with a high back , and round <unk> arms .
madam <name> went to the easy chair and sat down and took <name> in her lap .
<name> looked out upon the long drooping branches of the elm which <name> near the window .
<name> 's countenance was pale ; and he was slender in form , and delicate in appearance .
he had been sick , and even now , he was not quite well .
his little taper fingers rested upon the window-sill , while his grandmother opened her little bible and began to read .
<name> sat still in her lap , with a serious and attentive expression of countenance .
" two men went up into the <name> to pray ; the one a pharisee , the other a publican . "
" what is a pharisee and a publican ? "
asked <name> .
" you <name> hear presently .
'and the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself : god , i thank thee that i am not as other men are , <unk> , unjust , <unk> . "
" what are all those ? "
asked <name> .
" o , different kinds of crimes and sins .
the pharisee thanked god that he had not committed any of them . "
" was he a good man , grandmother ? "
" very likely he had not committed any of these great crimes . "
" very well , grandmother , go on . "
" 'or even as this publican . '
a publican , you must know , was a <unk> .
he used to collect the taxes from the people .
they did not like to pay their taxes , and so they did not like the <unk> , and despised them .
and thus the pharisee thanked god that he was not like that publican .
'i fast twice in the week .
i pay <unk> of all that i possess . '
" <unk> ? "
said <name> .
" yes , that was money which god had commanded them to pay .
they were to pay in proportion to the property they had .
but some dishonest men used to conceal some of their property , so as not to have to pay so much ; but this pharisee said he paid <unk> of all that he possessed . "
" that was right , grandmother , " said <name> .
" yes , " said his grandmother , " that was very well . "
" if he really did it , " continued <name> doubtfully .
" do you think he did , grandmother ? "
" i think it very probable .
i presume he was a pretty good man , outside . "
" what do you mean by that , grandmother ? "
" why , his heart might have been bad , but he was probably pretty careful about all his actions , which could be seen of men .
but we <name> go on . "
" 'and the publican , standing afar off , would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven , but smote upon his breast , saying , god be merciful to me a sinner .
i tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other . ' "
" which man ? "
said <name> .
" the publican . "
" the publican was justified ? "
said <name> , " what does justified mean ? "
" forgiven and approved .
god was pleased with the publican , because he confessed his sins honestly ; but he was displeased with the pharisee , because he came boasting of his good deeds . "
here there was a pause .
<name> sat still and seemed thoughtful .
his grandmother did not interrupt him , but waited to hear what he would say .
" yes ; but , grandmother , if the pharisee really was a good man , it wasn't right for him to thank god for it ? "
" it reminds me of <name> 's acorns , " said madam <name> .
" <name> 's acorns ! "
said <name> , " tell me about them , grandmother . "
" why , <name> and his brother <name> were sent to school .
they stopped to play by the way , until it was so late that they did not dare to go in .
then they staid playing about the fields till it was time to go home .
they felt pretty bad and out of humour , and at last they separated and went home different ways .
" in going home , <name> found an <unk> with acorns under it .
'ah ! '
said he , 'i <name> <name> mother home some acorns . '
he had observed that his mother was pleased whenever he brought her things ; and he had an idea of soothing his own feelings of guilt , and securing his mother's favour , by the good deed of carrying her home some acorns .
so , when he came into the house , he took off his hat carefully , with the acorns in it , and holding it in both hands , marched up to his mother with a smiling face , and look of great <unk> , and said , 'here , mother , i have got you some acorns . ' "
" and what did his mother say ? "
asked <name> .
" she shook her head sorrowfully , and told him to go and put the acorns away .
she knew where he had been .
" then presently <name> came in .
he put away his cap , walked in softly , and put his face down in his mother 's lap , and said , with tears and sobs , <unk> , i have been doing something very wrong . '
now , which of these do you think came to his mother right ? ' "
" why ,  <name> , " said he , " certainly . "
" yes , and that was the way the publican came ; but the pharisee covered up all his sins , being pleased and satisfied himself , and thinking that god would be pleased and satisfied with his acorns . "
here madam <name> paused , and <name> sat still , thinking of what he had heard .
madam <name> then closed her eyes , and , in a low , gentle voice , she spoke a few words of prayer ; and then she told <name> that he must always remember in all his prayers to confess his sins fully and freely , and never cover them up and conceal them , with an idea that his good deeds made him worthy .
then she put <name> down , and he ran down stairs to play .
he asked his grandmother to let him go over the bridge , so as to be ready to meet <name> , when he should come back with the cow .
she at first advised him not to go , for she was afraid , she said , that he might get lost , or fall into the <name> ; but <name> was very desirous to go , and finally she consented .
he had a little whip that <name> had made for him .
the handle was made from the branch of a <unk> , which <name> cut first to make a cane of , for himself ; but he broke his cane , and so he gave <name> the rest of the stick for a <unk> .
the lash was made of leather .
it was cut out of a round piece of thick leather , round and round , as they made leather <unk> , and then rolled upon a board .
this is a fine way to make lashes and reins for boys .
<name> took his whip for company , and sauntered along over the bridge .
when he had crossed the bridge , he walked along the bank of the stream , watching the <unk> and butterflies , and now and then cutting off the head of a weed with the lash of his whip .
the banks of the <name> were in some places high , and the water deep ; in other places , there was a sort of beach , sloping down to the <unk> edge ; and here , the water was generally shallow , to a considerable distance from the shore .
<name> was allowed to come down to the water at these shallow places ; but he had often been told that he must not go near the steep places , because there was danger that he would fall in .
now , boys are not very naturally inclined to obey their parents .
they have to be taught with great pains and care .
they must be punished for disobedience , in some way or other , a good many times .
but neglected children , that is , those that are left to themselves , are almost always very disobedient and <unk> .
<name> , now , was not a neglected child .
he had been taught to submit and obey , when he was very young , and his grandmother could trust him now .
besides , <name> , had still less disposition now to disobey his grandmother than usual , for he had been sick , and was still pale and feeble ; and this state of health often makes children quiet , gentle , and submissive .
so <name> walked slowly along , carefully avoiding all the high banks , but sometimes going down to the water , where the shore was sloping and safe .
at length , at one of these little landing places he stopped longer than usual .
he called it the cotton landing .
<name> and <name> gave it that name , because they always found , wedged in , in a corner between a log and the shore , a pile of cotton , as they called it .
it was , in reality , light , white froth , which always lay there ; and even if they pushed it all away with a stick , they would find a new supply the next day .
<name> stood upon the shore , and with the lash of his whip , cut into the pile of " cotton . "
the pile broke up into large masses , and moved slowly and lightly away into the stream .
one small tuft of it floated towards the shore , and <name> reached it with his <unk> , and took a part of it in , saying , " now i <name> see what it is made of . "
on closely examining it , he found to his surprise , that it was composed of an infinite number of very small bubbles , piled one upon another , like the little stones in a heap of gravel .
it was white and beautiful , and in some of the biggest bubbles , <name> could see all the colours of the rainbow .
he wondered where this foam could come from , and he determined to <name> some of it home to his grandmother .
so he stripped off a flat piece of birch bark from a neighbouring tree , and took up a little of the froth upon it , and placed it very carefully upon a rock on the bank , where it would remain safely , he thought , till he was ready to go home .
just above where he stood was a little waterfall in the <name> .
the current was stopped by some stones and logs , and the water tumbled over the obstruction , forming quite a little cataract , which sparkled in the sun .
<name> threw sticks and pieces of bark into the water , above the fall , and watched them as they sailed on , faster and faster , and then pitched down the descent .
then he would go and whip them into his landing , and thus he could take them out , and sail them down again .
after amusing himself some time in this manner , he began to wonder why <name> did not come , and he concluded to take his foam , and go along .
he went to the rock and took up his birch bark ; but , to his surprise , the foam had disappeared .
he was wondering what had become of it , when he heard across the road , and at a little distance above him , a scrambling in the bushes , on the side of the mountain .
at first , he was afraid ; but in a moment more , he caught a glimpse of the cow coming out of the bushes , and supposing that <name> was behind , he threw down his birch bark , and began to gallop off to meet him , lashing the ground with his whip .
at the same time , the cow , somewhat worried by being driven pretty fast down the rocks , came running out into the road , and when she saw <name> coming towards her , and with such antics , began to cut <unk> too .
she came on , in a kind of <unk> , <unk> canter , shaking her horns ; and <name> , before he got very near her , began to be somewhat frightened .
at first he stopped , looking at her with alarm .
then he began to fall back to the side of the road , towards the <name> .
at this instant <name> appeared coming out of the bushes , and , seeing <name> , called out to him to stand still .
" stand still , <name> , till she goes by : she <name> not hurt you . "
but <name> could not control his fears .
his little heart beat quick , and his pale cheek grew paler .
he could not control his fears , though he knew very well that what <name> said must be true .
he kept retreating backwards nearer and nearer to the <name> , as the cow came on , whipping the air , towards her to keep her off .
he was now at some little distance above the cotton landing , and opposite to a part of the bank where the water was deep .
<name> perceived his danger , and as he was now on the very brink , he shouted out suddenly , " <name> !
<name> !
take care ! "
but the sudden call only frightened poor <name> still more ; and before the " take care " was uttered , his foot slipped , and he slid back into the water , and sank into it until he entirely disappeared .
<name> rushed to the place , and in an instant was in the water by his side , and pulling <name> out , he carried him gasping to the shore .
he wiped his face with his handkerchief , and tried to cheer and encourage him .
" never , mind , <name> , " said he ; " it wo n't hurt you .
it is a warm <name> morning . "
<name> cried a few minutes , but , finally , became pretty nearly calm , and <name> led him along towards home , sobbing as he went , " o dear me !  what <name> my grandmother say ? "
chapter ii .
trouble .
as <name> walked along by the side of <name> , and came upon the bridge , he was seen both by his grandmother , who happened to be standing at the door , and also at the same instant , by the two boys , <name> and <name> , who were just then coming home from school .
<name> , seeing <name> walking along so sadly , his clothes and hair thoroughly drenched , set up a shout , and ran towards him over the bridge .
<name> was of a more quiet and sober turn , and he followed more slowly , but with a face full of surprise and curiosity .
madam <name> , too , perceived that her little grandson had been in the <name> , and she said , " can it be possible that he has disobeyed ? "
then , again , the next thought was , " well , if he has , he has been punished for it pretty severely , and so i <name> treat him kindly . "
<name> and <name> came eagerly up , with exclamations , and questions without number .
this made poor <name> feel worse and worse  he wanted to get home as soon as possible , and he could not tell the boys all the story there ; and presently <name> , finding that he could not get by them very well , took him up in his arms , and carried him towards the house , <name> and <name> following behind .
<name> expected that his grandmother would think him very much to blame , and so , as he came near enough to speak to her , he raised his head from <name> 's shoulder , and began to say , " i am very sorry , grandmother ; but i could not help it .
i certainly could not help it . "
but he saw at once , by his grandmother 's pleasant-looking face , that she was not going to find any fault with him .
" you have not hurt yourself , <name> , i <name> , " said she , as <name> put him down .
" no , " said he , " but i feel rather cold . "
his grandmother said she would soon warm him , and she led him into a little bedroom , where he was accustomed to sleep , and undressed him , talking <unk> with him all the while , so as to relieve his fears , and make him feel more happy .
she wiped him dry with soft flannel , and gave him some clean , dry clothes , and made him very comfortable again .
she did not ask him how he happened to fall in the water , for she knew it would trouble him to talk about it .
so she amused him by talking about other things , and at last let him out again into the parlour .
the wetting did <name> no injury ; but the fright and the suddenness of the plunge gave him a shock , which , in his feeble state of health , he was ill able to bear .
a good stout boy , with red cheeks and plump limbs , would not have regarded it at all , but would have been off to play again just as soon as his clothes were changed .
but poor <name> sat down in his little rocking chair by the side of his grandmother , and began to rock back and forth , as if he was rocking away the memory of his troubles , while his grandmother went on with her work .
presently he stopped to listen to the voices of <name> and <name> , who were out before the house .
" grandmother , " said he , " is that the boys ? "
" yes , " said she , " i believe it is . "
then <name> went on rocking , and the voices died away .
presently , they came nearer again .
the boys seemed to be passing down in front of the house , with a wheelbarrow , towards the water .
" grandmother , " said <name> , stopping again , " what do you suppose the boys are doing ? "
" i do n't know , " said she , " should not you like to go and see ?
you can play with them half an hour before dinner , if you please . "
<name> did not answer , but began to rock again .
he did not seem inclined to go .
soon after he heard a splash , as of stones thrown into the water .
<name> started up and said , " grandmother , what can they be doing ? "
" i do n't know , " said she , " if you want to know very much , you must go and see . "
<name> rose slowly , put his rocking chair back into its place , and went to the door .
he looked down towards the bank of the <name> before the house , and saw <name> and <name> there .
they had a wheelbarrow close to the edge of the water , with a few stones in it , some as big as <unk> head .
each of the boys had a stone in his hand , which he was just throwing into the <name> .
<name> had a great <name> to go down and see what they were doing ; but he felt weak and tired , and so , after looking on a moment , he said to himself , " i had rather sit down here . "
so he sat down upon the step of the door , and looked on .
after the boys had thrown one or two large stones into the water , they took hold of the wheelbarrow , and , then , <unk> it up , the whole load slid down into the water , close to the shore .
the boys then came back , wheeling the great wheelbarrow up into the road .
they went after another load of stones , and <name> 's curiosity was so far awakened , that he rose slowly , and walked down towards the place .
in a few minutes , the boys came back with their load ; <name> wheeling , and <name> walking along by his side , and pushing as well as he could , to help .
as soon as he saw <name> , he began to call out , " o <name> , you were afraid of a cow ! "
<name> looked sad and unhappy .
<name> said , " i would not laugh at him , <name> .
<name> , we are building a mole . "
" a mole ! "
said <name> .
" what is that ? "
" why , it is a kind of wharf , built out far into the water , to make a harbour for our shipping .
we learned about it in our geography . "
" yes , " said <name> , coming up , eagerly , to <name> , " you see the current carries all our vessels down the stream , you know , <name> , and we are going to build out a long mole , out into the middle of the <name> , and that <name> stop our vessels ; and then we are going to make it pretty wide , so that we can walk out upon it , and the end of it <name> do for a wharf . "
" yes , it <name> be a sort of harbour for 'em , " said <name> .
<name> looked quite pleased at this plan and wanted the boys to let him help ; and <name> said he might go and help them get their next load of stones .
but <name> did not help much , although he really tried to help .
he kept getting into the other boys ' way .
at last <name> got out of <name> , and said , " <name> , you do n't help us the least mite .
i wish you would go away . "
but <name> wanted to help ; and <name> tried to make him go away .
presently , he began to laugh at him for being afraid of a cow .
" i suppose i could frighten you by <unk> at you , <name> . "
<name> did not answer , but walked along by the side of the wheelbarrow .
<name> was wheeling it ; for they had now got it loaded , and were going back to the shore of the <name> , <name> on one side , and <name> upon the other .
<name> saw that <name> <name> his head , and looked confused .
" <unk> !
<unk> !  " said <name> .
<name> walked along silent as before .
" <unk> !
<unk> !  " said <name> , running round to <name> 's side of the wheelbarrow , and <unk> close into his ear .
<name> let go of the wheelbarrow , turned around , burst into tears , and walked slowly and sorrowfully away towards the house .
" there , now , " said <name> , " you have made him cry .
what do you want to trouble him so for ? "
<name> looked after <name> , and seeing that he was going to the house , he was afraid that he would tell his grandmother .
so he ran after him , and began to call to him to stop ; but , before he had gone many steps , he saw his grandmother standing at the door of the house , and calling to them all to come .
<name> had nearly stopped crying when he came up to his grandmother .
she did not say any thing to him about the cause of his trouble , but asked him if he was willing to go down cellar with <name> <name> , and help her choose a <unk> of apples for dinner .
his eye brightened at this proposal , and <name> <name> , who was sitting at the window , reading , rose , laid down her book , took hold of his hand with a smile , and led him away .
madam <name> then went to her seat in her great arm-chair , and <name> and <name> came and stood by her side .
" i am sorry , <name> , that you wanted to trouble <name> . "
" but , mother , " said <name> , " i only <unk> at him a little . "
" and what did you do it for ? "
" o , only for fun , mother . "
" did you suppose it gave him pain ? "
" why ,  i do n't know . "
" did you suppose it gave him pleasure ? "
" why , no , " said <name> , looking down .
" and did not you know that it gave him pain ?
now , tell me , honestly . "
" why , yes , mother , i knew it plagued him a little ; but then i only did it for fun . "
" i know it , " said madam <name> ; " and that is the very thing that makes me so sorry for it . "
" why , mother ? "
said <name> in a tone of surprise .
" because if you had given <name> four times as much pain for any other reason , i should not have thought half so much of it , as to have you trouble him for fun .
if it had been to do him any good , or to do any body else any good , or from mistake , or mere <unk> , i should not have thought so much of it ; but to do it for fun ! "
here madam <name> stopped , as if she did not know what to say .
" i rather think , mother , it was only <unk> , " said <name> , by way of <unk> <name> .
" no ; because he knew that it gave <name> pain , and it was , in fact , for the very purpose of giving him pain , that <name> did it .
if he had been saying <unk> accidentally , without thinking of troubling <name> , that would have been <unk> ; but it was not so .
and what makes me most unhappy about this , " continued madam <name> , putting her hand gently on <name> 's head , " is that my dear <name> has a heart capable under some circumstances , of taking pleasure in the sufferings of a helpless little child . "
<name> and <name> were both silent , though they saw clearly that what their mother said was true .
" and yet , perhaps , you think it is a very little thing after all , " she continued , " just <unk> at <name> a little .
the pain it gave him was soon over .
just sending him down cellar to get apples , made him forget it in a moment ; so that you see it is not the mischief that is done , in this case , but the spirit of mind in you , that it shews .
it is a little thing , i know ; but then it is a little symptom of a very bad disease .
it is very hard to cure . "
" well , mother , " said <name> , looking up , and speaking very positively , " i am determined not to trouble <name> any more . "
" yes , but i am afraid your <unk> wo n't reach the difficulty .
as long as the spirit of mind remains , so that you are capable of taking pleasure in the sufferings of another , your <unk> not to indulge the bad spirit , <name> not do much good .
you <name> forget them all , when the temptation comes .
do n't you remember how often i have talked with you about this , and how often you have promised not to do it , before ? "
" why , yes , mother , " said <name> , <unk> .
" so , you see <unk> <name> not do much good .
as long as your heart is malicious , the malice <name> come out in spite of all your <unk> . "
just at this moment <name> came in , bringing his plate of apples , with an air of great importance and satisfaction .
he had nearly forgotten his troubles .
soon after this , dinner was brought in , and madam <name> said no more to the boys about malice .
after dinner , they went out again to play .
chapter iii .
building the mole .
<name> sat down upon the step of the door , eating a piece of bread , while <name> and <name> returned to their work of building the mole .
they got the wheelbarrow , and loaded it with stones .
<name> sat a few minutes more at the door , and then he went into the house , and got his little rocking chair , and brought it out under the elm , and sat down there , looking towards the boys , who were at work near the water .
at last , <name> spied him sitting there , and said , " there is <name> , sitting under the great tree . "
<name> looked around , and then , throwing down the stone that he had in his hands , he said , " i mean to go and get him to come here . "
so he ran towards him , and said , " come , <name> , come down here , and help us make our mole . "
" no , " said <name> , shaking his head , and , turning away a little ; " i don't want to go . "
" o , do come , <name> , " said <name> ; " i wo n't trouble you any more . "
" no , " said <name> : " i am tired , and i had rather stay here in my little chair . "
" but i <name> <name> your chair down to the <name> ; and there is a beautiful place there to sit and see us tumble in the stones . "
so <name> got up , and <name> took his chair , and they walked together down to the shore of the <name> .
<name> found a little spot so smooth and level , that the rocking-chair would stand very even upon it , though it would not rock very well , for the ground was not hard , like a floor .
<name> rested his elbow upon the arm of his chair , and his pale cheek in his little slender hand , and watched the stones , as , one after another , they fell into the <name> .
the <name> at this place , was very wide and shallow , and the current was not very rapid , so that they got along pretty fast ; and thus the mole advanced steadily out into the stream .
" well , <name> , " said <name> , as he stopped , after they had tossed out all the stones from the wheelbarrow , " and how do you like our mole ? "
" o , not very well , " said <name> .
" why not ? "
said <name> , surprised .
" it is so stony . "
" stony ? "
said <name> .
" yes , " said <name> , " i do n't think i could walk on it very well . "
" o , " said <name> , " we are going to make the top very smooth , when we get it done . "
" how ? "
said <name> .
" why , we are going to haul gravel on it , and smooth it all down . "
" why ca n't we do it now ? "
said <name> , " as we go along : and then we can wheel our wheelbarrow out upon it , and tip our stones in at the end . "
" agreed , " said <name> ; and they accordingly leveled the stones off on the top , and put small stones in at all the interstices , that is , the little spaces between the large stones , so as to prevent the gravel from running down through .
then they went and got a load of gravel out of a bank pretty near , and spread it down over the top , and it made a good , smooth road ; only , it was not trodden down hard at first , and so it was not very easy wheeling over it .
they found one difficulty , however , and that was that the gravel rolled over each side of the mole , and went into the water .
to prevent this , they arranged the largest stones on each side , in a row , for the edge , and then filled in with gravel up to the edge , and thus they gradually advanced towards the middle of the stream , finishing the mole completely as they went on .
<name> then said he liked it very much , and wanted to walk on it .
so the boys let him .
he went out to the end , and stood there a minute , and then said that he wished he had his whip there , to whip in a stick which was sailing down a little way off .
" where is your whip ? "
said <name> .
" i suppose it is hanging up on its nail , " said <name> , " i mean to go and get it . "
so <name> walked off the mole , and went slowly up towards the house , singing by the way , while <name> and <name> went after another load of gravel .
while they were putting down this load , and spreading it on , <name> came back , looking disappointed and sorrowful , and saying that he could not find his whip .
" where did you put it when you had it last ? "
asked <name> .
" i put it on the nail , " said <name> , " i always put it on the nail . "
" o , no , <name> , " said <name> ; " you must have left it about somewhere . "
" no , " said <name> , shaking his head with a positive air , " i am sure i put it on my nail . "
" when did you have it last ? "
" why ,  let me see , " said <name> , thinking .
" i had it yesterday , playing horses on the <unk> : and then i had it this morning ,  i believe ,  when i went up the <name> to meet <name> . "
" then you left it up there , i know , " said <name> .
" no , " said <name> , " i am sure i put it on my nail . "
" you did not have it , <name> , " said <name> , mildly , " when we met you on the bridge . "
" did n't i ? "
said <name> , standing still and trying to think .
" no , " replied <name> , decidedly .
" i wish you would go up there with me , and help me find it . "
" why , we want to finish our mole , " said <name> .
" i 'll go , " said <name> , " while you , <name> , get another load of gravel .
come , <name> , " said he , " go and shew me where it was . "
so <name> and <name> walked on .
they went down to the bridge , crossed the stream upon it , then turned up , on the opposite bank , and walked on until they came to the cotton landing .
<name> then pointed to the place where he had fallen in ; and they looked all about there , upon the bank , and in the water , but in vain .
no whip was to be found .
before they returned , they stopped a moment at the cotton landing , and <name> shewed <name> that the cotton was all made of little bubbles .
they got some of it to the shore and examined it , and then , just as they were going away .
<name> exclaimed , suddenly , " there is your whip , now , <name> . "
<name> looked round , and saw that <name> was pointing towards the little fall or rather great ripple of water , and there , just in the fall , was the <unk> floating , and kept from drifting away by the lash , which had got caught in the rocks .
there the handle lay , or rather <name> , bobbing up and down , and struggling as if it was trying to get free .
after various attempts to liberate it , by throwing sticks and stones at it , <name> took off his shoes , turned up his pantaloons to his knees , and waded in to the place , and after carefully <unk> the whip , brought it safely to the shore .
" i am very glad i have got my whip again , " said <name> , while <name> was putting on his shoes .
" i am glad too , " said <name> .
" but you told a lie about it , <name> . "
" a lie ! "
said <name> .
" yes : you said you certainly <name> it up upon the nail , " said <name> , as they began to walk along .
" well , i thought i did , " said <name> .
" that makes no difference .
you did not say you thought you <name> it up , but that you were sure you did . "
" well , i certainly thought i did , " said <name> ; " and i am sure it wasn't a lie . "
<name> insisted that it was , and <name> determined to ask his grandmother .
they returned to the mole .
it was not long after this , that <name> , on looking towards the house , called out that his mother was coming .
it was true .
she put on her bonnet , and was coming slowly down to the <name> , to see how the boys got on with their work .
they were rejoiced to see her coming .
they took <name> 's chair , and laid it down upon its side , and then put one of the <unk> of the wheelbarrow upon it with the clean side up ; and this made quite a comfortable seat for her , though it was a little unsteady .
she sat down upon it , and made a good many enquiries about their plan and the progress of the work .
" well , boys , " said she , " that is a capital plan , and you <name> have a great <name> above your mole . "
" an <name> ! "
said <name> , " what is that ? "
" why , the water coming down , <name> strike upon the outer end of your mole , and be turned in towards the shore , and then <name> go round , and <name> come into the stream again .
there , you can see it is beginning to run so already . "
so the boys looked above the mole , and they saw the little bubbles that were floating in the water , sailing round and round slowly , in a small circle , between the upper side of the mole and the shore .
" when you get it built away out , " said madam <name> , " there <name> be quite a whirlpool ; you might call it the <unk> .
there , you see , <name> can have a little harbour up there on the shore , and one of you can go out to the end of the mole , and put a little ship into the water , and the <name> <name> <name> it round to him .
then he can take out the cargo , and put in a new one , and then set the ship in the water , and the current <name> <name> it back again , round on the other side of the whirlpool . "
the boys were very much delighted at this prospect , and they determined to build out the mole very far , so as to have " a great sweep , " as <name> called it , in the <name> .
<name> went out upon the part of the mole which was finished , and put in a piece of wood , and watched it with great delight as it slowly sailed round .
chapter iv .
a discussion .
while <name> stood upon the mole , he began to whip the water ; and , in doing so , he spattered <name> and <name> a little .
<name> said , " take care , <name>  do n't <unk> us ; " and he went up to him , and was going gently to take hold of his whip , to take it away .
" let me have the whip , " said he .
" no , " said <name> , holding it firmly , " i want it . "
" let go of it , <name> , " said madam <name> .
" why , mother , he ought to let me have it , for i went and got it for him .
he would not have had it at all without me . "
" you must not take it by violence , " said his mother , " if you have ever so good a right to it .
but did you get it for him ? "
" yes , mother ; and he told a lie about it . "
" o , <name> , " said his mother , " you ought not to say so .
i ca n't think <name> would tell a lie . "
" he did , mother ; he said he was sure he <name> it up , when , after all , he dropped it in the water ; and we agreed to leave it to you if that was not telling a lie . "
" did you know , <name> , when you said you <name> it up , that you had really left it in the water ? "
" no , grandmother , " said <name> , very earnestly ; " i really thought i had <name> it up . "
" then it was not telling a lie , <name> .
a lie is told with an intention to deceive .
to make it a lie it is necessary that the person who says a thing , must know distinctly at the time that he says it , that it is not true ; and he must say it with the particular intention to deceive .
now , <name> did not do this . "
" well , mother , " said <name> , " i am sure you have told us a good many times that we must never say any thing unless we are sure it is true . "
" so i have .
i admit that <name> did wrong in saying so positively that he had <name> his whip up , when he did not know certainly that he had .
but this does not prove that it was telling a lie .
you know there are a great many other faults besides telling lies ; and this is one of them . "
" what do you call it , mother ? "
said <name> .
" i do n't know , " said she , hesitating .
" it is a very common fault ,  asserting a thing positively , when you do not know whether it is true or not .
but if you think it is true , even if you have no proper grounds for thinking so , and are entirely mistaken , it is not telling a lie . "
" in fact , " she continued , " i once knew a case where one boy was justly punished for falsehood when what he said was true ; and another was rewarded for his truth , when what he said was false . "
" why , mother ? "
said <name> and <name> together , with great surprise .
" yes , " said madam <name> ; " the case was this .
they were farmers ' boys , and they wanted to go into the barn , and play upon the hay .
their father told them they might go , but charged them to be careful to shut the door after them in going in , so as not to let the colt get out .
so the boys ran off to the barn in high glee , and were so eager to get upon the hay , that they forgot altogether to shut the door .
when they came down they found the door open , and to their great alarm , the colt was nowhere to be seen .
<unk> , one of the boys , said , 'let us shut the door now , and not tell father that we let the colt out , and he <name> think somebody else did it . '
" 'no , ' said <name> , the other , 'let us tell the truth . '
" so about an hour afterwards , <unk> went into the house , and his father said , <unk> , did you let the colt out ? '
" 'no , sir , ' said <unk> .
" not long after he met <name> .
" <unk> , ' said he , 'you had a fine time upon the hay , i suppose .
i <name> you did not let the colt out . '
" <name> <name> his head , and said , 'why , yes , sir , we did .
we forgot to shut the door , and so he got away . '
" now , which of these boys , do you suppose , was guilty of telling a lie ? "
" why , <unk> , certainly , " said <name> , <name> , and <name> , all together .
" yes , and yet the colt had not got away . "
" had n't he ? "
said <name> .
" no , he was safely coiled up in a corner upon some hay , out of sight ; and there the farmer found him safe and sound , when he went in to look .
but did that make any difference in <unk> 's guilt , do you think ? "
" no , mother , " said <name> .
<name> , at the same time shook his head , shewing that he entertained the same opinion .
" i think it did not , " continued madam <name> , " and the farmer thought so too ; for he very properly punished <unk> , and rewarded <name> . "
<name> seemed to assent to this rather reluctantly , as if he was almost sorry that <name> had not been proved guilty of telling a lie .
" well , mother , " he said presently , with a more lively tone , " at any rate he disobeyed you ; for you told him not to go near the <name> where the bank was high ; and he did , or else he never would have fallen in . "
" but i could not help it , " said <name> , " the cow frightened me so . "
" yes , you could help it , " said <name> ; " for the cow did not come up and push you ; you walked back yourself , of your own accord . "
madam <name> observed that <name> appeared more pale and languid than usual ; and this new charge which <name> brought against him , made him more sad and melancholy still .
madam <name> accordingly then said she would not talk any more about it then , for she must go in , and she asked <name> whether he would rather go in with her , or remain out there with the boys .
he said he would rather go in .
so he took hold of madam <name> 's hand , and walked along by her side .
<name> said he would bring his rocking-chair for him , when he and <name> should come in .
chapter v. the story of blind <name> .
madam <name> went into the house , and sat down in her large rocking-chair , by a window , in a back parlour that looked out upon a little garden , and began to sew .
<name> played around a little while , rather languidly , and at last came up to his grandmother , and leaning upon her lap , asked her if she would not take him up , and rock him a little .
she could not help pitying him , he looked so feeble and sad ; and she accordingly laid down her work , and lifted him up ,  he was not heavy .
" well <name> , you have not asked me to take you up , and tell you a story so , for a long time .
this is the way i used to do when you were quite a little boy ; only then you used to kneel in my lap , and lay your head upon my shoulder , so that my mouth was close to your ear .
but you are too big now . "
<name> smiled a little , for he was glad to find that he was growing big ; but it was rather a faint and sad smile .
" but i do n't grow any stronger , grandmother , " said he .
" i wish i was well and strong , like the other boys . "
" you do n't know what would be best for you , my little <name> .
god leads you along in his own way through life , and you must go patiently and pleasantly on , just where he thinks best .
you are like blind <name> , going through the woods with his father . "
" how was that , grandmother ? "
said he , sitting up , and turning round to look at her .
" you sit still , " said she , gently laying him back again , " and i <name> tell you . "
" <name> was a blind boy .
he had been away , and was now going home with his father .
his father led him , and he walked along by his side .
presently , they came to a large <name> , and , before they got near it , they heard it roaring .
his father said , <unk> , i think there is a freshet . '
'i think so too , ' said <name> , 'for i hear the water roaring . '
when they came in sight of the stream , his father said , 'yes , <name> , there has been a great freshet , and the bridge is carried away . '
'and what shall we do now ? '
said <name> .
'why we must go round by the path through the woods . '
'that <name> be bad for me , ' said <name> 'but i <name> lead you , ' said his father , 'all the way ; just trust every thing to me . '
'yes , father , ' said <name> , 'i <name> . '
" so his father took a string out of his pocket , and gave one end of it to <name> .
'there , <name> , ' said he , 'take hold of that , and that <name> guide you ; and walk directly after me . ' "
" how long was the string ? "
said <name> .
" o not very long , " replied madam <name> ; " so as just to let him walk a step or two behind . "
" after he had walked on a short distance , he said , <unk> , i wish you would let me take hold of your hand . '
'but you said , ' replied his father , 'that you would trust every thing to me . '
'so i <name> , father , ' said <name> ; 'but i do wish you would let me take hold of your hand , instead of this string . '
'very well , ' said his father , 'you may try your way . '
" so <name> came and took hold of his father 's hand , and tried to walk along by his father 's side .
but the path was narrow ; there was not more than room for one , and though his father walked as far on one side as possible , yet <name> had not room enough .
the branches scratched his face , and he stumbled continually upon roots and stones .
at length he said , <unk> , you know best .
i <name> take hold of the string , and walk behind . '
" so , after that , he was patient and submissive , and followed his father wherever he led .
after a time his father saw a serpent in the road directly before them .
so he turned aside , to go round by a compass in the woods . "
" a compass ? "
said <name> .
" yes , " said his grandmother ; " that is a <unk> way .
but it was very rough and stony .
presently , <name> stopped and said , <unk> , it seems to me it is pretty stony ; have n't we got out of the path ? '
" 'yes , ' said his father ; 'but you promised to be patient and submissive , and trust every thing to me . '
" 'well , ' said <name> , 'you know best , and i <name> follow . '
" so he walked on again .
when they had got by , his father told him that the reason why he had gone out of the road was , that there was a serpent there .
and so , when god leads us in a difficult way , <name> , that we do n't understand at the time , we often see the reason of it afterwards . "
<name> did not answer , and madam <name> went on with her story .
" by and by , his father came within the sound of the <name> again , and stopped a minute or two , and then he told <name> that he should have to leave him a short time , and that he might sit down upon a log , and wait until he came back .
'but , father , ' said <name> , 'i do n't want to be left alone here in the woods , in the dark . '
'it is not dark , ' said his father .
'it is all dark to me , ' said <name> .
'i know it is , ' said his father , 'and i am very sorry ; but you promised to leave every thing to me , and be obedient and submissive . '
'so i <name> , father ; you know best , and i <name> do just as you say . '
so <name> sat down upon the log , and his father went away .
he was a little terrified by the solitude , and the darkness , and the roaring of the water ; but he trusted to his father , and was still .
" by and by , he heard a noise as of something heavy falling into the water .
he was frightened , for he thought it was his father .
but it was not his father .
what do you think it was , <name> ? "
<name> did not answer .
madam <name> looked down to see why he did not speak , and as she moved him a little , so as to see his face , his head rolled over to one side ; and , in short , madam <name> found that he was fast asleep .
" poor little fellow ! "
said she ; and she rose carefully , and carried him to the bed , and laid him down .
he opened his eyes a moment , when his cheek came in contact with the cool pillow , but turned his face over immediately , shut his eyes again , and was soon in a sound sleep .
chapter <name> .
engineering .
when <name> awoke it was almost evening .
the rays of the setting sun were shining in at the window .
<name> opened his eyes , and , after lying still a few moments , began to sing .
he thought it was morning , and that it was time for him to get up .
presently , however , he observed that the sun was shining in at the wrong window for morning : then he noticed that he was not undressed ; and , finally , he thought it must be night ; but he could not think how he came to be asleep there at that time .
<name> went out into the parlour .
<name> and <name> were just putting the chairs around the tea table .
at tea time , the boys talked a good deal about the mole , and they asked <name> <name> if she would help them rig some vessels to sail in the <unk> .
" sail in the <unk> ! "
said <name> <name> ; " whoever heard of sailing in the <unk> ?
that is a great whirlpool , which swallows up ships ; they never sail in it .
you had better call it the gulf stream . "
" well , " said <name> , " we <name> ; and <name> you help us rig some vessels ? "
" yes , " said <name> <name> , " when you get the mole done . "
<name> <name> was a beautiful girl , about seventeen years old , with a mild and gentle expression of countenance , and very pleasant tone of voice .
she helped the children in all their plays , and they were always pleased when she was with them .
she had great stores of pasteboard and coloured papers , to make boxes , and <unk> , and little <unk> , and <unk> of ; and she had a <unk> , and pencils , and <unk> , and <unk> of pictures and drawing lessons .
she rigged the boys ' vessels , and covered their balls , and made them beautiful flags and banners out of her pieces of coloured silk .
she advised them to have a flag-staff out at the end of the mole , as they generally have on all fortifications and national works .
she told them she would make them a handsome flag for the purpose .
after tea she went down with them to see the works .
she seemed to like the mole very much .
the whirlpool was moving very regularly , and she advised them to build the mole out pretty far .
" yes , " said <name> ; " and we are going to have a piece across up and down the stream , at the end of it , so as to make a t of it . "
" i think you had better make a y of it , " said <name> <name> .
" a y ! "
said <name> , " how ? "
" why instead of having the end piece go straight across the end of the mole , let the two parts of it branch out into the stream , one upwards and the other down . "
" what good <name> that do ? "
said <name> .
" why , if you make it straight like a t , the current <name> run directly along the outer edge of it , and so your vessels <name> not stay there .
but if you have it <unk> , there <name> be a little sort of harbour in the crotch , where your vessels can lie quietly , while the current flows along by , out beyond the forks . "
" that <name> be excellent , " said <name> , clapping his hands .
" and besides , " said she , " the upper part of the y <name> run out obliquely into the stream , and so turn more of the current into your <name> , and make the whirlpool larger . "
" well , and we <name> make it so , " said <name> ; " and then it <name> be an excellent mole . "
" yes , " said <name> <name> , " there <name> be all sorts of water around it ;  a whirlpool above , a little harbour in the crotch , a current in front , and still water below .
it <name> be as good a place for sailing boats as i ever saw . "
but the twilight was coming on , and they all soon returned to the house .
madam <name> had a little <unk> , as it was called , where she slept .
it was called a <unk> , because it consisted , in fact , of two small rooms , with a large arched opening between them , without any door .
in one room was the bed , which moved in and out on little trucks , for <name> .
in the other room was a table in the middle , with books and papers upon it .
there was a window in one side , and opposite the arched opening which led to the bedroom was a small sofa .
now , it was madam <name> 's custom every evening , before the children went to bed , to take them into her bedroom , and hear them read a few verses of the bible ; and then she would explain the verses , and talk with them a little about what had occurred during the day , and give them good advice and good instruction .
at such times the children usually sat upon the sofa , on one side of the table , and madam <name> took her seat on the other side of the table , in the chair , so as to face them .
the children generally liked this very much ; and yet she very seldom told them any stories at these times .
it was almost all reasonings and explanations ; and yet the children liked it very much .
chapter vii .
the sofa .
the boys took their places on the sofa , and afterwards laid their books upon the table .
after that madam <name> began to talk about the occurrences of the day , as follows :  " there are two or three things , boys , that i have been keeping to talk with you about this evening .
one is the question you asked , <name> , about <name> 's disobeying me , when he fell into the water . "
" yes , mother , " said <name> , looking up at once , very eagerly ; " you told him never to go near the bank ; and yet he went , and so he fell in . "
" but i could not help it , " said <name> .
" why , yes , mother , he certainly could help it ; for he walked there himself of his own accord . "
" very well ; that is the question for us to consider ; but , first , we must all be in a proper state of mind to consider it , or else it <name> do us no good .
now , <name> , i am going to ask you a question , and i want to have you answer it honestly :  which way do you wish to have this question , about <name> 's disobedience , decided ? "
" why ,  i do n't know , " said <name> .
" suppose i should come to the conclusion that <name> did right , and should prove it by arguments , should you feel a little glad , or a little sorry ? "
<name> <name> his head , and seemed somewhat confused , but said , doubtfully , that he did not know .
" now , i think , myself , " said his mother , " that you have a secret wish to have it appear that <name> is guilty of disobedience .
you said he disobeyed , at first , from unkind feelings , which you seemed to feel towards him at the moment ; and now , i suppose , you wish to adhere to it , so as to get the victory .
now , honestly , is n't it so ? "
<name> did not answer at first .
he looked somewhat ashamed .
presently , however , he concluded , that it was best to be <name> and honest ; so he looked up and acknowledged that it was so .
" yes , " said his mother ; " and while you are under the influence of such a prejudice , it would do no good for us to discuss the subject , for you would not be convinced ; so you had better give it up . "
madam <name> saw , while she was speaking , that <name> did not look sullen and dissatisfied , but good-natured and pleasant ; and so she knew that he had concluded to listen , candidly , to what she had to say .
" i think that <name> was not to blame at all , " said madam <name> , " for two reasons .
one is , that he was probably overwhelmed with terror .
to be sure , as you say , the cow did not push him .
he walked himself ,  yet still he was impelled as strongly as if he had been pushed , though in a different manner . "
" then there is another reason why <name> is innocent of any disobedience .
when i told him that he must not go to the high banks , i did not mean that he never must go , in any case whatever . "
" i thought you said he never must , " said <name> .
" i presume i did say so , and i made no exceptions ; but still some exceptions are always implied in such a case .
in all commands , however positive they may be , there is always some exception implied . "
" why , mother ? "
said <name> with surprise .
" it is so , " said his mother .
" suppose , for instance , that i were to tell you to sit down by the parlour fire , and study a lesson , and not to get out of your chair on any account .
and suppose that , after i had gone and left you , the fire should fall down , and some coals roll out upon the floor , would it not be your duty to get up , and brush them back ? "
" why , yes , " said <name> .
" so in all cases , very extreme and extraordinary occurrences , that could not , by possibility , have been considered , make exceptions .
and <name> , thinking , as he did , that he was in great danger from the cow , if he had thought of my command at all , he would have done perfectly right to have considered so extraordinary a case an exception , and so have retreated towards the <name> , notwithstanding my commands .
and now that question is settled . "
here little <name> , who had been sitting up very straight , and looking eagerly at his grandmother and at the other boys , during the progress of the conversation , <name> a long breath , and leaned back against the sofa , as if he felt a good deal relieved .
" and now , <name> , there is one thing i have seen in you to-day , which gave me a great deal of pleasure , and another which gave me pain . "
" what , mother , " said <name> .
" why , after i talked with you at noon , about teasing <name> , you began to treat him very kindly .
that gave me a great deal of pleasure .
i saw that your heart was somewhat changed in regard to <name> ; for you seemed to take pleasure in making him happy , while before you took delight in making him miserable . "
<name> looked gratified and pleased while his mother was saying these things .
" but then , in the course of the afternoon , " she continued , " the old malignant heart seemed to come back again .
when i came down to see the mole , i found you in such a state of mind as to take pleasure in <unk> suffering .
you wanted to prove that he had told a lie , and looked disappointed when i shewed you that he had not .
then you wanted to prove he had disobeyed me , when , after all , you knew very well that he had not . "
" o , mother , " said <name> .
" yes , <name> , i am very sorry to have to say so ; but you undoubtedly had no real belief that <name> had done wrong .
suppose i had told you i was going to punish him for disobeying me in retreating to the <name> , should you have thought that it would have been right ? "
" why , no , mother , " said <name> .
" you would have been shocked at such an idea .
and now do n't you see that all your attempts to prove that he had done wrong , was only the effect of the ill-will you felt towards him at the time .
it was malice <unk> over your judgment and your sense of right and wrong .
i told you , you know , that your resolutions would not reach the case . "
" well , mother , i am determined , " said <name> , very <unk> and positively , " that i never <name> tease or trouble <name> any more . "
" the evil is not so much in teasing and troubling <name> , as in having a heart capable of taking any pleasure in it .
that is the great difficulty . "
" well , mother , i am determined i never <name> feel any pleasure in his trouble again . "
" i am afraid that wo n't depend altogether upon the determination you make .
for instance , when you went to <name> to-day , and kindly tried to persuade him to go down , and offered to <name> his rocking-chair for him , your heart was then in a state of love towards him .
do you think you could then , by determination , have changed it from love to hate , and begun to take pleasure in teasing him ? "
<name> remembered how kindly and pleasantly he had felt towards <name> at that time , and he thought that it would have been impossible for him then to have found any pleasure in tormenting him ; and so he said , " no , mother , i could not . "
" and so , when you are angry with a person , and your heart is in a state of ill-will and malice towards him , does it seem to you that you can merely by a determination change it all at once , and begin to be filled with love , so as to feel pleasure in his happiness ? "
<name> was silent at first ; he presently answered , faintly , that he could not .
" and if you can not change your heart by your mere determination at the time , you certainly can not by making one general determination , now beforehand , for all time to come . "
<name> saw his helpless condition , and sighed .
after a pause , he said , " mother , it seems to me you are discouraging me from trying to be a better boy . "
" no , <name> ; but i do n't want you to depend on false hopes that must only end in your disappointment .
your determination <name> help in not indulging the bad feelings ; but i want to have your heart changed so that you could not possibly have such feelings .
i <name> mine is .
i once shewed the same spirit that you do ; but now i do n't think it would be possible for me to take any pleasure in teasing <name> , or you , or <name> .
" i <name> , " added madam <name> , " that god <name> give you a benevolent and tender heart , so that there shall be no tendency in you to do wrong .
he <name> change yours , if you pray to him to do it .
in fact , i <name> , and sometimes i almost believe , that he has begun .
i do not think you would have gone to <name> to-day so pleasantly , and acknowledged your fault , as you did by your actions , and felt so totally different from what you had done , if god had not wrought some change in you .
i have very often talked with children about such faults , as plainly and kindly as i did with you , and it produced no effect .
when they went away , i found , by their looks and actions afterwards , that their hearts were not changed at all .
and so , <name> , " said she , " i have not been saying this to discourage you , but to make you feel that you need a greater change than you can accomplish , and so to lead you to god that you may throw yourself upon him , and ask him , not merely to help you in your <unk> not to act out your bad feelings , but to change the very nature of them , or rather , to <name> on the change , which i <name> he has begun . "
<name> remembered , while his mother was talking , how full his heart had been of kindness and love to <name> , while he was helping him that afternoon , and he perceived clearly that he had not produced that state of mind by any of his own <unk> that he would feel so before he actually did .
he remembered how happy he had been at that time , and how discontented and miserable after he had been troubling <name> ; and he had a feeling of strong <name> that god would change his heart , and make him altogether and always benevolent and kind .
now , it happened that <name> had not understood this conversation very well , and he began to be weary and uneasy .
besides just about this time he began to recollect something about his grandmother 's beginning a story for him , when she took him up in her lap , after he came in from the mole .
so , when he noticed that there was a pause in the conversation , he said , " grandmother , you promised to tell me a story about blind <name> . "
" so i did , " said his grandmother smiling , " and i began it ; but before i got through you got fast asleep . "
<name> and <name> laughed , and so in fact did <name> ; and madam <name> then said that if he would tell <name> and <name> the story as far as she had gone , she would finish it .
" well , " said <name> , " i <name> .
once there was a blind boy , and his name was <name> ; and , you see , he was going through the woods , and his father was with him .
and his father walked along , and he walked along , and it was stony , and he said he would do just what his father said , because his father knew best ,  and  and so he took hold of the string again . "
" what string ? "
said <name> .
" why , it was his father 's string , " said <name> , eagerly , looking up into <name> 's face .
" what did he have a string for ? "
said <name> .
" why to lead him along by , " said <name> .
" yes  but why did not he take hold of his father 's hand ? "
asked <name> .
" why ,  why ,  there was a snake in the road , i believe ,  was n't there , grandmother ? "
his grandmother smiled ,  for <name> had evidently got bewildered , in his drowsiness , so that he had not a very distinct recollection of the story .
she , therefore , began again , and told the whole .
when she got to the place where she left off before , that is , to the place <name> heard a splash in the water , <name> started up , and asked , eagerly , " what was it ? "
" a stone , i suppose , " said <name> , coolly .
" no , " said madam <name> , " it was only the end of the stem of a small tree , which <name> 's father was trying to fix across the <name> , so that he could lead his blind boy over .
it was lying upon the ground , and he took it and raised it upon its end , near the edge of the bank , on one side , and then let it fall over , in hopes that the other end would fall upon the opposite bank .
but it did not happen to fall straight across , and so the end fell into the water , and this was the noise that <name> heard .
" he <name> the stick back again , and then contrived to raise it on its end once more ; and this time he was more successful .
it fell across , and so extended from bank to bank .
in a few minutes he succeeded in getting another by its side , and then he came back to <name> .
" <unk> , ' said he , 'i have built a bridge . '
" 'a bridge ! '
said <name> .
" 'yes , ' said he , 'a sort of a bridge ; and now i am going to try to lead you over . '
" 'but , father , i am afraid . '
" 'you said you would trust yourself entirely to me , and go wherever i should say . '
" 'well , father , ' said <name> , 'i <name> .
you know best , after all . '
" so <name> took hold of his father 's hand , and , with slow , and very careful steps , he got over the roaring torrent , and then they soon came out into a broad smooth road , and so got safely home . "
" now , <name> , " continued madam <name> , after she had finished her story , " do you remember what i meant to teach you by this story ? "
" yes , grandmother ; you said that i was like blind <name> , and that god knew what was best for me , and that i must let him lead me wherever he pleases . "
" yes ; and what was it that you said that reminded me to tell you the story ? "
" i said that i wished that i was well and strong , like the other boys . "
" yes , " said his grandmother , " i do not think you said it in a fretful or impatient spirit ; but i thought that this story of <name> would help to keep you patient and contented . "
" yes , grandmother , it does , " said <name> .
chapter viii .
the cart ride .
a week after this , <name> had his whip to mend .
he had broken off the lash , by whipping in sticks and little pieces of drift-wood to the mole .
<name> and <name> worked a little every day upon the mole , and had carried it out pretty far into the stream , and had almost finished the lower branches of the y .
so , one morning , after the boys had gone to school , and <name> had had his reading lesson , he sat down upon the steps of the door , behind the house , and began to tie on his lash with a piece of twine which <name> <name> had given him .
behind the house where <name> 's grandmother lived , there was a <name> which led to the pasture .
at the head of the <name> , where you entered it from the yard , were a pair of bars .
while <name> was mending his whip , he accidentally looked up , and noticed that the bars were down .
" there , mr. <name> , " said <name> , talking to himself , as he went on winding his twine round and round the <unk> ; " for once in your life , you have been careless .
you have left your bars down .
now we shall have the cattle all let out , unless i go and stop the mischief . "
<name> thought he would go and put the bars up again , as soon as he had tied the ends of his twine ; but before he got quite ready , he heard a noise , as of something coming in the <name> .
he could not see down the <name> far , from the place where he sat , for the barn was in the way .
but he wondered what could be coming , and he looked towards the bars , and sat waiting for it to appear .
in a moment , the head and horns of a great ox came into view , and , immediately after , the body of the ox himself , walking slowly along towards the bars .
" there now , " said <name> , " there comes lion , and he 'll get away . "
so he jumped up , and ran towards the ox a few steps , brandishing his whip , and shouting out to drive him back .
old lion , however , seemed to pay no attention , but came steadily forward , stepping carefully over the ends of the bars , and then , advancing a little way into the yard , began quietly to feed upon the grass .
before <name> got over his surprise at the entire indifference which old lion seemed to feel towards him and his whip , he heard the bars rattling again , and looking there , he saw <name> , lion 's mate , following on .
" o dear me , " said <name> , " what shall i do ?
all our oxen are getting away .
i 'll run and call <name> . "
so he began to shout out " <name> , " as loud as he could call ; and immediately afterwards , he heard <name> 's voice answering just down the <name> and , looking that way , he saw him coming over the bars himself , as if he had been following the oxen along up the <name> .
" <name> , <name> , " he cried out , " come quiet ; all your oxen are getting away . "
" o , no , " said <name> , quietly , as he was putting up the bars after the oxen , " they can not get away  i have fastened the outer gate . "
then <name> looked around and observed that the outer gate was fastened , so that they could not get out of the yard .
" o , very well , " said he .
" i did not know you were driving them up ; " and so he quietly returned to his seat , and went on playing with his whip .
<name> , in the mean time , proceeded to yoke up the cattle .
" <name> , " said <name> , at length , " where are you going with the cattle ? "
" out into the woods , " said <name> .
" what are you going to do in the woods ? "
said <name> .
" i am going to make a piece of fence . "
" may i go with you ? "
" i do n't think you can help me much about the fence , " said <name> .
" i can pull bushes along , " said <name> .
<name> made no reply , but began to drive the oxen towards a cart that was standing in a corner of the yard , and , after a few minutes , <name> renewed his request .
" <name> , i wish you would let me go with you . "
" well  it is just as your grandmother says , " replied <name> .
so <name> ran to ask his grandmother ; and she came to the window , and enquired of <name> how long he expected to be gone .
he said it would take him more than half a day to make the piece of fence , and he was going to take his dinner with him .
this was an objection to <unk> going ; but yet his grandmother concluded on the whole to consent .
so they put up some bread and butter , and some apples , with <unk> dinner , for <name> .
these things were all put in paper parcels , and the parcels put into a bag , which was thrown into the bottom of the cart .
then <name> wanted to take his hatchet .
his grandmother thought it would not be safe .
" i 'll be very careful , " said he : " and if i do n't have my hatchet , how can i help to make the fence ? "
<name> smiled , and madam <name> seemed at a loss to know what to say .
" it wo n't do ,  <name> it <name> ? "
said she .
" he might cut himself , " said <name> .
" but there is a small key-hole saw in the barn , that i filed up the other day .
perhaps he might have that , to saw the bushes down with . "
" can you saw , <name> ? "
said his grandmother .
" not very well , " said <name> , looking somewhat disappointed ; " the saw sticks so . "
" i can set it pretty rank , " said <name> , speaking to madam <name> at the window , " and then , i think , he can make it run smooth . "
madam <name> did not understand what <name> meant by setting it rank , and so she said , " how <name> that help it , <name> ? "
" why , then it <name> cut a wide <unk> , " said <name> , " and so the back <name> follow in easily . "
she did not understand from this much better than she did before ; but , as she had great confidence in <name> , she concluded to let him manage in his own way .
she accordingly told him that he might fix the saw , and take <name> with him .
so <name> went out into the barn , and took down the saw from a nail .
the teeth looked bright and sharp .
" why , <name> , how sharp it looks .
and the teeth are of different shape from what they were before . "
" yes , " said <name> , " i have made a cutting saw of it . "
" a cutting saw ? "
said <name> .
" can you cut with a saw ?
i thought they always sawed with a saw . "
" i mean , cut across the grain , " said <name> , smiling .
" when a saw is filed so as to saw along the board , then it is called a splitting saw ; but when it is to saw across the board , then i call it a cutting saw . "
<name> looked carefully at the teeth , so as to see how the teeth of a cutting saw were shaped .
and while he looked on , he observed that <name> had a little instrument in his hand , and he took hold of the first tooth of the saw with it , and bent it over a little to one side , and then he took hold of the next one , and bent it over to the other side ; and so he went on , bending them alternately to the right and left , until he passed along from one end of the saw to the other .
" there , " said he , " that is set pretty rank . "
" what do you mean by that ? "
said <name> , as he followed <name> out of the barn .
" why , the teeth are set off , a good way , each side , and it <name> cut a good wide <unk> ; and so your saw <name> run easy . "
by this time they had reached the cart .
<name> took hold of <name> under the arms , and jumped him up into the cart behind , and then handed him his saw .
then he put in an axe and an iron bar for himself , and one or two spare chains ; and then he went to open the great gate .
just at this moment , <name> <name> appeared at the window , and said , " <name> , are you going into the woods ? "
" yes , " said <name> .
" then , if you see any good , smooth birch bark , wo n't you bring me home some ! "
" i <name> , " said <name> ; and then <name> opened the gate , and started the oxen on .
<name> stood up in front , holding on by a stake , and wondering all the while what <name> could mean by a <unk> .
one would think that he might have known by the connection in which <name> used it ,  for he said that he had bent the teeth out so as to make the saw cut a good wide <unk> , and so he might have supposed that the <unk> was the cut in the wood which a saw makes in going in .
the reason why boys find it so difficult to saw , is because the teeth do not generally spread very much , and so the <unk> is narrow .
still , the back of the saw would run in it well enough , without sticking , if they were to saw perfectly straight .
but they generally make the saw twist or wind a little , and then the back of the saw rubs upon one side or the other ; and sticks .
now , <name> 's plan was to make the teeth set off , each side , so far as to make the <unk> very wide , and then he thought that <name> would be able to make it go , especially as the saw was very narrow .
<name> got into the cart , and took his seat upon a board which passed across from side to side , and they rode along .
they reached , at length , a place where there was a small cart path leading off from the main road into the woods .
<name> turned off into this path ; but it was so narrow that both he and <name> had sometimes to <name> away to one side or the other to avoid the bushes .
at length he stopped and unfastened the oxen from the tongue .
when all was right he started the oxen on before him , <name> trotting on behind with his saw in his hand .
presently they struck off from the cart path directly into the woods , and in a few minutes came to the place where the fence was to be made .
chapter ix .
the fire .
<name> let the cattle browse about , while he went to work , cutting down some small , but yet pretty tall and bushy trees .
he then brought up the team , and hooked a long chain into the ring which <name> down from the middle of the yoke , upon the under side .
the end of the chain trailed upon the ground , as the oxen came along , and <name> was very much interested to see how they would trample along , any where , among the rocks , roots , mire , logs , bushes , stumps , and , in fact , over and through almost any thing , chewing their cud all the time , patient and unconcerned .
when they were brought up near to one of the trees that had been cut down , <name> would hook the chain around the butt end of it , and then , at his command , they would drag it out of its place in the line of the fence .
after looking on for some time , <name> began to think that he would go to work ; and he went to a little tree , with a stem about as big round as his arm , and began to saw away upon it .
he found that the saw would run very well indeed ; and in a short time , he got the tree off , and then undertook to drag it to the fence .
<name> was always a very silent man ; he seldom spoke , unless to answer a question ; and while <name> had been watching him , when he first began to work , instead of talking with <name> , as <name> would have desired , he was all the time singing , " do , re , <name> , <unk> , <name> , la , si , do . "
the truth was , that <name> had just begun to go to a singing school , and he was taking this opportunity to rise and fall the notes , as he called it .
when <name> asked him any question about his work , he would just answer it in a few words , and then , a minute after , begin again with his <unk> , re , <name> , ' and all the rest .
<name> became tired of this singing ; and when , at length , his tree got wedged fast , so that he could not move it any farther , he sat down discouraged upon a log , and looked anxiously towards <name> , as if he wished that he would come and help him .
<name> had just hooked his chain to another tree , and taking up his goad stick , called out , " <name> ' , <name> !
<name> ' , lion ! "
and then as his oxen started on , he followed them with his  " do , re , <name> , <unk> , <name> , la , si , do . "
" dear me ! "
said <name> , with a deep sigh .
" do , si , la , <name> , <unk> , <name> , re , do , " sang <name> , coming down the scale .
<name> got up , and walked along towards <name> a little way , and called out , " <name> ? "
" what ? "
said <name> .
" when do you think you shall be done singing that tune ? "
<name> smiled , and asked " why ? "
" why , " said <name> , in rather a timid voice , " i do n't think it is a very pretty tune . "
" do n't you ? "
said <name> .
" well , i do n't admire it much myself . "
" then what do you sing it so much , for , <name> ? "
" o , that 's my lesson , " said <name> , " but how does your saw do , <name> ? "
" very well ; only i ca n't get my tree along . "
" where do you want to get it ? "
" o , out to the fence , " said <name> .
" you had better not try to make a fence .
you had better build a fire . "
" but i have not got any fire to light it with ? "
" yes , " said <name> , " i brought a <unk> , because i thought you would want a fire ; and i forgot to give it to you . "
so <name> pointed to a place among some rocks off at a little distance before him , near the line in which he was coming along with his fence , and advised <name> to make a fire there .
<name> liked this plan very much .
he said he would play " camp out , " and so build a camp , and have a fire before the camp .
<name> told him that so soon as he should get his pile of sticks ready , he would come and strike fire for him .
<name> went to the place and began to work .
he cut down bushes , and placed them up against the rocks , in such a manner as to make a little hut which he should get into .
he then collected a pile of sticks in front of it .
first , he picked up all the dry sticks he could find near , and then he sawed off branches from the old dead trees which were lying around in the forest .
in an hour , with <name> 's help in lighting his fire , <name> had a very good camp .
his hut was quite a comfortable one , with a blazing fire near it , and three large apples roasting before the fire .
by and by , <name> saw <name> coming towards him , with the bag over his arm .
he opened it , and took out one parcel after another , and then laying the mouth of the bag down upon the ground , he took hold of the bottom of it , and raised it in the air ; while <name> watched to see what was coming out .
it proved to be potatoes ; and <name> told <name> he might roast them in his fire .
" cover them up well with hot ashes and coals , <name> , and then build a fire upon the top . "
so <name> dug out the bottom of his fire with a pole ;  for the fire had pretty much burnt down to ashes ;  and he put the potatoes in .
there were five of them .
<name> helped him to cover them up , and then he put more sticks upon the top .
when that was done , and just as he was going back to his work , <name> said , " see there , <name> ;  there is a fine chimney for you to burn out . "
<name> looked where <name> pointed , and saw a very tall and large hollow tree , or rather trunk of a tree ,  for the top had long since decayed and dropped away .
there it stood , desolate , with a great hole in the side near the bottom , and the bark hanging loosely about it all the way up to the top .
the boys always liked to find such hollow trees in the woods , to build fires in ; they called it " burning out a chimney . "
" now , " said <name> , " all you have got to do is to go to work while your potatoes are roasting , and fill up that old hollow tree at the bottom with sticks and brush , and old pieces of bark .
pack them in close ; then , when i come to dinner , i <name> help you to light it . "
<name> then went back to the fence , and <name> began his work as <name> had directed .
he got all the dried branches that he could find , and carried them to the foot of the tree .
others he sawed ; and he packed all the pieces in the hollow of the tree as closely as he could .
by this time <name> saw <name> coming along towards the camp , and he went there to meet him .
they raked open the fire , and took out the potatoes .
<name> turned a stone upon its edge , towards the fire , so as to keep them warm .
he also cut some square pieces of birch bark from a neighbouring tree , for plates , and gave one to <name> , and took one himself , and then they both sat down upon a smooth log which <name> <name> up to the fire , and took their birch bark plates in their lap .
<name> took a little paper of salt out of his pocket , and poured the salt out upon another square piece of birch bark , which he placed upon a stone between himself and <name> , so that both could reach it .
" what shall i do for a spoon ? "
said <name> .
" o , you do n't need a spoon , " said <name> ; and he took up a <unk> himself , broke it in two , sprinkled some salt upon it , and began to eat it as a boy would eat an apple .
" o , i ca n't eat my potatoes so , " said <name> .
" why not , " said <name> , putting a little more salt upon his own <unk> .
" it is too hot , " said <name> .
" then you must wait until it cools . "
" but i want a spoon very much , " said <name> .
" well , " said <name> , " i <name> make you one . "
so <name> took out his knife and cut off a piece from a dry pine branch , which lay near him .
he split this so as to get a flat piece out of it , which he fashioned into a rude sort of spoon , that answered <name> 's purpose very well .
but before <name> had much more than begun his dinner , <name> had finished his , and , rising , said that he must go back to his work .
" but , first , i <name> set your chimney <unk> , " said he .
" no , " said <name> , " i want you to let me kindle it . "
" you ca n't . "
" yes , i can , " said <name> ; " i can get some birch bark . "
" very well ; only if i go away to my work now , you must not come and trouble me to come back again , because you ca n't get the fire a-going . "
" no , " said <name> , " i wo n't . "
so <name> went back to his work , and <name> finished his dinner .
at length , however , his potatoes and bread and butter were all gone , and his apple cores he had pretty thoroughly scraped with his wooden spoon , and thrown into the fire .
so he got up from his seat , and prepared to light his chimney .
he took his plate for a slow match .
it was pretty large and stiff , and he thought it would burn long enough for him to <name> it from the fire to his chimney .
he accordingly took hold of it by one corner , and held the other corner into the flame , which was curling up from a brand by the side of his fire .
but before the birch bark took fire , the flame of the brand went out , and then <name> looked around for another .
the fire had , however , burnt nearly down , so as to leave a great bed of embers , with the brands all around it , the burnt ends pointing inwards , <name> pushed some of these into the fire , and soon made a blaze again , and then once more attempted to set the corner of his plate on fire .
he succeeded .
the corner began to blaze and curl , and <name> rose and moved along carefully , lest the wind should blow it out .
this precaution was , however , scarcely necessary , for the little wind that his motion occasioned , only fanned the flame the more , and the part which was on fire curled round upon that which was not , and thus formed a round and solid mass , which burned fiercely .
<name> walked along , the bark blazing higher and higher , and curling in upon itself more and more , until , at length , he began to be afraid it would reach his fingers before he could get to his chimney .
he walked faster and faster , and presently began to run .
this fanned the fire the more , until , just as he came within a few steps of his chimney , the curling bark reached his fingers , and he tripped over a great root at the very instant when he was dropping the piece of bark from his hands .
he came down upon <unk> , and the bark which was now a compact roll , rolled down a little slope , crackling and blazing by the way .
<name> got up and looked at the blazing mass a minute or two , in despair ; but finding that it kept on burning , his eye suddenly brightened , and he said aloud , " i 'll poke it up . "
so he looked around for a stick .
he readily found one , and began to push the blazing roll up the <unk> ; but as fast as he pushed it up , it rolled down again , and all his efforts were consequently vain .
" o dear me ! "
said <name> , at length throwing down his stick , " what shall i do ? "
in the meantime the roll continued blazing , and <name> , looking at it steadily , observed that it was hollow .
" ah , " said he , " i 'll stick him . "
so he took up his stick again , and tried to thrust the end of the stick into the roll .
after one or two ineffectual attempts , he succeeded , though by this time the bark was pretty well burnt through , and was all ready to fall to pieces .
he , however , succeeded in raising it into the air , upon the end of his pole ; but before he got it to the hollow tree , it dropped off again in several blazing fragments , which continued to burn a moment upon the ground , and then went out entirely .
<name> then went to <name> , and told him that he could not make his fire burn .
" o you must not come to me , youngster ; you promised not to trouble me with it , " said <name> , as he hooked the chain around the <unk> of another tree .
" but i thought i could make it burn . "
" well , what 's the matter with it ?
but stand back , for i am going to start this tree along . "
" why the bark all curls up and burns my hand , " said <name> , retreating at the same time out of the way of the top of <name> 's tree .
the oxen started along , dragging the tree , and <name> followed , trying to get an opportunity to speak once more to <name> .
<name> , however , went calling aloud to his oxen , and directing them here and there with his " gee , <name> , " and his " <name> , lion , " and his " wo up , whoa " .
at length , however , he had the tree in its place , and seeing <name> standing at a little distance patiently , he asked him again , " what do you say is the matter with your fire , <name> ? "
" why , the birch bark curls up and burns me : i wish you would come and set it <unk> . "
" no , " said <name> , walking along by the side of his oxen ; " i must not leave my work to help you play ; but i <name> tell you three ways to <name> the fire , and you can manage it in one or the other of them . "
so saying , he took out his knife , and cut down a small , slender <name> , which was growing near him , and trimmed off the top and the few little branches which were growing near the top .
it made a slender pole about five feet long , with smooth but freckled bark , from end to end .
he then made a little split in one end .
" there , <name> , " said he , " take that , and stick a piece of birch bark in the split end ; then you can <name> it , and let it curl as much as it pleases .
or , if that fails , put a large piece of birch bark directly upon the fire .
then , as soon as it begins to burn , it <name> begin to curl , and then you must put the end of the stick down to it , in such a manner that the bark <name> curl over and grasp it , and then you can take it up and <name> the roll upon the end of your pole . "
" very well , " said <name> , " there are two ways . "
" there are two ways , " repeated <name> .
" now , if both these fail , you must put on a good many fresh sticks upon the fire , with one end of each of them out .
then , as soon as the ends which are in the fire have got burnt through , take up two of them by the ends that were out of the fire and lay them down at the foot of the hollow tree , close to the wood you have got together there .
then come back and get two more brands , and lay them down in the same way , and be careful to have the burnt ends all together .
so you must keep going back and forth , until you find that the brands are beginning to burn up freely in the new place . "
<name> took the <name> pole and went back to his fire .
he tore the <unk> in two , and this made two very good small strips of bark .
he pulled open the split end of his pole , and carefully inserted one of them , and then , holding it over a little flame which was rising from a burning brand , he set it on fire .
the bark was soon in a blaze , and it writhed and curled as if it were struggling to get away ; but it only clung to the end of the pole more closely ; and <name> , much pleased at the success of his experiment , waved it in the air , and shouted to <name> to look and see .
he then walked slowly along , stopping every moment to wave his great <unk> , and shout ; and so , when at last he reached the hollow tree , the bark was nearly burnt out , and the fragments were beginning to fall off from the end of the pole .
he then thrust it hastily under the heap of fuel , which had been collected in the tree ; but it was too late .
it flickered and smoked a minute or two , and finally went out altogether .
" i do n't care , " said <name> to himself , " for i have got the other half of the <unk> ; " and he went back for that .
it happened unluckily , however , this time , that , in pulling open the cleft which <name> had made in his <name> pole , he pulled too hard , and split one side off .
here was at once an end to all attempts to communicate fire to his chimney by this method .
so , after <unk> the split part of his stick to its place , once or twice , and finding that the idea of uniting it again was entirely out of the question , he threw the broken piece away , and said to himself that he must try <name> 's second plan .
he accordingly took the other large piece of bark , which was the one which <name> had used for his plate , and laid it upon the fire .
as soon as it began to curl , he laid the end of the stick close to it , on the side towards which it seemed to be bending ,  and in such a way that it curled over upon it , and soon clasped it tight , as <name> had predicted that it would do .
he then raised it in the air , and set out to run with it , so that it should not burn out before he reached the place .
but he ought not to have run .
it would have been far safer and better to have walked along carefully and slowly ; for as he ran on , jumping over logs and stones , and scrambling up and down the hummocks , the top of the pole , with the blazing roll of bark , was jerked violently about in the air , until , at length , as he was wheeling around a tree , he accidentally held the top of the pole so far that it wheeled round through the air very swiftly , and threw the birch bark off by the centrifugal force : and away it went , rolling along upon the ground .
the centrifugal force is that which makes any thing fly off when it is whirled round and round .
<name> did not understand this very well , but he was surprised to see his roll flying off in that manner .
he immediately took two sticks , and tried to take up the roll with them , as one would with a pair of tongs ; but he could not hold it with them .
" well , then , " said he , " i must try the third way . "
so he began to gather sticks , and put the ends of them upon the fire .
when they began to burn , he took up one ; but as soon as he got it off the fire , it began to go out , and he said that he knew that way to kindle a fire never would do .
in fact , he began to get out of <name> .
he threw down the stick , and went off again after <name> .
" <name> , " said he , " i cannot make my fire burn ; and i wish you would come and kindle it for me . "
" have you tried the ways i told you about ? "
" yes , " said <name> .
" have you tried all of them faithfully ? "
" all but the last , " said <name> , " and i know that wo n't do . "
" you must try them all , faithfully , or else i ca n't come . "
so saying , <name> went on with his work .
<name> went back a good deal out of humour with himself , and saying that he wished <name> was not so cross .
he took up two of the sticks , which were now pretty well on fire , and carried them along , swinging them by the way , to make fiery rings and serpents in the air .
when he reached the chimney , he threw them down carelessly , and stood watching them , to see if they were going to burn .
instead , however , of setting the other wood on fire , they only grew <unk> and <unk> themselves ; and he said to himself , " i knew they would not burn . "
then he sat down upon a log , in a sad state of <unk> and dissatisfaction .
however , after waiting a few minutes , longer , he went back to the fire , determined to bring all the brands there were , and put them down , though he knew , he said , that they would not burn .
he was going to do it , so that then he could go and tell <name> that he had tried all his plans , and that now he must come , and light the fire himself .
so he walked along , back and forth bringing the brands , and laying them down together near the foot of the heap of fuel in the tree .
but before he had brought them all , he found that they began to brighten up a little , and at length they broke out into a little flame .
he stood and watched it a few minutes .
it blazed up higher and higher .
he then put on some more wood which was near .
the flame crept up between these sticks , and soon began to snap and crackle among the brush in the tree .
<name> stepped back , and watched the flame a moment as it flashed up higher and higher , and then clapped his hands , jumped up on a log , and shouted out , " <name> , it 's <unk> , its <unk> . "
chapter x .
the captive .
when <name> heard <name> 's voice calling to him so loudly , he paused a moment from his work , and seeing that the fire had actually taken , in <name> , he told <name> that he must go back a little way , for <unk> the tree would fall .
so <name> went back to some distance , and asked <name> if that was far enough .
<name> said it was , and <name> then sat down upon a log , with his <name> pole in his hand , to watch the progress of the fire .
a dense smoke soon began to pour out of the top of the chimney .
the fire roared up through the hollow , and it caught outside too , under the bark , and soon enveloped the whole tree in smoke , sparks , and flame .
large pieces of the blazing bark detached themselves , from time to time , from the side of the tree , and came down , crackling and sparkling to the ground ; and the opening below where <name> had crammed in his fuel , soon glowed like the mouth of a furnace .
near the top of the tree was an old branch , or rather the stump of an old branch , decayed and blackened , reaching out a little way , like an arm .
this was soon enveloped in smoke ; and , as <name> was watching it , as it appeared and disappeared in the wreaths , he thought he saw something move .
he looked again , intently .
it was a squirrel ,  half suffocated in the smoke , and struggling to hold on .
<name> immediately called out to <name> as loud as he could call , " <name> , <name> , come here , quick : here is a poor squirrel burning up . "
<name> dropped his axe , and ran ,  bounding over the logs , and hummocks ; but before he reached the place , the squirrel , unable to hold on any longer , and half stifled with the smoke and scorching heat , dropped from his hold to the ground .
<name> came up at the moment , and seized him ; he brought him to where <name> was sitting ,  <name> himself eagerly coming forward to see .
" is it dead ? "
said <name> .
" pretty much , " said <name> .
the squirrel lay gasping helplessly in <name> 's hands .
" here , put him in my cap , " said <name> ; " that <name> make a good bed for him , and perhaps he <name> come to life again . "
<name> examined him pretty carefully , and he did not seem to be burnt .
he said he thought he must have been suffocated by breathing the smoke and hot air .
<name> then went back to his work , and <name> sat upon the log , watching alternately the squirrel and the burning tree .
in a few minutes a great flame flashed out at the top of the tree : and finally , after about half an hour , the whole trunk , being all in a blaze , from top to bottom , began slowly to bend and bend over .
" <name> , " shouted <name> ,  " <name> , look ;  it is going to fall ! "
the tall trunk moved at first slowly , but soon more and more rapidly , and finally came down to the ground with a crash .
the crash startled the little squirrel , so that he almost regained his feet ; and <name> was afraid that he was going to run away .
but he laid over again upon his side , and was soon quiet again as before .
not long after this , <name> finished his work , and prepared to go home .
he proposed to <name> that they should leave the squirrel there , upon the log ; but <name> was very desirous to <name> him home , because , he said , he could tame him , and give him to <name> <name> .
so <name> asked how they should contrive to <name> him .
<name> wanted to <name> him home in his cap ; but <name> said that he would take cold by riding home bare-headed .
" however , " said <name> , " perhaps i can contrive something . "
so he went after another piece of birch bark from the tree , about six inches wide , and two feet long , and rolled it over , bringing the two ends together , so as to make a sort of round box ,  only it was without top or bottom .
to keep it in shape he tied a string round it .
" but how are you going to keep him in ? "
asked <name> .
<name> said nothing , but he took a handkerchief out of his jacket pocket , and spread it out upon the ground , and put his birch bark box upon it .
he then laid the squirrel gently in upon the handkerchief , which thus served for a bottom .
next he <name> the corners of the handkerchief up over the top , and tied the opposite pairs of ends together .
thus the handkerchief served for top , bottom , and handle .
they soon reached the place where they had left the cart ; they got into it and rode on .
<name> held the squirrel in his lap , and of course , as there was nothing but the thin handkerchief for a bottom to the box , <name> felt the weight of the squirrel , pressing soft and warm upon his knees .
the squirrel lay very still until they got very near home , and then <name> began to feel a creeping sensation , as if he was beginning to move .
<name> was highly delighted to perceive these signs of returning life ; he held his knees perfectly still , that he might not disturb him , crying out , however , to <name> , " he 's moving , <name> ; he 's moving , he 's moving . "
chapter xi .
<name> <name> .
<name> and <name> reached home about the middle of the afternoon : and while <name> went into the yard to leave the cart and turn out the cattle , <name> pressed eagerly into the house , to shew his prize .
<name> <name> , or <name> , as they generally called her , came to meet him to see what he had got in his hand .
" is that my birch bark ? "
said she .
" there !
i forgot your birch bark , " said <unk>  " but i have got something here a great deal better . "
and so saying he put his handkerchief down , and began very eagerly to untie the knots .
when he had got two of the ends untied , and was at work upon the other two , out leaped the squirrel , and ran across the room .
<name> <name> , startled by the sudden appearance of the animal , ran off to the door , and <name> called out in great distress , " o dear !
o dear !
what shall i do ?
he 'll get away .
shut the door , <name> <name> ,  shut the door , quick !
call <name> ; call <name> . "
<name> <name> , at first , retreated outside of the door , and stood there a moment , peeping in .
finding , however , that the squirrel remained very quiet in a corner of the room , she returned softly , and went round , and shut all the doors and windows , and then <name> went and called <name> .
the squirrel had by no means yet got over his accident , and he allowed himself to be easily <unk> and secured .
<name> contrived to fasten him into a box , so as to keep him safe , until next morning ; and by that time they thought , if he should then seem likely to get well , they could determine what it was best to do with him .
while <name> was coming home , there had been a strange mixture of delight and uneasiness in his feelings .
the delight was occasioned by the possession of the squirrel .
that was obvious enough .
the uneasiness he did not think about very distinctly , and did not notice what the cause of it was .
boys very often feel a sort of uneasiness of mind ,  they do not know exactly how or why ,  and they have this feeling mingling sometimes strangely with their very enjoyment , in their hours of gaiety and glee .
now the real reason of this unquiet state of mind , in <name> 's case , was that his conscience had been disturbed by his feelings of vexation and impatience , towards <name> , for not leaving his work , to come and kindle his fire .
he had not yielded to these feelings .
he had restrained them , and had stood still , and spoken respectfully to <name> , all the time .
in fact , he was hardly aware that he had done any thing wrong , at all .
but still , for a moment , selfish passions had had possession of his heart , and whenever they get possession , even if they are kept in subjection , so as not to lead to any bad actions or words , and even if they are soon driven away by new thoughts , as <name> 's were , by the sight of his blazing fire ,  still , they always leave more or less of misery behind .
so <name> , as he was going home , had his heart filled with delight at the thoughts of the squirrel resting warmly in his lap ; and he was also a prey , in some degree , to a gnawing uneasiness , which he could not understand , but which was really caused by a sting which sin had left there .
and yet <name> came home with an idea that he had been a very good boy .
so , after they had got tired of looking at the squirrel , and <name> <name> had taken her seat at her work by the window , with her little <unk> before her , <name> came up to her , and kneeling upon her cricket , and putting his arms in her lap , he said , " well , aunt <name> , i have been a good boy all day to-day , and so i want you to make me a picture-book , this evening . "
<name> had a way of making <unk> that pleased children very much .
the way was this : she used to save all the old , worn-out picture books , and loose pictures , she could find , and put them carefully in one of her drawers , up stairs .
then she would make a small blank book , of white paper , and sew it through the back .
then she would cut out pictures enough from her old stores to fill the book , leaving the colours blank , because they were to be covered with some <unk> paper , for a title .
then she would paste the pictures in .
and here , when <name> <name> first began to make such books , an unexpected difficulty arose .
for , when paper is wet , it swells ; and then , when it dries again , though it shrinks a little , and does not shrink back quite into its original dimensions ,  that is , quite to the length and breadth that it had at first .
now , when <name> <name> pasted her pictures in the pages of the book , that part of the leaf which was under the picture was wet by the paste , and so it swelled , while the other part remained dry .
and when the picture came to dry , it did not shrink quite back again .
it remained swelled a little ; and this caused the <name> to look warped or puckered , so that the leaves did not lie smooth together .
at length she found out a way to remedy this difficulty entirely ; and this was , to wet the whole of the leaf , as well as that part that the picture was pasted to , and that made it all swell alike .
the way she managed the operation was this : after sewing the book , she would cut out a piece of morocco paper , or blue paper , or gilt paper , and sometimes a piece of morocco itself , just the size of the book when open , for the cover .
then , after spreading out a large newspaper upon the table , so as to keep the table clean , she would lay down the cover with the handsome side down , and then spread the paste over the other side , very carefully , with a brush which she made from the end of a quill .
then she would put the back edge of the book down upon this cover , and lay it over , first on one side , and then on the other , and <name> it down well with a towel ; and that would make the cover stick to the outside leaves of the book , and cover up and hide the great <unk> in the back , by which the leaves had been sewed together .
then she would take the book before her , and begin at the beginning .
first , she would lay down the cover and put upon it a piece of tin , made to fill papers with , to keep it down smooth .
then she would lay the next leaf down upon the tin .
the leaf was to have the title-page upon it , and so there were to be no pictures pasted to it .
she would , therefore , lay this down upon the tin , and then , with one of her large paint brushes , dipped in the water , she would wet it all over , patting it afterwards with a towel , to take up all the superfluous water .
then she would take up the tin , and put the <unk> down upon the cover , and put the tin over it to keep it down smooth .
the next leaf would be for pictures , and , after <unk> pictures upon it , on both sides , she would lay it down upon the tin , and with her brush she would wet all those parts which had not been pasted .
then patting it with a dry towel , or soft cloth , to dry it as much as possible , she would put it under the tin .
in this way she would go on regularly , through the book , <unk> pictures upon all the pages , and wetting with her brush all those parts of the paper which had not been wet by the paste , and putting the tin over the leaves as fast as she finished them , to keep them all smooth .
then , when she had got through , she would put the whole away between two boards , to dry ; the weight of the paper board being sufficient to keep the leaves all smooth .
the next morning when she came to look at her book , she generally found it nearly dry ; and then she would put some heavy weight upon the upper board , to press it harder .
when it was perfectly dry , she took out the book , and <unk> off the edges , all around , with a sharp knife and a rule .
then she would get her <unk> , and colour all the pictures beautifully , and make borders about them , in bright colours , and print a handsome title-page with her pen , and write the name of the boy in it whom she meant to give it to .
so <name> , when he came and told <name> <name> , what a good boy he had been , meant to have her make such a book as this .
" but sometimes boys are mistaken in thinking they have been good boys .
i should want to ask <name> . "
" he would say so , i know , " said <name> ; " for i certainly did not trouble him at all , all the day . "
" suppose you run and ask him . "
" well , " said <name> ; and away he ran .
" but stop , " said <name> <name> ; " you must not ask him by a leading question . "
" what is that ? "
said <name> .
" do n't you know ? "
said <name> <name> .
" no , " said <name> .
" o , that is very important for boys to know ; for they very often ask leading questions , when they ought not to .
now , if you go and say , <unk> , have n't i been a good boy to-day ? '
that way of asking the question shews that you want him to say , 'yes , you have . '
it is called a leading question , because it leads <name> to answer in a particular way .
now , if i should go and ask him thus , <unk> <name> been a good boy to-day ? '
with the emphasis on has , it would be a leading question the other way .
it would sound as if i wanted him to say you had not been a good boy . "
" how must i ask him , then ? "
said <name> .
" why you can say , <unk> , aunt <name> wants to know what sort of a boy i have been to-day , ' that way of putting the question would not lead him one way or the other . "
" why , he might know , " said <name> , " that i should want him to say i have been good . "
" yes , but not from the form of the question .
the question would not lead him . "
while <name> <name> was saying this , <name> was standing with his hand upon the latch of the door , ready to go ; and when she had finished what she was saying , he started off to find <name> .
as he passed across the yard , he heard the sound of voices before the house .
it was <name> and <name> coming home from school .
in a minute they appeared in view , by the great elm .
<name> had a long slender pole in his hands , which he was waving in the air , and <name> had a small piece of wood , and a knife .
he sat down under the elm , and began to shave the wood with the knife .
<name> ran to tell them about his squirrel ; but before he got there , <name> , seeing him , began to wave his pole in the air , and shout , and then said , " see what a <name> flag-staff we have got . "
" is that your flag-staff ? "
said <name> .
" yes .
<name> <name> gave it to us .
he got it out of his father 's shop .
we are going to set it up out at the end of our mole . "
" yes , " said <name> , " and i am going to make a truck on the top , to haul up the flag by .
<name> is going to make us a flag . "
" a truck ? "
said <name> , <unk> .
" yes , " said <name> , " a little wheel to put a string over to hoist it by . "
<name> looked upon the pole , and upon <name> 's work , for a minute in silence , and then said , " i have got something better than a flag-staff . "
" what ? "
asked <name> .
" a squirrel . "
" a squirrel ! "
said <name> in surprise .
" yes , " said <name> , " a grey squirrel . "
" where is he ? "
said <name> , looking up eagerly , from his work .
" in the <unk> , " said <name> .
" <name> put him in a <unk>  come , and i <name> shew him to you . "
down went <name> 's pole , in a moment ; <name> , too , shut his knife , and put it in his pocket , and off they went to see the squirrel .
the little <unk> was frightened at seeing so many eyes peeping in upon him from every crevice and opening in his box .
he looked much brighter and better than he did when he was put into the box , and <name> thought he would get entirely well .
" o , i wish i had him , " said <name> .
" i am going to keep him in a cage , " said <name> .
" i wish he was mine , " said <name> .
" why ca n't you give him to me , <name> ? "
" o , no , " said <name> , " i want to keep him . "
" you do n't know how to take care of him , " said <name> .
" come , you give him to me , and i <name> give you my flag-staff . "
" no , " said <name> , " i do n't want any flag-staff .
i want to keep the squirrel . "
" see , see , " said <name> , " he is creeping along . "
" o , " said <name> , " i wish he was mine . "
" there , he is curling up in the corner . "
" would you give him to me for my top ? "
said <name> , very eagerly .
" he 's going to eat that kernel of corn , " said <name> .
" i should think you might give him to me , " said <name> , <unk> , " for that top ; the top is worth a great deal the most . "
after a few minutes , <name> finding that there was no prospect of inducing <name> to sell him the squirrel , desisted from his attempts ; and then , after a moment 's pause , he said , " i do n't think it is your squirrel , after all , <name> . "
" whose is it then ? "
" <name> 's .
he saved it .
the poor thing would have been burnt up , if he had not run and caught it up . "
" no , he would n't , " said <name> , " i was just going to get him myself . "
<name> , having decided in his own mind that the squirrel was <name> 's , ran off to find <name> , with the design of asking him to give the squirrel to him .
but <name> said the squirrel was <name> 's .
" but you caught him , " said <name> .
" yes , but i caught him for <name> , not for myself . "
" and you fixed the box to bring him home in , " said <name> .
" i know it , but i only did it to please <name> .
the squirrel is his altogether . "
so <name> had to return disappointed .
when <name> came in , <name> <name> was putting up her work , and arranging her things neatly in her drawer .
" well , <name> , " said she , " and what did <name> say ? "
" o , he said it was mine , " replied <name> .
" what was yours ? "
said <name> <name> .
" the squirrel . "
" the squirrel ! "
repeated <name> <name> ; " you went to ask him what sort of a boy you had been . "
" o ! "
said <name>  " there !  i forgot all about that .
i 'll run and ask him now . "
" no ,  stop , " said <name> <name> ; " it is time for supper now ; and besides , i <name> take your word for it ; you are a pretty honest boy .
you say you was a pleasant boy all day . "
" yes , " said <name> , " i was . "
he had forgotten his feelings of <unk> , when <name> would not come and light his fire .
" and you think i ought to make you a picture book for a reward . "
" yes , " said <name> , " i wish you would . "
" but i can not tell how pleasant in mind you have been all day , unless i know what you have had to try you . "
" to try me ? "
asked <name> .
" yes , i want to know what troubles , or difficulties , or disappointments you had to bear , and did bear patiently and pleasantly . "
<name> looked a little perplexed .
" you know , <name> , " she continued , " there is no merit in being pleasant unless things go wrong . "
" is n't there ? "
said <name> .
" why , no , " said <name> <name> , as she shut up her <unk> drawer , " is there ? "
" why no , " said <name> , smiling ; for he could not help smiling , while yet he was a little disappointed at finding all his fancied goodness melted away .
" now , did you have a good time in the woods to-day ? "
" yes , " said <name> .
" did <name> take good care of you ? "
" yes , " said he .
" and did you have a good dinner ? "
" yes ; and a <name> great fire , " said <name> .
" you little rogue , then ! "
said <name> <name> , laughing , and stabbing at his sides with her finger ; " here you have been having a beautiful time in the woods , amusing yourself all day , and had every thing to please you ; and now you come to me to pay you for not having been impatient and fretful !
you little rogue ! "
<name> turned , and ran laughing away , <name> <name> after him , and pointing at him with her finger .
<name> made his escape into the front entry , and hid behind the door .
<name> <name> pretended to have lost sight of him , and not to know where he was ; and she went about , saying , " where is that little rogue ?
he came to get away one of my <unk> for nothing .
he wanted to be paid for bearing happiness patiently .
the rogue !
i 'll pinch him if i can only find him . "
so saying , <name> <name> went and sat down to supper , and soon after <name> came and took his seat too ; <name> <name> <unk> shaking her finger at him all the time .
he had to hold his hand over his mouth to keep from laughing aloud .
perhaps some of the readers of this book may smile at <name> 's idea of his merit in having been a pleasant boy all day , when he felt vexed and <unk> in the only case which brought him any trial ; but it is so with almost all children , and some grown persons too .
a great deal of the goodness upon which we all pride ourselves , is only the quiescence of bad propensities in the absence of temptation and trial .
chapter xii .
the walk .
outside of the window in madam <name> 's bedroom , where the children used to sit and talk with her just before going to bed , there was a little platform , with a plain roof over it , supported by small square posts , altogether forming a sort of portico .
below this window there were two doors , opening from the middle out each way , so that when the window was raised , and the doors were opened , a person could walk in and out .
there were seats in the portico , and there was a wild <unk> growing upon a plain trellis , on each side .
in front of the portico was one of the broad walks of the garden , for on this side the garden extended up to the house .
at least there was no fence between , though there was a small plot of green grass next to the house ; and next to that came the trees and flowers .
one pleasant evening <name> and <name> were playing on this grass , waiting for madam <name> to come and call them in to the sofa .
it was about eight o'clock , but it was not dark .
the western sky still looked bright ; for though the sun had gone down , so that it could no longer shine upon the trees and houses , it still shone upon the clouds and atmosphere above , and made them look bright .
presently madam <name> came , and stood at the window .
" where 's <name> ? "
said she .
" out in the garden , " said <name> , " and mother , " he continued , " i wish you would walk in the garden to-night . "
at first , madam <name> said she thought she could not very well that evening , for she had a difficult text to talk about ; but the boys promised to walk along quietly , and to be very sober and attentive ; and so she went and put on her garden bonnet , and came out .
the garden was not large , it extended back to some high <name> precipices , where the boys used sometimes to climb up for play .
" i am afraid , " said madam <name> , as she sauntered along the walk , the children around her , " that you <name> not like the verse that i am going to talk with you about this evening , very well , when you first hear it . "
" what is it mother ? "
said <name> .
" 'and you hath he quickened , who were dead in <unk> and sins . ' "
" what does quickened mean ? "
asked <name> .
" made alive , or brought to life .
quick means alive , sometimes ; as for instance , the quick and the dead , means the living and the dead .
and so we say , <unk> to the quick , ' that is , cut to the living flesh , where it can feel . "
" once i read in a fable , " said <name> , " of a horse being stung to the quick . "
" what , by a hornet ? "
said <name> .
" no , " said <name> , " by something the ass said . "
" o , yes , " said madam <name> , " that means it hurt his feelings .
if a <name> should sting any body so that the sting should only go into the skin , it would not hurt much ; but if it should go in deep , so as to give great pain , we should say it stung to the quick , that is , to the part which has life and feeling .
so i suppose that something that the ass said , hurt the horse 's feelings . "
" what was it , <name> , that the ass said ? "
asked <name> .
" why  he said , i believe that the horse was proud , or something like that . "
" no matter about that fable now , " said their mother ; " you understand the meaning of the verse .
it was written to good men ; it says that god gave them life and feeling , when they were dead in <unk> and sins .
but i must first tell you what dead means . "
" o , we know what <unk> ' means , well enough , " said <name> .
" perhaps not exactly what it means here , " said madam <name> .
" dead means here insensible . "
" but i do n't know what insensible means , " said <name> .
" i <name> explain it to you , " said she .
" once there were two boys who quarreled in the recess at school ; and the teacher decided that for their punishment they should be publicly reproved before all the scholars .
so , after school , they were required to stand up in their places , and listen to the reprimand .
while they were standing , and the teacher was telling them that they had done very wrong ,  had indulged bad passions , and displeased god , and destroyed their own happiness , and brought disgrace upon the school ,  one of them stood up with a bold and careless air , while the teacher was speaking , and afterwards when he took his seat , looked round to the other scholars , and laughed .
the other boy <name> his head , and looked very much ashamed ; and as the teacher had finished what he was saying , he sunk into his seat , put his head down upon his desk before him , and burst into tears .
now , the first one was insensible , or as it is called in this text , dead to all sense of shame .
the other was alive to it .
you understand now ? "
" yes , mother , " said the boys .
the party walked on for a short time in silence , admiring the splendid and beautiful scenery which was presented to view , in the setting sun , and the calm <unk> which reigned around .
suddenly <name> , seeing a beautiful <name> growing in a border , as they were walking by , stopped to gather it .
madam <name> was afraid that he was not attending to what she was saying .
" now , <name> , " said she , " that 's a very pretty <name> ; but suppose you should go and hold it before <unk> .
do you suppose he would care any thing about it ? "
<unk> was a great dog that belonged to madam <name> .
" no , grandmother , " said <name> , " i do n't think he would . "
" and suppose you were to go and <name> him on his head , and tell him he was a good dog , would he care any thing about that ? "
" yes , " said <name> ; " he would jump , and wag his tail , and almost laugh . "
" then you see , boys , that <unk> is <unk> ' and alive to praise ; but to beauty of colour , and form he is insensible , and as it were , dead .
the beauty makes no impression upon him at all , he is stupid and lifeless , so far as that is concerned .
" now , what is meant by men being dead in <unk> and sins is , that they are thus insensible to god 's goodness , and their duty to love and obey him .
suppose , now , i was to go out into the street , and find some boys talking harshly and roughly to one another , as boys often do in their plays ; and suppose they were boys that i knew , so that it was proper for me to give them advice ; now , if i were to go and tell them that it was the law of god that they should be kind to one another , and that they ought to be so , and thus obey and please him , what effect do you think it would have ? "
" they would not mind it very much , " said <name> .
" i expect that they would though , " said <name> .
" i do n't think that they would mind it much myself .
each one wants to have his own way , and to seek his own pleasures , and they do not see the excellence of obeying and pleasing god at all .
it seems to me a very excellent thing for boys to try to please god , but i know very well that most boys care no more about it than <unk> would for your <name> , <name> .
in respect to god they are insensible and dead ; dead in <unk> and sins , and the only <name> for them is , that god <name> <unk> them ; that is , give them life and feeling ; and then , if i say just the same things to them , they <name> listen seriously and attentively , and <name> really <name> to please god .
as it is now with almost all boys , they are so insensible and dead to all sense of regard to god , that when we want to influence them to do their duty , we must appeal to some other motive ; something that they have more sensibility to .
" for example , you remember the other day when you went a <unk> with <name> <name> . "
" yes , " said <name> .
" now , i recollect that i thought there was great danger that you might be troublesome to <name> <name> , or to some others of the party ; and i wanted to say something to you before you went , to make you a good boy .
the highest and best motive would have been for me to say , 'now , <name> , remember and do what is right to-day .
the trees and fields , and pleasant <name> ; the flowers and the strawberries , your own health and strength , and joyous feelings , all come from god ; the whole scene that you are going to enjoy to-day , he has contrived for you , and now he <name> watch over you all the time , and be pleased if he sees you careful and conscientious in doing right all day .
now , be a good boy , for the sake of pleasing him . '
suppose i had said that to you , do you think it would have made you a good boy ? "
<name> held down his head , and said , hesitatingly , that he did not think it would .
" that motive would have been piety .
if a boy takes pains to do what is right , and avoid what is wrong , because he is grateful to god , and wishes to please him , it is piety .
but i was afraid that would not have much influence with you , and so i tried to think of some other motive .
i thought of filial affection next . "
" what is that ? "
said <name> .
" filial affection is a boy 's love for his father or mother , " replied madam <name> .
" i said to myself , how <name> it do to appeal to <unk> filial affection , to-day ?
i can say to him , 'now , <name> , be a good boy to-day , to please me .
i shall be very happy to-night if <name> <name> comes home and says that you have been kind , and gentle and yielding all day . '
but then , on reflection , i thought that that motive would not be powerful enough .
i knew you had at least some <name> to please me , but i had some doubt whether it would be enough to <name> you through all the temptations of the whole day .
do you recollect what i did say to you , <name> ? "
" yes , mother , " replied <name> , " you told me just before i went away , that if i was a good , pleasant boy , <name> <name> would want to take me again some day . "
" yes , and what principle in your heart was that appealing to ? "
<name> did not answer .
<name> said , " selfishness . "
" yes , " said his mother ; " or rather not selfishness , but <unk> .
selfishness means not only a <name> for our own happiness , but injustice towards others .
it would have been wrong for me to have appealed to <name> 's selfishness , as that would have been encouraging a bad passion ; but it was right for me to appeal to his <unk> , that is , to shew him how his own future enjoyment would depend upon his being a good boy that day .
" now , <name> , do you think that what i said had any influence over you that day ? "
" yes , mother , " said <name> , " i think it did .
i thought of it a good many times . "
" would it have had as much influence if i had asked you to be a good boy only to please me ? "
<name> acknowledged that he did not think it would .
" do you think it would have had as much influence if i had asked you to do right to please god ? "
" no , mother , " said <name> .
" do you think that would have had any influence at all ? "
<name> seemed at a loss , and said he did n't know .
" do you think it would ? "
said <name> .
" why , yes , " said madam <name> , though she spoke in rather a doubtful tone .
" i rather think it would have had some influence  not much , but some .
he would not have thought of it very often , but still , i rather think , at least i <name> , that <name> has some <name> to please god , and that it now and then influences him a little .
but in boys generally , i do n't think that such a motive would have any influence at all . "
" not any at all ? "
said <name> .
" why , you can judge for yourself .
do you suppose that the boys at school , and those that you meet in the street , are influenced in their conduct every day , by any <name> to please god ? "
" why , nobody tells them , " said <name> .
" o , yes , they have been told over and over again , at church , and in the sabbath school , till they are tired of hearing it . "
the boys were silent , and the whole party walked along very slowly , for several steps ; and then <name> said that he thought that though the boys were pretty bad , he did not think they were quite so bad as they would be , if they did not hear any thing about god .
he said it seemed to him that it had some influence upon them .
" o , yes , " said madam <name> , " i have no doubt that what is said to them about their duty to god has a very important influence over them in various ways .
religious instruction produces a great many good effects upon the conduct of boys and men , even where it does not awaken any genuine love for god , and honest <name> to please him .
that is a peculiar feeling .
i <name> tell you . "
so saying , madam <name> paused , and seemed a moment to be lost in thought .
the whole party had by this time gone almost the whole round of the walk , and were now slowly sauntering towards the house and as madam <name> said those last words , they were just passing along by the side of the <name> declivity at the back of the garden .
madam <name> looked upon the rocks , and saw a beautiful little <unk> growing there in a crevice , and hanging over at the top .
" what a beautiful <unk> there is ! "
said she .
" where ? "
said the boys , looking around .
" there , " said she , " just by the side of the little <unk> .
how <name> <name> would admire it . "
" i 'll climb up and get it for her , " said <name> .
" i 'll have it in a minute . "
he dropped his mother 's hand , and began scrambling up the rocks .
they were jagged and irregular fragments , with bushes and trees among them , and <name> , who was a very expert climber , soon had the <unk> in his hand , and was coming down delighted with his prize .
he brought the leaves of the plant with it , and it was in fact an elegant little flower .
" now , <name> , " said madam <name> , as they walked along again , <name> holding his flower very carefully in his hand , " notice this feeling you have towards <name> <name> , which led you to get the flower .
it was not fear of her ,  it was not <name> of getting any reward from her , i suppose . "
" no , indeed , mother , " said <name> .
" it was simply a <name> to give her pleasure .
when you go in , you <name> take a pleasure yourself in going to her , and gratifying her with the present .
now , do you suppose that the boys generally have any such feeling as that towards god ? "
" no , mother , " said <name> , " i do n't think they have . "
" nor do i .
they are dead to all such feelings .
they take no pleasure in pleasing god .
they do n't like to think of him , and i do n't see that they shew any signs of having any love for him at all . "
they walked along , after this , silently .
<name> saw how destitute of love to god his heart had been , and still was ; and yet he could not help thinking that he did sometimes feel a little grateful to god for all his kindness and care ; and at least some faint desires to please him .
it was nearly dark when they arrived at the house ; and <name> asked his mother to let him run and give <name> <name> her <unk> .
she was very much pleased with it indeed .
she arranged it and the leaves that <name> had brought with it , so as to give the whole group a graceful form , and put it in water , saying she meant to rise early the next morning to paint it .
<name> determined that he would get up too and see her do it .
chapter xiii .
the junk .
a few days after this , when <name> and <name> were at work one evening upon their mole , and <name> was playing near , sometimes helping a little and sometimes looking on , <name> <name> came down to see them .
they had nearly finished the <unk> and were trying to contrive some way to fasten up their flag-staff at the end .
" we ca n't drive the flag-staff down into our mole , " said <name> , looking up with an anxious and perplexed expression to <name> <name> , " for it is all stony . "
" could n't you drive it down into the bottom of the <name> , and then build your mole up all around it ? "
said <name> <name> .
" no , " said <name> , " the bottom of the <name> is stony too . "
" it looks <name> , " said <name> <name> , looking down through the water to the bottom of the <name> .
" no , it is very hard and stony under the sand , and we can not drive any thing down at all . "
" well , " said <name> <name> , " go on with your work , and i <name> sit down upon the bank and consider what you can do . "
after some time , <name> <name> proposed that the boys should go up to the <unk> and get a short log of wood , which had one end sawed off square , and roll it down to the mole .
then that they should dig out a little hole in the bottom of the <name> with a hoe , so deep that when they put in the log , the upper end would be a little above the surface of the mole .
then she said they might put in the log , with the sawed end uppermost , and while one boy held it steady , the other might throw in stones and sand all around it till it was secure in its place .
then they could build the mole a little beyond it ; and thus there would be a solid wooden block , firmly fixed in the end of the mole .
" but how shall we fasten our flag-staff to it ? "
said <name> .
" why you must get an <unk> , and bore a hole down in the middle of it , and make the end of your flag-staff round so that it <name> just fit in . "
the boys thought this an excellent plan , and went off after the log .
while they were gone , <name> <name> asked <name> if he had fed his squirrel that evening , and <name> said he had not .
" had n't you better go now and feed him before it is too dark ? "
" why , no , " said <name> , " i do n't want to go now ; besides , i am going to let <name> feed him to-night .
i promised <name> that i would let him feed him sometimes . "
the truth was that <name> wanted to stay and see the boys fix their log .
he had had his squirrel now several days , and had lost his interest in him , as boys generally do in any new <unk> , after they have had it a few days .
he was really , under this show of generosity and faithful performance of his promise , only gratifying his own selfish desires , but he did not see it himself .
the heart is not only selfish and sinful , but it is deceitful ; it even <unk> itself .
so , presently , when <name> saw <name> and <name> rolling the log down from the house , he ran off to meet them , and said , " <name> you may feed my squirrel to-night , and i <name> help <name> roll down the log . "
<name> looked up with an air of indifference , and said he did not want to feed the squirrel that night .
<name> was quite surprised at the answer ; and he walked along by the side of <name> and <name> towards the mole , as they rolled the log along , scarcely knowing what to do .
he did not want to leave the poor squirrel without his supper ; and , on the other hand , he did not want to go away from the mole .
<name> <name> saw his perplexity , and she understood the reason of it .
now , it happened that <name> <name> had been forming a very curious plan about the squirrel , from the very day when he was brought home ; though she had not said any thing to the boys about it .
to <name> her plan into execution , it was necessary that the squirrel should be hers ; and she resolved from the beginning , that as soon as a convenient opportunity should offer , she would try to buy him .
she determined , therefore , to wait quietly until she saw some signs of <name> 's being tired of his squirrel , and then she determined to buy him .
she did not suppose that <name> would have got tired of the care of his squirrel quite so soon as this ; but when she found that he had , she thought that the time had arrived for her to attempt to make the purchase .
so when <name> came back to the mole , she said , " <name> , i have a great mind to go and feed your squirrel for you , if you want to stay here and help the boys to make the mole .
in fact , i should like to buy him of you , if you would like to sell him . "
" well , " said <name> , " what <name> you give me for him ? "
" let me see  what can i make you . "
and <name> <name> tried to think what she could make <name> that he would like as well as the squirrel .
she proposed first a new picture-book , and then a flag , and next her monthly rose ; and , finally , she said she would make him something or other , and let him see it , and then he could tell whether he would give his squirrel for it or not .
" i shall , i know , " said <name> , " for i can see him just as well if he is yours as i can if he is mine . "
" but perhaps i shall let him go , " said <name> <name> .
" o no , " said <name> , " you must not let him go . "
" if i buy him of you , " replied <name> <name> , " he <name> be mine entirely , and i must do whatever i please with him . "
" o , but i shall make you promise not to let him go , " said <name> , " or else i shall not want to sell him to you . "
" very well , " said <name> <name> ; " though you can tell better when you see what i am going to make you . "
<name> <name> then went up to the house , and fed the squirrel , and as it began to grow dark pretty soon after that , the boys themselves soon came up .
she asked <name> if he would make her a mast , and also a small block of wood for a step .
" a step ! "
said <name> ; " a step for what ? "
" a step for the mast , " said <name> <name> .
" what is a step for a mast ? "
" it is a block , with a hole in it for the lower end of the mast to fit into , " said <name> <name> .
" do they call it a step ? "
said <name> .
" yes , " said <name> <name> ; " i read about it in a book where i learned about rigging .
any little block <name> do . "
<name> 's curiosity was very much excited , and he begged <name> <name> to tell him what she was going to make .
" well , " said <name> <name> , " if you <name> keep the secret . "
" yes , " said <name> , " i <name> . "
" a chinese junk ! "
said <name> <name> .
" a chinese junk ! "
said <name> , with surprise and delight .
" yes , now run along to mother . "
so <name> went , and <name> <name> began to think of her work .
she happened to have recollected that there was in the <name> an old <unk> , of japanned ware , which had been worn out and thrown aside , and was now good for nothing ; and yet it was whole , and <name> <name> thought it would make a good boat .
as , however , it was not shaped like a boat , she thought she would call it a chinese junk , which is a clumsy kind of vessel , built by the chinese .
accordingly after the boys had gone to bed , she got all her materials together ; the old <unk> for the hull of the junk , some fine twine for the rigging , <name> 's mast and step , and a piece of birch bark , which she thought would represent very well the mats of which the chinese make their sails .
she carried all those things to her room , so as to have them all ready for her to go to work upon the vessel very early the next morning .
and early the next morning she did get to work .
on the whole , the craft , when finished , if it was not built exactly after the model of a real chinese junk , would sail about as well , and was as <name> .
she got it all done before breakfast , and carried it down , and hid it under some bushes near the mole .
then , after breakfast , she took the boys all down , and told <name> that she was ready to make him an offer for his squirrel .
she then went to the bushes , and taking out the junk , she went to the mole , and carrying it out to the end , she gently set it down into the water .
the boys looked on in great delight , as the junk wheeled slowly around in the great circles of the whirlpool .
<name> hesitated a good deal before he finally decided to give <name> <name> his squirrel , and he tried to <unk> with her , that is , make her agree , that she would not let him go ; but <name> <name> would not make any such agreement .
she said that if she had the little fellow at all , she must have him for her own , without any condition whatever ; and <name> , at length , finding the elegance of the chinese junk irresistible , decided to make the trade .
and now for <name> 's plan .
she liked to see the squirrel very much ; she admired his graceful movements , his beautiful grey colour , and his bushy tail , curled over his back , like a plume .
but then she did not like to have him a prisoner .
she knew that he must love a life of freedom ,  rambling among the trees , climbing up to the topmost branches , and leaping from limb to limb ; and it was painful to her to think of his being shut up in a cage .
and yet she did not like to let him go , for then she knew that in all probability he would run off to the woods , and she would see him no more .
it happened that one limb of the great elm before the house was hollow for a considerable distance up from the trunk of the tree , and there was a hole leading into this hollow limb at the crotch , where the limb grew out from the tree .
she thought that this would make a fine house for the squirrel , if he could only be induced to think so himself , and live there .
it occurred to her that she might put him in , and fasten up the hole with wires for a time , like a cage ; and she thought that if she kept him shut up there , and fed him there with plenty of nuts and corn , for a week or two , he would gradually forget his old home in the woods , and get wonted to his new one .
after thinking of several ways of fastening up the mouth of the hole , she concluded finally on the following plan .
she got some small nails , and drove them in pretty near together on each side of the hole , and then she took a long piece of fine wire , and passed it across from one to the other , in such a manner as to cover the mouth of the hole with a sort of net-work of wire .
she then got <name> to put the squirrel in through a place which she left open for that purpose , and then she closed this place up like the rest , with wires .
the squirrel ran up into the limb , and disappeared .
when the boys came and saw the ingenious cage which <name> <name> had contrived , they thought it was an excellent plan ; and they asked her if she was not afraid that when she opened the cage door , he would run off into the woods again .
she said she was very much afraid that he would , but that still there was a possibility that he might stay ; and if he should , she should often see him from her window , running about the tree , and she should take so much more pleasure in that than in seeing him shut up in a cage , that she thought she should prefer to take the risk .
she made the boys promise not to go to the hole , for fear they might frighten him , and she said she meant to feed him herself every day , with nuts and corn , and try to get him tame before she took away the wires .
the children felt a good deal of curiosity to see whether the squirrel would stay in the tree or run away , when <name> <name> should open his cage door ; and after a few days , they were eager to have her try the experiment .
but she said , no .
she wished to let him have full time to become well accustomed to his new home .
<name> <name> generally went early in the morning to feed the squirrel ,  before the boys were up .
then she fed him again after they had gone to school , and also just before they came home at night .
she knew that if she fed him when they were at home , they would want to go with her ; and it would frighten the squirrel to see so many strange faces ,  even if the boys should try to be as still as possible .
one morning , <name> <name> and the boys were down near the mole , and were talking about the squirrel .
<name> and <name> were sailing their boats , and <name> <name> was sitting with <name> upon a bench which <name> had made for his mother , close to the shore .
<name> 's junk was upon the ground by his side .
<name> asked <name> <name> when she was going to let her squirrel out .
" o , i do n't know , " said she , " perhaps in a week more . "
" a week ! "
said <name> , pushing his boat off from the shore , " i wouldn't wait so long as that . "
" why , when i first had him , you wanted to have me keep him in a cage all the time . "
" i know it , " said <name> ; " but now i want to see whether he <name> run away . "
" i would not try yet , " said <name>  " but you 'd better have a name for him , <name> . "
" i have got a name for him , " said she .
" what is it ? "
said <name> , eagerly .
" mungo . "
" mungo ! "
repeated <name> ; " i do n't think that is a very good name .
what made you think of that name ? "
" o , i heard of a traveller once , named mungo .
the whole of his name was mungo park ; but i thought mungo was enough for my squirrel . "
" he has not been much of a traveller , " said <name> .
" o , yes , " replied <name> <name> , " i think it probable he has travelled about the woods a great deal . "
" did mungo park travel in the woods ? "
" yes , in africa .
i think mungo knows his name too , " said <name> <name> .
" do you , " said <name> .
" why ? "
" why , whenever i go to feed him , " said <name> <name> , " i call mungo !
mungo !
and drop my nuts and corn down through the wires into the hole .
and now he begins to come down when he hears my voice , and the little rogue catches up a nut and runs off with it . "
" does he ? "
said <name> .
" o , i wish you would let him out .
i do n't believe he would run away . "
" not just yet , " said <name> <name> .
" but if you do n't let him out pretty soon , i shall be gone , " said <name> ; " for i am going to boston , you know , next week . "
" so you are , " said <name> <name> ; " i forgot that . "
<name> 's father and mother were coming up from boston that week , and they had written something about taking <name> back with them , when they returned .
<name> was much pleased with this idea .
he liked living in the country better than living in boston ; but still , he was very much pleased at the thought of seeing his father and mother , and his little sister , at home .
he also liked riding , and was very glad of the opportunity to ride several days in the carryall , upon the front seat with his father .
he expected that his father would let him have the whip and reins pretty often to drive .
" it is not certain , however , " continued <name> <name> , " that you <name> go to boston this summer .
mother said that perhaps you would not go until the fall , and then perhaps she would go with you , and bring you back to stay here through the <name> . "
" but i do n't want to stay here in the <name> , " said <name> .
" why not ? "
said <name> <name> .
" o , it is so cold and snowy ;  and we ca n't play any . "
" that 's a great mistake , " said <name> ; " we have fine times in the <name> . "
" why , what can you do ? "
" o , a great many things ; last <name> we dug out a house in a great <unk> under the rocks , and played in it a good deal . "
" but it must be very cold in a <unk> , " said <name> .
" o , we had a fire . "
" a fire ? "
said <name> .
" certainly , " said <name> , " we put some large stones for the fire-place , and let the smoke go out at the top . "
" but then it would melt your house down . "
" it did melt it a little around the sides , and so made it grow larger : but it did not melt it down .
we had some good boards for seats , and we could stay there in the cold days . "
" yes , " said <name> <name> , " i remember i went in one cold , <name> day , and i found you boys all snugly stowed in your <unk> , warm and comfortable , by a good blazing fire . "
" once we made some <name> in our <unk> , " said <name> .
" did you ? "
said <name> .
" yes , " said <name> ; " <name> <name> proposed the plan , and got mother to give us the molasses in a little kettle , and we put it upon three stones in our <unk> , and we boiled it all one wednesday afternoon , and when it was done , we poured it out upon the snow .
it was capital <name> . "
" i should like to see a <unk> , " said <name> , " very much . "
" then should not you like to stay here next <name> ?
and then we can make one , " said <name> .
" perhaps i could make one in boston , " said <name> .
" ho ! "
said <name> , with a tone of contempt , " you could n't make a <unk> . "
" but there are enough other boys in boston to help me , " said <name> .
" there is not any good place , " said <name> <name> , in a mild and pleasant tone .
" there is only a very small yard , and that is full of wood piles . "
" i can make it on the common , " said <name> .
" the common is large enough i can tell you . "
here <name> suddenly called out in a tone of great eagerness and delight , to look off to a little bush near them , to which he pointed with his finger .
" see !
see !
there is a squirrel !  a large grey squirrel ! "
" where ? "
said <name> , " where ?
i do n't see him . "
" hush ! "
said <name> <name> , in a low tone : " all keep perfectly still .
i'll shew him to you , <name> .
there , creeping along the branch . "
" i see him , " said <name> .
" let us catch him , and put him in with mungo . "
" i 'm afraid it is mungo , " said <name> <name> .
" mungo ! "
said <name> , with surprise .
" yes , " said <name> <name> , " it looks like him .
i am afraid he has got out of some hole , and is going away .
sit still , and we <name> see what he <name> do . "
" o , no , " said <name> , " i <name> go and catch him . "
" no , by no means , " said <name> <name> , holding <name> back , " let us see what he <name> do . "
it was mungo .
he had gnawed himself a hole , and escaped from his prison .
he did not , however , seem disposed to go away very fast .
he came down from the bush , and crept along upon the ground towards the <name> , and then finding that he could not get across very well , he ran about the grass a little while , and then went back by degrees to the tree .
he climbed up to the great branch , playing a minute or two about the grating over the hole , and then ran along out to the end of the branch , the children watching him all the time , and walking slowly along up towards the tree .
" i 'll go and get him some corn , " said <name> <name> , " and see if he <name> not come down for it to his hole , when i call him .
you stand here perfectly still , till i come back . "
so she went in and got a nut instead of corn , and put it down by the hole , calling " mungo ! "
" mungo ! "
as usual .
the squirrel came creeping down the branch , and <name> <name> left the nut upon the grating , and went away .
he crept down cautiously , seized the nut , stuffed it into his cheek , and ran off to one of the topmost branches ; and there standing upon his hind legs , and holding his nut in his <unk> , he began gnawing the shell , watching the children all the time .
the next morning , <name> <name> tore off the netting , and the squirrel lived in the tree a long while .
<name> , however , saw but little more of him at this time , for he went to boston the next week with his father .
what befell him there may perhaps be described in another book , to be called " <name> in town . "
end of <name> in the country .
poetry .
passing away .
mothers !
where are they ?  where ?
they are gone from this passing scene , gone with the dreams of <name> that were , as if they ne'er had been .
husbands !
where are they ?  where ?
the visions of life are fled ; but they live  beneath  above  in air , for spirits can ne'er be dead .
children !
where are they ?  where ?
<name> the sun or stars reply ?
nor earth , nor sea , nor air , <name> answer to the cry .
return they not with the early morn ?
where are the lost ones ?
say  gone to a land whence none return , but where ,  oh , where are they ?
dear ones !
where are they ?  where ?
they are gone from the village home ; we ponder and gaze on the empty chair , and recall the voice 's tone .
loved ones !
where are they ?  where ?
we stand by the vacant bed , on the spot where we breathed the prayer , when we raised the dying head .
the friends !
where are they ?  where ?
their spirits have left the <name> ; are they gone to weep in black despair , or to sing in eternal day ?
where are they ?
oh tell us where !
that our aching hearts may rest ; do they breathe the <name> man 's prayer , or are they among the blest ?
lost ones !
where are they ?  where ?
we ask  but we ask in vain ; the sound goes round on the waves of air , and <name> says , " where ? "
again  where are they ?  where ?

preface .
the history of the life of every individual who has , for any reason , attracted extensively the attention of mankind , has been written in a great variety of ways by a multitude of authors , and persons sometimes wonder why we should have so many different accounts of the same thing .
the reason is , that each one of these accounts is intended for a different set of readers , who read with ideas and purposes widely dissimilar from each other .
among the twenty millions of people in the united states , there are perhaps two millions , between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five , who wish to become acquainted , in general , with the leading events in the history of the old world , and of ancient times , but who , coming upon the stage in this land and at this period , have ideas and conceptions so widely different from those of other nations and of other times , that a mere <unk> of existing accounts is not what they require .
the story must be told expressly for them .
the things that are to be explained , the points that are to be brought out , the comparative degree of prominence to be given to the various particulars , <name> all be different , on account of the difference in the situation , the ideas , and the objects of these new readers , compared with those of the various other classes of readers which former authors have had in view .
it is for this reason , and with this view , that the present series of historical narratives is presented to the public .
the author , having had some opportunity to become acquainted with the position , the ideas , and the intellectual wants of those whom he addresses , presents the result of his labors to them , with the <name> that it may be found successful in accomplishing its design .

king <name> the first was born in scotland .
it may perhaps surprise the reader that an english king should be born in scotland .
the explanation is this : they who have read the history of <name> <name> of scots , <name> remember that it was the great end and aim of her life to unite the crowns of england and scotland in her own family .
<name> <name> was then <name> of england .
she lived and died unmarried .
<name> <name> and a young man named lord darnley were the next heirs .
it was uncertain which of the two had the strongest claim .
to prevent a dispute , by uniting these claims , <name> made darnley her husband .
they had a son , who , after the death of his father and mother , was acknowledged to be the heir to the british throne , whenever <name> 's life should end .
in the mean time he remained king of scotland .
his name was <name> .
he married a <name> of denmark ; and his child , who afterward was king <name> the first of england , was born before he left his native realm .
king <name> 's mother was , as has been already said , a <name> of denmark .
her name was <name> .
the circumstances of her marriage to king <name> were quite extraordinary , and attracted great attention at the time .
it is , in some sense , a matter of principle among kings and queens , that they must only marry persons of <name> rank , like themselves ; and as they have very little opportunity of visiting each other , residing as they do in such distant capitals , they generally choose their <unk> by the reports which come to them of the person and character of the different candidates .
the choice , too , is very much influenced by political considerations , and is always more or less embarrassed by negotiations with other courts , whose ministers make objections to this or that alliance , on account of its supposed interference with some of their own political schemes .
as it is very inconvenient , moreover , for a king to leave his dominions , the marriage ceremony is usually performed at the court where the bride resides , without the presence of the bridegroom , he sending an embassador to act as his representative .
this is called being married by proxy .
the bride then comes to her <name> husband's dominions , accompanied by a great escort .
he meets her usually on the frontiers ; and there she sees him for the first time , after having been married to him some weeks by proxy .
it is true , indeed , that she has generally seen his picture , that being usually sent to her before the marriage contract is made .
this , however , is not a matter of much consequence , as the personal <unk> of a <name> have generally very little to do with the question of her marriage .
now king <name> had concluded to propose for the oldest daughter of the king of denmark and he entered into negotiations for this purpose .
this plan , however , did not please the government of england , and <name> , who was then the english <name> , managed so to embarrass and interfere with the scheme , that the king of denmark gave his daughter to another claimant .
<name> was a man of very mild and quiet temperament , easily counteracted and thwarted in his plans ; but this disappointment aroused his energies , and he sent a splendid embassy into denmark to demand the king 's second daughter , whose name was <name> .
he prosecuted this suit so vigorously that the marriage articles were soon agreed to and signed .
<name> embarked and set sail for scotland .
the king remained there , waiting for her arrival with great impatience .
at length , instead of his bride , the news came that the fleet in which <name> had sailed had been dispersed and driven back by a storm , and that <name> herself had landed on the coast of norway .
<name> immediately conceived the design of going himself in pursuit of her .
but knowing very well that all his ministers and the officers of his government would make endless objections to his going out of the country on such an errand , he kept his plan a profound secret from them all .
he ordered some ships to be got ready privately , and provided a suitable train of attendants , and then embarked without letting his people know where he was going .
he sailed across the <name> ocean to the town in norway where his bride had landed .
he found her there , and they were married .
her brother , who had just succeeded to the throne , having received intelligence of this , invited the young couple to come and spend the <name> at his capital of copenhagen ; and as the season was far advanced , and the sea <name> , king <name> concluded to accept the invitation .
they were received in copenhagen with great pomp and parade , and the <name> was spent in festivities and rejoicings .
in the spring he brought his bride to scotland .
the whole world were astonished at the performance of such an exploit by a king , especially one of so mild , quiet , and grave a character as that which <name> had the credit of possessing .
young <name> was very weak and feeble in his infancy .
it was feared that he would not live many hours .
the rite of baptism was immediately performed , as it was , in those days , considered essential to the salvation of a child dying in infancy that it should be baptized before it died .
notwithstanding the fears that were at first felt , <name> lingered along for some days , and gradually began to acquire a little strength .
his feebleness was a cause of great anxiety and concern to those around him ; but the degree of interest felt in the little sufferer 's fate was very much less than it would have been if he had been the oldest son .
he had a brother , <name> <name> , who was older than he , and , consequently , heir to his father 's crown .
it was not probable , therefore , that <name> would ever be king ; and the importance of every thing connected with his birth and his welfare was very much diminished on that account .
it was only about two years after <name> 's birth that <name> <name> died , and king <name> succeeded to the english throne .
a messenger came with all speed to scotland to announce the fact .
he rode night and day .
he arrived at the king 's palace in the night .
he gained admission to the king 's chamber , and , kneeling at his bedside , proclaimed him king of england .
<name> immediately prepared to bid his scotch subjects farewell , and to proceed to england to take possession of his new realm .
<name> <name> was to follow him in a week or two , and the other children , <name> and <name> ; but <name> was too feeble to go .
in those early days there was a prevailing belief in scotland , and , in fact , the opinion still lingers there , that certain persons among the old highlanders had what they called the gift of the second sight  that is , the power of foreseeing futurity in some mysterious and incomprehensible way .
an incident is related in the old histories connected with <name> 's infancy , which is a good illustration of this .
while king <name> was preparing to leave scotland , to take possession of the english throne , an old highland laird came to bid him farewell .
he gave the king many parting counsels and good wishes , and then , overlooking the older brother , <name> <name> , he went directly to <name> , who was then about two years old , and bowed before him , and kissed his hand with the greatest appearance of regard and veneration .
king <name> undertook to correct his supposed mistake , by telling him that that was his second son , and that the other boy was the heir to the crown .
" no , " said the old laird , " i am not mistaken .
i know to whom i am speaking .
this child , now in his <unk> arms , <name> be greater than his brother .
this is the one who is to convey his father 's name and titles to succeeding generations . "
this prediction was fulfilled ; for the robust and healthy <name> died , and the feeble and <unk> <name> lived and grew , and succeeded , in due time , to his father 's throne .
now inasmuch as , at the time when this prediction was uttered , there seemed to be little human probability of its fulfillment , it attracted attention ; its unexpected and startling character made every one notice and remember it ; and the old laird was at once an object of interest and wonder .
it is probable that this <name> to excite the admiration of the <unk> , mingled insensibly with a sort of poetic enthusiasm , which a rude age and mountainous scenery always inspire , was the origin of a great many such predictions as these ; and then , in the end , those only which turned out to be true were remembered , while the rest were forgotten ; and this was the way that the reality of such prophetic powers came to be generally believed in .
feeble and uncertain of life as the infant <name> appeared to be , they conferred upon him , as is customary in the case of young princes , various titles of nobility .
he was made a duke , a <name> , an <name> , and a baron , before he had strength enough to lift up his head in his nurse 's arms .
his title as duke was duke of albany ; and as this was the highest of his nominal honors , he was generally known under that designation while he remained in scotland .
[ illustration : windsor castle . ]
when his father left him , in order to go to england and take possession of his new throne , he appointed a governess to take charge of the health and education of the young duke .
this governess was <name> <name> .
the reason why she was appointed was , not because of her possessing any peculiar qualifications for such a charge , but because her husband , sir <name> <name> , had been the messenger employed by the english government to communicate to <name> the death of <name> , and to announce to him his accession to the throne .
the bearer of good news to a monarch must always be rewarded , and <name> <unk> sir <name> for his service by appointing his wife to the post of governess of his infant son .
the office undoubtedly had its honors and <unk> , with very little of responsibility or care .
one of the chief residences of the english monarchs is windsor castle .
it is situated above london , on the thames , on the southern shore .
it is on an eminence overlooking the river and the delightful valley through which the river here <unk> .
in the rear is a very extensive park or forest , which is penetrated in every direction by rides and walks almost innumerable .
it has been for a long time the chief country residence of the british kings .
it is very spacious , containing within its walls many courts and <unk> , with various buildings surrounding them , some ancient and some modern .
here king <name> held his court after his arrival in england , and in about a year he sent for the little <name> to join him .
the child traveled very slowly , and by very easy stages , his nurses and attendants watching over him with great solicitude all the way .
the journey was made in the month of october .
his mother watched his arrival with great interest .
being so feeble and helpless , he was , of course , her favorite child .
by an instinct which very strongly <unk> the wisdom and goodness which implanted it , a mother always <unk> a double portion of her love upon the frail , the helpless , and the suffering .
instead of being wearied out with protracted and incessant calls for watchfulness and care , she feels only a deeper sympathy and love , in proportion to the infirmities which call for them , and thus finds her highest happiness in what we might expect would be a weariness and a toil .
little <name> was four years old when he reached windsor castle .
they celebrated his arrival with great rejoicings , and a day or two afterward they invested him with the title of duke of york , a still higher distinction than he had before attained .
soon after this , when he was perhaps five or six years of age , a gentleman was appointed to take the charge of his education .
his health gradually improved , though he still continued helpless and feeble .
it was a long time before he could walk , on account of some <unk> of his limbs .
he learned to talk , too , very late and very slowly .
besides the general feebleness of his constitution , which kept him back in all these things , there was an impediment in his speech , which affected him very much in childhood , and which , in fact , never entirely disappeared .
as soon , however , as he commenced his studies under his new tutor , he made much greater progress than had been expected .
it was soon observed that the feebleness which had attached to him pertained more to the body than to the mind .
he advanced with considerable rapidity in his learning .
his progress was , in fact , in some degree , promoted by his bodily infirmities , which kept him from playing with the other boys of the court , and led him to like to be still , and to retire from scenes of sport and pleasure which he could not share .
the same cause operated to make him not agreeable as a companion , and he was not a favorite among those around him .
they called him baby <name> .
his temper seemed to be in some sense <unk> by the feeling of his inferiority , and by the jealousy he would naturally experience in finding himself , the son of a king , so <unk> in athletic sports by those whom he regarded as his <unk> in rank and station .
the lapse of a few years , however , after this time , made a total change in <name> 's position and prospects .
his health improved , and his constitution began to be confirmed and established .
when he was about twelve years of age , too , his brother <name> died .
this circumstance made an entire change in all his prospects of life .
the eyes of the whole kingdom , and , in fact , of all europe , were now upon him as the future sovereign of england .
his sister <name> , who was a few years older than himself , was , about this time , married to a <name> <name> , with great pomp and ceremony , young <name> acting the part of <unk> .
in consequence of his new position as <unk> to the throne , he was advanced to new honors , and had new titles conferred upon him , until at last , when he was sixteen years of age , he was made <name> of wales , and certain revenues were appropriated to support a court for him , that he might be surrounded with external circumstances and insignia of rank and power , corresponding with his prospective greatness .
in the mean time his health and strength rapidly improved , and with the improvement came a taste for manly and athletic sports , and the attainment of excellence in them .
he gradually acquired great skill in all the exploits and performances of the young men of those days , such as shooting , riding , <unk> , and tilting at tournaments .
from being a weak , sickly , and almost helpless child , he became , at twenty , an active , athletic young man , full of life and spirit , and ready for any romantic enterprise .
in fact , when he was twenty-three years old , he embarked in a romantic enterprise which attracted the attention of all the world .
this enterprise <name> presently be described .
there was at this time , in the court of king <name> , a man who became very famous afterward as a favorite and follower of <name> .
he is known in history under the name of the duke of buckingham .
his name was originally <name> <unk> .
he was a very handsome young man , and he seems to have attracted king <name> 's attention at first on this account .
<name> found him a convenient attendant , and made him , at last , his principal favorite .
he raised him to a high rank , and conferred upon him , among other titles , that of duke of buckingham .
the other persons about the court were very envious and jealous of his influence and power ; but they were obliged to submit to it .
he lived in great state and splendor , and for many years was looked up to by the whole kingdom as one of the greatest personages in the realm .
we shall learn hereafter how he came to his end .
if the reader imagines , from the accounts which have been given thus far in this chapter of the pomp and parade of royalty , of the castles and the ceremonies , the titles of nobility , and the various insignia of rank and power , which we have alluded to so often , that the mode of life which royalty led in those days was lofty , dignified , and truly great , he <name> be very greatly deceived .
all these things were merely for show  things put on for public display , to gratify pride and impress the people , who never looked behind the scenes , with high ideas of the grandeur of those who , as they were taught , ruled over them by a divine right .
it would be hard to find , in any class of society except those reputed infamous , more low , gross , and vulgar modes of life than have been exhibited generally in the <name> palaces of europe for the last five hundred years .
king <name> the first has , among english sovereigns , rather a high character for <unk> and gravity of deportment , and purity of morals ; but the glimpses we get of the real , every-day routine of his domestic life , are such as to show that the pomp and parade of royalty is mere glittering tinsel , after all .
the historians of the day tell such stories as these .
the king was at one time very dejected and melancholy , when buckingham contrived this plan to amuse him .
in the first place , however , we ought to say , in order to illustrate the terms on which he and buckingham lived together , that the king always called buckingham <unk> , which was a contraction of <name> .
st. <name> was always represented in the catholic pictures of the saints , as a very handsome man , and buckingham being handsome too , <name> called him <unk> by way of a compliment .
<unk> called the king his dad , and used to sign himself , in his letters , " your slave and dog <unk> . "
there are extant some letters which passed between the king and his favorite , written , on the part of the king , in a style of <unk> and <unk> such that the <unk> of those days said that they were not fit to be printed .
they would not " blot their pages " with them , they said .
king <name> 's letters were more properly expressed .
to return , then , to our story .
the king was very much dejected and melancholy .
<unk> , in order to divert him , had a pig dressed up in the clothes of an infant child .
buckingham 's mother , who was a countess , <unk> the nurse , dressed also carefully for the occasion .
another person put on a bishop 's robes , satin gown , lawn sleeves , and the other <unk> ornaments .
they also provided a <unk> font , a <unk> , and other things necessary for a religious ceremony , and then invited the king to come in to attend a baptism .
the king came , and the pretended bishop began to read the service , the assistants looking gravely on , until the squealing of the pig brought all gravity to an end .
the king was not pleased ; but the historian thinks the reason was , not any objection which he had to such a profanation , but to his not happening to be in a mood for it at that time .
there was a negotiation going on for a long time for a marriage between one of the king 's sons , first <name> , and afterward <name> , and a <name> of spain .
at one time the king lost some of the papers , and was storming about the palace in a great rage because he could not find them .
at last he chanced to meet a certain scotchman , a servant of his , named gib , and , like a vexed and impatient child , who lays the charge of a lost plaything upon any body who happens to be at hand to receive it , he put the responsibility of the loss of the papers upon gib .
" i remember , " said he , " i gave them to you to take care of .
what have you done with them ? "
the faithful servant fell upon his knees , and protested that he had not received them .
the king was only made the more angry by this contradiction , and kicked the scotchman as he kneeled upon the floor .
the man rose and left the apartment , saying , " i have always been faithful to your majesty , and have not deserved such treatment as this .
i can not remain in your service under such a degradation .
i shall never see you again . "
he left the palace , and went away .
a short time after this , the person to whose custody the king had really committed the papers came in , and , on learning that they were wanted , produced them .
the king was ashamed of his conduct .
he sent for his scotch servant again , and was not easy until he was found and brought into his presence .
the king kneeled before him and asked his forgiveness , and said he should not rise until he was forgiven .
gib was disposed to evade the request , and urged the king to rise ; but <name> would not do so until gib said he forgave him , in so many words .
the whole case shows how little of dignity and <name> bearing there really was in the manners and conduct of the king in his daily life , though we are almost ready to overlook the ridiculous <unk> and folly of his fault , on account of the truly <name> frankness and honesty with which he acknowledged it .
thus , though every thing in which royalty appeared before the public was conducted with great pomp and parade , this external magnificence was then , and always has been , an outside show , without any thing corresponding to it within .
the great mass of the people of england saw only the outside .
they gazed with admiration at the spectacle of magnificence and splendor which royalty always presented to their eyes , whenever they beheld it from the distant and humble points of view which their position afforded them .
<name> <name> , on the other hand , was behind the curtain .
his childhood and youth were exposed fully to all the real influences of these scenes .
the people of england submitted to be governed by such men , not because they thought them qualified to govern , or that the circumstances under which their characters were formed were such as were calculated to form , in a proper manner , the minds of the rulers of a <name> people .
they did not know what those circumstances were .
in their conceptions they had grand ideas of <name> character and life , and imagined the splendid palaces which some saw , but more only heard of , at westminster , were filled with true greatness and <name> .
they were really filled with vulgarity , vice , and shame .
<name> was to them king <name> the first , monarch of great britain , <name> , and ireland , and <name> was <name> , <name> of wales , duke of york , and <unk> to the throne .
whereas , within the palace , to all who saw them and knew them there , and really , so far as their true moral position was concerned , the father was " old dad , " and the son , what his father always called him till he was twenty-four years old , " baby <name> . "

in order that the reader may understand fully the nature of the romantic enterprise in which , as we have already said , <name> <name> embarked when he was a little over twenty years of age , we must premise that <name> , the <name> <name> who married <name> 's sister <name> some years before , was the ruler of a country in germany called the <unk> .
it was on the banks of the rhine .
<unk> title , as ruler of this country , was <unk> <unk> .
there are a great many independent states in germany , whose sovereigns have various titles , and are possessed of various prerogatives and powers .
now it happened that , at this time , very fierce civil wars were raging between the catholics and the protestants in germany .
<name> got drawn into these wars on the protestant side .
his motive was not any <name> to promote the progress of what he considered the true <name> , but only a wish to extend his own dominions , and add to his own power , for he had been promised a kingdom , in addition to his <unk> , if he would assist the people of the kingdom to gain the victory over their catholic foes .
he embarked in this enterprise without consulting with <name> , his father-in-law , knowing that he would probably <unk> of such dangerous ambition .
<name> was , in fact , very sorry afterward to hear of <name> 's having engaged in such a contest .
the result was quite as disastrous as <name> feared .
<name> not only failed of getting his new kingdom , but he provoked the rage of the catholic powers against whom he had undertaken to contend , and they poured a great army into his own original territory , and made an easy conquest of it .
<name> fled to holland , and remained there a fugitive and an exile , hoping to obtain help in some way from <name> , in his efforts to recover his lost dominions .
the people of england felt a great interest in <name> 's unhappy fate , and were very desirous that <name> should raise an army and give him some efficient assistance .
one reason for this was that they were protestants , and they were always ready to embark , on the protestant side , in the continental quarrels .
another reason was their interest in <name> , the wife of <name> , who had so recently left england a blooming bride , and whom they still considered as in some sense pertaining to the <name> family of england , and as having a right to look to all her father 's subjects for protection .
but king <name> himself had no inclination to go to war in such a quarrel .
he was inactive in mind , and childish , and he had little taste for warlike enterprises .
he undertook , however , to accomplish the object in another way .
the king of spain , being one of the most powerful of the catholic sovereigns , had great influence in all their councils .
he had also a beautiful daughter , <name> <name> , called , as spanish princesses are styled , the infanta .
now <name> conceived the design of proposing that his son <name> should marry <name> <name> , and that , in the treaty of marriage , there should be a stipulation providing that the <unk> should be restored to <name> .
these negotiations were commenced , and they went on two or three years without making any sensible progress .
<name> <name> was a catholic , and <name> a protestant .
now a catholic could not marry a protestant without a special dispensation from the pope .
to get this dispensation required new negotiations and delays .
in the midst of it all , the king of spain , <name> <name> 's father , died , and his son , her brother , named <name> , succeeded him .
then the negotiations had all to be commenced anew .
it was supposed that the king of spain did not wish to have the affair concluded , but liked to have it in discussion , as it tended to keep the king of england more or less under his control .
so they continued to send <unk> back and forth , with drafts of treaties , articles , conditions , and stipulations without number .
there were endless discussions about securing to <name> <name> the full enjoyment of the catholic religion in england , and express agreements were proposed and debated in respect to her having a chapel , and priests , and the right to celebrate mass , and to enjoy , in fact , all the other privileges which she had been accustomed to exercise in her own native land .
<name> did not object .
he agreed to every thing ; but still , some how or other , the arrangement could not be closed .
there was always some pretext for delay .
at last buckingham proposed to <name> that they two should set off for spain in person , and see if they could not settle the affair .
buckingham 's motive was partly a sort of reckless daring , which made him love any sort of adventure , and partly a <name> to circumvent and thwart a rival of his , the <name> of bristol , who had charge of the negotiations .
it may seem to the reader that a simple journey from london to madrid , of a young man , for the purpose of visiting a <name> whom he was wishing to espouse , was no such extraordinary undertaking as to attract the attention of a spirited young man to it from love of adventure .
the truth is , however , that , with the ideas that then prevailed in respect to <name> etiquette , there was something very unusual in this plan .
the <name> and buckingham knew very well that the consent of the statesmen and high officers of the realm could never be obtained , and that their only alternative was , accordingly , to go off secretly and in disguise .
it seemed , however , to be rather necessary to get the king 's consent .
but buckingham did not anticipate much difficulty in this , as he was accustomed to manage <name> almost like a child .
he had not , however , been on very good terms with <name> , having been accustomed to treat him in the haughty and imperious manner which <name> would usually yield to , but which <name> was more inclined to resist and resent .
when buckingham , at length , conceived of this scheme of going into spain , he changed his deportment toward <name> , and endeavored , by artful <unk> , to gain his kind regard .
he soon succeeded , and then he proposed his plan .
he represented to <name> that the sole cause of the delays in settling the question of his marriage was because it was left so entirely in the hands of embassadors , <unk> , and statesmen , who involved every thing in endless mazes .
" take the affair into your own hands , " said he , " like a man .
set off with me , and go at once into spain .
astonish them with your sudden and unexpected presence .
the infanta <name> be delighted at such a proof of your ardor , courage , and devotion , and <name> do all in her power to co-operate with you in bringing the affair at once to a close .
besides , the whole world <name> admire the originality and boldness of the achievement . "
<name> was easily persuaded .
the next thing was to get the king's consent .
<name> and buckingham went to his palace one day , and watching their opportunity when he was pretty <name> with wine , <name> said that he had a favor to ask , and wished his father to promise to <name> it before he knew what it was .
<name> , after some hesitation , half in jest and half in <name> , agreed to it .
they made him promise that he would not tell any one what it was , and then explained their plan .
the king was thunderstruck ; his amazement sobered him at once .
he retracted his promise .
he never could consent to any such scheme .
buckingham here interposed with his aid .
he told the king it was perfectly safe for the <name> to go , and that this measure was the only plan which could bring the marriage treaty to a close .
besides , he said , if he and the <name> were there , they could act far more effectually than any embassadors in securing the restoration of the <unk> to <name> .
<name> could not withstand these entreaties and arguments , and he finally gave a reluctant consent to the plan .
he repented , however , as soon as the consent was given , and when <name> and buckingham came next to see him , he said it must be given up .
one great source of his anxiety was a fear that his son might be taken and kept a prisoner , either in <name> or spain , and detained a long time in captivity .
such a captive was always , in those days , a very tempting prize to a rival power .
personages of very high rank may be held in imprisonment , while all the time those who detain them may pretend not to confine them at all , the guards and sentinels being only marks of regal state , and indications of the <name> of the power into whose hands they have fallen to treat them in a manner <unk> with their rank .
then there were always , in those days , questions and disputes pending between the rival courts of england , <name> , and spain , out of which it was easy to get a pretext for <unk> any strolling <name> who might cross the frontier , as security for the fulfillment of some stipulation , or for doing some act of justice claimed .
<name> , knowing well how much <name> and honor were to be expected of kings and courts , was afraid to trust his son in french or spanish dominions .
he said he certainly could not consent to his going , without first sending to <name> , at least , for a <unk>  that is , a paper from the government , <unk> the honor of the king not to molest or interrupt him in his journey through his dominions .
buckingham , instead of attempting to reassure the king by fresh arguments and persuasions , broke out into a passion , accused him of violating his promise not to reveal their plan to any one , as he knew , he said , that this new opposition had been put into his head by some of his counselors to whom he had made known the design .
the king denied this , and was terrified , agitated , and distressed by buckingham 's violence .
he wept like a child .
his opposition at length gave way a second time , and he said they might go .
they named two attendants whom they wanted to go with them .
one was an officer of the king 's household , named <unk> , who was then in the anteroom .
they asked the king to call him in , to see if he would go .
when <unk> came in , the king accosted him with , " here 's <unk> and baby <name> that want to go to spain and fetch the infanta .
what think you of it ? "
<unk> did not think well of it at all .
there followed a new relapse on the part of the king from his consent , a new storm of anger from buckingham , more sullen obstinacy on the part of <name> , with profane <unk> and recriminations one against another .
the whole scene was what , if it had occurred any where else than in a palace , would have been called a <unk> .
it ended , as <unk> usually do , in the triumph of the most unreasonable and violent .
<name> threw himself upon a bed which was in the room , weeping bitterly , and saying that they would go , and he should lose his baby <name> .
considering that <name> was now the monarch 's only child remaining at home , and that , as heir to the crown , his life was of great consequence to the realm , it is not surprising that his father was distressed at the idea of his exposing himself to danger on such an expedition ; but one not accustomed to what is behind the scenes in <name> life would expect a little more dignity and propriety in the mode of expressing paternal solicitude from a king .
<name> and buckingham set off secretly from london ; their two attendants were to join them in different places  the last at dover , where they were to embark .
they laid aside all marks of distinction in dress , such as persons of high rank used to wear in those days , and took the garb of the common people .
they put on <unk> , also , the hair of which was long , so as to shade the face and alter the expression of their countenances .
these external disguises , however , were all that they could command .
they could not assume the modest and quiet air and manner of persons in the ordinary walks of life , but made such displays , and were so liberal in the use of their money , and carried such an air and manner in all that they did and said , that all who had any intercourse with them perceived that they were in disguise .
they were supposed to be wild blades , out on some frolic or other , but still they were allowed to pass along without any molestation .
they were , however , stopped at dover , where in some way they attracted the attention of the mayor of the town .
dover is on the channel , opposite to calais , at the narrowest point .
it was , of course , especially in those days , the point where the principal intercourse between the two nations centered .
the magistrates of the two towns were obliged , consequently , to be on the alert , to prevent the escape of fugitives and criminals , as well as to guard against the efforts of smugglers , or the entrance of spies or other secret enemies .
the mayor of dover arrested our heroes .
they told him that their names were <name> smith and <name> smith ; these , in fact , were the names with which they had traveled through england thus far .
they said that they were traveling for amusement .
the mayor did not believe them .
he thought they were going across to the french coast to fight a duel .
this was often done in those days .
they then told him that they were indeed persons of rank in disguise , and that they were going to inspect the english fleet .
he finally allowed them to embark .
on landing at calais , they traveled post to <name> , strictly preserving their incognito , but assuming such an air and bearing as to create the impression that they were not what they pretended .
when they reached <name> , buckingham could not resist the temptation of showing <name> a little of life , and he contrived to get admitted to a party at court , where <name> saw , among other ladies who attracted his attention , the <name> <name> .
he was much struck with her beauty and <name> , but he little thought that it was this <name> , and not the infanta whom he was going in pursuit of , who was really to become his wife , and the future <name> of england .
the young travelers thought it not prudent to remain long in <name> , and they accordingly left that city , and pressed forward as rapidly as possible toward the spanish frontier .
they managed , however , to conduct always in such a way as to attract attention .
although they were probably sincerely desirous of not having their true rank and character known , still they could not resist the temptation to assume such an air and bearing as to make people wonder who they were , and thus increase the spirit and adventure of their journey .
at <unk> they received invitations from some grandees to be present at some great <name> , but they declined , saying that they were only poor gentlemen traveling to inform their minds , and were not fit to appear in such <name> assemblies .
at last they approached madrid .
they had , besides <unk> , another attendant who spoke the spanish language , and served them as an interpreter .
they separated from these two the day before they entered madrid , so as to attract the less attention .
their attendants were to be left behind for a day , and afterward were to follow them into the city .
the british embassador at madrid at this time was the <name> of bristol .
he had had charge of all the negotiations in respect to the marriage , and to the restoration of the <unk> , and believed that he had brought them almost to a successful termination .
he lived in a palace in madrid , and , as is customary with the embassadors of great powers at the courts of great powers , in a style of the highest pomp and splendor .
buckingham took the <name> directly to bristol 's house .
bristol was utterly confounded at seeing them .
nothing could be worse , he said , in respect to the completion of the treaty , than the <name> 's presence in madrid .
the introduction of so new and extraordinary an element into the affair would undo all that had been done , and lead the king of spain to begin anew , and go over all the ground again .
in speaking of this occurrence to another , he said that just as he was on the point of coming to a satisfactory conclusion of his long negotiations and toils , a demon in the shape of <name> <name> came suddenly upon the stage to thwart and defeat them all .
the spanish court was famous in those days  in fact , it has always been famous  for its <unk> attention to etiquette and parade ; and as soon as the <name> 's arrival was known to the king , he immediately began to make preparations to welcome him with all possible pomp and ceremony .
a great procession was made through the <unk> , which is a street in madrid famous for <unk> , processions , and public displays of all kinds .
in moving through the city on this occasion , the king and <name> <name> walked together , the monarch thus treating the <name> as his equal .
there was a great canopy of state borne over their heads as they moved along .
this canopy was supported by a large number of persons of the highest rank .
the streets , and the windows and balconies of the houses on each side , were thronged with spectators , dressed in the <name> and splendid court dresses of those times .
when they reached the end of the route , and were about to enter the gate of the palace , there was a delay to decide which should enter first , the king and the <name> each insisting on giving the precedence to the other .
at last it was settled by their both going in together .
if the <name> thus , on the one hand , derived some benefit in the gratification of his pride by the spanish etiquette and parade , he suffered some inconvenience and disappointment from it , on the other hand , by its excluding him from all intercourse or acquaintance with the infanta .
it was not proper for the young man to see or to speak to the young <name> , in such a case as this , until the arrangements had been more fully matured .
the formalities of the engagement must have proceeded beyond the point which they had yet reached , before the bridegroom could be admitted to a personal interview with the bride .
it is true , he could see her in public , where she was in a crowd , with other ladies of the court , and where he could have no communication with her ; but this was all .
they arranged it , however , to give <name> as many opportunities of this kind as possible .
there were shows , in which the <name> could see the infanta among the spectators ; and they arranged <unk> and <unk> at the ring , and other athletic sports , such as <name> excelled in , and let him perform his exploits in her presence .
his rivals in these contests did not have the <unk> to conquer him , and his performances excited expressions , at least , of universal admiration .
but the <name> and buckingham did not very willingly submit to the stiffness and formality of the spanish court .
as soon as they came to feel a little at home , they began to act with great freedom .
at one time the <name> learned that the infanta was going , early in the morning , to take a walk in some private pleasure grounds , at a country house in the neighborhood of madrid , and he conceived the design of gaining an interview with her there by stealth .
he accordingly repaired to the place , got admitted in some way within the precincts of the palace , and contrived to clamber over a high wall which separated him from the grounds in which the infanta was walking , and so let himself down into her presence .
the accounts do not state whether she herself was pleased or alarmed , but the officer who had her in charge , an old nobleman , was very much alarmed , and begged the <name> to retire , as he himself would be subject to a very severe punishment if it were known that he had allowed such an interview .
finally they opened the door , and the <name> went out .
many people were pleased with this and similar adventures of the <name> and of buckingham , but the leading persons about the court were displeased with them .
their precise and formal notions of propriety were very much shocked by such <unk> .
besides , it was soon found that the characters of these <unk> visitors , especially that of buckingham , were corrupt , and their lives very irregular .
buckingham was accustomed to treat king <name> in a very bold , familiar , and imperious manner , and he fell insensibly into the same habits of intercourse with those about him in spain .
the little reserve and caution which he manifested at first soon wore off , and he began to be very generally disliked .
in the mean time the negotiation was , as bristol had expected , very much put back by the <name> 's arrival .
the king of spain formed new plans , and thought of new conditions to impose .
the catholics , too , thought that <unk> coming thus into a catholic country , indicated some leaning , on his part , toward the catholic <name> .
the pope actually wrote him a long letter , the object of which was to draw him off from the ranks of <unk> .
<name> wrote a civil , but rather an <unk> reply .
in the mean time , king <name> wrote childish letters from time to time to his two dear boys , as he called them , and he sent them a great many presents of jewelry and splendid dresses , some for them to wear themselves , and some for the <name> to offer as gifts to the infanta .
among these , he describes , in one of his letters , a little mirror , set in a case which was to be worn <name> at the girdle .
he wrote to <name> that when he gave this mirror to the infanta , he must tell her that it was a picture which he had had imbued with magical virtue by means of incantations and charms , so that whenever she looked into it , she would see a portrait of the most beautiful <name> in england , <name> , or spain .
at last the great obstacle in the way of the conclusion of the treaty of marriage , which consisted in the delays and difficulties in getting the pope 's dispensation , was removed .
the dispensation came .
but then the king of spain wanted some new <unk> in respect to the privileges of catholics in england , under pretense of securing more perfectly the rights of the infanta and of her attendants when they should have arrived in that country .
the truth was , he probably wished to avail himself of the occasion to gain some foothold for the catholic <name> in england , which country had become almost entirely protestant .
at length , however , all obstacles seemed to be removed , and the treaty was signed .
the news of it was received with great <name> in england , as it seemed to secure a permanent alliance between the two powerful countries of england and spain .
great celebrations took place in london , to do honor to the occasion .
a chapel was built for the infanta , to be ready for her on her arrival ; and a fleet was fitted out to convey her and her attendants to her new home .
in the mean time , however , although the king had signed the treaty , there was a strong party formed against the marriage in spain .
buckingham was hated and despised .
<name> , they saw , was almost entirely under his influence .
they said they would rather see the infanta in her grave than in the hands of such men .
buckingham became irritated by the hostility he had awakened , and he determined to break off the match entirely .
he wrote home to <name> that he did not believe the spanish court had any intention of carrying the arrangement really into effect ; that they were <unk> the affair on every possible pretext , and that he was really afraid that , if the <name> were to attempt to leave the country , they would interpose and detain him as a prisoner .
king <name> was very much alarmed .
he wrote in the greatest trepidation , urging " the lads " to come away immediately , leaving a proxy behind them , if necessary , for the <unk> of the marriage .
this was what buckingham wanted , and he and the <name> began to make preparations for their departure .
the king of spain , far from interposing any obstacles in the way , only treated them with greater and higher marks of respect as the time of their separation from his court <name> nigh .
he arranged great and pompous ceremonies to honor their departure .
he accompanied them , with all the grandees of the court , as far as to the <unk> , which is a famous <name> palace not far from madrid , built and furnished in the most sumptuous style of magnificence and splendor .
here they had parting feasts and celebrations .
here the <name> took his leave of the infanta , bristol serving as interpreter , to translate his parting speeches into spanish , so that she could understand them .
from the <unk> the <name> and buckingham , with a great many english noblemen who had followed them to madrid , and a great train of attendants , traveled toward the seacoast , where a fleet of vessels were ready to receive them .
[ illustration : the <unk> . ]
they embarked at a port called st. <name> .
they came very near being lost in a storm of mist and rain which came upon them while going out to the ships , which were at a distance from the shore , in small boats provided to convey them .
having escaped this danger , they arrived safely at portsmouth , the great landing point of the british navy on the southern shores of england , and thence proceeded to london .
they sent back orders that the proxy should not be used , and the match was finally abandoned , each party accusing the other of <unk> and bad <name> .
king <name> was however , very glad to get his son safe back again , and the people made as many bonfires and illuminations to celebrate the breaking up of this catholic match , as they had done before to do honor to its supposed completion .
as all <name> of recovering the <unk> by negotiation was now past , the king began to prepare for the attempt to conquer it by force of arms .

king <name> made slow progress in his military preparations .
he could not raise the funds without the action of parliament , and the houses were not in very good humor .
the expenses of the <name> 's visit to spain had been enormous , and other charges , arising out of the pomp and splendor with which the arrangements of the court were maintained , gave them a strong feeling of discontent .
they had other grievances of which they were disposed to complain , and they began to look upon this war , notwithstanding its protestant character , as one in which the king was only striving to recover his son-in-law 's dominions , and , consequently , as one which pertained more to his personal interests than to the public welfare of the realm .
while things were in this state the king fell sick .
the mother of the duke of buckingham undertook to <unk> for him .
it was understood that buckingham himself , who had , in the course of the spanish enterprise , and since his return , acquired an entire ascendency over <name> , was not unwilling that his old master should leave the stage , and the younger one reign in his stead ; and that his mother shared in this feeling .
at any rate , her <unk> made the king much worse .
he had the sacrament administered to him in his sick chamber , and said that he derived great comfort from it .
one morning , very early , he sent for the <name> to come and see him .
<name> rose , dressed himself , and came .
his father had something to say to him , and tried to speak .
he could not .
his strength was too far gone .
he fell back upon his pillow , and died .
<name> was , of course , now king .
the theory in the english monarchy is , that the king never dies .
so soon as the person in whom the <name> sovereignty resides ceases to breathe , the principle of supremacy <unk> immediately in his successor , by a law of transmission entirely independent of the <name> of man .
the son becomes king by a divine right .
his being proclaimed and crowned , as he usually is , at some convenient time early in his reign , are not ceremonies which make him king .
they only acknowledge him to be so .
he does not , in any sense , derive his powers and prerogatives from these acts .
he only receives from his people , by means of them , a recognition of his right to the high office to which he has already been <unk> by the <unk> of heaven .
it <name> be observed , thus , that the ideas which prevailed in respect to the nature and province of government , were very different in england at that time , from those which are entertained in <name> at the present day .
with us , the administration of government is merely a business , transacted for the benefit of the people by their agents  men who are put in power for this purpose , and who , like other agents , are responsible to their <unk> for the manner in which they fulfill their trusts .
but government in england was , in the days of the <unk>  and it is so to a great extent at the present day  a right which one family possessed , and which entitled that family to certain <unk> , powers , and prerogatives , which they held entirely independent of any <name> , on the part of the people , that they should exercise them , or even their consent that they should do so .
the right to govern the realm of great britain was a sort of estate which descended to <name> from his ancestors , and with the possession and enjoyment of which the community had no right to interfere .
this seems , at first view , very absurd to us , but it is not particularly absurd .
<name> 's lawyers would say to any plain proprietor of a piece of land , who might call in question his right to govern the country , the king holds his crown by precisely the same tenure that you hold your farm .
why should you be the exclusive possessor of that land , while so many poor beggars are starving ?
because it has descended to you from your ancestors , and nothing has descended to them .
and it is precisely so that the right to manage the fleets and armies , and to administer the laws of the realm , has descended , under the name of sovereignty , to him , and no such political power has descended to you .
true , the farmer would reply ; but in matters of government we are to consider what <name> promote the general good .
the great object to be attained is the welfare and happiness of the community .
now , if this general welfare comes into competition with the supposed rights of individuals , arising from such a principle as hereditary succession , the latter ought certainly to yield .
but why , might the lawyer reply , should rights founded on hereditary succession yield any more readily in the case of government than in the case of property ?
the distribution of property influences the general welfare quite as much as the management of power .
suppose it were proved that the general welfare of your parish would be promoted by the division of your land among the destitute there .
you have nothing to oppose to such a proposition but your hereditary right .
and the king has that to oppose to any plan of a division of his prerogatives and powers among the people who would like to share them .
whatever may be thought of this reasoning on this side of the atlantic , and at the present day , it was considered very satisfactory in england two or three centuries ago .
the true and proper jurisdiction of an english monarch , as it had existed from ancient times , was considered as an absolute right , <unk> in each successive <unk> of the crown , and which the community could not justly interfere with or disturb for any reasons less imperious than such as would authorize an interference with the right of succession to private property .
indeed , it is probable that , with most men at that time , an inherited right to govern was regarded as the most sacred of the two .
the fact seems to be , that the right of a son to come into the place of his father , whether in respect to property , power , or social rank , is not a natural , inherent , and <unk> right , but a privilege which society accords , as a matter of convenience and expediency .
in england , expediency is , on the whole , considered to require that all three of these things , viz. , property , rank , and power , in certain cases , should descend from father to son .
in this country , on the other hand , we confine the <unk> to property , <unk> it in the case of rank and power .
in neither case is there probably any absolute natural right , but a conventional right is allowed to take its place in one , or another , or all of these particulars , according to the opinion of the community in respect to what its true interests and the general welfare , on the whole , require .
the kings themselves of this <name> race  which race includes <name> <name> of scots , the mother of the line , and <name> i. , <name> i. , <name> ii. , and <name> ii.  entertained very high ideas of these hereditary rights of theirs to govern the realm of england .
they felt a determination to maintain these rights and powers at all hazards .
<name> ascended the throne with these feelings , and the chief point of interest in the history of his reign is the contest in which he engaged with the english people in his attempts to maintain them .
the body with which the king came most immediately into conflict in this long struggle for ascendency , was the parliament .
and here american readers are very liable to fall into a mistake by considering the houses of parliament as analogous to the houses of legislation in the various governments of this country .
in our governments the chief magistrate has only to execute definite and written laws and <unk> , passed by the legislature , and which the legislature may pass with or without his consent ; and when enacted , he must be governed by them .
thus the president or the governor is , in a certain sense , the agent and officer of the legislative power of the state , to <name> into effect its decisions , and this legislative power has really the control .
by the ancient constitution of england , however , the parliament was merely a body of counselors , as it were , summoned by the king to give him their advice , to frame for him such laws as he wished to have framed , and to aid him in raising funds by <unk> the people .
the king might call this council or not , as he pleased .
there was no necessity for calling it unless he needed more funds than he could raise by his own resources .
when called , they felt that they had come , in a great measure , to aid the king in doing his <name> .
when they framed a law , they sent it to him , and if he was satisfied with it , he made it law .
it was the king who really enacted it .
if he did not approve the law , he wrote upon the parchment which contained it , " the king <name> think of it , " and that was the end .
the king would call upon them to <unk> a tax and collect the money , and would talk to them about his plans , and his government , and the aid which he desired from them to enable him to accomplish what he had himself undertaken .
in fact , the king was the government , and the houses of parliament his instruments to aid him in giving effect to his decrees .
the nobles , that is , the heads of the great families , and also the bishops , who were the heads of the various <unk> of the church formed one branch of this great council .
this was called the house of lords .
certain representatives of the counties and of the towns formed another branch , called the house of commons .
these delegates came to the council , not from any right which the counties and towns were supposed to possess to a share in the government , but simply because they were summoned by the king to come and give him their aid .
they were to serve without pay , as a matter of duty which they owed to the sovereign .
those that came from counties were called knights , and those from the towns <unk> .
these last were held in very little estimation .
the towns , in those days , were considered as mere collections of shopkeepers and tradesmen , who were looked down upon with much disdain by the haughty nobles .
when the king called his parliament together , and went in to address them , he entered the chamber of the house of peers , and the commons were called in , to stand where they could , with their heads uncovered , to hear what he had to say .
they were , in a thousand other ways , treated as an inferior class ; but still their counsels might , in some cases , be of service , and so they were summoned to attend , though they were to meet always , and deliberate , in a separate chamber .
as the king could call the parliament together at any time and place he pleased , so he could suspend or terminate their sittings at any time .
he could <unk> the action of a parliament for a time , sending the members to their homes until he should summon them again .
this was called a <unk> .
or he could dissolve the body entirely at any time , and then require new elections for a new parliament whenever he wished to avail himself of the wisdom or aid of such a body again .
thus every thing went on the supposition that the real responsibility for the government was with the king .
he was the monarch , and the real sovereignty vested in him .
he called his nobles , and a delegation from the mass of the people , together , whenever he wanted their help , and not otherwise .
he was responsible , not to them nor to the people at large , but to god only , for the acts of his administration .
the duty of parliament was limited to that of aiding him in carrying out his plans of government , and the people had nothing to do but to be obedient , submissive , and loyal .
these were , at any rate , the ideas of the kings , and all the forms of the english constitution and the ancient phraseology in which the transactions are expressed , correspond with them .
we can not give a better proof and illustration of what has been said than by <unk> the substance of one of king <name> 's messages to his parliament , delivered about the close of his life , and , of course , at the period of which we are writing .
it was as follows : " my lords spiritual and temporal , and you the commons : in my last parliament i made long discourses , especially to them of the lower house .
i did open the true thought of my heart .
but i may say with our savior , 'i have piped to you and ye have not danced ; i have mourned to you and you have not lamented ; ' so all my sayings turned to me again without any success .
and now , to tell the reasons of your calling and of this meeting , apply it to yourselves , and spend not the time in long speeches .
consider that the parliament is a thing composed of a head and a body ; the monarch and the two estates .
it was , first , a monarchy ; then , after , a parliament .
there are no parliaments but in monarchical governments ; for in <name> , the <unk> , and other free governments there are none .
the head is to call the body together ; and for the clergy the bishops are chief , for <unk> their knights , for towns and cities their <unk> and citizens .
these are to treat of difficult matters , and counsel their king with their best advice to make laws [ a ] for the <unk> and the lower house is also to petition the king and acquaint him with their grievances , and not to meddle with the king 's prerogative .
they are to offer supply for his necessity , and he to distribute , in recompense thereof , justice and <name> .
as in all parliaments it is the king's office to make good laws , whose fundamental cause is the people 's ill manners , so at this time .
[ footnote a : meaning advice to him how he shall make laws , as is evident from what is said below . ]
" for a supply to my necessities , i have reigned eighteen years , in which i have had peace , and i have received far less supply than hath been given to any king since the conquest .
the last <name> had , one year with another , above a hundred thousand pounds per annum in <unk> ; and in all my time i have had but four <unk> and six <unk> [ b ] .
it is ten years since i had a <unk> , in all which time i have been sparing to trouble you .
i have turned myself as nearly to save expenses as i may .
i have abated much in my household expenses , in my navies , and the charge of my <unk> . "
[ footnote b : species of taxes granted by parliament . ]
after speaking about the affairs of the <unk> , and calling upon the parliament to furnish him with money to recover it for his son-in-law , he adds : " consider the trade for the making thereof better , and show me the reason why my mint , these eight or nine years , hath not gone .
i confess i have been liberal in my grants ; but if i be informed , i <name> amend all <unk> grievances .
but whoever shall hasten after grievances , and <name> to make himself popular he hath the spirit of satan .
i was , in my first parliament , a novice ; and in my last , there was a kind of beasts , called <unk> , a dozen of whom undertook to govern the last parliament , and they led me .
i shall thank you for your good office , and <name> that the world may say well of our agreement . "
this kind of harangue from the king to his parliament seems not to have been considered at the time , at all extraordinary ; though , if such a message were to be sent , at the present day , to a body of legislators , whether by a king or a president , it would certainly produce a sensation .
still , notwithstanding what we have said , the parliament did contrive gradually to attain to the possession of some privileges and powers of its own .
the english people have a great deal of independence and spirit , though americans traveling there , with ideas carried from this country , are generally surprised at finding so little instead of so much .
the knights and <unk> of the house of commons , though they submitted patiently to the forms of degradation which the lords and kings imposed upon them , gradually got possession of certain powers which they claimed as their own , and which they showed a strong disposition to defend .
they claimed the exclusive right to lay taxes of every kind .
this had been the usage so long , that they had the same right to it that the king had to his crown .
they had a right too , to petition the king for a redress of any grievances which they supposed the people were suffering under his reign .
these , and certain other powers and <unk> which they had possessed , were called their privileges .
the king 's rights were , on the other hand , called his prerogatives .
the parliament were always endeavoring to extend , define , and establish their privileges .
the king was equally bent on maintaining his ancient prerogatives .
king <name> 's reign derives its chief interest from the long and insane contest which he waged with his parliament on this question .
the contest commenced at the king's accession to the throne , and lasted a quarter of a century : it ended with his losing all his prerogatives and his head .
this circumstance , that the main interest in king <name> 's reign is derived from his contest with his parliament , has made it necessary to explain somewhat fully , as we have done , the nature of that body .
we have described it as it was in the days of the <unk> ; but , in order not to leave any wrong impression on the mind of the reader in regard to its present condition , we must add , that though all its external forms remain the same , the powers and functions of the body have greatly changed .
the despised and <unk> knights and <unk> , that were not worthy to have seats provided for them when the king was delivering them his speech , now rule the world ; or , at least , come nearer to the possession of that dominion than any other power has ever done , in ancient or modern times .
they decide who shall administer the government , and in what way .
they make the laws , settle questions of trade and commerce , decide really on peace and war , and , in a word , hold the whole control , while the nominal sovereign takes rides in the <name> parks , or holds drawing-rooms in the palaces , in empty and powerless parade .
there is no question that the british house of commons has exerted a far wider influence on the destinies of the human race than any other governmental power that has ever existed .
it has gone steadily on for five , and perhaps for ten centuries , in the same direction and toward the same ends ; and whatever revolutions may threaten other elements of european power , the british house of commons , in some form or other , is as sure as any thing human can be of existence and power for five or ten centuries to come .
and yet it is one of the most remarkable of the strange phenomena of social life , that this body , standing at the head , as it really does , of all human power , <unk> patiently still to all the marks and tokens of inferiority and degradation which accompanied its origin .
it comes together when the sovereign sends <unk> , ordering the several <unk> to choose their representatives , and the representatives to assemble .
it comes humbly into the house of peers to listen to the instructions of the sovereign at the opening of the session , the members in a standing position , and with heads uncovered .
[ c ] it debates these suggestions with forms and in a phraseology which imply that it is only considering what counsel to give the king .
it <unk> nothing  it only recommends ; and it holds its existence solely at the discretion of the great imaginary power which called it into being .
these forms may , very probably , soon be changed for others more true to the facts ; and the principle of election may be changed , so as to make the body represent more fully the general population of the empire ; but the body itself <name> doubtless continue its action for a very long period to come .
[ footnote c : even in the case of a committee of conference between the two houses , the lords have seats in the <unk> and wear their hats .
the members from the commons must stand , and be uncovered during the deliberations ! ]
according to the view of the subject which we have presented , it would of course follow , as the real sovereignty was mainly in the king 's hands , that at the death of one monarch and the accession of another , the functions of all officers holding their places under the authority of the former would cease .
this was actually the case .
and it shows how entirely the parliament was considered as the instrument and creation of the king , that on the death of a king , the parliament immediately expired .
the new monarch must make a new parliament , if he wished one , to help him <name> out his own plans .
in the same manner almost all other offices expired .
as it would be extremely inconvenient or impossible to appoint anew all the officers of such a realm on a sudden emergency , it is usual for the king to issue a decree renewing the appointments of the existing <unk> of these offices .
thus king <name> , two days after his father 's death , made it his first act to renew the appointments of the members of his father's privy council , of the foreign embassadors , and of the judges of the courts , in order that the affairs of the empire might go on without interruption .
he also issued <unk> for calling a parliament , and then made arrangements for the <unk> of his father 's funeral .
[ illustration : st .
<name> 's . ]
the scene of these transactions was what was , in those days , called westminster .
minster means cathedral .
a cathedral church had been built , and an <name> founded , at a short distance west from london , near the mouth of the thames .
the church was called the west minster , and the <name> , westminster <name> .
the town afterward took the same name .
the street leading to the city of london from westminster was called the strand ; it lay along the shore of the river .
the gate by which the city of london was entered on this side was called <name> bar , on account of a building just within the walls , at that point , which was called the <name> .
in process of time , london expanded beyond its bounds and spread westward .
the strand became a magnificent street of shops and stores .
westminster was filled with palaces and houses of the nobility , the whole region being entirely covered with streets and edifices of the greatest magnificence and splendor .
westminster is now called the west end of london , though the jurisdiction of the city still ends at <name> bar .
parliament held its sessions in a building near the shore , called st. <name> 's .
the king 's palace , called st. <name> 's palace , was near .
the old church became a place of <unk> for the english kings , where a long line of them now repose .
the palace of king <name> 's wife , <name> of denmark , was on the bank of the river , some distance down the strand .
she called it , during her life , denmark house , in honor of her native land .
its name is now somerset house .
king <name> 's funeral was attended with great pomp .
the body was conveyed from somerset house to its place of repose in the <name> , and attended by a great procession .
king <name> walked as chief mourner .
two earls attended him , one on each side , and the train of his robes was borne by twelve peers of the realm .
the expenses of this funeral amounted to a sum equal to two hundred thousand dollars .
one thing more is to be stated before we can consider <name> as fairly entered upon his career , and that is the circumstance of his marriage .
his father <name> , so soon as he found the negotiations with spain must be finally abandoned , opened a new negotiation with the king of <name> for his daughter <name> <name> .
after some delay , this arrangement was concluded upon .
the treaty of marriage was made , and soon after the old king 's death , <name> began to think of bringing home his bride .
he accordingly made out a commission for a nobleman , appointed for the purpose , to act in his name , in the performance of the ceremony at <name> .
the pope 's dispensation was obtained , <name> <name> , as well as the infanta , being a catholic .
the ceremony was performed , as such ceremonies usually were in <name> , in the famous church of notre dame , where <name> 's grandmother , <name> <name> of scots , had been married to a <name> of <name> about seventy years before .
there was a great theater , or platform , erected in front of the altar in the church , which was thronged by the concourse of spectators who rushed to witness the ceremony .
the beautiful <name> was married by proxy to a man in another kingdom , whom she had never seen , or , at least , never known .
it is not probable that she observed him at the time when he was , for one evening , in her presence , on his journey through <name> .
the duke of buckingham had been sent over by <name> to conduct home his bride .
ships were waiting at boulogne , a port nearly opposite to dover , to take her and her attendants on board .
she bade farewell to the palaces of <name> , and set out on her journey .
[ d ] [ footnote d : see portrait at the commencement of this volume . ]
the king , in the mean time , had gone to dover , where he awaited her arrival .
she landed at dover on the day after sailing from boulogne , <unk> and sad .
the king received his bride , and with their attendants they went by carriages to canterbury , and on the following day they entered london .
great preparations had been made for receiving the king and his consort in a suitable manner ; but london was , at this time , in a state of great distress and fear on account of the plague which had broken out there .
the disease had increased during the king 's absence , and the alarm and anxiety were so great , that the rejoicings on account of the arrival of the <name> were omitted .
she journeyed quietly , therefore , to westminster , and took up her abode at somerset house , which had been the residence of her predecessor .
they had fitted it up for her reception , providing for it , among other conveniences , a <name> catholic chapel , where she could enjoy the services of religion in the forms to which she had been accustomed .

<name> commenced his reign in <unk> .
he continued to reign about twenty-four years .
it <name> assist the reader to receive and retain in mind a clear idea of the course of events during his reign , if we regard it as divided into three periods .
during the first , which continued about four years , <name> and the parliament were both upon the stage , contending with each other , but just at open war .
each party <unk> , and <unk> , and struggled to gain its own ends , the disagreement widening and deepening continually , till it ended in an open rupture , when <name> abandoned the plan of having parliaments at all , and attempted to govern alone .
this attempt to manage the empire without a legislature lasted for ten years , and is the second period .
after this a parliament was called , and it soon made itself independent of the king , and became hostile to him , the two powers being at open war .
this constitutes the third period .
thus we have four years spent in getting into the quarrel between the king and parliament , ten years in an attempt by the king to govern alone , and , finally , ten years of war , more or less open , the king on one side , and the parliament on the other .
the first four years  that is , the time spent in getting really into the quarrel with parliament , was buckingham 's work , for during that time buckingham 's influence with the king was paramount and supreme ; and whatever was done that was important or extraordinary , though done in the king 's name , really originated in him .
the whole country knew this and were indignant that such a man , so unprincipled , so low in character , so reckless , and so completely under the sway of his impulses and passions , should have such an influence over the king , and , through him , such power to interfere with and endanger the mighty interests of so vast a realm .
it must not be supposed , however , in consequence of what has been said about the extent of the regal power in england , that the daily care and responsibility of the affairs of government , in its ordinary administration , rested directly upon the king .
it is not possible that any one mind can even comprehend , far less direct , such an enormous complication of interests and of action as is involved in the carrying on , from day to day , the government of an empire .
offices , authorities , and departments of administration spring up gradually , and all the ordinary routine of the affairs of the empire are managed by them .
thus the navy was all completely organized , with its gradations of rank , its rules of action , its records , its account books , its offices and arrangements for <unk> and supply , the whole forming a vast system which moved on of itself , whether the king were present or absent , sick or well , living or dead .
it was so with the army ; it was so with the courts ; it was so with the general administration of the government , at london .
the immense mass of business which constituted the work of government was all <unk> and arranged , and it moved on regularly , in the hands of more or less prudent and careful men , who governed , themselves , by ancient rules and usages , and in most cases managed wisely .
every thing , however , was done in the king 's name .
the ships were his majesty 's ships , the admirals were his majesty 's servants , the war was his majesty 's war , the court was the king's bench .
the idea was , that all these thousands of officers , of all ranks and grades , were only an enormous multiplication of his majesty ; that they were to do his <name> and <name> on his administration as he would himself <name> it on were he personally capable of attending to such a vast detail ; subject , of course , to certain limits and restrictions which the laws and customs of the realm , and the promises and contracts of his predecessors , had imposed .
but although all this action was theoretically the king 's action , it came to be , in fact , almost wholly independent of him .
it went on of itself , in a regular and systematic way , pursuing its own accustomed course , except so far as the king directly interposed to modify its action .
it might be supposed that the king would certainly take the general direction of affairs into his own hands , and that this charge , at least , would necessarily come upon him , as king , day by day .
some monarchs have attempted to do this , but it is obvious that there must be some provision for having this general charge , as well as all the subordinate functions of government , attended to independently of the king , as his being always in a condition to fulfill this duty is not to be relied upon .
sometimes the king is young and inexperienced ; sometimes he is sick or absent ; and sometimes he is too feeble in mind , or too indolent , or too devoted to his pleasures , to exercise any governmental care .
there has gradually grown up , therefore , in all monarchies , the custom of having a central board of officers of state , whom the king <unk> , and who take the general direction of affairs in his stead , except so far as he chooses to interfere .
this board , in england , is called the privy council .
the privy council in england is a body of great importance .
its nature and its functions are , of course , entirely different from those of the two houses of parliament .
they represent , or are intended to represent , the nation .
the parliament is , in theory , the nation , assembled at the king 's command , to give him their advice .
the privy council , on the other hand , represents the king .
it is the king's privy council .
they act in his name .
they follow his directions when he chooses to give any .
whatever they decide upon and decree , the king signs  often , indeed , without any idea of its nature .
still he signs it , and all such decrees go forth to the word as the king 's orders in council .
the privy council , of course , would have its meetings , its officers , its records , its rules of proceeding , and its various usages , and these grew , in time , to be laws and rights ; but still it was , in theory , only a sort of expansion of the king , as if to make a kind of artificial being , with one soul , but many heads and hands , because no natural human being could possibly have capacities and powers extensive and multifarious enough for the exigencies of reigning .
<name> thus had a council who took charge of every thing , except so far as he chose to interpose .
the members were generally able and experienced men .
and yet buckingham was among them .
he had been made lord high admiral of england , which gave him supreme command of the navy , and admitted him to the privy council .
these were very high honors .
this privy council now took the direction of public affairs , attended to every thing , provided for all emergencies , and kept all the complicated machinery of government in motion , without the necessity of the king 's having any personal agency in the matter .
the king might interpose , more or less , as he was inclined ; and when he did interpose , he sometimes found obstacles in the way of immediately accomplishing his plans , in the forms or usages which had gradually grown into laws .
for instance , when the king began his reign , he was very eager to have the war for the recovery of the <unk> go on at once ; and he was , besides , very much embarrassed for want of money .
he wished , therefore , in order to save time , that the old parliament which king <name> had called should continue to act under his reign .
but his privy council told him that that could not be .
that was <unk> parliament .
if he wanted one for his reign , he must call upon the people to elect a new parliament for him .
the new parliament was called , and <name> sent them a very civil message , explaining the emergency which had induced him to call them , and the reason why he was so much in want of money .
his father had left the government a great deal in debt .
there had been heavy expenses connected with the death of the former king , and with his own accession and marriage .
then there was the war .
it had been engaged in by his father , with the approbation of the former parliament ; and engagements had been made with allies , which now they could not honorably retract .
he urged them , therefore , to <name> , without delay , the necessary supplies .
the parliament met in july , but the plague was increasing in london , and they had to adjourn , early in <name> , to oxford .
this city is situated upon the thames , and was then , as it is now , the seat of a great many colleges .
these colleges were independent of each other in their internal management , though united together in one general system .
the name of one of them , which is still very distinguished , was christ church college .
they had , among the buildings of that college , a magnificent hall , more than one hundred feet long , and very lofty , built in a very imposing style .
it is still a great object of interest to all who visit oxford .
this hall was fitted up for the use of parliament , and the king met the two houses there .
he made a new speech himself , and others were made by his ministers , explaining the state of public affairs , and gently urging the houses to act with promptness and decision .
the houses then separated , and each commenced its own deliberations .
but , instead of promptly complying with the king 's proposals they sent him a petition for redress of a long list of what they called grievances .
these grievances were , almost all of them , complaints of the toleration and encouragement of the catholics , through the influence of the king 's catholic bride .
she had stipulated to have a catholic chapel , and catholic attendants , and , after her arrival in england , she and buckingham had so much influence over the king , that they were producing quite a change at court , and gradually through all ranks of society , in favor of the catholics .
the commons complained of a great many things , nearly all , however , originating in this cause .
the king answered these complaints , clause by clause , promising redress more or less distinctly .
there is not room to give this petition and the answers in full , but as all the subsequent troubles between <name> and the people of england arose out of this difficulty of his young wife 's bringing in so strong a catholic influence with her to the realm , it may be well to give an abstract of some of the principal petitions , with the king 's answers .
the commons said : that they had understood that <unk> priests , and other catholics , were gradually creeping in as teachers of the youth of the realm , in the various <unk> of learning , and they wished to have decided measures taken to examine all candidates for such stations , with a view to the careful exclusion of all who were not true protestants .
king.  allowed .
and i <name> send to the <unk> and all the authorities to see that this is done .
<unk>  that more efficient arrangements should be made for appointing able and faithful men in the church  men that <name> really devote themselves to preaching the gospel to the people ; instead of conferring these places and salaries on favorites , sometimes , as has been the case , several to the same man .
the king made some explanations in regard to this subject , and promised hereafter to comply with this requisition .
<unk>  that the laws against sending children out of the country to foreign countries to be educated in catholic <unk> should be strictly enforced , and the practice be entirely broken up .
king.  agreed ; and he would send to the lord admiral , and to all the naval officers on the coast , to watch very carefully and stop all children attempting to go abroad for such a purpose ; and he would issue a proclamation commanding all the noblemen 's children now on the continent to return by a given day .
<unk>  that no catholic ( or , as they called him , <unk> <unk> , that is , a person refusing to subscribe to the protestant <name> , <unk> meaning person refusing ) be admitted into the king 's service at court ; and that no english catholic be admitted into the <name> 's service .
they could not refuse to allow her to employ her own french attendants , but to appoint english catholics to the honorable and lucrative offices at her disposal was doing a great injury to the protestant cause in the realm .
the king agreed to this , with some conditions and <unk> .
<unk>  that all <unk> and catholic priests , owing allegiance to the see of rome , should be sent away from the country , according to laws already existing , after fair notice given ; and if they would not go , that they should be imprisoned in such a manner as to be kept from all communication with other persons , so as not to <unk> their false religion .
king.  the laws on this subject shall be enforced .
the above are sufficient for a specimen of these complaints and of the king 's answers .
there were many more of them , but they have all the same character  being designed to stop the strong current of catholic influence and ascendency which was setting in to the court , and through the court into the realm , through the influence of the young <name> and the persons connected with her .
at the present day , and in this country , the commons <name> be thought to be in the wrong , inasmuch as the thing which they were contending against was , in the main , merely the toleration of the catholic religion .
but then the king was in the wrong too , for , since the laws against this toleration stood enacted by the consent and concurrence of his predecessors , he should not have allowed them to be <unk> and virtually annulled through the influence of a foreign bride and an unworthy favorite .
perhaps he felt that he was wrong , or perhaps his answers were all framed for him by his privy council .
at all events , they were entirely favorable to the demands of the commons .
he promised every thing .
in many things he went even beyond their demands .
it is admitted , however , on all hands , that , so far as he himself had any agency in making these replies , he was not really sincere .
he himself , and buckingham , were very eager to get supplies .
buckingham was admiral of the fleet , and very strongly desired to enlarge the force at his command , with a view to the performing of some great exploit in the war .
it is understood , therefore , that the king intended his replies as promises merely .
at any rate , the promises were made .
the commons were called into the great hall again , at christ church , where the peers assembled , and the king 's answers were read to them .
buckingham joined in this policy of attempting to conciliate the commons .
he went into their assembly and made a long speech , explaining and <unk> his conduct , and <unk> , in some sense , for what might seem to be wrong .
the commons returned to their place of deliberation , but they were not satisfied .
they wanted something besides promises .
some were in favor of granting supplies " in gratitude to his majesty for his gracious answer . "
others thought differently .
they did not see the necessity for raising money for this foreign war .
they had greater enemies at home ( meaning buckingham and <unk> ) than they had abroad .
besides , if the king would stop his waste and extravagance in bestowing honors and rewards , there would be money enough for all necessary uses .
in a word , there was much debate , but nothing done .
the king , after a short time , sent a message to them urging them to come to a decision .
they sent him back a declaration which showed that they did not intend to yield .
their language , however , was of the most humble character .
they called him " their dread sovereign , " and themselves " his poor commons . "
the king was displeased with them , and dissolved the parliament .
they , of course , immediately became private citizens , and dispersed to their homes .
after trying some ineffectual attempts to raise money by his own <name> prerogatives and powers , the king called a new parliament , taking some singular precautions to keep out of it such persons as he thought would oppose his plans .
the <name> of bristol , whom buckingham had been so jealous of , considering him as his rival , was an influential member of the house of peers .
<name> and buckingham agreed to omit him in sending out the <name> <unk> to summon the peers .
he <unk> parliament , claiming a right to his seat .
<name> then sent him his writ , but gave him a command , as his sovereign , not to attend the session .
he also selected four of the prominent men in the house of commons , men whom he considered most influential in opposition to him and to buckingham , and appointed them to offices which would call them away from london ; and as it was the understanding in those days that the sovereign had a right to command the services of his subjects , they were obliged to go .
the king hoped , by these and similar means , to diminish the influence against him in parliament , and to get a majority in his favor .
but his plans did not succeed .
such measures only irritated the house and the country .
after another struggle this parliament was dissolved too .
things went on so for four or five years , the breach between the king and the people growing wider and wider .
within this time there were four parliaments called , and , after various contentions with them , they were , one after another , dissolved .
the original subject of disagreement , viz. , the growing influence of the catholics , was not the only one .
other points came up , growing out of the king 's use of his prerogative , and his irregular and , as they thought , illegal attempts to interfere with their freedom of action .
the king , or , rather , buckingham using the king 's name , resorted to all sorts of contrivances to accomplish this object .
for instance , it had long been the custom , in case any member of the house of peers was absent , for him to give authority to any friend of his , who was also a member , to vote for him .
this authority was called a proxy .
this word is supposed to be derived from <unk> , which means action in the place of , and in behalf of , another .
buckingham induced a great number of the peers to give him their <unk> .
he did this by rewards , honors , and various other influences , and he found so many willing to yield to these inducements , that at one time he had thirty or forty <unk> in his hands .
thus , on a question arising in the house of lords , he could give a very large majority of votes .
the house , after murmuring for some time , and expressing much discontent and vexation at this state of things , finally made a law that no member of the house should ever have power to use more than two <unk> .
one of the parliaments which king <name> assembled at length brought articles of impeachment against buckingham , and a long contest arose on this subject .
an impeachment is a trial of a high officer of state for <unk> of his office .
all sorts of charges were brought against buckingham , most of which were true .
the king considered their interfering to call one of his ministers to account as wholly intolerable .
he sent them orders to dismiss that subject from their deliberations , and to proceed immediately with their work of laying taxes to raise money , or he would dissolve the parliament as he had done before .
he reminded them that the parliaments were entirely " in his power for their calling , sitting , and dissolution , and as he found their fruits were for good or evil , so they were to continue , or not to be . "
if they would mend their errors and do their duty , henceforward he would forgive the past ; otherwise they were to expect his <unk> hostility .
this language irritated instead of alarming them .
the commons persisted in their plan of impeachment .
the king arrested the men whom they appointed as managers of the impeachment , and imprisoned them .
the commons remonstrated , and insisted that buckingham should be dismissed from the king 's service .
the king , instead of dismissing him , took measures to have him appointed , in addition to all his other offices , chancellor of the university of cambridge , a very exalted station .
parliament remonstrated .
the king , in retaliation , dissolved the parliament .
thus things went on from bad to worse , and from worse to worse again ; the chief cause of the difficulties , in almost all cases , being traceable to buckingham 's reckless and arbitrary conduct .
he was continually doing something in the pursuit of his own ends , by the rash and heedless exercise of the vast powers committed to him , to make extensive and irreparable mischief .
at one time he ordered a part of the fleet over to the coast of <name> , to enter the french service , the sailors expecting that they were to be employed against the spaniards .
they found , however , that , instead of going against the spaniards , they were to be sent to <name> .
<name> was a town in <name> in possession of the protestants , and the king of <name> wished to subdue them .
the sailors sent a remonstrance to their commander , begging not to be forced to fight against their brother protestants .
this remonstrance was , in form , what is called a round <name> .
in a round <name> a circle is drawn , the petition or remonstrance is written within it , and the names are written all around it , to prevent any one 's having to take the responsibility of being the first <unk> .
when the commander of the fleet received the round <name> , instead of being offended , he inquired into the facts , and finding that the case was really as the round <name> represented it , he broke away from the french command and returned to england .
he said he would rather be hanged in england for disobeying orders than to fight against the protestants of <name> .
buckingham might have known that such a spirit as this in englishmen was not to be trifled with .
but he knew nothing , and thought of nothing , except that he wished to please and gratify the french government .
when the fleet , therefore , arrived in england , he peremptorily ordered it back , and he resorted to all sorts of pretexts and <unk> of the facts to persuade the officers and men that they were not to be employed against the protestants .
the fleet accordingly went back , and when they arrived , they found that buckingham had deceived them .
they were ordered to <name> .
one of the ships broke away and returned to england .
the officers and men deserted from the other ships and got home .
the whole armament was disorganized , and the english people , who took sides with the sailors , were extremely exasperated against buckingham for his blind and blundering recklessness , and against the king for giving such a man the power to do his mischief on such an extensive scale .
at another time the duke and the king contrived to fit out a fleet of eighty sail to make a descent upon the coast of spain .
it caused them great trouble to get the funds for this expedition , as they had to collect them , in a great measure , by various methods depending on the king 's prerogative , and not by authority of parliament .
thus the whole country were dissatisfied and discontented in respect to the fleet before it was ready to sail .
then , as if this was not enough , buckingham overlooked all the officers in the navy in selecting a commander , and put an officer of the army in charge of it ; a man whose whole experience had been acquired in wars on the land .
the country thought that buckingham ought to have taken the command himself , as lord high admiral ; and if not , that he ought to have selected his commander from the ranks of the service employed .
thus the fleet set off on the expedition , all on board burning with indignation against the arbitrary and absurd management of the favorite .
the result of the expedition was also extremely disastrous .
they had an excellent opportunity to attack a number of ships , which would have made a very <name> prize ; but the <unk> either did not know , or did not dare to do , his duty .
he finally , however , effected a landing , and took a castle , but the sailors found a great store of wine there , and went to drinking and carousing , breaking through all discipline .
the commander had to get them on board again immediately , and come away .
then he conceived the plan of going to intercept what were called the spanish galleons , which were ships employed to bring home silver from the mines in <name> , which the spaniards then possessed .
on further thoughts he concluded to give up this idea , on account of the plague , which , as he said , broke out in his ships .
so he came back to england with his fleet disorganized , demoralized , and crippled , and covered with military disgrace .
the people of england charged all this to buckingham .
still the king persisted in retaining him .
it was his prerogative to do so .
after a while buckingham got into a personal quarrel with <unk> , who was the leading manager of the french government , and he resolved that england should make war upon <name> .
to alter the whole political position of such an empire as that of great britain , in respect to peace and war , and to change such a nation as <name> from a friend to an enemy , would seem to be quite an undertaking for a single man to attempt , and that , too , without having any reason whatever to assign , except a personal quarrel with a minister about a love affair .
but so it was .
buckingham undertook it .
it was the king 's prerogative to make peace or war , and buckingham ruled the king .
he contrived various ways of <unk> ill <name> .
one was , to <unk> the mind of the king from the <name> .
he represented to him that the <name> 's french servants were fast becoming very disrespectful and insolent in their treatment of him , and finally persuaded him to send them all home .
so the king went one day to somerset house , which was the <name> 's residence  for it is often the custom in high life in europe for the husband and wife to have separate establishments  and requested her to summon her french servants into his presence , and when they were assembled , he told them that he had concluded to send them all home to <name> .
some of them , he said , had acted properly enough , but others had been rude and forward , and that he had decided it best to send them all home .
the french king , on hearing of this , seized a hundred and twenty english ships lying in his harbors in retaliation of this act , which he said was a palpable violation of the marriage contract , as it certainly was .
upon this the king declared war against <name> .
he did not ask parliament to act in this case at all .
there was no parliament .
parliament had been dissolved in a fit of displeasure .
the whole affair was an exercise of the <name> prerogative .
nor did the king now call a parliament to provide means for carrying on the war , but set his privy council to devise modes of doing it , through this same prerogative .
the attempts to raise money in these ways made great trouble .
the people resisted , and interposed all possible difficulties .
however some funds were raised , and a fleet of a hundred sail , and an army of seven thousand men , were got together .
buckingham undertook the command of this expedition himself , as there had been so much dissatisfaction with his appointment of a commander to the other .
it resulted just as was to be expected in the case of seven thousand men , and a hundred ships , afloat on the swelling surges of the english channel , under the command of vanity , recklessness , and folly .
the duke came back to england in three months , bringing home one third of his force .
the rest had been lost , without accomplishing any thing .
the measure of public indignation against buckingham was now full .
buckingham himself walked as loftily and proudly as ever .
he equipped another fleet , and was preparing to set sail in it himself , as commander again .
he went to portsmouth , accordingly , for this purpose , portsmouth being the great naval station then , as now , on the southern coast of england .
here a man named <name> , who had been an officer under the duke in the former expedition , and who had been extremely exasperated against him on account of some of his management there , and who had since found how universal was the detestation of him in england , resolved to rid the country of such a curse at once .
he accordingly took his station in the <unk> of the house where buckingham was , armed with a knife .
buckingham came out , talking with some frenchmen in an angry manner , having had some dispute with them , when <name> thrust the knife into his side as he passed , and , leaving it in the wound , walked away , no one having noticed who did the deed .
buckingham pulled out the knife , fell down , and died .
the bystanders were going to seize one of the frenchmen , when <name> advanced and said , " i am the man ; you are to arrest me ; let no one suffer that is innocent . "
he was taken .
they found a paper in his hat , saying that he was going to destroy the duke , and that he could not sacrifice his life in a nobler cause than by delivering his country from so great an enemy .
king <name> was four miles off at this time .
they carried him the news .
he did not appear at all concerned or troubled , but only directed that the murderer  he ought to have said , perhaps , the executioner  should be secured , and that the fleet should proceed to sail .
he also ordered the treasurer to make arrangements for a splendid funeral .
the treasurer said , in reply , that a funeral would only be a temporary show , and that he could hereafter erect a monument at half the cost , which would be a much more lasting memorial .
<name> acceded .
afterward , when <name> spoke to him about the monument , the treasurer replied , what would the world say if your majesty were to build a monument to the duke before you erect one for your father ?
so the plan was abandoned , and buckingham had no other monument than the universal detestation of his countrymen .

the great difficulty in governing without a parliament was the raising of funds .
by the old customs and laws of the realm , a tax upon the people could only be levied by the action of the house of commons ; and the great object of the king and council during buckingham 's life , in summoning parliaments from time to time , was to get their aid in this respect .
but as <name> found that one parliament after another withheld the grants , and spent their time in complaining of his government , he would dissolve them , successively , after exhausting all possible means of bringing them to a compliance with his <name> .
he would then be thrown upon his own resources .
the king had some resources of his own .
these were certain estates , and lands , and other property , in various parts of the country , which belonged to the crown , the income of which the king could appropriate .
but the amount which could be derived from this source was very small .
then there were certain other modes of raising money , which had been resorted to by former monarchs , in emergencies , at distant intervals , but still in instances so numerous that the king considered precedents enough had been established to make the power to resort to these modes a part of the prerogative of the crown .
the people , however , considered these acts of former monarchs as irregularities or <unk> .
they denied the king 's right to resort to these methods , and they threw so many difficulties in the way of the execution of his plans , that finally he would call another parliament , and make new efforts to lead them to conform to his <name> .
the more the experiment was tried , however , the worse it succeeded ; and at last the king determined to give up the idea of parliaments altogether , and to compel the people to submit to his plans of raising money without them .
the final dissolution of parliament , by which <name> entered upon his new plan of government , was attended with some resistance , and the affair made great difficulty .
it seems that one of the members , a certain mr. rolls , had had some of his goods seized for payment of some of the king 's irregular taxes , which he had refused to pay willingly .
now it had always been considered the law of the land in england , that the person and the property of a member of parliament were sacred during the session , on the ground that while he was giving his attendance at a council meeting called by his sovereign , he ought to be protected from molestation on the part either of his <unk> or his sovereign , in his person and in his property .
the house of commons considered , therefore , the seizure of the goods of one of the members of the body as a breach of their privilege , and took up the subject with a view to punish the officers who acted .
the king sent a message immediately to the house , while they were debating the subject , saying that the officer acted , in seizing the goods , in obedience to his own direct command .
this produced great excitement and long debates .
the king , by taking the responsibility of the seizure upon himself , seemed to bid the house defiance .
they brought up this question : " whether the seizing of mr. rolls 's goods was not a breach of privilege ? "
when the time came for a decision , the speaker , that is , the presiding officer , refused to put the question to vote .
he said he had been commanded by the king not to do it !
the house were indignant , and immediately adjourned for two days , probably for the purpose of considering , and perhaps consulting their constituents on what they were to do in so extraordinary an emergency as the king's coming into their own body and interfering with the functions of one of their own proper officers .
they met on the day to which they had adjourned , prepared to insist on the speaker 's putting the question .
but he , immediately on the house coming to order , said that he had received the king 's command to adjourn the house for a week , and to put no question whatever .
he was then about to leave the chair , but two of the members advanced to him and held him in his place , while they read some resolutions which had been prepared .
there was great confusion and clamor .
some insisted that the house was adjourned , some were determined to pass the resolutions .
the resolutions were very decided .
they declared that whoever should counsel or advise the laying of taxes not granted by parliament , or be an actor or instrument in collecting them , should be accounted an <unk> , and a capital enemy to the kingdom and commonwealth .
and also , that if any person whatever should voluntarily pay such taxes , he should be counted a capital enemy also .
these resolutions were read in the midst of great uproar .
the king was informed of the facts , and sent for the sergeant of the house  one of the highest officers  but the members locked the door , and would not let the sergeant go .
then the king sent one of his own officers to the house with a message .
the members kept the door locked , and would not let him in until they had disposed of the resolutions .
then the house adjourned for a week .
the next day , several of the leading members who were supposed to have been active in these proceedings were summoned to appear before the council .
they refused to answer out of parliament for what was said and done by them in parliament .
the council sent them to prison in the tower .
the week passed away , and the time for the <unk> of the houses arrived .
it had been known , during the week , that the king had determined on dissolving parliament .
it is usual , in dissolving a parliament , for the sovereign not to appear in person , but to send his message of dissolution by some person commissioned to deliver it .
this is called dissolving the house by commission .
the dissolution is always declared in the house of lords , the commons being summoned to attend .
in this case , however , the king attended in person .
he was dressed magnificently in his <name> robes , and wore his crown .
he would not deign , however , to send for the commons .
he entered the house of peers , and took his seat upon the throne .
several of the commons , however , came in of their own accord , and stood below the bar , at the usual place assigned them .
the king then rose and read the following speech .
the antiquity of the language gives it an air of <unk> now which it did not possess then .
" my lords ,  i never came here upon so unpleasant an occasion , it being the dissolution of a parliament .
therefore men may have some cause to wonder why i should not rather <unk> to do this by commission , it being a general maxim of kings to leave harsh commands to their ministers , themselves only executing pleasing things .
yet considering that justice as well consists in reward and praise of virtue as punishing of vice , i thought it necessary to come here to-day , and to declare to you and all the world , that it was merely the undutiful and <unk> carriage in the lower house that hath made the dissolution of this parliament .
and you , my lords , are so far from being any <unk> of it , that i take as much comfort in your dutiful demeanour , as i am justly <unk> with their proceedings .
yet , to avoid their <unk> , let me tell you , that it is so far from me to <unk> all the house alike guilty , that i know there are many there as dutiful subjects as any in the world it being but some few <unk> among them that did cast this mist of <unk> over most of their eyes .
yet to say truth , there was good number there that could not be infected with this <unk> .
" to conclude , as those <unk> must look for their reward of punishment , so you , my lords , may justly expect from me that favor and protection that a good king <unk> to his loving and faithful nobility .
and now , my lord keeper , do what i have commanded you . "
then the lord keeper pronounced the parliament dissolved .
the lord keeper was the keeper of the great seal , one of the highest officers of the crown .
of course this affair produced a fever of excitement against the king throughout the whole realm .
this excitement was kept up and increased by the trials of the members of parliament who had been imprisoned .
the courts decided against them , and they were sentenced to long imprisonment and to heavy fines .
the king now determined to do without parliaments entirely ; and , of course , he had to raise money by his <name> prerogative altogether , as he had done , in fact , before , a great deal , during the intervals between the successive parliaments .
it <name> not be very entertaining , but it <name> be very useful to the reader to peruse carefully some account of the principal methods resorted to by the king .
in order , however , to diminish the necessity for money as much as possible , the king prepared to make peace with <name> and spain ; and as they , as well as england , were exhausted with the wars , this was readily effected .
one of the resorts adopted by the king was to a system of loans , as they were called , though these loans differed from those made by governments at the present day , in being <unk> upon the whole community according to their liability to taxation , and in being made , in some respects , compulsory .
the <name> was not to be absolutely collected by force , but all were expected to lend , and if any refused , they were to be required to make oath that they would not tell any body else that they had refused , in order that the influence of their example might not operate upon others .
those who did refuse were to be reported to the government .
the officers appointed to collect these loans were charged not to make unnecessary difficulty , but to do all in their power to induce the people to contribute freely and willingly .
this plan had been before adopted , in the time of buckingham , but it met with little success .
another plan which was resorted to was the granting of what was called <unk> : that is , the government would select some important and necessary articles in general use , and give the exclusive right of manufacturing them to certain persons , on their paying a part of the profits to the government .
soap was one of the articles thus chosen .
the exclusive right to manufacture it was given to a company , on their paying for it .
so with leather , salt , and various other things .
these persons , when they once possessed the exclusive right to manufacture an article which the people must use , would abuse their power by <unk> the article , or charging enormous prices .
nothing prevented their doing this , as they had no competition .
the effect was , that the people were injured much more than the government was benefited .
the plan of granting such <unk> by governments is now universally odious .
another method of taxation was what was called tonnage and <unk> .
this was an ancient tax , assessed on merchandise brought into the country in ships , like the duties now collected at our <unk> .
it was called tonnage and <unk> because the merchandise on which it was assessed was reckoned by weight , viz. , the ton and the pound .
a former king , <name> iii. , first assessed it to raise money to suppress piracy on the seas .
he said it was reasonable that the merchandise protected should pay the expense of the protection , and in proper proportion .
the parliament in that day opposed this tax .
they did not object to the tax itself , but to the king 's <unk> it by his own authority .
however , they granted it themselves afterward , and it was regularly collected .
subsequent parliaments had granted it , and generally made the law , once for all , to continue in force during the life of the monarch .
when <name> commenced his reign , the peers were for renewing the law as usual , to continue throughout his reign .
the commons desired to <unk> the law only for a year at a time , so as to keep the power in their own hands .
the two houses thus disagreed , and nothing was done .
the king then went on to collect the tax without any authority except his own prerogative .
another mode of <unk> money adopted by the king was what was called ship money .
this was a plan for raising a navy by making every town contribute a certain number of ships , or the money necessary to build them .
it originated in ancient times , and was at first confined to seaport towns which had ships .
these towns were required to furnish them for the king 's service , sometimes to be paid for by the king , at other times by the country , and at other times not to be paid for at all .
<name> revived this plan , extending it to the whole country ; a tax was assessed on all the towns , each one being required to furnish money enough for a certain number of ships .
the number at one time required of the city of london was twenty .
there was one man who made his name very celebrated then , and it has continued very celebrated since , by his refusal to pay his ship money , and by his long and determined contest with the government in regard to it , in the courts .
his name was <name> hampden .
he was a man of fortune and high character .
his tax for ship money was only twenty shillings , but he declared that he would not pay it without a trial .
the king had previously obtained the opinion of the judges that he had a right , in case of necessity , to <unk> and collect the ship money , and hampden knew , therefore , that the decision would certainly , in the end , be against him .
he knew , however , that the attention of the whole country would be attracted to the trial , and that the arguments which he should offer , to prove that the act of collecting such a tax on the part of the king 's government was illegal and tyrannical , would be spread before the country , and would make a great impression , although they certainly would not alter the opinion of the judges , who , holding their offices by the king 's appointment , were strongly inclined to take his side .
it resulted as hampden had foreseen .
the trial attracted universal attention .
it was a great spectacle to see a man of fortune and of high standing , making all those preparations , and <unk> so great expense , on account of a refusal to pay five dollars , knowing too , that he would have to pay it in the end .
the people of the realm were convinced that hampden was right , and they applauded and honored him very greatly for his spirit and courage .
the trial lasted twelve days .
the <unk> and injustice of the tax were fully exposed .
the people concurred entirely with hampden , and even some of the judges were convinced .
he was called the patriot hampden , and his name <name> always be celebrated in english history .
the whole discussion , however , though it produced a great effect at the time , would be of no interest now , since it turned mainly on the question what the king 's rights actually were , according to the ancient customs and usages of the realm .
the question before mankind now is a very different one ; it is not what the powers and prerogatives of government have been in times past , but what they ought to be now and in time to come .
the king 's government gained the victory , ostensibly , in this contest , and hampden had to pay the money .
very large sums were collected , also , from others by this tax , and a great fleet was raised .
the performances and exploits of the fleet had some influence in <unk> the murmurs of the people .
the fleet was the greatest which england had ever possessed .
one of its exploits was to compel the dutch to pay a large sum for the privilege of fishing in the narrow seas about great britain .
the dutch had always maintained that these seas were public , and open to all the world ; and they had a vast number of fishing boats , called <unk> , that used to resort to them for the purpose of catching herring , which they made a business of preserving and sending all over the world .
the english ships attacked these fleets of <unk> , and drove them off ; and as the dutch were not strong enough to defend them , they agreed to pay a large sum annually for the right to fish in the seas in question , protesting , however , against it as an extortion , for they maintained that the english had no control over any seas beyond the bays and <unk> of their own shores .
one of the chief means which <name> depended upon during the long period that he governed without a parliament , was a certain famous tribunal or court called the <name> <unk> this court was a very ancient one , having been established in some of the earliest reigns ; but it never attracted any special attention until the time of <name> .
his government called it into action a great deal , and extended its powers , and made it a means of great injustice and oppression , as the people thought ; or , as <name> would have said , a very efficient means of <unk> his prerogative , and punishing the stubborn and rebellious .
there were three reasons why this court was a more convenient and powerful instrument in the hands of the king and his council than any of the other courts in the kingdom .
first , it was , by its ancient constitution , composed of members of the council , with the exception of two persons , who were to be judges in the other courts .
this plan of having two judges from the common law courts seems to have been adopted for the purpose of securing some sort of conformity of the <name> chamber decisions with the ordinary principles of english <unk> .
but then , as these two law judges would always be selected with reference to their disposition to <name> out the king's plans , and as the other members of the court were all members of the government itself , of course the court was almost entirely under governmental control .
the second reason was , that in this court there was no jury .
there had never been <unk> employed in it from its earliest constitution .
the english had contrived the plan of trial by jury as a defense against the severity of government .
if a man was accused of crime , the judges appointed by the government that he had offended were not to be allowed to decide whether he was guilty or not .
they would be likely not to be impartial .
the question of his guilt or innocence was to be left to twelve men , taken at hazard from the ordinary walks of life , and who , consequently , would be likely to sympathize with the accused , if they saw any disposition to oppress him , rather than to join against him with a tyrannical government .
thus the jury , as they said , was a great safeguard .
the english have always attached great value to their system of trial by jury .
the plan is retained in this country , though there is less necessity for it under our institutions .
now , in the <name> chamber , it had never been the custom to employ a jury .
the members of the court decided the whole question ; and as they were entirely in the interest of the government , the government , of course , had the fate of every person accused under their direct control .
the third reason consisted in the nature of the crimes which it had always been customary to try in this court .
it had jurisdiction in a great variety of cases in which men were brought into collision with the government , such as charges of riot , sedition , libel , opposition to the <unk> of the council , and to proclamations of the king .
these and similar cases had always been tried by the <name> chamber , and these were exactly the cases which ought not to be tried by such a court ; for persons accused of hostility to government ought not to be tried by government itself .
there has been a great deal of discussion about the origin of the term <name> chamber .
the hall where the court was held was in a palace at westminster , and there were a great many windows in it .
some think that it was from this that the court received its name .
others suppose it was because the court had cognizance of a certain crime , the latin name of which has a close affinity with the word <name> .
another reason is , that certain documents , called <unk> , used to be kept in the hall .
the prettiest idea is a sort of tradition that the ceiling of the hall was formerly ornamented with stars , and that this circumstance gave name to the hall .
this supposition , however , unfortunately , has no better foundation than the others ; for there were no stars on the ceiling in <name> 's time , and there had not been any for a hundred years ; nor is there any positive evidence that there ever were .
however , in the absence of any real reason for preferring one of these ideas over the other , mankind seem to have wisely determined on choosing the most picturesque , so that it is generally agreed that the origin of the name was the ancient decoration of the ceiling of the hall with gilded stars .
however this may be , the court of the <name> chamber was an engine of prodigious power in the hands of <name> 's government .
it aided them in two ways .
they could punish their enemies , and where these enemies were wealthy , they could fill up the treasury of the government by imposing enormous fines upon them .
sometimes the offenses for which these fines were imposed were not of a nature to deserve such severe penalties .
for instance , there was a law against turning tillage land into pasturage .
land that is tilled supports men .
land that is <unk> supports cattle and sheep .
the former were a burden , sometimes , to <unk> , the latter a means of wealth .
hence there was then , as there is now , a tendency in england , in certain parts of the country , for the landed proprietors to change their tillage land to pasture , and thus drive the peasants away from their homes .
there were laws against this , but a great many persons had done it notwithstanding .
one of these persons was fined four thousand pounds ; an enormous sum .
the rest were alarmed , and made compositions , as they were called ; that is , they paid at once a certain sum on condition of not being prosecuted .
thirty thousand pounds were collected in this way , which was then a very large amount .
there were in those days , as there are now , certain tracts of land in england called the king 's forests , though a large portion of them are now without trees .
the boundaries of these lands had not been very well defined , but the government now published decrees <unk> the boundaries , and extending them so far as to include , in many cases , the buildings and improvements of other proprietors .
they then prosecuted these proprietors for having <unk> , as they called it , upon the crown lands , and the <name> chamber assessed very heavy fines upon them .
the people said all this was done merely to get pretexts to extort money from the nation , to make up for the want of a parliament to <unk> regular taxes ; but the government said it was a just and legal mode of protecting the ancient and legitimate rights of the king .
in these and similar modes , large sums of money were collected as fines and penalties for offenses more or less real .
in other cases very severe punishments were inflicted for various sorts of offenses committed against the personal dignity of the king , or the great lords of his government .
it was considered highly important to repress all appearance of disrespect or hostility to the king .
one man got into some contention with one of the king 's officers , and finally struck him .
he was fined ten thousand pounds .
another man said that a certain archbishop had incurred the king 's displeasure by desiring some toleration for the catholics .
this was considered a slander against the archbishop , and the offender was sentenced to be fined a thousand pounds , to be whipped , imprisoned , and to stand in the <unk> at westminster , and at three other places in various parts of the kingdom .
a gentleman was following a <name> as a spectator , the hounds belonging to a nobleman .
the huntsman , who had charge of the hounds , ordered him to keep back , and not come so near the hounds ; and in giving him this order , spoke , as the gentleman alleged , so insolently , that he struck him with his riding-whip .
the huntsman threatened to complain to his master , the nobleman .
the gentleman said that if his master should justify him in such insulting language as he had used , he would serve him in the same manner .
the <name> chamber fined him ten thousand pounds for speaking so <unk> of a lord .
by these and similar proceedings , large sums of money were collected by the <name> chamber for the king 's treasury , and all expression of discontent and dissatisfaction on the part of the people was suppressed .
this last policy , however , the suppression of expressions of dissatisfaction , is always a very dangerous one for any government to undertake .
discontent , silenced by force , is exasperated and extended .
the outward signs of its existence disappear , but its inward workings become wide-spread and dangerous , just in proportion to the weight by which the <unk> is kept down .
<name> and his court of the <name> chamber rejoiced in the power and efficacy of their tremendous tribunal .
they issued proclamations and decrees , and governed the country by means of them .
they silenced all murmurs .
but they were , all the time , <unk> through the whole length and breadth of the land a deep and inveterate enmity to royalty , which ended in a revolution of the government , and the <unk> of the king .
they stopped the hissing of the steam for the time , but caused an explosion in the end .
<name> was king of scotland as well as of england .
the two countries were , however , as countries , distinct , each having its own laws , its own administration , and its own separate dominions .
the sovereign , however , was the same .
a king could inherit two kingdoms , just as a man can , in this country , inherit two farms , which may , nevertheless , be at a distance from each other , and managed separately .
now , although <name> had , from the death of his father , exercised sovereignty over the realm of scotland , he had not been crowned , nor had even visited scotland .
the people of scotland felt somewhat neglected .
they murmured that their common monarch gave all his attention to the sister and rival kingdom .
they said that if the king did not consider the scottish crown worth coming after , they might , perhaps , look out for some other way of disposing of it .
the king , accordingly , in <unk> , began to make preparations for a <name> progress into scotland .
he first issued a proclamation requiring a proper supply of provisions to be collected at the several points of his proposed route , and specified the route , and the length of stay which he should make in each place .
he set out on the 13th of may with a splendid retinue .
he stopped at the seats of several of the nobility on the way , to enjoy the hospitalities and entertainments which they had prepared for him .
he proceeded so slowly that it was a month before he reached the frontier .
here all his english servants and retinue retired from their posts , and their places were supplied by scotchmen who had been previously appointed , and who were awaiting his arrival .
he entered edinburgh with great pomp and parade , all scotland flocking to the capital to witness the festivities .
the coronation took place three days afterward .
he met the scotch parliament , and , for form 's sake , took a part in the proceedings , so as actually to exercise his <name> authority as king of scotland .
this being over , he was conducted in great state back to berwick , which is on the frontier , and thence he returned by rapid journeys to london .
the king dissolved his last parliament in <unk> .
he had now been endeavoring for four or five years to govern alone .
he succeeded tolerably well , so far as external appearances indicated , up to this time .
there was , however , beneath the surface , a deep-seated discontent , which was constantly widening and extending , and , soon after the return of the king from scotland , real difficulties gradually arose , by which he was , in the end , compelled to call a parliament again .
what these difficulties were <name> be explained in the subsequent chapters .

in getting so deeply involved in difficulties with his people , king <name> did not act alone .
he had , as we have already explained , a great deal of help .
there were many men of intelligence and rank who entertained the same opinions that he did , or who were , at least , willing to adopt them for the sake of office and power .
these men he <name> around him .
he gave them office and power , and they joined him in the efforts he made to defend and enlarge the <name> prerogative , and to <name> on the government by the exercise of it .
one of the most prominent and distinguished of these men was laud .
the reader must understand that the church , in england , is very different from any thing that exists under the same name in this country .
its bishops and clergy are supported by revenues derived from a vast amount of property which belongs to the church itself .
this property is entirely independent of all control by the people of the <unk> .
the clergyman , as soon as he is appointed , comes into possession of it in his own right ; and he is not appointed by the people , but by some nobleman or high officer of state , who has inherited the right to appoint the clergyman of that particular parish .
there are bishops , also , who have very large revenues , likewise independent ; and over these bishops is one great dignitary , who <unk> in lofty state over the whole system .
this officer is called the archbishop of canterbury .
there is one other archbishop , called the archbishop of york ; but his realm is much more limited and less important .
the archbishop of canterbury is styled the lord <unk> of all england .
his rank is above that of all the peers of the realm .
he crowns the kings .
he has two magnificent palaces , one at canterbury and one at london , and has very large revenues , also , to enable him to maintain a style of living in accordance with his rank .
he has the superintendence of all the affairs of the church for the whole realm , except a small portion pertaining to the <unk> of york .
his palace in london is on the bank of the thames , opposite westminster .
it is called <unk> palace .
[ illustration : <unk> palace . ]
the city of canterbury , which is the chief seat of his dominion , is southeast of london , not very far from the sea .
the cathedral is there , which is the archbishop 's church .
it is more than five hundred feet in length , and the tower is nearly two hundred and fifty feet high .
the magnificence of the architecture and the decorations of the building correspond with its size .
there is a large company of clergymen and other officers attached to the service of the cathedral .
they are more than a hundred in number .
the palace of the archbishop is near .
the church was thus , in the days of <name> , a complete realm of itself , with its own property , its own laws , its own legislature , and courts , and judges , its own capital , and its own monarch .
it was entirely independent of the mass of the people in all these respects , as all these things were wholly controlled by the bishops and clergy , and the clergy were generally appointed by the noblemen , and the bishops by the king .
this made the system almost entirely independent of the community at large ; and as there was organized under it a vast amount of wealth , and influence , and power , the archbishop of canterbury , who presided over the whole , was as great in authority as he was in rank and honor .
now laud was archbishop of canterbury .
king <name> had made him so .
he had observed that laud , who had been advanced to some high stations in the church by his father , king <name> , was desirous to enlarge and strengthen the powers and prerogatives of the church , just as he himself was endeavoring to do in respect to those of the throne .
he accordingly promoted him from one post of influence and honor to another , until he made him at last archbishop of canterbury .
thus he was placed upon the summit of ecclesiastical grandeur and power .
he commenced his work , however , of strengthening and <unk> the church , before he was appointed to this high office .
he was bishop of london for many years , which is a post , in some respects , second only to that of archbishop of canterbury .
while in this station , he was appointed by the king to many high civil offices .
he had great capacity for the transaction of business , and for the fulfillment of high trusts , whether of church or state .
he was a man of great integrity and moral worth .
he was stern and severe in manners but learned and accomplished .
his whole soul was bent on what he undoubtedly considered the great duty of his life , supporting and confirming the authority of the king and the power and influence of english <unk> .
notwithstanding his high qualifications , however , many persons were jealous of the influence which he possessed with the king , and murmured against the appointment of a <unk> to such high offices of state .
there was another source of hostility to laud .
there was a large part of the people of england who were against the church of england altogether .
they did not like a system in which all power and influence came , as it were , from above downward .
the king made the noblemen , the noblemen made the bishops , the bishops made the clergy , and the clergy ruled their flocks ; the flocks themselves having nothing to say or do but to submit .
it is very different with <unk> in this country .
the people here choose the clergy , and the clergy choose the bishops , so that power in the church , as in every thing else here , goes from below upward .
the two systems , when at rest , look very similar in the two countries ; but when in action , the current of life flows in contrary directions , making the two diametrically opposite to each other in spirit and power .
in england , <unk> is an engine by which the people are <unk> governed .
here , it is the machinery by which they govern .
thus , though the forms appear similar , the action is very diverse .
now in england there was a large and increasing party that hated and opposed the whole episcopal system .
laud , to counteract this tendency , attempted to define , and enlarge , and extend that system as far as possible .
he made the most of all the ceremonies of worship , and introduced others , which were , indeed , not exactly new , but rather ancient ones revived .
he did this conscientiously , no doubt , thinking that these forms of devotion were adapted to impress the soul of the <unk> , and lead him to feel , in his heart , the reverence which his outward action expressed .
many of the people , however , bitterly opposed these things .
they considered it a return to <unk> .
the more that laud , and those who acted with him , attempted to magnify the rites and the powers of the church , the more these persons began to abhor every thing of the kind .
they wanted christianity itself , in its purity , <unk> , as they said , by these <unk> and idolatrous forms .
they were called puritans .
there were a great many things which seem to us at the present day of very little consequence , which were then the subjects of endless disputes and of the most bitter animosity .
for instance , one point was whether the place where the communion was to be administered should be called the communion table or the altar ; and in what part of the church it should stand ; and whether the person <unk> should be called a priest or a clergyman ; and whether he should wear one kind of dress or another .
great importance was attached to these things ; but it was not on their own account , but on account of their bearing on the question whether the lord 's supper was to be considered only a ceremony <unk> of christ 's death , or whether it was , whenever celebrated by a regularly authorized priest , a real renewal of the sacrifice of christ , as the catholics maintained .
calling the communion table an altar , and the <unk> minister a priest , and clothing him in a <unk> garb , <unk> the idea of a renewal of the sacrifice of christ .
laud and his <unk> urged the adoption of all these and similar usages .
the puritans detested them , because they detested and abhorred the doctrine which they seemed to imply .
another great topic of controversy was the subject of amusements .
it is a very singular circumstance , that in those branches of the <name> church where rites and forms are most insisted upon , the greatest latitude is allowed in respect to the <unk> and amusements of social life .
catholic <name> is filled with theaters and dancing , and the sabbath is a holiday .
in london , on the other hand , the number of theaters is small , dancing is considered as an amusement of a more or less equivocal character , and the sabbath is rigidly observed ; and among all the simple democratic churches of new england , to dance or to attend the theater is considered almost morally wrong .
it was just so in the days of laud .
he wished to encourage amusements among the people , particularly on <name> , after church .
this was partly for the purpose of <unk> the efforts of those who were inclined to puritan views .
they attached great importance to their sermons and lectures , for in them they could address and influence the people .
but by means of these addresses , as laud thought , they put ideas of insubordination into the minds of the people , and <unk> on the authority of the church and of the king .
to prevent this , the <unk> party wished to exalt the prayers in the church service , and to give as little place and influence as possible to the sermon , and to draw off the attention of the people from the discussions and <unk> of the preachers by encouraging games , dances , and amusements of all kinds .
the judges in one of the counties , at a regular court held by them , once passed an order forbidding certain revels and <unk> connected with the church service , on account of the <unk> and <unk> , as they alleged , to which they gave rise ; and they ordered that public notice to this effect should be given by the bishop .
the archbishop , laud , considered this an interference on the part of the civil magistrates , with the powers and prerogatives of the church .
he had the judges brought before the council , and <unk> there ; and they were required by the council to <unk> their order at the next court .
the judges did so , but in such a way as to show that they did it simply in obedience to the command of the king 's council .
the people , or at least all of them who were inclined to puritan views , sided with the judges , and were more strict in <unk> from all such amusements on <name> than ever .
this , of course , made those who were on the side of laud more determined to promote these <unk> .
thus , as neither party pursued , in the least degree , a generous or conciliatory course toward the other , the difference between them widened more and more .
the people of the country were fast becoming either bigoted <unk> or <unk> puritans .
laud employed the power of the <name> chamber a great deal in the accomplishment of his purpose of enforcing entire submission to the ecclesiastical authority of the church .
he even had persons sometimes punished very severely for words of disrespect , or for writings in which they <unk> what they considered the tyranny under which they suffered .
this severe punishment for the mere expression of opinion only served to fix the opinion more firmly , and <unk> it more widely .
sometimes men would <name> in their sufferings for this cause , and bid the authorities defiance .
one man , for instance , named <unk> , was brought before the <name> chamber , charged with publishing <unk> pamphlets .
now , in all ordinary courts of justice , no man is called upon to say any thing against himself .
unless his crime can be proved by the testimony of others , it can not be proved at all .
but in the <name> chamber , whoever was brought to trial had to take an oath at first that he would answer all questions asked , even if they tended to <unk> himself .
when they proposed this oath to <unk> , he refused to take it .
they decided that this was contempt of court , and sentenced him to be whipped , put in the <unk> , and imprisoned .
while they were whipping him , he spent the time in making a speech to the spectators against the tyranny of bishops , referring to laud , whom he considered as the author of these proceedings .
he continued to do the same while in the <unk> .
as he passed along , too , he distributed copies of the pamphlets which he was prosecuted for writing .
the <name> chamber , hearing that he was <unk> the mob , ordered him to be gagged .
this did not subdue him .
he began to stamp with his foot and <unk> ; thus continuing to express his indomitable spirit of hostility to the tyranny which he opposed .
this single case would be of no great consequence alone , but it was not alone .
the attempt to put <unk> down was a symbol of the experiment of coercion which <name> in the state , and laud in the church , were trying upon the whole nation ; it was a symbol both in respect to the means employed , and to the success attained by them .
one curious case is related , which turned out more fortunately than usual for the parties accused .
some young lawyers in london were drinking at an evening entertainment , and among other <unk> they drank confusion to the archbishop of canterbury .
one of the waiters , who heard them , mentioned the circumstance , and they were brought before the <name> chamber .
before their trial came on , they applied to a certain nobleman to know what they should do .
" where was the waiter , " asked the nobleman , " when you drank the toast ? "
" at the door . "
" oh !
very well , then , " said he ; " tell the court that he only heard a part of the toast , as he was going out ; and that the words really were , <unk> to the archbishop of canterbury 's enemies . ' "
by this ingenious plea , and by means of a great appearance of humility and deference in the presence of the archbishop , the lawyers escaped with a reprimand .
laud was not content with establishing and confirming throughout all england the authority of the church , but attempted to extend the same system to scotland .
when king <name> went to scotland to be crowned , he took laud with him .
he was pleased with laud 's endeavors to enlarge and confirm the powers of the church , and wished to aid him in the work .
there were two reasons for this .
one was , that the same class of men , the puritans , were the natural enemies of both , so that the king and the archbishop were drawn together by having one common foe .
then , as the places in the church were not hereditary , but were filled by appointments from the king and the great nobles , whatever power the church could get into its hands could be employed by the king to strengthen his own authority , and keep his subjects in subjection .
we must not , however , censure the king and his advisers too strongly for this plan .
they doubtless were ambitious ; they loved power ; they wished to bear sway , <unk> and unquestioned , over the whole realm .
but then the king probably thought that the exercise of such a government was necessary for the order and prosperity of the realm , besides being his inherent and <unk> right .
good and bad motives were doubtless mingled here , as in all human action ; but then the king was , in the main , doing what he supposed it was his duty to do .
in proposing , therefore , to build up the church in scotland , and to make it conform to the english church in its rites and ceremonies , he and laud doubtless supposed that they were going greatly to improve the government of the sister kingdom .
there was in those days , as now , in the english church , a certain prescribed course of prayers , and <unk> , and scripture lessons , for each day , to be read from a book by the minister .
this was called the liturgy .
the puritans did not like a liturgy .
it tied men up , and did not leave the individual mind of the preacher at <name> to range freely , as they wished it to do , in conducting the devotional services .
it was on this very account that the friends of strong government did like it .
they wished to curtail this <name> , which , however , they called license , and which they thought made mischief .
in <unk> prayers , it is often easy to see that the speaker is aiming much more directly at producing a salutary effect on the minds of his hearers than at simply presenting petitions to the supreme being .
but , notwithstanding this evil , the existence of which no candid man can deny , the enemies of forms , who are generally friends of the largest <name> , think it best to leave the clergyman free .
the friends of forms , however , prefer forms on this very account .
they like what they consider the wholesome and salutary restraints which they impose .
now there has always been a great spirit of freedom in the scottish mind .
that people have ever been unwilling to submit to coercion or restraints .
there is probably no race of men on earth that would make worse slaves than the scotch .
their sturdy independence and determination to be free could never be subdued .
in the days of <name> they were particularly fond of freely exercising their own minds , and of speaking freely to others on the subject of religion .
they thought for themselves , sometimes right and sometimes wrong ; but they would think , and they would express their thoughts ; and their being thus unaccustomed , in one particular , to submit to restraints , rendered them more difficult to be governed in others .
laud thought , consequently , that they , particularly , needed a liturgy .
he prepared one for them .
it was varied somewhat from the english liturgy , though it was substantially the same .
the king proclaimed it , and required the bishops to see that it was employed in all the churches in scotland .
the day for introducing the liturgy was the signal for riots all over the kingdom .
in the principal church in edinburgh they called out " a pope !
a pope !  " when the clergyman came in with his book and his <unk> robes .
the bishop ascended the pulpit to address the people to appease them , and a stool came flying through the air at his head .
the police then expelled the congregation , and the clergyman went through with the service of the liturgy in the empty church , the congregation outside , in great tumult , accompanying the exercises with cries of disapprobation and resentment , and with volleys of stones against the doors and windows .
the scotch sent a sort of embassador to london to represent to the king that the hostility to the liturgy was so universal and so strong that it could not be enforced .
but the king and his council had the same conscientious scruples about giving up in a contest with subjects , that a teacher or a parent , in our day , would feel in the case of resistance from children or scholars .
the king sent down a proclamation that the observance of the liturgy must be insisted on .
the scotch prepared to resist .
they sent delegates to edinburgh , and organized a sort of government .
they raised armies .
they took possession of the king 's castles .
they made a solemn covenant , binding themselves to insist on religious freedom .
in a word , all scotland was in rebellion .
it was the custom in those days to have , connected with the court , some <unk> person , who used to be fantastically dressed , and to have great <name> of speech , and whose province was to amuse the courtiers .
he was called the king 's jester , or , more commonly , the fool .
the name of king <name> 's fool was archy .
after this rebellion broke out , and all england was aghast at the extent of the mischief which laud 's liturgy had done , the fool , seeing the archbishop go by one day , called out to him , " my lord !
who is the fool now ! "
the archbishop , as if to leave no possible doubt in respect to the proper answer to the question , had poor archy tried and punished .
his sentence was to have his coat pulled up over his head , and to be dismissed from the king 's service .
if laud had let the affair pass , it would have ended with a laugh in the street ; but by resenting it , he gave it notoriety , caused it to be recorded , and has perpetuated the memory of the jest to all future times .
he ought to have joined in the laugh , and rewarded archy on the spot for so good a <unk> .
the scotch , besides organizing a sort of civil government , took measures for summoning a general assembly of their church .
this assembly met at glasgow .
the nobility and gentry flocked to glasgow at the time of the meeting , to encourage and sustain the assembly , and to manifest their interest in the proceedings .
the assembly very deliberately went to work , and , not content with taking a stand against the liturgy which <name> had imposed , they abolished the fabric of <unk>  that is , the government of bishops  altogether .
thus laud 's attempt to perfect and confirm the system resulted in <unk> it completely from the kingdom .
it has never held up its head in scotland since .
they established <unk> in its place , which is a sort of republican system , the <unk> being all officially equal to each other , though banded together under a common government administered by themselves .
the king was determined to put down this rebellion at all hazards .
he had made such good use of the various irregular modes of raising money which have been already described , and had been so economical in the use of it , that he had now quite a sum of money in his treasury ; and had it not been for the attempt to enforce the unfortunate liturgy upon the people of scotland , he might , perhaps , have gone on reigning without a parliament to the end of his days .
he had now about two hundred thousand pounds , by means of which , together with what he could borrow , he hoped to make one single demonstration of force which would bring the rebellion to an end .
he raised an army and equipped a fleet .
he issued a proclamation summoning all the peers of the realm to attend him .
he moved with this great concourse from london toward the north , the whole country looking on as spectators to behold the progress of this great expedition , by which their monarch was going to attempt to subdue again his other kingdom .
<name> advanced to the city of york , the great city of the north of england .
here he paused and established his court , with all possible pomp and parade .
his design was to impress the scots with such an idea of the greatness of the power which was coming to overwhelm them as to cause them to submit at once .
but all this show was very hollow and <unk> .
the army felt a greater sympathy with the scots than they did with the king .
the complaints against <name> 's government were pretty much the same in both countries .
a great many scotchmen came to york while the king was there , and the people from all the country round flocked thither too , drawn by the <name> spectacles connected with the presence of such a court and army .
the scotchmen disseminated their complaints thus among the english people , and finally the king and his council , finding indications of so extensive a disaffection , had a form of an oath prepared , which they required all the principal persons to take , acknowledging allegiance to <name> , and denying that they had any intelligence or correspondence with the enemy .
the scotchmen all took the oath very readily , though some of the english refused .
at any rate , the state of things was not such as to intimidate the scotch , and lead them , as the king had hoped , to <name> for peace .
so he concluded to move on toward the borders .
he went to newcastle , and thence to berwick .
from berwick he moved along the banks of the tweed , which here forms the boundary between the two kingdoms , and , finding a suitable place for such a purpose , the king had his <name> tent pitched , and his army encamped around him .
now , as king <name> had undertaken to subdue the scots by a show of force , it seems they concluded to defend themselves by a show too , though theirs was a cheaper and more simple contrivance than his .
they advanced with about three thousand men to a place distant perhaps seven miles from the english camp .
the king sent an army of five thousand men to attack them .
the scotch , in the mean time , collected great herds of cattle from all the country around , as the historians say , and arranged them behind their little army in such a way as to make the whole appear a vast body of soldiers .
a troop of horsemen , who were the advanced part of the english army , came in sight of this formidable host first , and , finding their <name> so much greater than they had anticipated , they fell back , and ordered the artillery and <unk> who were coming up to retreat , and all together came back to the encampment .
there were two or three military enterprises of similar character , in which nothing was done but to encourage the scotch and <unk> the english .
in fact , neither officers , soldiers , nor king wished to proceed to extremities .
the officers and soldiers did not wish to fight the scotch , and the king , knowing the state of his army , did not really dare to do it .
finally , all the king 's council advised him to give up the pretended contest , and to settle the difficulty by a compromise .
accordingly , in <name> , negotiations were commenced , and before the end of the month articles were signed .
the king probably made the best terms he could , but it was universally considered that the scots gained the victory .
the king disbanded his army , and returned to london .
the scotch leaders went back to edinburgh .
soon after this the parliament and the general assembly of the church convened , and these bodies took the whole management of the realm into their own hands .
they sent commissioners to london to see and confer with the king , and these commissioners seemed almost to assume the character of embassadors from a foreign state .
these negotiations , and the course which affairs were taking in scotland , soon led to new difficulties .
the king found that he was losing his kingdom of scotland altogether .
it seemed , however , as if there was nothing that he could do to regain it .
his reserved funds were gone , and his credit was exhausted .
there was no resource left but to call a parliament and ask for supplies .
he might have known , however , that this would be useless , for there was so strong a <unk> with the scotch in their alleged grievances among the people of england , that he could not reasonably expect any response from the latter , in whatever way he might appeal to them .

the <name> of strafford .

during the time that the king had been engaged in the attempt to govern england without parliaments , he had , besides laud , a very efficient <unk> , known in english history by the name of the <name> of strafford .
this title of <name> of strafford was conferred upon him by the king as a reward for his services .
his father 's name was wentworth .
he was born in london , and the <name> name given to him was <name> .
he was educated at the university of cambridge , and was much distinguished for his talents and his personal accomplishments .
after finishing his education , he traveled for some time on the continent , visiting foreign cities and courts , and studying the languages , manners , and customs of other nations .
he returned at length to england .
he was made a knight .
his father died when he was about twenty-one , and left him a large fortune .
he was about seven years older than king <name> , so that all these circumstances took place before the commencement of <name> 's reign .
for many years after this he was very extensively known in england as a gentleman of large fortune and great abilities , by the name of sir <name> wentworth .
sir <name> wentworth was a member of parliament in those days , and in the contests between the king and the parliament he took the side of parliament .
<name> used to maintain that his power alone was hereditary and sovereign ; that the parliament was his council ; and that they had no powers or privileges except what he himself or his ancestors had granted and allowed them .
wentworth took very strong ground against this .
he urged parliament to maintain that their rights and privileges were inherent and hereditary as well as those of the king ; that such powers as they possessed were their own , and were entirely independent of <name> <name> or permission ; and that the king could no more encroach upon the privileges of parliament , than parliament upon the prerogatives of the king .
this was in the beginning of the difficulties between the king and the commons .
it <name> , perhaps , be recollected by the reader , that one of the plans which <name> adopted to weaken the opposition to him in parliament was by appointing six of the leaders of this opposition to the office of sheriff in their several counties .
and as the general theory of all monarchies is that the subjects are bound to obey and serve the king , these men were obliged to leave their seats in parliament and go home , to serve as sheriffs .
<name> and his council supposed that the rest would be more quiet and submissive when the leaders of the party opposed to him were taken away .
but the effect was the reverse .
the commons were incensed at such a mode of interfering with their action , and became more hostile to the <name> power than ever .
wentworth himself , too , was made more determined in his opposition by this treatment .
a short time after this , the king 's plan of a forced <name> was adopted , which has already been described ; that is , a sum of money was assessed in the manner of a tax upon all the people of the kingdom , and each man was required to lend his proportion to the government .
the king admitted that he had no right to make people give money without the action of parliament , but claimed the right to require them to lend it .
as sir <name> wentworth was a man of large fortune , his share of the <name> was considerable .
he absolutely refused to pay it .
the king then brought him before a court which was entirely under <name> control , and he was condemned to be imprisoned .
knowing , however , that this claim on the part of the king was very doubtful , they mitigated the punishment by allowing him first a range of two miles around his place of confinement , and afterward they released him entirely .
he was chosen a member of parliament again , and he returned to his seat more powerful and influential than ever .
buckingham , who had been his greatest enemy , was now dead , and the king , finding that he had great abilities and a spirit that would not yield to <unk> or force , concluded to try kindness and favors .
in fact , there are two different modes by which sovereigns in all ages and countries endeavor to neutralize the opposition of popular leaders .
one is by <unk> them with threats and punishments , and the other buying them off with appointments and honors .
some of the king 's high officers of state began to cultivate the acquaintance of wentworth , and to pay him attentions and <unk> .
he could not but feel gratified with these indications of their regard .
they complimented his talents and his powers , and represented to him that such abilities ought to be employed in the service of the state .
finally , the king conferred upon him the title of baron .
common gratitude for these marks of distinction and honor held him back from any violent opposition to the king .
his enemies said he was bought off by honors and rewards .
no doubt he was ambitious , and , like all other politicians , his supreme motive was love of consideration and honor .
this was doubtless his motive in what he had done in behalf of the parliament .
but all that he could do as a popular leader in parliament was to acquire a general ascendency over men 's minds , and make himself a subject of fame and honor .
all places of real authority were exclusively under the king 's control , and he could only rise to such stations through the sovereign 's favor .
in a word , he could acquire only influence as a leader in parliament , while the king could give him power .
kings can exercise , accordingly , a great control over the minds of legislators by offering them office ; and king <name> , after finding that his first advances to wentworth were favorably received , appointed him one of his privy council .
wentworth accepted the office .
his former friends considered that in doing this he was deserting them , and betraying the cause which he had at first espoused and defended .
the country at large were much displeased with him , finding that he had forsaken their cause , and placed himself in a position to act against them .
persons who change sides in politics or in religion are very apt to go from one extreme to another .
their former friends <unk> them , and they , in retaliation , act more and more energetically against them .
it was so with strafford .
he gradually engaged more and more fully and earnestly in <unk> the king .
finally , the king appointed him to a very high station , called the presidency of the north .
his office was to govern the whole north of england  of course , under the direction of the king and council .
there were four counties under his jurisdiction , and the king gave him a commission which clothed him with enormous powers  powers greater , as all the people thought , than the king had any right to bestow .
strafford proceeded to the north , and entered upon the government of his realm there , with a determination to <name> out all the king's plans to the utmost .
from being an ardent advocate of the rights of the people , as he was at the commencement of his career , he became a most determined and uncompromising supporter of the arbitrary power of the king .
he insisted on the collection of money from the people , in all the ways that the king claimed the power to collect it by authority of his prerogative ; and he was so strict and exacting in doing this , that he raised the revenue to four or five times what any of his predecessors had been able to collect .
this , of course , pleased king <name> and his government extremely ; for it was at a time during which the king was attempting to govern without a parliament , and every accession to his funds was of extreme importance .
laud , too , the archbishop , was highly gratified with his exertions and his success , and the king looked upon laud and wentworth as the two most efficient supporters of his power .
they were , in fact , the two most efficient <unk> of his destruction .
of course , the people of the north hated him .
while he was earning the applause of the archbishop and the king , and <unk> himself to new honors and increased power , he was sewing the seeds of the bitterest animosity in the hearts of the people every where .
still he enjoyed all the external marks of consideration and honor .
the president of the north was a sort of king .
he was clothed with great powers , and lived in great state and splendor .
he had many attendants , and the great nobles of the land , who generally took <name> 's side in the contests of the day , envied wentworth 's greatness and power , and applauded the energy and success of his administration .
ireland was , at this time , in a disturbed and disordered state , and laud proposed that wentworth should be appointed by the king to the government of it .
a great proportion of the inhabitants were catholics , and were very little disposed to submit to protestant rule .
wentworth was appointed lord deputy , and afterward lord lieutenant , which made him king of ireland in all but the name .
every thing , of course , was done in the name of <name> .
he carried the same energy into his government here that he had exhibited in the north of england .
he improved the condition of the country astonishingly in respect to trade , to revenue , and to public order .
but he governed in the most arbitrary manner , and he boasted that he had rendered the king as absolute a sovereign in ireland as any <name> in the world could be .
such a boast from a man who had once been a very prominent defender of the rights of the people against this very kind of sovereignty , was fitted to produce a feeling of universal exasperation and <name> of revenge .
the murmurs and muttered threats which filled the land , though suppressed , were very deep and very strong .
the king , however , and laud , considered wentworth as their most able and efficient <unk> ; and when the difficulties in scotland began to grow serious , they recalled him from ireland , and put that country into the hands of another ruler .
the king then advanced him to the rank of an <name> .
his title was the <name> of strafford .
as the subsequent parts of his history attracted more attention than those preceding his elevation to this earldom , he has been far more widely known among mankind by the name of strafford than by his original name of wentworth , which was , from this period , nearly forgotten .
to return now to the troubles in scotland .
the king found that it would be impossible to go on without supplies , and he accordingly concluded , on the whole , to call a parliament .
he was in serious trouble .
laud was in serious trouble too .
he had been <unk> engaged for many years in establishing <unk> all over england , and in putting down , by force of law , all disposition to dissent from it ; and in attempting to produce , throughout the realm , one uniform system of <name> <name> and worship .
this was his idea of the perfection of religious order and right .
he used to make an annual visitation to all the <unk> in the realm ; inquire into the usages which prevailed there ; put a stop , so far as he could , to all irregularities ; and confirm and establish , by the most decisive measures , the episcopal authority .
he sent in his report to the king of the results of his inquiries , asking the king 's aid , where his own powers were insufficient , for the more full accomplishment of his plans .
but , notwithstanding all this diligence and zeal , he found that he met with very partial success .
the irregularities , as he called them , which he suppressed in one place , would break out in another ; the disposition to throw off the dominion of bishops was getting more and more extensive and deeply seated ; and now , the result of the religious revolution in scotland , and of the general excitement which it produced in england , was to widen and extend this feeling more than ever .
he did not , however , give up the contest , he employed an able writer to draw up a defense of <unk> , as the true and scriptural form of church government .
the book , when first prepared , was moderate in its tone , and allowed that in some particular cases a presbyterian mode of government might be admissible ; but laud , in <unk> the book , struck out these concessions as unnecessary and dangerous , and placed <unk> in full and exclusive possession of the ground , as the divinely instituted and only admissible form of church government and discipline .
he caused this book to be circulated ; but the attempt to reason with the <unk> , after having failed in the attempt to <unk> them , is not generally very successful .
the archbishop , in his report to the king this year of the state of things throughout his province , represents the spirit of <unk> to the church of england as getting too strong for him to control without more efficient help from the civil power ; but whether it would be wise , he added , to undertake any more effectual coercion in the present distracted state of the kingdom , he left it for the king to decide .
laud proposed that the council should recommend to the king the calling of a parliament .
at the same time , they passed a resolution that , in case the parliament " should prove <unk> , and refuse to <name> supplies , they would sustain the king in the resort to extraordinary measures . "
this was regarded as a threat , and did not help to <unk> the members favorably in regard to the feeling with which the king was to meet them .
the king ordered the parliament to be elected in december , but did not call them together until <name> .
in the mean time , he went on raising an army , so as to have his military preparations in readiness .
he , however , appointed a new set of officers to the command of this army , neglecting those who were in command before , as he had found them so little disposed to act efficiently in his cause .
he supplied the leader 's place with strafford .
this change produced very extensive murmurs of dissatisfaction , which , added to all the other causes of complaint , made the times look very dark and <name> .
the parliament assembled in <name> .
the king went into the house of lords , the commons being , as usual , summoned to the bar .
he addressed them as follows : " my lords and gentlemen ,  there was never a king who had a more great and weighty cause to call his people together than myself .
i <name> not trouble you with the particulars .
i have informed my lord keeper , and now command him to speak , and i <name> your attention . "
the keeper referred to was the keeper of the king 's seals , who was , of course , a great officer of state .
he made a speech , informing the houses , in general terms , of the king 's need of money , but said that it was not necessary for him to explain minutely the monarch 's plans , as they were exclusively his own concern .
we may as well quote his words , in order to show in what light the position and province of a british parliament was considered in those days .
" his majesty 's kingly resolutions , " said the lord keeper , " are seated in the ark of his sacred breast , and it were a presumption of too high a nature for any <unk> <unk> to touch it .
yet his majesty is now pleased to lay by the shining beams of majesty , as <unk> did to <unk> , that the distance between sovereignty and subjection should not bar you of that filial freedom of access to his person and counsels ; only let us beware how , with the son of <unk> , we aim not at the guiding of the chariot , as if that were the only testimony of <unk> affection ; and let us remember , that though the king sometimes lays by the beams and rays of majesty , he never lays by majesty itself . "
when the keeper had finished his speech , the king confirmed it by saying that he had exaggerated nothing , and the houses were left to their deliberations .
instead of proceeding to the business of raising money , they commenced an inquiry into the grievances , as they called them  that is , all the unjust acts and the <unk> of the government , of which the country had been complaining for the ten years during which there had been an intermission of parliaments .
the king did all in his power to arrest this course of procedure .
he sent them message after message , urging them to leave these things , and take up first the question of supplies .
he then sent a message to the house of peers , requesting them to interpose and exert their influence to lead the commons to act .
the peers did so .
the commons sent them back a reply that their interference in the business of supply , which belonged to the commons alone , was a breach of their privileges .
" and , " they added , " therefore , the commons <name> their <unk> in their wisdom to find out some way for the <unk> of their privileges broken by that act , and to prevent the like <unk> in future . "
thus repulsed on every hand , the king gave up the <name> of accomplishing any thing through the action of the house of commons , and he suddenly determined to dissolve parliament .
the session had continued only about three weeks .
in dissolving the parliament the king took no notice of the commons whatever , but addressed the lords alone .
the commons and the whole country were incensed at such capricious treatment of the national legislature .
the king and his council tried all summer to get the army ready to be put in motion .
the great difficulty , of course , was want of funds .
the <unk> , which was the great council of the church , and which was accustomed in those days to sit simultaneously with parliament , continued their session afterward in this case , and raised some money for the king .
the nobles of the court subscribed a considerable amount , also , which they lent him .
they wished to sustain him in his contest with the commons on their own account , and then , besides , they felt a personal interest in him , and a sympathy for him in the troubles which were thickening around him .
the summer months passed away in making the preparations and getting the various bodies of troops ready , and the military stores collected at the place of rendezvous in york and newcastle .
the scots , in the mean time , had been assembling their forces near the borders , and , being somewhat <unk> by their success in the previous campaign , crossed the frontier , and advanced boldly to meet the forces of the king .
they published a <unk> , declaring that they were not entering england with any hostile intent toward their sovereign , but were only coming to present to him their humble petitions for a redress of their grievances , which they said they were sure he would graciously receive as soon as he had opportunity to learn from them how great their grievances had been .
they respectfully requested that the people of england would allow them to pass safely and without molestation through the land , and promised to conduct themselves with the utmost propriety and decorum .
this promise they kept .
they avoided <unk> the inhabitants in any way , and purchased fairly every thing they consumed .
when the english officers learned that the scotch had crossed the tweed , they sent on immediately to london , to the king , urging him to come north at once , and join the army , with all the remaining forces at his command .
the king did so , but it was too late .
he arrived at york ; from york he went northward to reach the van of his army , which had been posted at newcastle , but on his way he was met by messengers saying that they were in full retreat , and that the scotch had got possession of newcastle .
the circumstances of the battle were these .
newcastle is upon the <unk> .
the banks at newcastle are steep and high , but about four miles above the town is a place called <unk> , where was a meadow near the river , and a convenient place to cross .
the scotch advanced in a very slow and orderly manner to <unk> , and encamped there .
the english sent a detachment from newcastle to arrest their progress .
the scotch begged them not to interrupt their march , as they were only going to present petitions to the king !
the english general , of course , paid no attention to this pretext .
the scotch army then attacked them and soon put them to flight .
the routed english soldiers fled to newcastle , and were there joined by all that portion of the army which was in newcastle , in a rapid retreat .
the scotch took possession of the town , but conducted themselves in a very orderly manner , and bought and paid for every thing they used .
the poor king was now in a situation of the most imminent and terrible danger .
rebel subjects were in full possession of one kingdom , and were now advancing at the head of victorious armies into the other .
he himself had entirely alienated the affections of a large portion of his subjects , and had openly quarreled with and dismissed the legislature .
he had no funds , and had exhausted all possible means of raising funds .
he was half distracted with the perplexities and dangers of his position .
his deciding on dissolving parliament in the spring was a hasty step , and he bitterly regretted it the moment the deed was done .
he wished to recall it .
he <unk> several days about the possibility of summoning the same members to meet again , and constituting them again a parliament .
but the lawyers insisted that this could not be done .
a dissolution was a dissolution .
the parliament , once dissolved , was no more .
it could not be brought to life again .
there must be new orders to the country to proceed to new elections .
to do this at once would have been too humiliating for the king .
he now found , however , that the necessity for it could no longer be postponed .
there was such a thing in the english history as a council of peers alone , called in a sudden emergency which did not allow of time for the elections necessary to constitute the house of commons .
<name> called such a council of peers to meet at york , and they immediately assembled .
in the mean time the scotch sent embassadors to york , saying to the king that they were advancing to lay their grievances before him !
they expressed great sorrow and regret at the victory which they had been compelled to gain over some forces that had attempted to prevent them from getting access to their sovereign .
the king laid this communication before the lords , and asked their advice what to do ; and also asked them to counsel him how he should provide funds to keep his army together until a parliament could be convened .
the lords advised him to appoint commissioners to meet the scotch , and endeavor to compromise the difficulties ; and to send to the city of london , asking that corporation to lend him a small sum until parliament could be assembled .
this advice was followed .
a temporary treaty was made with the rebels , although making a treaty with rebels is perhaps the most humiliating thing that a hereditary sovereign is ever compelled to do .
the <name> of strafford was , however , entirely opposed to this policy .
he urged the king most earnestly not to give up the contest without a more decisive struggle .
he represented to him the danger of beginning to yield to the torrent which he now began to see would overwhelm them all if it was allowed to have its way .
he tried to persuade the king that the scots might yet be driven back , and that it would be possible to get along without a parliament .
he dreaded a parliament .
the king , however , and his other advisers , thought that they must yield a little to the storm .
strafford then wanted to be allowed to return to his post in ireland , where he thought that he should probably be safe from the terrible enmity which he must have known that he had awakened in england , and which he thought a parliament would concentrate and bring upon his devoted head .
but the king would not consent to this .
he assured strafford that if a parliament should assemble , he would take care that they should not hurt a hair of his head .
unfortunate monarch !
how little he foresaw that that very parliament , from whose violence he thus promised to defend his favorite servant so completely as to insure him from the slightest injury , would begin by taking off his favorite 's head , and end with taking off his own !

the parliament assembled in november , <unk> .
the king proceeded to london to attend it .
he left strafford in command of the army at york .
active hostilities had been suspended , as a sort of temporary truce had been concluded with the scots , to prepare the way for a final treaty .
strafford had been entirely opposed to this , being still full of energy and courage .
the king , however , began to feel alarmed .
he went to london to meet the parliament which he had summoned , but he was prepared to meet them in a very different spirit from that which he had manifested on former occasions .
he even gave up all the external circumstances of pomp and parade with which the opening of parliament had usually been attended .
he had been accustomed to go to the house of lords in state , with a numerous retinue and great parade .
now he was conveyed from his palace along the river in a barge , in a quiet and unostentatious manner .
his opening speech , too , was moderate and conciliatory .
in a word , it was pretty evident to the commons that the proud and haughty spirit of their <name> master was beginning to be pretty effectually humbled .
of course , now , in proportion as the king should falter , the commons would grow bold .
the house immediately began to attack laud and strafford in their speeches .
it is the theory of the british constitution that the king can do no wrong ; whatever <unk> at any time attaches to the acts of his administration , belongs to his advisers , not to himself .
the speakers condemned , in most decided terms , the arbitrary and tyrannical course which the government had pursued during the intermission of parliaments , but charged it all , not to the king , but to strafford and laud .
strafford had been , as they considered , the responsible person in civil and military affairs , and laud in those of the church .
these speeches were made to try the temper of the house and of the country , and see whether there was hostility enough to laud and strafford in the house and in the country , and boldness enough in the expression of it , to warrant their impeachment .
the attacks thus made in the house against the two ministers were made very soon .
within a week after the opening of parliament , one of the members , after <unk> a long time against the encroachments and tyranny of archbishop laud , whose title , according to english usage , was " his <name> , " said he hoped that , before the year ran round , his <name> would either have more <name> or no <name> at all ; " for , " he added , " our manifold griefs do fill a mighty and vast circumference , yet in such a manner that from every part our lines of sorrow do meet in him , and point at him the center , from whence our miseries in this church , and many of them in the commonwealth , do flow . "
he said , also , that if they must submit to a pope , he would rather obey one that was as far off as the tiber , than to have him come as near as the thames .
similar denunciations were made against strafford , and they awakened no opposition .
on the contrary , it was found that the feeling of hostility against both the ministers was so universal and so strong , that the leaders began to think seriously of an impeachment on a charge of high treason .
high treason is the greatest crime known to the english law , and the punishment for it , especially in the case of a peer of the realm , is very terrible .
this punishment was generally inflicted by what was called a <name> of attainder , which brought with it the worst of penalties .
it implied the perfect destruction of the criminal in every sense .
he was to lose his life by having his head cut off upon a block .
his body , according to the strict letter of the law , was to be mutilated in a manner too shocking to be here described .
his children were <unk> , and his property all forfeited .
this was considered as the consequence of the <unk> of the blood , which rendered it corrupt , and incapable of transmitting an inheritance .
in fact , it was the intention of the <name> of attainder to brand the wretched object of it with complete and perpetual infamy .
the proceedings , too , in the impeachment and trial of a high minister of state , were always very imposing and solemn .
the impeachment must be moved by the commons , and tried by the peers .
a peer of the realm could be tried by no inferior tribunal .
when the commons proposed bringing articles of impeachment against an officer of state , they sent first a messenger to the house of peers to ask them to arrest the person whom they intended to accuse , and to hold him for trial until they should have their articles prepared .
the house of peers would comply with this request , and a time would be appointed for the trial .
the commons would frame the charges , and appoint a certain number of their members to manage the prosecution .
they would collect evidence , and get every thing ready for the trial .
when the time arrived , the chamber of the house of peers would be arranged as a court room , or they would assemble in some other hall more suitable for the purpose , the prisoner would be brought to the bar , the commissioners on the part of the commons would appear with their documents and their evidence , persons of distinction would assemble to listen to the proceedings , and the trial would go on .
it was in accordance with this routine that the commons commenced proceedings against the <name> of strafford , very soon after the opening of the session , by appointing a committee to inquire whether there was any just cause to accuse him of treason .
the committee reported to the house that there was just cause .
the house then appointed a messenger to go to the house of lords , saying that they had found that there was just cause to accuse the <name> of strafford of high treason , and to ask that they would <unk> him from the house , as the phrase was , and hold him in custody till they could prepare the charges and the evidence against him .
all these proceedings were in secret session , in order that strafford might not get warning and fly .
the commons then nearly all accompanied their messenger to the house of lords , to show how much in <name> they were .
the lords complied with the request .
they caused the <name> to be arrested and committed to the charge of the usher of the black <name> , and sent two officers to the commons to inform them that they had done so .
the usher of the black <name> is a very important officer of the house of lords .
he is a sort of sheriff , to execute the various <unk> of the house , having officers to serve under him for this purpose .
the badge of his office has been , for centuries , a black <name> with a golden lion at the upper end , which is borne before him as the emblem of his authority .
a peer of the realm , when charged with treason , is committed to the custody of this officer .
in this case he took the <name> of strafford under his charge , and kept him at his house , properly guarded .
the commons went on preparing the articles of impeachment .
this was in november .
during the <name> following the parties struggled one against another , laud doing all in his power to strengthen the position of the king , and to avert the dangers which threatened himself and strafford .
the animosity , however , which was felt against him , was steadily increasing .
the house of commons did many things to <unk> the rites and usages of the episcopal church , and to make them odious .
the excitement among the populace increased , and mobs began to interfere with the service in some of the churches in london and westminster .
at last a mob of five hundred persons assembled around the archbishop 's palace at <unk> .
[ e ] this palace , as has been before stated , is on the bank of the thames , just above london , opposite to westminster .
the mob were there for two hours , beating at the doors and windows in an attempt to force admission , but in vain .
the palace was very strongly guarded , and the mob were at length repulsed .
one of the <unk> was taken and hanged .
[ footnote e : see view of this palace on <name> 133 . ]
one would have thought that this sort of persecution would have awakened some sympathy in the archbishop 's favor ; but it was too late .
he had been bearing down so mercilessly himself upon the people of england for so many years , suppressing , by the severest measures , all expressions of discontent , that the hatred had become entirely uncontrollable .
its breaking out at one point only promoted its breaking out in another .
the house of commons sent a messenger to the house of lords , as they had done in the case of strafford , saying that they had found good cause to accuse the archbishop of canterbury of treason , and asked that he might be <unk> from the house , and held in custody till they could prepare their charges , and the evidence to sustain them .
the archbishop was at that time in his seat .
he was directed to withdraw .
before leaving the chamber he asked leave to say a few words .
permission was granted , and he said in substance that he was truly sorry to have awakened in the hearts of his countrymen such a degree of displeasure as was obviously excited against him .
he was most unhappy to have lived to see the day in which he was made subject to a charge of treason .
he begged their <unk> to look at the whole course of his life , and he was sure that they would be convinced that there was not a single member of the house of commons who could really think him guilty of such a charge .
here one of the lords interrupted him to say that by speaking in that manner he was uttering slander against the house of commons , charging them with solemnly bringing accusations which they did not believe to be true .
the archbishop then said , that if the charge must be entertained , he hoped that he should have a fair trial , according to the ancient parliamentary usages of the realm .
another of the lords interrupted him again , saying that such a remark was improper , as it was not for him to <unk> the manner in which the proceedings should be conducted .
he then withdrew , while the house should consider what course to take .
presently he was summoned back to the bar of the house , and there committed to the charge of the usher of the black <name> .
the usher conducted him to his house , and he was kept there for ten weeks in close confinement .
at last the time for the trial of strafford came on , while laud was in confinement .
the interest felt in the trial was deep and universal .
there were three kingdoms , as it were , combined against one man .
various measures were resorted to by the commons to diminish the possibility that the accused should escape conviction .
some of them have since been thought to be unjust and cruel .
for example , several persons who were strong friends of strafford , and who , as was supposed , might offer testimony in his favor , were charged with treason and confined in prison until the trial was over .
the commons appointed thirteen persons to manage the prosecution .
these persons were many months preparing the charges and the evidence , keeping their whole proceedings profoundly secret during all the time .
at last the day approached , and westminster hall was fitted up and prepared to be the scene of the trial .
[ illustration : westminster hall ] westminster hall has the name of being the largest room whose roof is not supported by pillars , in europe .
it stands in the region of the palaces and the houses of parliament at westminster , and has been for seven centuries the scene of pageants and ceremonies without number .
it is said that ten thousand persons have been accommodated in it at a banquet .
[ f ] this great room was fitted up for the trial .
seats were provided for both houses of parliament ; for the commons were to be present as <unk> , and the lords as the court .
there was , as usual , a chair of state , or throne , for the king , as a matter of form .
there was also a private gallery , screened from the observation of the spectators , where the king and <name> could sit and witness the proceedings .
they attended during the whole trial .
[ footnote f : it is two hundred and seventy feet long , seventy-five wide , and ninety high . ]
one would have supposed that the deliberate solemnity of these preparations would have calmed the animosity of strafford 's enemies , and led them to be satisfied at last with something less than his utter destruction .
but this seems not to have been the effect .
the terrible hostilities which had been gathering strength so long , seemed to rage all the more fiercely now that there was a prospect of their gratification .
and yet it was very hard to find any thing sufficiently distinct and tangible against the accused to warrant his conviction .
the commissioners who had been appointed to manage the case divided the charges among them .
when the trial commenced , they stated and urged these charges in succession .
strafford , who had not known beforehand what they were to be , replied to them , one by one , with calmness and composure , and yet with great eloquence and power .
the extraordinary abilities which he had shown through the whole course of his life , seemed to shine out with increased splendor amid the awful solemnities which were now darkening its close .
he was firm and undaunted , and yet respectful and submissive .
the natural excitements of the occasion ; the imposing assembly ; the breathless attention ; the magnificent hall ; the consciousness that the opposition which he was struggling to stem before that great tribunal was the combined hostility of three kingdoms , and that the torrent was flowing from a reservoir which had been accumulating for many years ; and that the whole civilized world were looking on with great interest to watch the result ; and perhaps , more than all , that he was in the unseen presence of his sovereign , whom he was accustomed to look upon as the greatest personage on earth ; these , and the other circumstances of the scene , filled his mind with strong emotions , and gave animation , and energy , and a lofty eloquence to all that he said .
the trial lasted eighteen days , the excitement increasing consistently to the end .
there was nothing proved which could with any propriety be considered as treason .
he had managed the government , it is true , with one set of views in respect to the absolute prerogatives and powers of the king , while those who now were in possession of power held opposite views , and they considered it a matter of necessity that he should die .
the charge of treason was a pretext to bring the case somewhat within the reach of the formalities of law .
it is one of the necessary incidents of all governmental systems founded on force , and not on the consent of the governed , that when great and fundamental questions of policy arise , they often bring the country to a crisis in which there can be no real settlement of the dispute without the absolute destruction of one party or the other .
it was so now , as the popular leaders supposed .
they had determined that stern necessity required that laud and strafford must die ; and the only object of going through the formality of a trial was to soften the violence of the proceeding a little , by doing all that could be done toward establishing a legal justification of the deed .
the trial , as has been said , lasted eighteen days .
during all this time , the leaders were not content with simply urging the proceedings forward energetically in westminster hall .
they were <unk> and managing in every possible way to secure the final vote .
but , notwithstanding this , strafford 's defense was so able , and the failure to make out the charge of treason against him was so clear , that it was doubtful what the result would be .
accordingly , without waiting for the decision of the peers on the impeachment , a <name> of attainder against the <name> was brought forward in the house of commons .
this <name> of attainder was passed by a large majority  <unk> 204 , <unk> 59 .
it was then sent to the house of lords .
the lords were very unwilling to pass it .
while they were debating it , the king sent a message to them to say that in his opinion the <name> had not been guilty of treason , or of any attempt to <unk> the laws ; and that several things which had been alleged in the trial , and on which the <name> of attainder chiefly rested , were not true .
he was willing , however , if it would satisfy the enemies of the <name> , to have him convicted of a <unk> , and made incapable of holding any public office from that time ; but he protested against his being punished by a <name> of attainder on a charge of treason .
this interposition of the king in strafford 's favor awakened loud expressions of displeasure .
they called it an interference with the action of one of the houses of parliament .
the enemies of strafford created a great excitement against him out of doors .
they raised clamorous calls for his execution , among the populace .
the people made black lists of the names of persons who were in the <name> 's favor , and posted them up in public places , calling such persons <unk> , and threatening them with public vengeance .
the lords , who would have been willing to have saved strafford 's life if they had dared , began to find that they could not do so without <unk> their own .
when at last the vote came to be taken in the house of lords , out of eighty members who had been present at the trial , only forty-six were present to vote , and the <name> was passed by a vote of thirty-five to eleven .
the thirty-four who were absent were probably all against the <name> , but were afraid to appear .
the responsibility now devolved upon the king .
an act of parliament must be signed by the king .
he really <unk> it .
the action of the two houses is , in theory , only a recommendation of the measure to him .
the king was determined on no account to give his consent to <unk> condemnation .
he , however , laid the subject before his privy council .
they , after <unk> upon it , recommended that he should sign the <name> .
nothing else , they said , could allay the terrible storm which was raging , and the king ought to prefer the peace and safety of the realm to the life of any one man , however innocent he might be .
the populace , in the mean time , crowded around the king 's palace at whitehall , calling out " justice !
justice !  " and filling the air with threats and imprecations ; and preachers in their pulpits urged the necessity of punishing offenders , and <unk> on the iniquity which those magistrates committed who allowed great <unk> to escape the penalty due for their crimes .
the <name> , too , was alarmed .
she begged the king , with tears , not any longer to attempt to withstand the torrent which threatened to sweep them all away in its fury .
while things were in this state , <name> received a letter from strafford in the tower , expressing his consent , and even his request , that the king should yield and sign the <name> .
the tower of london is very celebrated in english history .
though called simply by the name of the tower , it is , in fact , as <name> be seen by the engraving in the frontispiece , an extended group of buildings , which are of all ages , sizes , and shapes , and covering an extensive area .
it is situated below the city of london , having been originally built as a fortification for the defense of the city .
its use for this purpose has , however , long since passed away .
strafford said , in his letter to the king , " to set your majesty 's conscience at <name> , i do most humbly beseech your majesty for prevention of evils , which may happen by your refusal , to pass this <name> .
sir , my consent shall more acquit you herein to god , than all the world can do besides ; to a willing man there is no injury done ; and as by god 's <name> , i forgive all the world , with a calmness and meekness of infinite contentment to my <unk> soul , so , sir , to you i can give the life of this world with all the cheerfulness imaginable , in the just acknowledgment of your exceeding favors ; and only beg that in your goodness you would <unk> to cast your gracious regard upon my poor son and his three sisters , less or more , and no otherwise than as their unfortunate father may hereafter appear more or less guilty of this death .
god long preserve your majesty . "
on receiving this letter the king caused the <name> to be signed .
he would not do it with his own hands , but commissioned two of his council to do it in his name .
he then sent a messenger to strafford to announce the decision , and to inform him that he must prepare to die .
the messenger observed that the <name> seemed surprised ; and after hearing that the king had signed the <name> , he quoted , in a tone of despair , the words of scripture , " put not your trust in princes , nor in the sons of men , for in them is no salvation . "
historians have thought it strange that strafford should have expressed this disappointment when he had himself requested the king to resist the popular <name> no longer ; and they infer from it that he was not sincere in the request , but supposed that the king would regard it as an act of nobleness and generosity on his part , that would render him more unwilling than ever to consent to his destruction , and that he was accordingly surprised and disappointed when he found that the king had taken him at his word .
it is said , however , by some historians , that this letter was a forgery , and that it was written by some of strafford 's enemies to lead the king to resist no longer .
the reader , by perusing the letter again , can perhaps form some judgment whether such a document was more likely to have been <unk> by enemies , or really written by the unhappy prisoner himself .
the king did not entirely give up the <name> of saving his friend , even after the <name> of attainder was signed .
he addressed the following message to the house of lords .
my lords ,  i did yesterday satisfy the justice of this kingdom by passing the <name> of attainder against the <name> of strafford : but <name> being as inherent and inseparable to a king as justice , i <name> at this time in some measure to show that likewise , by suffering that unfortunate man to fulfill the natural course of his life in a close imprisonment : yet so , if ever he make the least offer to escape , or offer directly or indirectly to meddle in any sort of public business , especially with me either by message or letter , it shall cost him his life without farther process .
this , if it may be done without the <unk> of my people , <name> be an unspeakable contentment to me .
" i <name> not say that your complying with me in this my intended <name> , shall make me more willing , but certainly 'twill make me more cheerful in granting your just grievances : but if no less than his life can <unk> my people , i must say let justice be done .
thus again recommending the consideration of my intention to you , i rest , " your unalterable and affectionate friend , " <name> r. " [ illustration : strafford and laud ] the lords were inexorable .
three days from the time of signing the <name> , arrangements were made for conducting the prisoner to the scaffold .
laud , who had been his friend and <unk> in the king 's service , was confined also in the tower , awaiting his turn to come to trial .
they were not allowed to visit each other , but strafford sent word to laud requesting him to be at his window at the time when he was to pass , to bid him farewell , and to give him his blessing .
laud accordingly appeared at the window , and strafford , as he passed , asked for the <unk> 's prayers and for his blessing .
the old man , for laud was now nearly seventy years of age , attempted to speak , but he could not command himself sufficiently to express what he wished to say , and he fell back into the arms of his attendants .
" god protect you , " said strafford , and walked calmly on .
he went to the place of execution with the composure and courage of a hero .
he spoke freely to those around him , asserted his innocence , sent messages to his absent friends , and said he was ready and willing to die .
the scaffold , in such executions as this , is a platform slightly raised , with a block and chairs upon it , all covered with black cloth .
a part of the dress has to be removed just before the execution , in order that the neck of the sufferer may be fully exposed to the impending blow .
strafford made these preparations himself , and said , as he did so , that he was in no wise afraid of death , but that he should lay his head upon that block as cheerfully as he ever did upon his pillow .
* * * * * <name> found his position in no respect improved by the execution of strafford .
the commons , finding their influence and power increasing , grew more and more bold , and were from this time so absorbed in the events connected with the progress of their quarrel with the king , that they left laud to pine in his prison for about four years .
they then found time to act over again the solemn and awful scene of a trial for treason before the house of peers , the passing of a <name> of attainder , and an execution on tower hill .
laud was over seventy years of age when the ax fell upon him .
he submitted to his fate with a calmness and heroism in keeping with his age and his character .
he said , in fact , that none of his enemies could be more desirous to send him out of life than he was to go .

the way in which the king came at last to a final rupture with parliament was this .
the victory which the commons gained in the case of strafford had greatly increased their confidence and their power , and the king found , for some months afterward , that instead of being satisfied with the concessions he had made , they were continually demanding more .
the more he yielded , the more they <unk> .
they grew , in a word , bolder and bolder , in proportion to their success .
they considered themselves doing the state a great and good service by <unk> tyranny of its power .
the king , on the other hand , considered them as undermining all the foundations of good government , and as depriving him of personal rights , the most sacred and solemn that could vest in any human being .
it <name> be recollected that on former occasions , when the king had got into contention with a parliament , he had dissolved it , and either attempted to govern without one , or else had called for a new election , hoping that the new members would be more <unk> .
but he could not dissolve the parliament now .
they had provided against this danger .
at the time of the trial of strafford , they brought in a <name> into the commons providing that thenceforth the houses could not be <unk> or dissolved without their own consent .
the commons , of course , passed the <name> very readily .
the peers were more reluctant , but they did not dare to reject it .
the king was extremely unwilling to sign the <name> ; but , amid the terrible excitements and dangers of that trial , he was overborne by the influences of danger and <unk> which surrounded him .
he signed the <name> .
of course the commons were , thereafter , their own masters .
however dangerous or destructive the king might consider their course of conduct to be , he could now no longer arrest it , as heretofore , by a dissolution .
he went on , therefore , till the close of <unk> , yielding slowly and reluctantly , and with many struggles , but still all the time yielding , to the resistless current which bore him along .
at last he resolved to yield no longer .
after retreating so long , he determined suddenly and desperately to turn back and attack his enemies .
the whole world looked on with astonishment at such a sudden change of his policy .
the measure which he resorted to was this .
he determined to select a number of the most efficient and prominent men in parliament , who had been leaders in the proceedings against him , and demand their arrest , imprisonment , and trial , on a charge of high treason .
the king was influenced to do this partly by the advice of the <name> , and of the ladies of the court , and other persons who did not understand how deep and strong the torrent was which they thus urged him to attempt to stem .
they thought that if he would show a little courage and energy in facing these men , they would yield in their turn , and that their boldness and success was owing , in a great measure , to the king 's want of spirit in resisting them .
" strike boldly at them , " said they ; " seize the leaders ; have them tried , and condemned , and executed .
threaten the rest with the same fate ; and follow up these measures with energetic and decisive action , and you <name> soon make a change in the aspect of affairs . "
the king adopted this policy , and he did make a change in the aspect of affairs , but not such a change as his advisers had anticipated .
the commons were thrown suddenly into a state of astonishment one day by the appearance of a king 's officer in the house , who rose and read articles of a charge of treason against five of the most influential and popular members .
the officer asked that a committee should be appointed to hear the evidence against them which the king was preparing .
the commons , on hearing this , immediately voted , that if any person should attempt even to seize the papers of the persons accused , it should be lawful for them to resist such an attempt by every means in their power .
the next day another officer appeared at the bar of the house of commons , and spoke as follows .
" i am commanded by the king 's majesty , my master , upon my allegiance , that i should come to the house of commons , and require of mr. speaker five gentlemen , members of the house of commons ; and those gentlemen being delivered , i am commanded to arrest them in his majesty 's name , on a charge of high treason . "
the commons , on hearing this demand , voted that they would take it into consideration .
the king 's friends and advisers urged him to follow the matter up vigorously .
every thing depended , they said , on firmness and decision .
the next day , accordingly , the king determined to go himself to the house , and make the demand in person .
a <name> of the court , who was made acquainted with this plan , sent notice of it to the house .
in going , the king took his guard with him , and several personal attendants .
the number of soldiers was said to be five hundred .
he left this great retinue at the door , and he himself entered the house .
the commons , when they heard that he was coming , had ordered the five members who were accused to withdraw .
they went out just before the king came in .
the king advanced to the speaker 's chair , took his seat , and made the following address .
" gentlemen ,  i am sorry for this occasion of coming unto you .
yesterday i sent a sergeant at arms upon a very important occasion to apprehend some that by my command were accused of high treason ; <unk> i did expect obedience and not a message .
and i must declare unto you here , that albeit no king that ever was in england shall be more careful of your privileges , to maintain them to the uttermost of his power , than i shall be ; yet you must know that in cases of treason no person hath a privilege ; and therefore i am come to know if any of those persons that were accused are here .
for i must tell you , gentlemen , that so long as these persons that i have accused ( for no slight crime , but for treason ) are here , i can not expect that this house <name> be in the right way that i do heartily wish it .
therefore i am come to tell you that i must have them wherever i find them . "
after looking around , and finding that the members in question were not in the hall , he continued : " well !
since i see the birds are flown , i do expect from you that you shall send them unto me as soon as they return hither .
but i assure you , on the word of a king , i never did intend any force , but shall proceed against them in a legal and fair way , for i never meant any other .
" i <name> trouble you no more , but tell you i do expect , as soon as they come to the house , you <name> send them to me , otherwise i must take my own course to find them . "
the king 's coming thus into the house of commons , and demanding in person that they should act according to his instructions , was a very extraordinary circumstance  perhaps unparalleled in english history .
it produced the greatest excitement .
when he had finished his address , he turned to the speaker and asked him where those men were .
he had his guard ready at the door to seize them .
it is difficult for us , in this country , to understand fully to how severe a test this sudden question put the presence of mind and courage of the speaker ; for we can not realize the profound and awful deference which was felt in those days for the command of a king .
the speaker gained great applause for the manner in which he stood the trial .
he fell upon his knees before the great potentate who had addressed him , and said , " i have , sir , neither eyes to see , nor tongue to speak , in this place , but as the house is pleased to direct me , whose servant i am .
and i humbly ask pardon that i can not give any other answer to what your majesty is pleased to demand of me . "
the house was immediately in a state of great excitement and confusion .
they called out " privilege !
privilege !  " meaning that their privileges were violated .
they immediately adjourned .
news of the affair spread every where with the greatest rapidity , and produced universal and intense excitement .
the king 's friends were astonished at such an act of rashness and folly , which , it is said , only one of the king 's advisers knew anything about , and he immediately fled .
the five members accused went that night into the city of london , and called on the government and people of london to protect them .
the people armed themselves .
in a word , the king found at night that he had raised a very threatening and terrible storm .
the commons met the next morning , but did not attempt to transact business .
they simply voted that it was useless for them to proceed with their deliberations , while exposed to such <unk> of their rights .
they appointed a committee of twenty-four to inquire into and report the circumstances of the king 's intrusion into their councils , and to consider how this breach of their privileges could be repaired .
they ordered this committee to sit in the city of london , where they might <name> to be safe from such interruptions , and then the house adjourned for a week , to await the result of the <unk> deliberations .
the committee went to london .
in the mean time , news went all over the kingdom that the house of commons had been compelled to suspend its sittings on account of an illegal and <unk> interference with their proceedings on the part of the king .
the king was alarmed ; but those who had advised him to adopt this measure told him that he must not falter now .
he must persevere and <name> his point , or all would be lost .
he accordingly did persevere .
he brought troops and arms to his palace at whitehall , to be ready to defend it in case of attack .
he sent in to london , and ordered the lord mayor to assemble the city authorities at the <unk> , which is the great city hall of london ; and then , with a retinue of noblemen , he went in to meet them .
the people shouted , " privileges of parliament !
privileges of parliament !  " as he passed along .
some called out , " to your tents , o <name> !  " which was the ancient hebrew cry of rebellion .
the king , however , persevered .
when he reached the <unk> , he addressed the city authorities thus : " gentlemen ,  i am come to demand such persons as i have already accused of high treason , and do believe are shrouded in the city .
i <name> no good man <name> keep them from me .
their offenses are treason and <unk> of a high nature .
i <name> your assistance , that they may be brought to a legal trial . "
three days after this the king issued a proclamation , addressed to all magistrates and officers of justice every where , to arrest the accused members and <name> them to the tower .
in the mean time , the committee of twenty-four continued their session in london , examining witnesses and preparing their report .
when the time arrived for the house of commons to meet again , which was on the 11th of <name> , the city made preparations to have the committee escorted in an imposing manner from the <unk> to westminster .
a vast amount of the intercommunication and traffic between different portions of the city then , as now , took place upon the river , though in those days it was managed by <unk> , who rowed small <unk> to and fro .
innumerable steamboats take the place of the <unk> at the present day , and <unk> and engineers have superseded the <unk> .
the <unk> were then , however , a large and formidable body , banded together , like the other trades of london , in one great organization .
this great company turned out on this occasion , and attended the committee in barges on the river , while the military companies of the city marched along the streets upon the land .
the committee themselves went in barges on the water , and all london flocked to see the spectacle .
the king , hearing of these arrangements , was alarmed for his personal safety , and left his palace at whitehall to go to hampton court , which was a little way out of town .
the committee , after entering the house , reported that the transaction which they had been considering constituted a high breach of the privileges of the house , and was a <unk> act , tending to a <unk> of the peace of the kingdom ; and that the privileges of parliament , so violated and broken , could not be sufficiently <unk> , unless his majesty would be pleased to inform them who advised him to do such a deed .
the king was more and more seriously alarmed .
he found that the storm of public <unk> and indignation was too great for him to withstand .
he began to fear for his own safety more than ever .
he removed from hampton court to windsor castle , a stronger place , and more remote from london than hampton court ; and he now determined to give up the contest .
he sent a message , therefore , to the house , saying that , on further reflection , since so many persons had doubts whether his proceedings against the five members were consistent with the privileges of parliament , he would <unk> them , and the whole subject might rest until the minds of men were more composed , and then , if he proceeded against the accused members at all , he would do so in a manner to which no exception could be taken .
he said , also , he would henceforth be as careful of their privileges as he should be of his own life or crown .
thus he acknowledged himself vanquished in the struggle , but the acknowledgment came too late to save him .
the excitement increased , and spread in every direction .
the party of the king and that of the parliament disputed for a few months about these occurrences , and others growing out of them , and then each began to <unk> and struggle to get possession of the military power of the kingdom .
the king , finding himself not safe in the vicinity of london , retreated to york , and began to assemble and organize his followers .
parliament sent him a declaration that if he did not <unk> the forces which he was assembling , they should be compelled to provide measures for securing the peace of the kingdom .
the king replied by proclamations calling upon his subjects to join his standard .
in a word , before midsummer , the country was plunged in the horrors of civil war .
a civil war , that is , a war between two parties in the same country , is generally far more savage and sanguinary than any other .
the hatred and the animosities which it creates , <unk> throughout the country , and produce universal conflict and misery .
if there were a war between <name> and england , there might be one , or perhaps two invading armies of frenchmen attempting to penetrate into the interior .
all england would be united against them .
husbands and wives , parents and children , neighbors and friends , would be drawn together more closely than ever ; while the awful scenes of war and bloodshed , the excitement , the passion , the terror , would be confined to a few detached spots , or to a few lines of march which the invading armies had occupied .
in a civil war , however , it is very different .
every distinct portion of the country , every village and hamlet , and sometimes almost every family , is divided against itself .
the hostility and hatred , too , between the combatants , is always far more intense and bitter than that which is felt against a foreign foe .
we might at first be surprised at this .
we might imagine that where men are contending with their neighbors and <unk> , the recollection of past friendships and good-will , and various lingering ties of regard , would moderate the fierceness of their anger , and make them more considerate and forbearing .
but this is not found to be the case .
each party considers the other as not only enemies , but traitors , and accordingly they hate and abhor each other with a double intensity .
if an englishman has a frenchman to combat , he meets him with a murderous impetuosity , it is true , but without any special bitterness of animosity .
he expects the frenchman to be his enemy .
he even thinks he has a sort of natural right to be so .
he <name> kill him if he can ; but then , if he takes him prisoner , there is nothing in his feelings toward him to prevent his treating him with generosity , and even with kindness .
he hates him , but there is a sort of <unk> in his hatred , after all .
on the other hand , when he fights against his countrymen in a civil war , he <unk> and hates with <unk> bitterness the <unk> ingratitude which he thinks his neighbors and friends evince in turning enemies to their country .
he can see no honesty , no truth , no courage in any thing they do .
they are infinitely worse , in his estimation , than the most ferocious of foreign foes .
civil war is , consequently , always the means of far wider and more terrible mischief than any other human calamity .
in the contention between <name> and the parliament , the various elements of the social state adhered to one side or the other , according to their natural <unk> .
the <unk> generally joined the king , the presbyterians the parliament .
the gentry and the nobility favored the king ; the mechanics , artisans , merchants , and common people the parliament .
the rural districts of country , which were under the control of the great <unk> , the king ; the cities and towns , the parliament .
the <name> , and fashionable , and worldly , the king ; the <unk> and austere , the parliament .
thus every thing was divided .
the quarrel <unk> to every hamlet and to every fireside , and the peace and happiness of the realm were effectually destroyed .
both sides began to raise armies and to prepare for war .
before commencing hostilities , however , the king was persuaded by his counselors to send a messenger to london and propose some terms of accommodation .
he accordingly sent the <name> of southampton to the house of peers , and two other persons to the house of commons .
he had no expectation , probably , of making peace , but he wanted to gain time to get his army together , and also to strengthen his cause among the people by showing a disposition to do all in his power to avoid open war .
the messengers of the king went to london , and made their appearance in the two houses of parliament .
the house of lords ordered the <name> of southampton to withdraw , and to send his communication in writing , and in the mean time to retire out of london , and wait for their answer .
the house of commons , in the same spirit of hostility and defiance , ordered the messengers which had been sent to them to come to the bar , like humble <unk> or criminals , and make their communication there .
the propositions of the king to the houses of parliament were , that they should appoint a certain number of commissioners , and he also the same number , to meet and confer together in <name> of agreeing upon some conditions of peace .
the houses passed a vote in reply , declaring that they had been doing all in their power to preserve the peace of the kingdom , while the king had been interrupting and disturbing it by his military gatherings , and by proclamations , in which they were called traitors ; and that they could enter into no treaty with him until he disbanded the armies which he had collected , and recalled his proclamations .
to this the king replied that he had never intended to call them traitors ; and that when they would recall their declarations and votes <unk> those who adhered to him as traitors , he would recall his proclamations .
thus messages passed back and forth two or three times , each party <unk> the other , and neither willing to make the concessions which the other required .
at last all <name> of an accommodation was abandoned , and both sides prepared for war .
the nobility and gentry flocked to the king 's standard .
they brought their plate , their jewels , and their money , to provide funds .
some of them brought their servants .
there were two companies in the king's guard , one of which consisted of gentlemen , and the other of their servants .
these two companies were always kept together .
there was the greatest zeal and enthusiasm among the upper classes to serve the king , and equal zeal and enthusiasm among the common people to serve the parliament .
the war continued for four years .
during all this time the armies marched and <unk> all over the kingdom , carrying ruin and destruction wherever they went , and plunging the whole country in misery .
[ illustration : the king 's adherents entering york . ]
at one of the battles which was fought , the celebrated <name> hampden , the man who would not pay his ship money , was slain .
he had been a very energetic and efficient officer on the parliamentary side , and was much dreaded by the forces of the king .
at one of the battles between <name> <name> , <name> 's nephew , and the army of the parliament , the <name> brought to the king 's camp a large number of prisoners which he had taken .
one of the prisoners said he was confident that hampden was hurt , for he saw him riding off the field before the battle was over , with his head hanging down , and his hands clasping the neck of his horse .
they heard the next day that he had been wounded in the shoulder .
inflammation and fever ensued , and he died a few days afterward in great agony .
this <name> <name> was a very famous character in all these wars .
he was young and ardent , and full of courage and enthusiasm .
he was always foremost , and ready to embark in the most daring undertakings .
he was the son of the king 's sister <name> , who married the <unk> <unk> , as narrated in a preceding chapter .
he was famous not only for his military skill and attainments , but for his knowledge of science , and for his ingenuity in many philosophical arts .
there is a mode of engraving called <unk> , which is somewhat easier of execution than the common mode , and produces a peculiar effect .
<name> <name> is said to have been the inventor of it , though , as is the case with almost all other inventions , there is a dispute about it .
he discovered a mode of dropping melted glass into water so as to form little pear-shaped globules , with a long slender tail .
these globules have this remarkable property , that if the tip of the tail is broken off ever so gently , the whole flies into atoms with an explosion .
these drops of glass are often exhibited at the present day , and are called <name> <name> 's drops .
the <name> also discovered a very tenacious composition of metals for casting cannon .
as artillery is necessarily very heavy , and very difficult to be transported on marches and upon the field of battle , it becomes very important to discover such metallic compounds as have the greatest strength and tenacity in resisting the force of an explosion .
<name> <name> invented such a compound , which is called by his name .
there were not only a great many battles and fierce encounters between the two great parties in this civil war , but there were also , at times , temporary <unk> of the hostilities , and negotiations for peace .
but it is very hard to make peace between two powers engaged in civil war .
each considers the other as acting the part of rebels and traitors , and there is a difficulty , almost insuperable , in the way of even opening negotiations between them .
still the people became tired of the war .
at one time , when the king had made some propositions which the parliament would not accept , an immense assemblage of women collected together , with white ribbons in their hats , to go to the house of commons with a petition for peace .
when they reached the door of the hall their number was five thousand .
they called out , " peace !
peace !
give us those traitors that are against peace , that we may tear them to pieces . "
the guards who were stationed at the door were ordered to fire at this crowd , loading their guns , however , only with powder .
this , it was thought , would frighten them away ; but the women only laughed at the volley , and returned it with stones and <unk> , and drove the guards away .
other troops were then sent for , who charged upon the women with their swords , and cut them in their faces and hands , and thus at length dispersed them .
during the progress of the war , the <name> returned from the continent and joined the king .
she had some difficulty , however , and encountered some personal danger , in her efforts to return to her husband .
the <unk> , who had command of the english ships off the coast , received orders to intercept her .
he watched for her .
she contrived , however , to elude his vigilance , though there were four ships in her convoy .
she landed at a town called burlington , or <unk> , in yorkshire .
this town stands in a very picturesque situation , a little south of a famous promontory called <unk> head , of which there is a beautiful view from the pier of the town .
the <name> succeeded in landing here .
on her arrival at the town , she found herself worn down with the anxiety and fatigue of the voyage , and she wished to stop a few days to rest .
she took up her residence in a house which was on the quay , and , of course , near the water .
the quay , as it is called , in these towns , is a street on the margin of the water , with a wall but no houses next the sea .
the <unk> arrived at the town the second night after the <name> had landed .
he was vexed that his expected prize had escaped him .
he brought his ships up near to the town , and began to fire toward the house in which the <name> was lodging .
[ illustration : the landing of the <name> ] this was at five o'clock in the morning .
the <name> and her attendants were in their beds , asleep .
the reports of the cannon from the ships , the terrific whistling of the balls through the air , and the crash of the houses which the balls struck , aroused the whole village from their slumbers , and threw them into consternation .
the people soon came to the house where the <name> was lodging , and begged her to fly .
they said that the neighboring houses were blown to pieces , and that her own would soon be destroyed , and she herself would be killed .
they may , however , have been influenced more by a regard to their own safety than to hers in these injunctions , as it must have been a great object with the villagers to effect the immediate removal of a visitor who was the means of bringing upon them so terrible a danger .
these urgent entreaties of the villagers were soon enforced by two cannon-balls , which fell , one after another , upon the roof of the house , and , crashing their way through the roof and the floors , went down , without seeming to regard the resistance , from the top to the bottom .
the <name> hastily put on her clothes , and went forth with her attendants on foot , the balls from the ships whistling after them all the way .
one of her servants was killed .
the rest of the fugitives , finding their exposure so great , stopped at a sort of trench which they came to , at the end of a field , such as is dug commonly , in england , on one side of the hedge to make the barrier more impassable to the animals which it is intended to confine .
this trench , with the embankment formed by the earth thrown out of it , on which the hedge is usually planted , afforded them protection .
they sought shelter in it , and remained there for two hours , like besiegers in the approaches to a town , the balls passing over their heads <unk> , though sometimes covering them with the earth which they threw up as they bounded by .
at length the tide began to ebb , and the <unk> was in danger of being left aground .
he weighed his anchors and withdrew , and the <name> and her party were relieved .
such a <unk> of a helpless and defenseless woman is a <unk> which could hardly take place except in a civil war .
the <name> rejoined her husband , and she rendered him essential service in many ways .
she had personal influence enough to raise both money and men for his armies , and so contributed very essentially to the strength of his party .
at last she returned to the continent again , and went to <name> , where she was still actively employed in promoting his cause .
at one of the battles in which the king was defeated , the parliamentary army seized his baggage , and found among his papers his correspondence with the <name> .
they very <unk> ordered it to be published , as the letters seemed to show a vigorous determination on the part of the king not to yield in the contest without obtaining from the parliament and their adherents full and ample concessions to his claims .
as time rolled on , the strength of the <name> party gradually wasted away , while that of parliament seemed to increase , until it became evident that the latter would , in the end , obtain the victory .
the king retreated from place to place , followed by his foes , and growing weaker and more discouraged after every conflict .
his son , the <name> of wales , was then about fifteen years of age .
he sent him to the western part of the island , with directions that , if affairs should still go against him , the boy should be taken in time out of the country , and join his mother in <name> .
the danger grew more and more imminent , and they who had charge of the young <name> sent him first to <unk> , and then to jersey  islands in the channel  whence he made his escape to <name> , and joined his mother .
fifteen years afterward he returned to london with great pomp and parade , and was placed upon the throne by universal <unk> .
at last the king himself , after being driven from one place of refuge to another , retreated to oxford and intrenched himself there .
here he spent the <name> of <unk> in extreme depression and distress .
his friends deserted him ; his resources were expended ; his hopes were extinguished .
he sent proposals of peace to the parliament , and offered , himself , to come to london , if they would <name> him a <unk> .
in reply , they forbade him to come .
they would listen to no propositions , and would make no terms .
the case , they saw , was in their own hands , and they determined on <unk> submission .
they hemmed the king in on all sides at his retreat in oxford , and reduced him to despair .
in the mean time , the scots , a year or two before this , had raised an army and crossed the northern frontier , and entered england .
they were against monarchy and <unk> , but they were , in some respects , a separate enemy from those against whom the king had been contending so long ; and he began to think that he had perhaps better fall into their hands than into those of his english foes , if he must submit to one or to the other .
he hesitated for some time what course to take ; but at last , after receiving representations of the favorable feeling which prevailed in regard to him in the scottish army , he concluded to make his escape from oxford and surrender himself to them .
he accordingly did so , and the civil war was ended .

the circumstances of king <name> 's surrender to the scots were these .
he knew that he was surrounded by his enemies in oxford , and that they would not allow him to escape if they could prevent it .
he and his friends , therefore , formed the following plan to elude them .
they sent word to the commanders of each of the several gates of the city , on a certain day , that during the ensuing night three men would have to pass out on business of the king 's , and that when the men should appear and give a certain signal , they were to be allowed to pass .
the officer at each gate received this command without knowing that a similar one had been sent to the others .
[ illustration : newark . ]
accordingly , about midnight , the parties of men were dispatched , and they went out at the several gates .
the king himself was in one of these parties .
there were two other persons with him .
one of these persons was a certain mr. <unk> , and the king was disguised as his servant .
they were all on horseback , and the king had a valise upon the horse behind him , so as to complete his disguise .
this was on the 27th of <name> .
the next day , or very soon after , it was known at oxford that his majesty was gone , but no one could tell in what direction , for there was no means even of deciding by which of the gates he had left the city .
the scotch were , at this time , encamped before the town of newark , which is on the <name> , in the heart of england , and about one hundred and twenty miles north of london .
there was a magnificent castle at newark in those days , which made the place very strong .
the town held out for the king ; though the scots had been investing it for some time , they had not yet succeeded in compelling the governor to surrender .
the king concluded to proceed to newark and enter the scottish camp .
he considered it , or , rather , wished it to be considered that he was coming to join them as their monarch .
they were going to consider it surrendering to them as their prisoner .
the king himself must have known how it would be , but it made his sense of humiliation a little less poignant to <name> this illusion with him as long as it was possible to maintain it .
as soon as the parliament found that the king had made his escape from oxford , they were alarmed , and on the 4th of may they issued an order to this effect , " that what person <unk> should harbor and conceal , or should know of the <unk> or concealing of the king 's person , and should not immediately reveal it to the speakers of both houses , should be proceeded against as a traitor to the commonwealth , and die without <name> . "
the proclamation of this order , however , did not result in arresting the flight of the king .
on the day after it was issued , he arrived safely at newark .
the scottish general , whose name was <name> , immediately represented to the king that for his own safety it was necessary that they should retire toward the northern frontier ; but they could not so retire , he said , unless newark should first surrender .
they accordingly induced the king to send in orders to the governor of the castle to give up the place .
the scots took possession of it , and , after having garrisoned it , moved with their army toward the north , the king and general <name> being in the van .
they treated the king with great distinction , but guarded him very closely , and sent word to the parliament that he was in their possession .
there ensued long negotiations and much debate .
the question was , at first , whether the english or scotch should have the disposal of the king 's person .
the english said that they , and not the scots , were the party making war upon him ; that they had conquered his armies , and hemmed him in , and reduced him to the necessity of submission ; and that he had been taken captive on english soil , and ought , consequently , to be delivered into the hands of the english parliament .
the scots replied that though he had been taken in england , he was their king as well as the king of england , and had made himself their enemy ; and that , as he had fallen into their hands , he ought to remain at their disposal .
to this the english rejoined , that the scots , in taking him , had not acted on their own account , but as the allies , and , as it were , the agents of the english , and that they ought to consider the king as a captive taken for them , and hold him subject to their disposal .
they could not settle the question .
in the mean time the scottish army <name> back toward the frontier , taking the king with them .
about this time a negotiation sprung up between the parliament and the scots for the payment of the expenses which the scottish army had incurred in their campaign .
the scots sent in an account amounting to two millions of pounds .
the english objected to a great many of the charges , and offered them two hundred thousand pounds .
finally it was settled that four hundred thousand pounds should be paid .
this arrangement was made early in <name> .
in <name> the scots agreed to give up the king into the hands of the english parliament .
the world accused the scots of selling their king to his enemies for four hundred thousand pounds .
the scots denied that there was any connection between the two transactions above referred to .
they received the money on account of their just claims ; and they afterward agreed to deliver up the king , because they thought it right and proper so to do .
the friends of the king , however , were never satisfied that there was not a secret understanding between the parties , that the money paid was not the price of the king 's delivery ; and as this delivery resulted in his death , they called it the price of blood .
<name> was at newcastle when they came to this decision .
his mind had been more at ease since his surrender to the scots , and he was accustomed to amuse himself and while away the time of his captivity by various games .
he was playing chess when the intelligence was brought to him that he was to be delivered up to the english parliament .
it was communicated to him in a letter .
he read it , and then went on with his game , and none of those around him could perceive by his air and manner that the intelligence which the letter contained was any thing extraordinary .
perhaps he was not aware of the magnitude of the change in his condition and prospects which the communication announced .
there was at this time , at a town called <unk> or <unk> , in <unk> , a beautiful palace which was known by the name of <unk> house .
king <name> 's mother had purchased this palace for him when he was the duke of york , in the early part of his life , while his father , king <name> , was on the throne , and his older brother was the heir apparent .
it was a very stately and beautiful edifice .
the house was fitted up in a very handsome manner , and all suitable accommodations provided for the king 's reception .
he had many attendants , and every desirable convenience and luxury of living ; but , though the war was over , there was still kept up between the king and his enemies a petty contest about forms and <unk> , which resulted from the spirit of <unk> which characterized the age .
the king wanted his own episcopal <unk> .
the parliament would not consent to this , but sent him two presbyterian <unk> .
the king would not allow them to say <name> at the table , but performed this duty himself ; and on the sabbath , when they preached in his chapel , he never would attend .
one singular instance of this sort of <unk> , and of the king's presence of mind under the action of it , took place while the king was at newcastle .
they took him one day to the chapel in the castle to hear a scotch presbyterian who was preaching to the garrison .
the scotchman preached a long discourse pointed expressly at the king .
those preachers prided themselves on the <unk> with which , on such occasions , they discharged what they called their duty .
to cap the climax of his faithfulness , the preacher gave out , at the close of the sermon , the hymn , thus : " we <name> sing the <unk> <unk> : " 'why dost thou , tyrant , boast thyself , thy wicked works to praise ? ' "
as the congregation were about to commence the singing , the king cast his eye along the <name> , and found in the <unk> hymn one which he thought would be more appropriate .
he rose , and said , in a very audible manner , " we <name> sing the <unk> <unk> : " 'have <name> , lord , on me i pray , for men would me devour . ' "
the congregation , moved by a sudden impulse of religious generosity extremely unusual in those days , immediately sang the <unk> which the king had chosen .
while he was at <unk> the king used sometimes to go , escorted by a guard , to certain neighboring villages where there were <unk> .
one day , while he was going on one of these excursions , a man , in the dress of a laborer , appeared standing on a bridge as he passed , and handed him a packet .
the commissioners who had charge of <name>  for some of them always attended him on these excursions  seized the man .
the packet was from the <name> .
the king told the commissioners that the letter was only to ask him some question about the disposal of his son , the young <name> , who was then with her in <name> .
they seemed satisfied , but they sent the disguised messenger to london , and the parliament committed him to prison , and sent down word to dismiss all <name> 's own attendants , and to keep him thenceforth in more strict confinement .
in the mean time , the parliament , having finished the war , were ready to <unk> the army .
but the army did not wish to be disbanded .
they would not be disbanded .
the officers knew very well that if their troops were dismissed , and they were to return to their homes as private citizens , all their importance would be gone .
there followed long debates and negotiations between the army and the parliament , which ended , at last , in an open rupture .
it is almost always so at the end of a revolution .
the military power is found to have become too strong for the civil institutions of the country to control it .
<name> cromwell , who afterward became so distinguished in the days of the commonwealth , was at this time becoming the most influential leader of the army .
he was not the commander-in-chief in form , but he was the great <unk> and manager in fact .
he was a man of great sternness and energy of character , and was always ready for the most prompt and daring action .
he conceived the design of seizing the king 's person at <unk> , so as to take him away from the control of the parliament , and transfer him to that of the army .
this plan was executed on the 4th of <name> , about two months after the king had been taken to <unk> house .
the abduction was effected in the following manner .
cromwell detached a strong party of choice troops , under the command of an officer by the name of <name> , to <name> the plan into effect .
these troops were all horsemen , so that their movements could be made with the greatest celerity .
they arrived at <unk> house at midnight .
the cornet , for that was the military title by which <name> was designated , <name> up his horsemen about the palace , and demanded entrance .
before his company arrived , however , there had been an alarm that they were coming , and the guards had been doubled .
the officers in command asked the cornet what was his name and business .
he replied that he was cornet <name> , and that his business was to speak to the king .
they asked him by whom he was sent , and he replied that he was sent by himself , and that he must and would see the king .
they then commanded their soldiers to stand by their arms , and be ready to fire when the word should be given .
they , however , perceived that <name> and his force were a detachment from the army to which they themselves belonged , and concluding to receive them as brothers , they opened the gates and let them in .
the cornet stationed sentinels at the doors of those apartments of the castle which were occupied by the scotch commissioners who had the king in charge , and then went himself directly to the king 's chamber .
he had a pistol loaded and cocked in his hand .
he knocked at the door .
there were four grooms in waiting : they rebuked him for making such a disturbance at that time of the night , and told him that he should wait until the morning if he had any communication to make to the king .
the cornet would not accede to this proposition , but knocked violently at the door , the servants being deterred from interfering by dread of the loaded pistol , and by the air and manner of their visitor , which told them very plainly that he was not to be trifled with .
the king finally heard the disturbance , and , on learning the cause , sent out word that <name> must go away and wait till morning , for he would not get up to see him at that hour .
the cornet , as one of the historians of the time expresses it , " <unk> and retired . "
the next morning he had an interview with the king .
when he was introduced to the king 's apartment in the morning , the king said that he wished to have the scotch commissioners present at the interview .
<name> replied that the commissioners had nothing to do now but to return to the parliament at london .
the king then said that he wished to see his instructions .
the cornet replied that he would show them to him , and he sent out to order his horsemen to parade in the inner court of the palace , where the king could see them from his windows ; and then , pointing them out to the king , he said , " these , sir , are my instructions . "
the king , who , in all the trials and troubles of his life of excitement and danger , took every thing quietly and calmly looked at the men attentively .
they were fine troops , well mounted and armed .
he then turned to the cornet , and said , with a smile , that " his instructions were in fair characters , and could be read without spelling . "
the cornet then said that his orders were to take the king away with him .
the king declined going , unless the commissioners went too .
the cornet made no objection , saying that the commissioners might do as they pleased about accompanying him , but that he himself must go .
the party set off from <unk> and traveled two days , stopping at night at the houses of friends to their cause .
they reached cambridge , where the leading officers of the army received the king , rendering him every possible <name> of deference and respect .
from cambridge he was conducted by the leaders of the army from town to town , remaining sometimes several days at a place .
he was attended by a strong guard , and was treated every where with the utmost consideration and honor .
he was allowed some little <name> , in riding out and in amusements , but every precaution was taken to prevent the possibility of an escape .
the people collected every where into the places through which he had to pass , and his <unk> was constantly thronged .
this was not altogether on account of their respect and veneration for him as king , but it arose partly from a very singular cause .
there is a certain disease called the <unk> , which in former times had the name of the king 's evil .
it is a very unmanageable and obstinate disorder , resisting all ordinary modes of treatment ; but in the days of king <name> , it was universally believed by the common people of england , that if a king touched a patient afflicted with this disease , he would recover .
this was the reason why it was called the king 's evil .
it was the evil that kings only could cure .
now , as kings seldom traveled much about their dominions , whenever one did make such a journey , the people embraced the opportunity to bring all the cases which could possibly be considered as <unk> to the line of his route , in order that he might touch the persons afflicted and heal them .
in the course of the summer the king was conducted to hampton court , a beautiful palace on the thames , a short distance above london .
here he remained for some time .
he had an interview here with two of his children .
the oldest son was still in <name> .
the two whom he saw here were the duke of gloucester and the <name> <name> .
he found that they were under the care of a nobleman of high rank , and that they were treated with great consideration .
<name> was extremely gratified and pleased with seeing these members of his family again , after so long a separation .
his feelings of domestic affection were very strong .
the king remained at hampton court two or three months .
while he was here , london , and all the region about it , was kept in a continual state of excitement by the contentions of the army and parliament , and the endless negotiations which they attempted with each other and with the king .
during all this time the king was in a sort of elegant and honorable imprisonment in his palace at hampton court ; but he found the restraints to which he was subjected , and the harassing cares which the contests between these two great powers brought upon him , so great , that he determined to make his escape from the <unk> which bound him .
he very probably thought that he could again raise his standard , and collect an army to fight in his cause .
or perhaps he thought of making his escape from the country altogether .
it is not improbable that he was not decided himself which of these plans to pursue , but left the question to be determined by the circumstances in which he should find himself when he had regained his freedom .
at any rate , he made his escape .
one evening , about ten o'clock , attendants came into his room at hampton court , and found that he had gone .
there were some letters upon the table which he had left , directed to the parliament , to the general of the army , and to the officer who had guarded him at hampton court .
the king had left the palace an hour or two before .
he passed out at a private door , which admitted him to a park connected with the palace .
he went through the park by a walk which led down to the water , where there was a boat ready for him .
he crossed the river in the boat , and on the opposite shore he found several officers and some horses ready to receive him .
he mounted one of the horses , and the party rode rapidly away .
they traveled all night , and arrived , toward morning , at the residence of a countess on whose attachment to him , and fidelity , he placed great reliance .
the countess concealed him in her house , though it was understood by all concerned that this was only a temporary place of refuge .
he could not long be concealed here , and her residence was not provided with any means of defense ; so that , immediately on their arrival at the countess 's , the king and the few friends who were with him began to concert plans for a more secure retreat .
the house of the countess was on the southern coast of england , near the isle of wight .
there was a famous castle in those days upon this island , near the center of it , called <unk> castle .
the ruins of it , which are very extensive , still remain .
this castle was under the charge of colonel hammond , who was at that time governor of the island .
colonel hammond was a near relative of one of king <unk> <unk> , and the king thought it probable that he would espouse his cause .
he accordingly sent two of the gentlemen who had accompanied him to the isle of wight to see colonel hammond , and inquire of him whether he would receive and protect the king if he would come to him .
but he charged them not to let hammond know where he was , unless he would first solemnly promise to protect him , and not subject him to any restraint .
[ illustration : <unk> castle . ]
the messengers went , and , to the king 's surprise , brought back hammond with them .
the king asked them whether they had got his written promise to protect him .
they answered no , but that they could depend upon him as a man of honor .
the king was alarmed .
" then you have betrayed me , " said he , " and i am his prisoner . "
the messengers were then , in their turn , alarmed at having thus disappointed and displeased the king , and they offered to kill hammond on the spot , and to provide some other means of securing the king 's safety .
the king , however , would not sanction any such proceeding , but put himself under hammond 's charge , and was conveyed to <unk> castle .
he was received with every <name> of respect , but was very carefully guarded .
it was about the middle of november that these events took place .
hammond notified the parliament that king <name> was in his hands , and sent for directions from them as to what he should do .
parliament required that he should be carefully guarded , and they appropriated <unk> for the expenses of his support .
the king remained in this confinement more than a year , while the parliament and the army were struggling for the possession of the kingdom .
he spent his time , during this long period in various pursuits calculated to beguile the weary days , and he sometimes planned schemes for escape .
there were also a great many fruitless negotiations attempted between the king and the parliament , which resulted in nothing but to make the breach between them wider and wider .
sometimes the king was silent and depressed .
at other times he seemed in his usual spirits .
he read serious books a great deal , and wrote .
there is a famous book , which was found in manuscript after his death among his papers , in his handwriting , which it is supposed he wrote at this time .
he was allowed to take walks upon the castle wall , which was very extensive , and he had some other amusements which served to occupy his leisure time .
he found his confinement , however , in spite of all these <unk> , wearisome and hard to bear .
there were some schemes attempted to enable him to regain his <name> .
there was one very desperate attempt .
it seems that hammond , suspecting that the king was plotting an escape , dismissed the king's own servants and put others in their places  persons in whom he supposed he could more implicitly rely .
one of these men , whose name was burley , was exasperated at being thus dismissed .
he went through the town of <unk> , beating a drum , and calling upon the people to rise and rescue their sovereign from his captivity .
the governor of the castle , hearing of this , sent out a small body of men , arrested burley , and hanged and quartered him .
the king was made a close prisoner immediately after this attempt .
notwithstanding this , another attempt was soon made by the king himself , which came much nearer succeeding .
there was a man by the name of osborne , whom hammond employed as a personal attendant upon the king .
he was what was called gentleman usher .
the king succeeded in gaining this person 's favor so much by his <unk> and his general demeanor , that one day he put a little paper into one of the king 's gloves , which it was a part of his office to hold on certain occasions , and on this paper he had written that he was at the king's service .
at first <name> was afraid that this offer was only a treacherous one ; but at length he confided in him .
in the mean time , there was a certain man by the name of <name> in the garrison , who conceived the design of enticing the king away from the castle on the promise of promoting his escape , and then murdering him .
<name> thought that this plan would please the parliament , and that he himself , and those who should aid him in the enterprise , would be rewarded .
he proposed this scheme to osborne , and asked him to join in the execution of it .
osborne made the whole plan known to the king .
the king , on reflection , said to osborne , " very well ; continue in communication with <name> , and help him mature his plan .
let him thus aid in getting me out of the castle , and we <name> make such arrangements as to prevent the assassination . "
osborne did so .
he also gained over some other soldiers who were employed as sentinels near the place of escape .
osborne and <name> furnished the king with a saw and a file , by means of which he sawed off some iron bars which guarded one of his windows .
they were then , on a certain night , to be ready with a few attendants on the outside to receive the king as he descended , and convey him away .
in the mean time , <name> and osborne had each obtained a number of confederates , those of the former supposing that the plan was to assassinate the king , while those of the latter understood that the plan was to assist him in escaping from captivity .
certain expressions which were dropped by one of this latter class alarmed <name> , and led him to suspect some treachery .
he accordingly took the precaution to provide a number of armed men , and to have them ready at the window , so that he should be sure to be strong enough to secure the king immediately on his descent from the window .
when the time came for the escape , the king , before getting out , looked below , and , seeing so many armed men , knew at once that <name> had discovered their designs , and refused to descend .
he quickly returned to his bed .
the next day the bars were found filed in two , and the king was made a closer prisoner than ever .
some months after this , some commissioners from parliament went to see the king , and they found him in a most wretched condition .
his beard was grown , his dress was neglected , his health was gone , his hair was gray , and , though only forty-eight years of age , he appeared as <unk> and infirm as a man of seventy .
in fact , he was in a state of misery and despair .
even the enemies who came to visit him , though usually stern and hard-hearted enough to withstand any impressions , were extremely affected at the sight .

as soon as the army party , with <name> cromwell at their head , had obtained complete ascendency , they took immediate measures for proceeding vigorously against the king .
they seized him at <unk> castle , and took him to <unk> castle , which was a gloomy fortress in the neighborhood of <unk> .
<unk> castle was in a very extraordinary situation .
there is a long point extending from the main land toward the isle of wight , opposite to the eastern end of it .
this point is very narrow , but is nearly two miles long .
the castle was built at the extremity .
it consisted of one great round tower , defended by walls and bastions .
it stood lonely and desolate , surrounded by the sea , except the long and narrow neck which connected it with the distant shore .
of course , though comfortless and solitary , it was a place of much greater security than <unk> .
the circumstance of the king 's removal to this new place of confinement were as follows : in some of his many negotiations with the parliament while at <unk> , he had bound himself , on certain conditions , not to attempt to escape from that place .
his friends , however , when they heard that the army were coming again to take him away , concluded that he ought to lose no time in making his escape out of the country .
they proposed the plan to the king .
he made two objections to it .
he thought , in the first place , that the attempt would be very likely to fail ; and that , if it did fail , it would <unk> his enemies , and make his confinement more rigorous , and his probable danger more imminent than ever .
he said that , in the second place , he had promised the parliament that he would not attempt to escape , and that he could not break his word .
the three friends were silent when they heard the king speak these words .
after a pause , the leader of them , colonel cook , said , " suppose i were to tell your majesty that the army have a plan for seizing you immediately , and that they <name> be upon you very soon unless you escape .
suppose i tell you that we have made all the preparations necessary  that we have horses all ready here , concealed in a <unk>  that we have a vessel at the cows [ g ] waiting for us  that we are all prepared to attend you , and eager to engage in the enterprise  the darkness of the night <unk> our plan , and rendering it almost certain of success .
now , " added he , " these <unk> express the real state of the case , and the only question is what your majesty <name> resolve to do . "
[ footnote g : there were two points or headlands , on opposite sides of an inlet from the sea , on the northern side of the isle of wight , which in ancient times received the name of cows .
they were called the east cow and the west cow .
the harbor between them formed a safe and excellent harbor .
the name is now spelled <unk> , and the port is , at the present day , of great commercial importance . ]
the king paused .
he was distressed with perplexity and doubt .
at length he said , " they have promised me , and i have promised them , and i <name> not break the promise first . "
" your majesty means by they and them , the parliament , i suppose ? "
" yes , i do . "
" but the scene is now changed .
the parliament have no longer any power to protect you .
the danger is imminent , and the circumstances <unk> your majesty from all obligation . "
but the king could not be moved .
he said , come what may , he would not do any thing that looked like a breaking of his word .
he would dismiss the subject and go to bed , and enjoy his rest as long as he could .
his friends told him that they feared it would not be long .
they seemed very much agitated and distressed .
the king asked them why they were so much troubled .
they said it was to think of the extreme danger in which his majesty was lying , and his unwillingness to do any thing to avert it .
the king replied , that if the danger were tenfold more than it was , he would not break his word to avert it .
the fears of the king 's friends were soon realized .
the next morning , at break of day , he was awakened by a loud knocking at his door .
he sent one of his attendants to inquire what it meant .
it was a party of soldiers come to take him away .
they would give him no information in respect to their plans , but required him to dress himself immediately and go with them .
they mounted horses at the gate of the castle .
the king was very <name> to have his friends accompany him .
they allowed one of them , the duke of richmond , to go with him a little way , and then told him he must return .
the duke bade his master a very sad and sorrowful farewell , and left him to go on alone .
[ illustration : ruins of <unk> castle . ]
the escort which were conducting him took him to <unk> castle .
the parliament passed a vote condemning this proceeding , but it was too late .
the army concentrated their forces about london , took possession of the avenues to the houses of parliament , and excluded all those members who were opposed to them .
the remnant of the parliament which was left immediately took measures for bringing the king to trial .
the house of commons did not dare to trust the trial of the king to the peers , according to the provisions of the english constitution , and so they passed an ordinance for <unk> him of high treason , and for appointing commissioners , themselves , to try him .
of course , in appointing these commissioners , they would name such men as they were sure would be <unk> to condemn him .
the peers rejected this ordinance , and adjourned for nearly a fortnight , hoping thus to arrest any further proceedings .
the commons immediately voted that the action of the peers was not necessary , and that they would go forward themselves .
they then appointed the commissioners , and ordered the trial to proceed .
every thing connected with the trial was conducted with great state and parade .
the number of commissioners constituting the court was one hundred and thirty-three , though only a little more than half that number attended the trial .
the king had been removed from <unk> castle to windsor castle , and he was now brought into the city , and lodged in a house near to westminster hall , so as to be at hand .
on the appointed day the court assembled ; the vast hall and all the avenues to it were thronged .
the whole civilized world looked on , in fact , in astonishment at the almost unprecedented spectacle of a king tried for his life by an assembly of his subjects .
the first business after the opening of the court was to call the roll of the commissioners , that each one might answer to his name .
the name of the general of the army , <unk> , who was one of the number , was the second upon the list .
when his name was called there was no answer .
it was called again .
a voice from one of the galleries replied , " he has too much wit to be here . "
this produced some disorder , and the officers called out to know who answered in that manner , but there was no reply .
afterward , when the impeachment was read , the phrase occurred , " of all the people of england , " when the same voice rejoined , " no not the half of them . "
the officers then ordered a soldier to fire into the seat from which these interruptions came .
this command was not obeyed , but they found , on investigating the case , that the person who had answered thus was <unk> 's wife , and they immediately removed her from the hall .
when the court was fully organized , they commanded the <unk> to bring in the prisoner .
the king was accordingly brought in , and conducted to a chair covered with crimson <name> , which had been placed for him at the bar .
the judges remained in their seats , with their heads covered , while he entered , and the king took his seat , keeping his head covered too .
he took a calm and deliberate survey of the scene , looking around upon the judges , and upon the armed guards by which he was <unk> , with a stern and <unk> countenance .
at length silence was proclaimed , and the president rose to introduce the proceedings .
he addressed the king .
he said that the commons of england , deeply sensible of the calamities which had been brought upon england by the civil war , and of the innocent blood which had been shed , and convinced that he , the king , had been the guilty cause of it , were now determined to make inquisition for this blood , and to bring him to trial and judgment ; that they had , for this purpose , organized this court , and that he should now hear the charge brought against him , which they would proceed to try .
an officer then arose to read the charge .
the king made a gesture for him to be silent .
he , however , persisted in his reading , although the king once or twice attempted to interrupt him .
the president , too , ordered him to proceed .
the charge recited the evils and calamities which had resulted from the war , and concluded by saying that " the said <name> <name> is and has been the <unk> , author , and <unk> of the said unnatural , cruel , and bloody wars , and is therein guilty of all the <unk> , murders , <unk> , <unk> , spoils , <unk> , damages , and <unk> to this nation acted and committed in the said wars , or occasioned thereby . "
the president then sharply rebuked the king for his interruptions to the proceedings , and asked him what answer he had to make to the impeachment .
the king replied by demanding by what authority they pretended to call him to account for his conduct .
he told them that he was their king , and they his subjects ; that they were not even the parliament , and that they had no authority from any true parliament to sit as a court to try him ; that he would not betray his own dignity and rights by making any answer at all to any charges they might bring against him , for that would be an acknowledgment of their authority ; but he was convinced that there was not one of them who did not in his heart believe that he was wholly innocent of the charges which they had brought against him .
these proceedings occupied the first day .
the king was then sent back to his place of confinement , and the court adjourned .
the next day , when called upon to plead to the impeachment , the king only insisted the more strenuously in denying the authority of the court , and in stating his reasons for so denying it .
the court were determined not to hear what he had to say on this point , and the president continually interrupted him ; while he , in his turn , continually interrupted the president too .
it was a struggle and a dispute , not a trial .
at last , on the fourth day , something like testimony was produced to prove that the king had been in arms against the forces of the parliament .
on the fifth and sixth days , the judges sat in private to come to their decision ; and on the day following , which was saturday , <name> 27th , they called the king again before them , and opened the doors to admit the great assembly of spectators , that the decision might be announced .
there followed another scene of mutual interruptions and disorder .
the king insisted on longer delay .
he had not said what he wished to say in his defense .
the president told him it was now too late ; that he had consumed the time allotted to him in making objections to the jurisdiction of the court , and now it was too late for his defense .
the clerk then read the sentence , which ended thus : " for all which <unk> and crimes this court doth <unk> that he , the said <name> <name> , is a tyrant , traitor , murderer , and public enemy , and shall be put to death by the <unk> of his head from his body . "
when the clerk had finished the reading , the president rose , and said deliberately and solemnly , " the sentence now read and published is the act , sentence , judgment , and resolution of the whole court . "
and the whole court rose to express their assent .
the king then said to the president , " <name> you hear me a word , sir ? "
<unk> " sir , you are not to be heard after the sentence . "
king. " am i not , sir ? "
<unk> " no , sir .
guards , withdraw the prisoner ! "
king. " i may speak after sentence by your favor , sir .
hold  i say , sir  by your favor , sir  if i am not permitted to speak  " the other parts of his broken attempts to speak were lost in the tumult and noise .
he was taken out of the hall .
one would have supposed that all who witnessed these dreadful proceedings , and who now saw one who had been so lately the sovereign of a mighty empire standing friendless and alone on the brink of destruction , would have relented at last , and would have found their hearts yielding to emotions of pity .
but it seems not to have been so .
the animosities engendered by political strife are merciless , and the crowd through which the king had to pass as he went from the hall scoffed and derided him .
they blew the smoke of their tobacco in his face , and threw their pipes at him .
some proceeded to worse indignities than these , but the king bore all with quietness and resignation .
the king was sentenced on saturday .
on the evening of that day he sent a request that the bishop of london might be allowed to assist at his devotions , and that his children might be permitted to see him before he was to die .
there were two of his children then in england , his youngest son and a daughter .
the other two sons had escaped to the continent .
the government granted both these requests .
by asking for the services of an episcopal clergyman , <name> signified his firm determination to adhere to the very last hour of his life to the religious principles which he had been struggling for so long .
it is somewhat surprising that the government were willing to comply with the request .
it was , however , complied with , and <name> was taken from the palace of whitehall , which is in westminster , to the palace of st. <name> , not very far distant .
he was escorted by a guard through the streets .
at st. <name> 's there was a small chapel where the king attended divine service .
the bishop of london preached a sermon on the future judgment , in which he administered comfort to the mind of the unhappy prisoner , so far as the sad case allowed of any comfort , by the thought that all human judgments would be reviewed , and all wrong made right at the great day .
after the service the king spent the remainder of the day in retirement and private devotion .
during the afternoon of the day several of his most trusty friends among the nobility called to see him , but he declined to <name> them admission .
he said that his time was short and precious , and that he wished to improve it to the utmost in preparation for the great change which awaited him .
he hoped , therefore , that his friends would not be displeased if he declined seeing any persons besides his children .
it would do no good for them to be admitted .
all that they could do for him now was to pray for him .
the next day the children were brought to him in the room where he was confined .
the daughter , who was called the <name> <name> , was the oldest .
he directed her to tell her brother <name> , who was the second son , and now absent with <name> on the continent , that he must now , from the time of his father 's death , no longer look upon <name> as merely his older brother , but as his sovereign , and obey him as such ; and he requested her to charge them both , from him , to love each other , and to forgive their father 's enemies .
" you <name> not forget this , my dear child , <name> you ? "
added the king .
the <name> <name> was still very young .
" no , " said she , " i <name> never forget it as long as i live . "
he then charged her with a message to her mother , the <name> , who was also on the continent .
" tell her , " said he , " that i have loved her faithfully all my life , and that my tender regard for her <name> not cease till i cease to breathe . "
poor <name> was sadly grieved at this parting interview .
the king tried to comfort her .
" you must not be so afflicted for me , " he said .
" it <name> be a very glorious death that i shall die .
i die for the laws and liberties of this land , and for maintaining the protestant religion .
i have forgiven all my enemies , and i <name> that god <name> forgive them . "
the little son was , by title , the duke of gloucester .
he took him on his knees , and said , in substance , " my dear boy , they are going to cut off your father 's head . "
the child looked up into his father 's face very earnestly , not comprehending so strange an assertion .
" they are going to cut off my head , " repeated the king , " and perhaps they <name> want to make you a king ; but you must not be king as long as your brothers <name> and <name> live ; for if you do , very likely they <name> , some time or other , cut off your head . "
the child said , with a very determined air , that then they should never make him king as long as he lived .
the king then gave his children some other parting messages for several of his nearest relatives and friends , and they were taken away .
in cases of capital punishment , in england and <name> , there must be , after the sentence is pronounced , written authority to the sheriff , or other proper officer , to proceed to the execution of it .
this is called the warrant , and is usually to be signed by the chief magistrate of the state .
in england the sovereign always signs the warrant of execution ; but in the case of the execution of the sovereign himself , which was a case entirely unprecedented , the authorities were at first somewhat at loss to know what to do .
the commissioners who had judged the king concluded finally to sign it themselves .
it was expressed substantially as follows : " at the high court of justice for the trying and judging of <name> <name> , king of england , <name> 29th , <unk> : " whereas <name> <name> , king of england , has been convicted , <unk> , and condemned of high treason , and sentence was pronounced against him by this court , to be put to death by the <unk> of his head from his body , of which sentence execution yet <unk> to be done ; these are , therefore , now to <name> and require you to see the said sentence executed in the open street before whitehall , upon the morrow , being the thirtieth day of this instant month of <name> , between the hours of ten in the morning and five in the afternoon of the said day , with full effect ; and for so doing this shall be your sufficient warrant . "
<unk> of the judges signed this warrant , and then it was sent to the persons appointed to <name> the sentence into execution .
that night the king slept pretty well for about four hours , though during the evening before he could hear in his apartment the noise of the workmen building the platform , or scaffold as it was commonly called , on which the execution was to take place .
he awoke , however , long before day .
he called to an attendant who lay by his bedside , and requested him to get up .
" i <name> rise myself , " said he , " for i have a great work to do to-day . "
he then requested that they would furnish him with the best dress , and an extra supply of under clothing , because it was a cold morning .
he particularly wished to be well guarded from the cold , lest it should cause him to shiver , and they would suppose that he was trembling from fear .
" i have no fear , " said he .
" death is not terrible to me .
i bless god that i am prepared . "
the king had made arrangements for divine service in his room early in the morning , to be conducted by the bishop of london .
the bishop came in at the time appointed , and read the prayers .
he also read , in the course of the service , the <unk> chapter of <name> , which <unk> the closing scenes of our saviour 's life .
this was , in fact , the regular lesson for the day , according to the episcopal ritual , which assigns certain portions of scripture to every day of the year .
the king supposed that the bishop had purposely selected this passage , and he thanked him for it , as he said it seemed to him very appropriate to the occasion .
" may it please your majesty , " said the bishop , " it is the proper lesson for the day . "
the king was much affected at learning this fact , as he considered it a special providence , indicating that he was prepared to die , and that he should be sustained in the final agony .
about ten o'clock , colonel <unk> , who was the first one named in the warrant of execution of the three persons to whom the warrant was addressed , knocked gently at the king 's chamber door .
no answer was returned .
presently he knocked again .
the king asked his attendant to go to the door .
he went , and asked colonel <unk> why he knocked .
he replied that he wished to see the king .
" let him come in , " said the king .
the officer entered , but with great embarrassment and trepidation .
he felt that he had a most awful duty to perform .
he informed the king that it was time to proceed to whitehall , though he could have some time there for rest .
" very well , " said the king ; " go on ; i <name> follow . "
the king then took the bishop 's arm , and they went along together .
they found , as they issued from the palace of st. <name> into the park through which their way lay to whitehall , that lines of soldiers had been drawn up .
the king , with the bishop on one side , and the attendant before referred to , whose name was <name> , on the other , both uncovered , walked between these lines of guards .
the king walked on very fast , so that the others scarcely kept pace with him .
when he arrived at whitehall he spent some further time in devotion , with the bishop , and then , at noon , he ate a little bread and drank some light wine .
soon after this , colonel <unk> , the officer , came to the door and let them know that the hour had arrived .
the bishop and <unk> melted into tears as they bade their master farewell .
the king directed the door to be opened , and requested the officer to go on , saying that he would follow .
they went through a large hall , called the <unk> hall , to a window in front , through which a passage had been made for the king to his scaffold , which was built up in the street before the palace .
as the king passed out through the window , he perceived that a vast throng of spectators had assembled in the streets to witness the spectacle .
he had expected this , and had intended to address them .
but he found that this was impossible , as the space all around the scaffold was occupied with troops of horse and bodies of soldiers , so as to keep the populace at so great a distance that they could not hear his voice .
he , however , made his speech , addressing it particularly to one or two persons who were near , knowing that they would put the substance of it on record , and thus make it known to all mankind .
there was then some further conversation about the preparations for the final blow , the adjustment of the dress , the hair , & c. , in which the king took an active part , with great composure .
he then kneeled down and laid his head upon the block .
the executioner , who wore a mask that he might not be known , began to adjust the hair of the prisoner by putting it up under his cap , when the king , supposing that he was going to strike , hastily told him to wait for the sign .
the executioner said that he would .
the king spent a few minutes in prayer , and then stretched out his hands , which was the sign which he had arranged to give .
the axe descended .
the dissevered head , with the blood streaming from it , was held up by the assistant executioner , for the gratification of the vast crowd which was gazing on the scene .
he said , as he raised it , " behold the head of a traitor ! "
the body was placed in a coffin covered with black <name> , and taken back through the window into the room from which the monarch had walked out , in life and health , but a few moments before .
a day or two afterward it was taken to windsor castle upon a hearse drawn by six horses and covered with black <name> .
it was there interred in a vault in the chapel , with an inscription upon lead over the coffin : king <name> <unk> .
after the death of <name> , a sort of republic was established in england , called the commonwealth , over which , instead of a king , <name> cromwell presided , under the title of protector .
the country was , however , in a very anomalous and unsettled state .
it became more distracted still after the death of the protector , and it was only twelve years after <unk> the father that the people of england , by common consent , called back the son to the throne .
it seems as if there could be no stable government in a country where any very large portion of the inhabitants are destitute of property , without the aid of that mysterious but all controlling principle of the human breast , a spirit of reverence for the rights , and dread of the power of an hereditary crown .
in the united states almost every man is the possessor of property .
he has his house , his little farm , his shop and implements of labor , or something which is his own , and which he feels would be <unk> by revolution and anarchy .
he dreads a general scramble , knowing that he would probably get less than he would lose by it .
he is willing , therefore , to be governed by abstract law .
there is no need of holding up before him a scepter or a crown to induce obedience .
he <unk> without them .
he votes with the rest , and then abides by the decision of the <unk> .
in other countries , however , the case is different .
if not an actual majority , there is at least a very large proportion of the community who possess nothing .
they get scanty daily food for hard and long-continued daily labor ; and as change , no matter what , is always a blessing to sufferers , or at least is always looked forward to as such , they are ready to welcome , at all times , any thing that promises commotion .
a war , a conflagration , a riot , or a rebellion , is always welcome .
they do not know but that they shall gain some advantage by it , and in the mean time the excitement of it is some relief to the dead and eternal monotony of toil and suffering .
it is true that the revolutions by which monarchies are overturned are not generally effected , in the first instance , by this portion of the community .
the throne is usually overturned at first by a higher class of men ; but the deed being done , the <unk> upon the established course and order of the social state being once made , this lower mass is aroused and excited by it , and soon becomes unmanageable .
when property is so distributed among the population of a state that all have an interest in the preservation of order , then , and not till then , <name> it be safe to give to all a share in the power necessary for preserving it ; and , in the mean time , revolutions produced by insurrections and violence <name> probably only result in establishing governments unsteady and transient just in proportion to the suddenness of their origin .

the story of <name> is a story of crime .
it is a narrative of the course and the consequences of unlawful love .
in her strange and romantic history we see this passion portrayed with the most complete and graphic fidelity in all its influences and effects ; its uncontrollable impulses , its intoxicating joys , its reckless and mad career , and the dreadful remorse and ultimate despair and ruin in which it always and inevitably ends .
<name> was by birth an egyptian ; by ancestry and descent she was a greek .
thus , while <name> and the <name> of the nile formed the scene of the most important events and incidents of her history , it was the blood of macedon which flowed in her veins .
her character and action are marked by the genius , the courage , the originality , and the <unk> pertaining to the stock from which she sprung .
the events of her history , on the other hand , and the peculiar character of her adventures , her sufferings , and her sins , were determined by the circumstances with which she was surrounded , and the influences which were brought to bear upon her in the soft and voluptuous clime where the scenes of her early life were laid .
egypt has always been considered as physically the most remarkable country on the globe .
it is a long and narrow valley of verdure and <unk> , completely insulated from the rest of the habitable world .
it is more completely insulated , in fact , than any literal island could be , inasmuch as deserts are more impassable than seas .
the very existence of egypt is a most extraordinary phenomenon .
if we could but soar with the wings of an eagle into the air , and look down upon the scene , so as to observe the operation of that grand and yet simple process by which this long and wonderful valley , teeming so profusely with animal and vegetable life , has been formed , and is annually <unk> and renewed , in the midst of surrounding wastes of silence , desolation , and death , we should gaze upon it with <unk> admiration and pleasure .
we have not the wings of the eagle , but the <unk> of science furnish us with a sort of substitute for them .
the long series of patient , careful , and sagacious observations , which have been continued now for two thousand years , bring us results , by means of which , through our powers of mental <name> , we may take a comprehensive survey of the whole scene , analogous , in some respects , to that which direct and actual vision would afford us , if we could look down upon it from the eagle 's point of view .
it is , however , somewhat humiliating to our pride of intellect to reflect that long-continued philosophical investigations and learned scientific research are , in such a case as this , after all , in some sense , only a sort of substitute for wings .
a human mind connected with a pair of eagle 's wings would have solved the mystery of egypt in a week ; whereas science , philosophy , and research , confined to the surface of the ground , have been occupied for twenty centuries in accomplishing the undertaking .
it is found at last that both the existence of egypt itself , and its strange insulation in the midst of boundless tracts of dry and barren sand , depend upon certain remarkable results of the general laws of rain .
the water which is taken up by the atmosphere from the surface of the sea and of the land by evaporation , falls again , under certain circumstances , in showers of rain , the frequency and <unk> of which vary very much in different portions of the earth .
as a general principle , rains are much more frequent and abundant near the equator than in temperate climes , and they grow less and less so as we approach the poles .
this might naturally have been expected ; for , under the burning sun of the equator , the evaporation of water must necessarily go on with immensely greater rapidity than in the colder zones , and all the water which is taken up must , of course , again come down .
it is not , however , wholly by the latitude of the region in which the evaporation takes place that the quantity of rain which falls from the atmosphere is determined ; for the condition on which the falling back , in rain , of the water which has been taken up by evaporation mainly depends , is the cooling of the atmospheric stratum which contains it ; and this effect is produced in very various ways , and many different causes operate to modify it .
sometimes the stratum is cooled by being wafted over ranges of mountains , sometimes by encountering and becoming mingled with cooler currents of air ; and sometimes , again , by being driven in winds toward a higher , and , consequently , cooler latitude .
if , on the other hand , air moves from cold mountains toward warm and <name> plains , or from higher latitudes to lower , or if , among the various currents into which it falls , it becomes mixed with air warmer than itself , its capacity for containing vapor in solution is increased , and , consequently , instead of releasing its hold upon the waters which it has already in possession , it becomes thirsty for more .
it moves over a country , under these circumstances , as a warm and drying wind .
under a reverse of circumstances it would have formed drifting mists , or , perhaps , even copious showers of rain .
it <name> be evident , from these considerations , that the frequency of the showers , and the quantity of the rain which <name> fall , in the various regions respectively which the surface of the earth presents , must depend on the combined influence of many causes , such as the warmth of the climate , the proximity and the direction of mountains and of seas , the character of the prevailing winds , and the reflecting qualities of the soil .
these and other similar causes , it is found , do , in fact , produce a vast difference in the quantity of rain which falls in different regions .
in the northern part of south <name> , where the land is bordered on every hand by vast tropical seas , which load the hot and thirsty air with vapor , and where the mighty cordillera of the andes <unk> its icy summits to chill and precipitate the <unk> again , a quantity of rain amounting to more than ten feet in perpendicular height falls in a year .
at st. petersburg , on the other hand , the quantity thus falling in a year is but little more than one foot .
the immense deluge which pours down from the clouds in south <name> would , if the water were to remain where it fell , wholly <unk> and <unk> the country .
as it is , in flowing off through the valleys to the sea , the united torrents form the greatest river on the globe  the amazon ; and the vegetation , stimulated by the heat , and nourished by the abundant and incessant supplies of moisture , becomes so rank , and loads the earth with such an entangled and matted mass of trunks , and stems , and twining wreaths and vines , that man is almost excluded from the scene .
the boundless forests become a vast and almost impenetrable jungle , abandoned to wild beasts , <unk> reptiles , and huge and ferocious birds of prey .
of course , the district of st. petersburg , with its icy <name> , its low and powerless sun , and its twelve inches of annual rain , must necessarily present , in all its phenomena of vegetable and animal life , a striking contrast to the <unk> <unk> of new <unk> .
it is , however , after all , not absolutely the opposite extreme .
there are certain regions on the surface of the earth that are actually <unk> ; and it is these which present us with the true and real contrast to the luxuriant vegetation and teeming life of the country of the amazon .
in these <unk> regions all is necessarily silence , desolation , and death .
no plant can grow ; no animal can live .
man , too , is forever and hopelessly excluded .
if the <unk> abundance of animal and vegetable life shut him out , in some measure , from regions which an excess of heat and moisture render too prolific , the total absence of them still more effectually forbids him a home in these .
they become , therefore , vast wastes of dry and barren sands in which no root can find nourishment , and of dreary rocks to which not even a lichen can cling .
the most extensive and remarkable <unk> region on the earth is a vast tract extending through the interior and northern part of africa , and the southwestern part of <name> .
the red sea penetrates into this tract from the south , and thus breaks the outline and continuity of its form , without , however , altering , or essentially modifying its character .
it divides it , however , and to the different portions which this division forms , different names have been given .
the asiatic portion is called arabia <unk> ; the african tract has received the name of sahara ; while between these two , in the neighborhood of egypt , the barren region is called simply the desert .
the whole tract is marked , however , throughout , with one <unk> character : the absence of vegetable , and , consequently , of animal life , on account of the absence of rain .
the rising of a range of lofty mountains in the center of it , to produce a precipitation of moisture from the air , would probably transform the whole of the vast waste into as verdant , and fertile , and populous a region as any on the globe .
[ illustration : valley of the nile ] as it is , there are no such mountains .
the whole tract is nearly level , and so little elevated above the sea , that , at the distance of many hundred miles in the interior , the land rises only to the height of a few hundred feet above the surface of the mediterranean ; whereas in new <unk> , at less than one hundred miles from the sea , the chain of the andes rises to elevations of from ten to fifteen thousand feet .
such an ascent as that of a few hundred feet in hundreds of miles would be wholly imperceptible to any ordinary mode of observation ; and the great <unk> region , accordingly , of africa and <name> is , as it appears to the traveler , one vast plain , a thousand miles wide and five thousand miles long , with only one considerable interruption to the dead monotony which reigns , with that exception , every where over the immense expanse of silence and solitude .
the single interval of <unk> and life is the valley of the nile .
there are , however , in fact , three interruptions to the continuity of this plain , though only one of them constitutes any considerable interruption to its barrenness .
they are all of them valleys , extending from north to south , and lying side by side .
the most easterly of these valleys is so deep that the waters of the ocean flow into it from the south , forming a long and narrow inlet called the red sea .
as this inlet communicates freely with the ocean , it is always nearly of the same level , and as the evaporation from it is not sufficient to produce rain , it does not even <unk> its own shores .
its presence varies the dreary scenery of the landscape , it is true , by giving us surging waters to look upon instead of driving sands ; but this is all .
with the exception of the spectacle of an english steamer passing , at weary intervals , over its dreary expanse , and some <unk> remains of ancient cities on its eastern shore , it affords scarcely any indications of life .
it does very little , therefore , to relieve the monotonous aspect of solitude and desolation which reigns over the region into which it has intruded .
the most westerly of the three valleys to which we have alluded is only a slight depression of the surface of the land marked by a line of <unk> .
the depression is not sufficient to admit the waters of the mediterranean , nor are there any rains over any portion of the valley which it forms sufficient to make it the bed of a stream .
springs issue , however , here and there , in several places , from the ground , and , <unk> through the sands along the valley , give fertility to little <unk> , long and narrow , which , by the contrast that they form with the surrounding desolation , seem to the traveler to possess the verdure and beauty of paradise .
there is a line of these <unk> extending along this westerly depression , and some of them are of considerable extent .
the oasis of <unk> , on which stood the <unk> <name> of jupiter ammon , was many miles in extent , and was said to have contained in ancient times a population of eight thousand souls .
thus , while the most easterly of the three valleys which we have named was sunk so low as to admit the ocean to flow freely into it , the most westerly was so slightly depressed that it gained only a circumscribed and limited fertility through the springs , which , in the lowest portions of it , <unk> from the ground .
the third valley  the central one  remains now to be described .
the reader <name> observe , by referring once more to the map , that south of the great <unk> region of which we are speaking , there lie groups and ranges of mountains in abyssinia , called the mountains of the moon .
these mountains are near the equator , and the relation which they sustain to the surrounding seas , and to currents of wind which blow in that quarter of the world , is such , that they bring down from the atmosphere , especially in certain seasons of the year , vast and continual torrents of rain .
the water which thus falls <unk> the mountain sides and deluges the valleys .
there is a great portion of it which can not flow to the southward or eastward toward the sea , as the whole country consists , in those directions , of continuous tracts of elevated land .
the rush of water thus turns to the northward , and , pressing on across the desert through the great central valley which we have referred to above , it finds an outlet , at last , in the mediterranean , at a point two thousand miles distant from the place where the immense condenser <name> it from the skies .
the river thus created is the nile .
it is formed , in a word , by the surplus waters of a district <unk> with rains , in their progress across a <unk> desert , seeking the sea .
if the surplus of water upon the <unk> mountains had been constant and uniform , the stream , in its passage across the desert , would have communicated very little fertility to the barren sands which it traversed .
the immediate banks of the river would have , perhaps , been fringed with verdure , but the influence of the irrigation would have extended no farther than the water itself could have reached , by percolation through the sand .
but the flow of the water is not thus uniform and steady .
in a certain season of the year the rains are incessant , and they descend with such abundance and profusion as almost to <unk> the districts where they fall .
immense torrents stream down the mountain sides ; the valleys are <unk> ; plains turn into morasses , and morasses into lakes .
in a word , the country becomes half submerged , and the accumulated mass of waters would rush with great force and violence down the central valley of the desert , which forms their only outlet , if the passage were narrow , and if it made any considerable descent in its course to the sea .
it is , however , not narrow , and the descent is very small .
the depression in the surface of the desert , through which the water flows , is from five to ten miles wide , and , though it is nearly two thousand miles from the rainy district across the desert to the sea , the country for the whole distance is almost level .
there is only sufficient descent , especially for the last thousand miles , to determine a very gentle current to the northward in the waters of the stream .
under these circumstances , the immense quantity of water which falls in the rainy district in these <unk> tropical showers , expands over the whole valley , and forms for a time an immense lake , extending in length across the whole breadth of the desert .
this lake is , of course , from five to ten miles wide , and a thousand miles long .
the water in it is shallow and turbid , and it has a gentle current toward the north .
the rains , at length , in a great measure cease ; but it requires some months for the water to run off and leave the valley dry .
as soon as it is gone , there springs up from the whole surface of the ground which has been thus submerged a most rank and luxuriant vegetation .
this vegetation , now wholly regulated and controlled by the hand of man , must have been , in its original and primeval state , of a very peculiar character .
it must have consisted of such plants only as could exist under the condition of having the soil in which they grew laid , for a quarter of the year , wholly under water .
this circumstance , probably , prevented the valley of the nile from having been , like other fertile tracts of land , encumbered , in its native state , with forests .
for the same reason , wild beasts could never have haunted it .
there were no forests to shelter them , and no refuge or retreat for them but the dry and barren desert , during the period of the annual inundations .
this most extraordinary valley seems thus to have been formed and preserved by nature herself for the special possession of man .
she herself seems to have held it in reserve for him from the very morning of creation , refusing admission into it to every plant and every animal that might hinder or disturb his <unk> and control .
and if he were to abandon it now for a thousand years , and then return to it once more , he would find it just as he left it , ready for his immediate possession .
there would be no wild beasts that he must first expel , and no tangled forests would have sprung up , that his ax must first remove .
nature is the <unk> who keeps this garden of the world in order , and the means and machinery by which she <unk> are the grand <unk> surfaces of the seas , the beams of the tropical sun , the lofty summits of the <unk> mountains , and , as the product and result of all this instrumentality , great periodical inundations of summer rain .
for these or some other reasons egypt has been occupied by man from the most remote antiquity .
the oldest records of the human race , made three thousand years ago , speak of egypt as ancient then , when they were written .
not only is tradition silent , but even fable herself does not attempt to tell the story of the origin of her population .
here stand the oldest and most enduring monuments that human power has ever been able to raise .
it is , however , somewhat humiliating to the pride of the race to reflect that the loftiest and proudest , as well as the most permanent and stable of all the works which man has ever accomplished , are but the incidents and <unk> of a thin stratum of alluvial fertility , left upon the sands by the subsiding waters of summer showers .
the most important portion of the <unk> of the nile is the northern portion , where the valley widens and opens toward the sea , forming a triangular plain of about one hundred miles in length on each of the sides , over which the waters of the river flow in a great number of separate creeks and channels .
the whole area forms a vast meadow , intersected every where with <unk> streams of water , and presenting on its surface the most enchanting pictures of fertility , abundance , and beauty .
this region is called the <name> of the nile .
the sea upon the coast is shallow , and the fertile country formed by the deposits of the river seems to have projected somewhat beyond the line of the coast ; although , as the land has not advanced perceptibly for the last eighteen hundred years , it may be somewhat doubtful whether the whole of the apparent protrusion is not due to the natural conformation of the coast , rather than to any changes made by the action of the river .
the <name> of the nile is so level itself , and so little raised above the level of the mediterranean , that the land seems almost a continuation of the same surface with the sea , only , instead of blue waters topped with <unk> waves , we have broad tracts of waving grain , and gentle swells of land crowned with hamlets and villages .
in approaching the coast , the navigator has no distant view of all this verdure and beauty .
it lies so low that it continues beneath the horizon until the ship is close upon the shore .
the first landmarks , in fact , which the seaman makes , are the tops of trees growing apparently out of the water , or the summit of an obelisk , or the capital of a pillar , marking the site of some ancient and dilapidated city .
the most easterly of the channels by which the waters of the river find their way through the <name> to the sea , is called , as it <name> be seen marked upon the map , the <unk> branch .
it forms almost the boundary of the fertile region of the <name> on the eastern side .
there was an ancient city named pelusium near the mouth of it .
this was , of course , the first egyptian city reached by those who arrived by land from the eastward , traveling along the shores of the mediterranean sea .
on account of its thus marking the eastern frontier of the country , it became a point of great importance , and is often mentioned in the histories of ancient times .
the <unk> mouth of the nile , on the other hand , was called the <unk> mouth .
the distance along the coast from the <unk> mouth to pelusium was about a hundred miles .
the outline of the coast was formerly , as it still continues to be , very irregular , and the water shallow .
extended banks of sand protruded into the sea , and the sea itself , as if in retaliation , formed innumerable creeks , and <unk> , and lagoons in the land .
along this irregular and uncertain boundary the waters of the nile and the surges of the mediterranean kept up an eternal war , with energies so nearly equal , that now , after the lapse of eighteen hundred years since the state of the contest began to be recorded , neither side has been found to have gained any perceptible advantage over the other .
the river brings the sands down , and the sea drives them incessantly back , keeping the whole line of the shore in such a condition as to make it extremely dangerous and difficult of access to man .
it <name> be obvious , from this description of the valley of the nile , that it formed a country which in ancient times isolated and secluded , in a very striking manner , from all the rest of the world .
it was wholly shut in by deserts , on every side , by land ; and the shoals , and <unk> , and other dangers of navigation which marked the line of the coast , seemed to forbid approach by sea .
here it remained for many ages , under the rule of its own native ancient kings .
its population was peaceful and industrious .
its scholars were famed throughout the world for their learning , their science , and their philosophy .
it was in these ages , before other nations had intruded upon its peaceful seclusion , that the pyramids were built , and the enormous <unk> carved , and those vast temples reared whose ruined columns are now the wonder of mankind .
during these remote ages , too , egypt was , as now , the land of perpetual fertility and abundance .
there would always be corn in egypt , wherever else famine might rage .
the neighboring nations and tribes in arabia , palestine , and syria , found their way to it , accordingly , across the deserts on the eastern side , when driven by want , and thus opened a way of communication .
at length the persian monarchs , after extending their empire westward to the mediterranean , found access by the same road to pelusium , and thence <unk> and conquered the country .
at last , about two hundred and fifty years before the time of <name> , <name> the great , when he <unk> the persian empire , took possession of egypt , and annexed it , among the other persian provinces , to his own dominions .
at the division of <name> 's empire , after his death , egypt fell to one of his generals , named ptolemy .
ptolemy made it his kingdom , and left it , at his death , to his heirs .
a long line of sovereigns succeeded him , known in history as the dynasty of the ptolemies  greek princes , reigning over an egyptian realm .
<name> was the daughter of the eleventh in the line .
the capital of the ptolemies was <name> .
until the time of <name> 's conquest , egypt had no sea-port .
there were several <unk> along the coast , but no proper harbor .
in fact egypt had then so little commercial intercourse with the rest of the world , that she scarcely needed any .
<name> 's engineers , however , in exploring the shore , found a point not far from the <unk> mouth of the nile where the water was deep , and where there was an anchorage ground protected by an island .
<name> founded a city there , which he called by his own name .
he perfected the harbor by artificial excavations and embankments .
a lofty <unk> was reared , which formed a landmark by day , and exhibited a blazing <name> by night to guide the galleys of the mediterranean in .
a canal was made to connect the port with the nile , and warehouses were erected to contain the stores of merchandise .
in a word , <name> became at once a great commercial capital .
it was the seat , for several centuries , of the magnificent government of the ptolemies ; and so well was its situation chosen for the purposes intended , that it still continues , after the lapse of twenty centuries of revolution and change , one of the principal <unk> of the commerce of the east .

the founder of the dynasty of the ptolemies  the ruler into whose hands the kingdom of egypt fell , as has already been stated , at the death of <name> the great  was a macedonian general in <name> 's army .
the circumstances of his birth , and the events which led to his entering into the service of <name> , were somewhat peculiar .
his mother , whose name was arsinoÃ« , was a personal favorite and companion of <name> , king of macedon , the father of <name> .
<name> at length gave arsinoÃ« in marriage to a certain man of his court named <unk> .
a very short time after the marriage , ptolemy was born .
<name> treated the child with the same consideration and favor that he had evinced toward the mother .
the boy was called the son of <unk> , but his position in the <name> court of macedon was as high and honorable , and the attentions which he received were as great , as he could have expected to enjoy if he had been in reality a son of the king .
as he grew up , he attained to official stations of considerable responsibility and power .
in the course of time , a certain transaction occurred by means of which ptolemy involved himself in serious difficulty with <name> , though by the same means he made <name> very strongly his friend .
there was a province of the persian empire called <unk> , situated in the southwestern part of <name> minor .
the governor of this province had offered his daughter to <name> as the wife of one of his sons named <unk> , the half brother of <name> .
<name> 's mother , who was not the mother of <unk> , was jealous of this proposed marriage .
she thought that it was part of a scheme for bringing <unk> forward into public notice , and finally making him the heir to <name> 's throne ; whereas she was very <name> that this splendid inheritance should be reserved for her own son .
accordingly , she proposed to <name> that they should send a secret embassage to the persian governor , and represent to him that it would be much better , both for him and for his daughter , that she should have <name> instead of <unk> for a husband , and induce him , if possible , to demand of <name> that he should make the change .
<name> entered readily into this scheme , and various courtiers , ptolemy among the rest , undertook to aid him in the accomplishment of it .
the embassy was sent .
the governor of <unk> was very much pleased with the change which they proposed to him .
in fact , the whole plan seemed to be going on very successfully toward its accomplishment , when , by some means or other , <name> discovered the intrigue .
he went immediately into <name> 's apartment , highly excited with resentment and anger .
he had never intended to make <unk> , whose birth on the mother 's side was obscure and ignoble , the heir to his throne , and he reproached <name> in the bitterest terms for being of so <unk> and degenerate a spirit as to <name> to marry the daughter of a persian governor ; a man who was , in fact , the mere slave , as he said , of a barbarian king .
<name> 's scheme was thus totally defeated ; and so displeased was his father with the officers who had undertaken to aid him in the execution of it , that he banished them all from the kingdom .
ptolemy , in consequence of this decree , wandered about an exile from his country for some years , until at length the death of <name> enabled <name> to recall him .
<name> succeeded his father as king of macedon , and immediately made ptolemy one of his principal generals .
ptolemy rose , in fact , to a very high command in the macedonian army , and distinguished himself very greatly in all the celebrated conqueror 's subsequent campaigns .
in the persian invasion , ptolemy commanded one of the three grand divisions of the army , and he rendered repeatedly the most signal services to the cause of his master .
he was employed on the most distant and dangerous enterprises , and was often intrusted with the management of affairs of the utmost importance .
he was very successful in all his undertakings .
he conquered armies , reduced fortresses , <unk> treaties , and evinced , in a word , the highest degree of military energy and skill .
he once saved <name> 's life by discovering and revealing a dangerous conspiracy which had been formed against the king .
<name> had the opportunity to <unk> this favor , through a divine interposition vouchsafed to him , it was said , for the express purpose of enabling him to evince his gratitude .
ptolemy had been wounded by a poisoned arrow , and when all the remedies and <unk> of the physicians had failed , and the patient was apparently about to die , an effectual means of cure was revealed to <name> in a dream , and ptolemy , in his turn , was saved .
at the great rejoicings at susa , when <name> 's conquests were completed , ptolemy was honored with a golden crown , and he was married , with great pomp and ceremony , to <unk> , the daughter of one of the most distinguished persian generals .
at length <name> died suddenly , after a night of drinking and <unk> at babylon .
he had no son old enough to succeed him , and his immense empire was divided among his generals .
ptolemy obtained egypt for his share .
he repaired immediately to <name> , with a great army , and a great number of greek attendants and followers , and there commenced a reign which continued , in great prosperity and splendor , for forty years .
the native egyptians were reduced , of course , to subjection and bondage .
all the offices in the army , and all stations of trust and responsibility in civil life , were filled by greeks .
<name> was a greek city , and it became at once one of the most important commercial centers in all those seas .
greek and <name> travelers found now a language spoken in egypt which they could understand , and philosophers and scholars could gratify the curiosity which they had so long felt , in respect to the institutions , and monuments , and wonderful physical characteristics of the country , with safety and pleasure .
in a word , the organization of a greek government over the ancient kingdom , and the establishment of the great commercial relations of the city of <name> , conspired to bring egypt out from its concealment and seclusion , and to open it in some measure to the intercourse , as well as to bring it more fully under the observation , of the rest of mankind .
ptolemy , in fact , made it a special object of his policy to accomplish these ends .
he invited greek scholars , philosophers , poets , and artists , in great <name> , to come to <name> , and to make his capital their abode .
he collected an immense library , which subsequently , under the name of the alexandrian library , became one of the most celebrated collections of books and manuscripts that was ever made .
we shall have occasion to refer more particularly to this library in the next chapter .
besides prosecuting these splendid schemes for the aggrandizement of egypt , king ptolemy was engaged , during almost the whole period of his reign , in waging incessant wars with the surrounding nations .
he engaged in these wars , in part , for the purpose of extending the boundaries of his empire , and in part for <unk> against the aggressions and encroachments of other powers .
he finally succeeded in establishing his kingdom on the most stable and permanent basis , and then , when he was drawing toward the close of his life , being in fact over eighty years of age , he <unk> his throne in favor of his youngest son , whose name was also ptolemy , ptolemy the father , the founder of the dynasty , is known commonly in history by the name of ptolemy <unk> .
his son is called ptolemy philadelphia .
this son , though the youngest , was preferred to his brothers as heir to the throne on account of his being the son of the most favored and beloved of the monarch 's wives .
the determination of <unk> to <unk> the throne himself arose from his wish to put this favorite son in secure possession of it before his death , in order to prevent the older brothers from disputing the succession .
the coronation of <unk> was made one of the most magnificent and imposing ceremonies that <name> pomp and parade ever arranged .
two years afterward ptolemy the father died , and was buried by his son with a magnificence almost equal to that of his own coronation .
his body was deposited in a splendid mausoleum , which had been built for the remains of <name> ; and so high was the veneration which was felt by mankind for the greatness of his exploits and the splendor of his reign , that divine honors were paid to his memory .
such was the origin of the great dynasty of the ptolemies .
some of the early sovereigns of the line followed in some degree the honorable example set them by the distinguished founder of it ; but this example was soon lost , and was succeeded by the most extreme <unk> and <unk> .
the successive sovereigns began soon to live and to reign solely for the gratification of their own sensual propensities and passions .
<unk> begins sometimes with kindness , but it ends always in the most reckless and intolerable cruelty .
the ptolemies became , in the end , the most abominable and terrible tyrants that the principle of absolute and irresponsible power ever produced .
there was one vice in particular , a vice which they seem to have adopted from the asiatic nations of the persian empire , that resulted in the most awful consequences .
this vice was <unk> .
the law of god , proclaimed not only in the scriptures , but in the native instincts of the human soul , forbids <unk> among those connected by close ties of <unk> .
the necessity for such a law rests on considerations which can not here be fully explained .
they are considerations , however , which arise from causes inherent in the very nature of man as a social being , and which are of universal , perpetual , and insurmountable force .
to guard his creatures against the deplorable consequences , both physical and moral , which result from the practice of such marriages , the great author of nature has implanted in every mind an instinctive sense of their <unk> , powerful enough to give effectual warning of the danger , and so universal as to cause a distinct condemnation of them to be recorded in almost every code of written law that has ever been <unk> among mankind .
the persian sovereigns were , however , above all law , and every species of <unk> marriage was practiced by them without shame .
the ptolemies followed their example .
one of the most striking exhibitions of the nature of <unk> domestic life which is afforded by the whole dismal panorama of pagan vice and crime , is presented in the history of the great-grandfather of the <name> who is the principal subject of this narrative .
he was ptolemy physcon , the seventh in the line .
it is necessary to give some particulars of his history and that of his family , in order to explain the circumstances under which <name> herself came upon the stage .
the name physcon , which afterward became his historical designation , was originally given him in contempt and derision .
he was very small of stature in respect to height , but his <unk> and <unk> had made him immensely <unk> in body , so that he looked more like a monster than a man .
the term physcon was a greek word , which denoted <unk> the ridiculous figure that he made .
the circumstances of ptolemy physcon 's accession to the throne afford not only a striking illustration of his character , but a very faithful though terrible picture of the manners and morals of the times .
he had been engaged in a long and cruel war with his brother , who was king before him , in which war he had perpetrated all imaginable atrocities , when at length his brother died , leaving as his survivors his wife , who was also his sister , and a son who was yet a child .
this son was properly the heir to the crown .
physcon himself , being a brother , had no claim , as against a son .
the name of the <name> was <name> .
this was , in fact , a very common name among the princesses of the <unk> line .
<name> , besides her son , had a daughter , who was at this time a young and beautiful girl .
her name was also <name> .
she was , of course , the niece , as her mother was the sister , of physcon .
the plan of <name> the mother , after her husband 's death , was to make her son the king of egypt , and to govern herself , as regent , until he should become of age .
the friends and adherents of physcon , however , formed a strong party in his favor .
they sent for him to come to <name> to assert his claims to the throne .
he came , and a new civil war was on the point of breaking out between the brother and sister , when at length the dispute was settled by a treaty , in which it was stipulated that physcon should marry <name> , and be king ; but that he should make the son of <name> by her former husband his heir .
this treaty was carried into effect so far as the celebration of the marriage with the mother was concerned , and the establishment of physcon upon the throne .
but the <unk> monster , instead of keeping his <name> in respect to the boy , determined to murder him ; and so open and brutal were his habits of violence and cruelty , that he undertook to perpetrate the deed himself , in open day .
the boy fled shrieking to the mother's arms for protection , and physcon stabbed and killed him there , exhibiting the spectacle of a <unk> husband murdering the son of his wife in her very arms !
it is easy to conceive what sort of affection would exist between a husband and a wife after such transactions as these .
in fact , there had been no love between them from the beginning .
the marriage had been solely a political arrangement .
physcon hated his wife , and had murdered her son , and then , as if to complete the exhibition of the brutal lawlessness and <unk> of his passions , he ended with falling in love with her daughter .
the beautiful girl looked upon this heartless monster , as ugly and deformed in body as he was in mind , with absolute horror .
but she was wholly in his power .
he compelled her , by violence , to submit to his <name> .
he repudiated the mother , and forced the daughter to become his wife .
physcon displayed the same qualities of brutal tyranny and cruelty in the treatment of his subjects that he manifested in his own domestic relations .
the particulars we can not here give , but can only say that his atrocities became at length absolutely intolerable , and a revolt so formidable broke out , that he fled from the country .
in fact he barely escaped with his life , as the mob had surrounded the palace and were setting it on fire , intending to burn the tyrant himself and all the accomplices of his crimes together .
physcon , however , contrived to make his escape .
he fled to the island of cyprus , taking with him a certain beautiful boy , his son by the <name> whom he had divorced ; for they had been married long enough before the divorce , to have a son .
the name of this boy was <unk> .
his mother was very tenderly attached to him , and physcon took him away on this very account , to keep him as a hostage for his mother 's good behavior .
he fancied that , when he was gone , she might possibly attempt to resume possession of the throne .
his expectations in this respect were realized .
the people of <name> rallied around <name> , and called upon her to take the crown .
she did so , feeling , perhaps , some misgivings in respect to the danger which such a step might possibly bring upon her absent boy .
she quieted herself , however , by the thought that he was in the hands of his own father , and that he could not possibly come to harm .
after some little time had elapsed , and <name> was beginning to be well established in her possession of the supreme power at <name> , her <unk> approached , and arrangements were made for celebrating it in the most magnificent manner .
when the day arrived , the whole city was given up to festivities and rejoicing .
grand entertainments were given in the palace , and games , spectacles , and plays in every variety , were exhibited and performed in all quarters of the city .
<name> herself was enjoying a magnificent entertainment , given to the lords and ladies of the court and the officers of her army , in one of the <name> palaces .
in the midst of this scene of festivity and pleasure , it was announced to the <name> that a large box had arrived for her .
the box was brought into the apartment .
it had the appearance of containing some magnificent present , sent in at that time by some friend in honor of the occasion .
the curiosity of the <name> was excited to know what the mysterious <unk> might contain .
she ordered it to be opened ; and the guests gathered around , each eager to obtain the first glimpse of the contents .
the lid was removed , and a cloth beneath it was raised , when , to the unutterable horror of all who witnessed the spectacle , there was seen the head and hands of <name> 's beautiful boy , lying among masses of human flesh , which consisted of the rest of his body cut into pieces .
the head had been left entire , that the wretched mother might recognize in the pale and lifeless features the countenance of her son .
physcon had sent the box to <name> , with orders that it should be retained until the evening of the <unk> , and then presented publicly to <name> in the midst of the festivities of the scene .
the shrieks and cries with which she filled the apartments of the palace at the first sight of the dreadful spectacle , and the agony of long-continued and <unk> grief which followed , showed how well the cruel contrivance of the tyrant was fitted to accomplish its end .
it gives us no pleasure to write , and we are sure it can give our readers no pleasure to peruse , such shocking stories of bloody cruelty as these .
it is necessary , however , to a just appreciation of the character of the great subject of this history , that we should understand the nature of the domestic influences that reigned in the family from which she sprung .
in fact , it is due , as a matter of simple justice to her , that we should know what these influences were , and what were the examples set before her in her early life ; since the privileges and advantages which the young enjoy in their early years , and , on the other hand , the evil influences under which they suffer , are to be taken very seriously into the account when we are passing judgment upon the follies and sins into which they subsequently fall .
the monster physcon lived , it is true , two or three generations before the great <name> ; but the character of the intermediate generations , until the time of her birth , continued much the same .
in fact , the cruelty , corruption , and vice which reigned in every branch of the <name> family increased rather than diminished .
the beautiful niece of physcon , who , at the time of her compulsory marriage with him , evinced such an aversion to the monster , had become , at the period of her husband's death , as great a monster of ambition , selfishness , and cruelty as he .
she had two sons , lathyrus and <name> .
physcon , when he died , left the kingdom of egypt to her by <name> , <unk> her to associate with her in the government whichever of these two sons she might choose .
the oldest was best entitled to this privilege , by his priority of birth ; but she preferred the youngest , as she thought that her own power would be more absolute in reigning in conjunction with him , since he would be more completely under her control .
the leading powers , however , in <name> , resisted this plan , and insisted on <name> 's associating her oldest son , lathyrus , with her in the government of the realm .
they compelled her to recall lathyrus from the banishment into which she had sent him , and to put him nominally upon the throne .
<name> yielded to this necessity , but she forced her son to repudiate his wife , and to take , instead , another woman , whom she fancied she could make more <unk> to her <name> .
the mother and the son went on together for a time , lathyrus being nominally king , though her determination that she would rule , and his struggles to resist her intolerable tyranny , made their wretched household the scene of terrible a perpetual quarrels .
at last <name> seized a number of lathyrus 's servants , the <unk> who were employed in various offices about the palace , and after wounding and <unk> them in a horrible manner , she exhibited them to the populace , saying that it was lathyrus that had inflicted the cruel injuries upon the sufferers , and calling upon them to arise and punish him for his crimes .
in this and in other similar ways she awakened among the people of the court and of the city such an animosity against lathyrus , that they expelled him from the country .
there followed a long series of cruel and bloody wars , between the mother and the son in the course of which each party perpetrated against the other almost every imaginable deed of atrocity and crime .
<name> , the youngest son was so afraid of his terrible mother , that he did not dare to remain in <name> with her , but went into a sort of banishment of his own accord .
he , however , finally returned to egypt .
his mother immediately supposed that he was intending to disturb her possession of power , and resolved to destroy him .
he became acquainted with her designs , and , grown desperate by the long-continued pressure of her intolerable tyranny , he resolved to bring the anxiety and terror in which he lived to an end by killing her .
this he did , and then fled the country .
lathyrus , his brother , then returned , and reigned for the rest of his days in a tolerable degree of quietness and peace .
at length lathyrus died , and left the kingdom to his son , ptolemy <unk> , who was the great <name> 's father .
we can not soften the picture which is exhibited to our view in the history of this celebrated family , by regarding the mother of <unk> , in the masculine and merciless trails and principles which she displayed so energetically throughout her terrible career , as an exception to the general character of the princesses who appeared from time to time in the line .
in ambition , selfishness , unnatural and reckless cruelty , and utter disregard of every virtuous principle and of every domestic tie , she was but the type and representative of all the rest .
she had two daughters , for example , who were the consistent and worthy followers of such a mother .
a passage in the lives of these sisters illustrates very forcibly the kind of <unk> affection which prevailed in the family of the ptolemies .
the case was this : there were two princes of syria , a country lying northeast of the mediterranean sea , and so not very far from egypt , who , though they were brothers , were in a state of most deadly hostility to each other .
one had attempted to poison the other , and afterward a war had broken out between them , and all syria was suffering from the ravages of their armies .
one of the sisters , of whom we have been speaking , married one of these princes .
her name was <unk> .
after some time , but yet while the unnatural war was still raging between the two brothers , <name> , the other sister  the same <name> , in fact , that had been divorced from lathyrus at the instance of his mother  espoused the other brother .
<unk> was exceedingly incensed against <name> for marrying her husband 's mortal foe , and the implacable hostility and hate of the sisters was thenceforth added to that which the brothers had before exhibited , to complete the display of unnatural and <unk> passion which this shameful contest presented to the world .
in fact , <unk> from this time seemed to feel a new and <unk> interest in the contest , from her eager <name> to revenge herself on her sister .
she watched the progress of it , and took an active part in pressing forward the active prosecution of the war .
the party of her husband , either from this or some other causes , seemed to be gaining the day .
the husband of <name> was driven from one part of the country to another , and at length , in order to provide for the security of his wife , he left her in antioch , a large and <unk> city , where he supposed that she would be safe , while he himself was engaged in prosecuting the war in other quarters where his presence seemed to be required .
on learning that her sister was at antioch , <unk> urged her husband to attack the place .
he accordingly advanced with a strong detachment of the army , and besieged and took the city .
<name> would , of course , have fallen into his hands as a captive ; but , to escape this fate , she fled to a <name> for refuge .
a <name> was considered , in those days , an inviolable sanctuary .
the soldiers accordingly left her there .
<unk> , however , made a request that her husband would deliver the unhappy fugitive into her hands .
she was determined , she said , to kill her .
her husband remonstrated with her against this atrocious proposal .
" it would be a wholly useless act of cruelty , " said he , " to destroy her life .
she can do us no possible harm in the future progress of the war , while to murder her under these circumstances <name> only <unk> her husband and her friends , and nerve them with new strength for the remainder of the contest .
and then , besides , she has taken refuge in a <name> ; and if we violate that sanctuary , we shall incur , by such an act of sacrilege , the implacable displeasure of heaven .
consider , too , that she is your sister , and for you to kill her would be to commit an unnatural and wholly inexcusable crime . "
so saying , he commanded <unk> to say no more upon the subject , for he would on no account consent that <name> should suffer any injury whatever .
this refusal on the part of her husband to comply with her request only inflamed <unk> 's insane resentment and anger the more .
in fact , the earnestness with which he espoused her sister 's cause , and the interest which he seemed to feel in her fate , aroused <unk> 's jealousy .
she believed , or pretended to believe , that her husband was influenced by a sentiment of love in so warmly defending her .
the object of her hate , from being simply an enemy , became now , in her view , a rival , and she resolved that , at all hazards , she should be destroyed .
she accordingly ordered a body of desperate soldiers to break into the <name> and seize her .
<name> fled in terror to the altar , and clung to it with such convulsive force that the soldiers cut her hands off before they could tear her away , and then , maddened by her resistance and the sight of blood , they stabbed her again and again upon the floor of the <name> , where she fell .
the appalling shrieks with which the wretched victim filled the air in the first moments of her flight and her terror , subsided , as her life ebbed away , into the most awful imprecations of the judgments of heaven upon the head of the unnatural sister whose implacable hate had destroyed her .
notwithstanding the specimens that we have thus given of the character and action of this extraordinary family , the government of this dynasty , extending , as it did , through the reigns of thirteen sovereigns and over a period of nearly three hundred years , has always been considered one of the most liberal , enlightened , and prosperous of all the governments of ancient times .
we shall have something to say in the next chapter in respect to the internal condition of the country while these violent men were upon the throne .
in the mean time , we <name> here only add , that whoever is inclined , in observing the ambition , the selfishness , the party spirit , the unworthy intrigues , and the irregularities of moral conduct , which modern rulers and statesmen sometimes exhibit to mankind in their personal and political career , to believe in a <unk> and <unk> of national character as the world advances in age , <name> be very effectually <unk> by reading attentively a full history of this celebrated dynasty , and reflecting , as he reads , that the narrative presents , on the whole , a fair and honest exhibition of the general character of the men by whom , in ancient times , the world was governed .

it must not be imagined by the reader that the scenes of vicious indulgence , and reckless cruelty and crime , which were exhibited with such dreadful frequency , and carried to such an enormous excess in the palaces of the egyptian kings , prevailed to the same extent throughout the mass of the community during the period of their reign .
the internal administration of government , and the institutions by which the industrial pursuits of the mass of the people were regulated , and peace and order preserved , and justice enforced between man and man , were all this time in the hands of men well qualified , on the whole , for the trusts committed to their charge , and in a good degree faithful in the performance of their duties ; and thus the ordinary affairs of government , and the general routine of domestic and social life , went on , notwithstanding the profligacy of the kings , in a course of very tolerable peace , prosperity , and happiness .
during every one of the three hundred years over which the history of the ptolemies extends , the whole length and breadth of the land of egypt exhibited , with comparatively few interruptions , one wide-spread scene of busy industry .
the inundations came at their appointed season , and then regularly retired .
the boundless fields which the waters had <unk> were then every where tilled .
the lands were plowed ; the seed was sown ; the canals and <unk> , which <unk> from the river in every direction over the ground , were opened or closed , as the case required , to regulate the irrigation .
the inhabitants were busy , and , consequently , they were virtuous .
and as the sky of egypt is seldom or never darkened by clouds and storms , the scene presented to the eye the same <unk> aspect of smiling verdure and beauty , day after day , and month after month , until the ripened grain was gathered into the <unk> , and the land was cleared for another inundation .
we say that the people were virtuous because they were busy ; for there is no principle of political economy more fully established than that vice in the social state is the incident and symptom of idleness .
it prevails always in those classes of every great population who are either released by the possession of fixed and <unk> wealth from the necessity , or excluded by their poverty and degradation from the advantage , of useful employment .
wealth that is free , and subject to its possessor 's control , so that he can , if he <name> , occupy himself in the management of it , while it sometimes may make individuals vicious , does not generally corrupt classes of men , for it does not make them idle .
but wherever the institutions of a country are such as to create an aristocratic class , whose incomes depend on <unk> estates , or on fixed and permanent <unk> , so that the capital on which they live can not afford them any mental occupation , they are doomed necessarily to inaction and idleness .
vicious pleasures and indulgences are , with such a class as a whole , the inevitable result ; for the innocent enjoyments of man are planned and designed by the author of nature only for the intervals of rest and repose in a life of activity .
they are always found wholly insufficient to satisfy one who makes pleasure the whole end and aim of his being .
in the same manner , if , either from the influence of the social institutions of a country , or from the operation of natural causes which human power is unable to control , there is a class of men too low , and degraded , and miserable to be reached by the ordinary inducements to daily toil , so certain are they to grow corrupt and depraved , that degradation has become in all languages a term almost synonymous with vice .
there are many exceptions , it is true , to these general laws .
many active men are very wicked ; and there have been frequent instances of the most exalted virtue among nobles and kings .
still , as a general law , it is unquestionably true that vice is the incident of idleness ; and the sphere of vice , therefore , is at the top and at the bottom of society  those being the regions in which idleness reigns .
the great remedy , too , for vice is employment .
to make a community virtuous , it is essential that all ranks and gradations of it , from the highest to the lowest , should have something to do .
in accordance with these principles , we observe that , while the most extreme and abominable wickedness seemed to hold continual and absolute sway in the palaces of the ptolemies , and among the nobles of their courts , the working ministers of state , and the men on whom the actual governmental functions devolved , discharged their duties with wisdom and fidelity , and throughout all the ordinary ranks and gradations of society there prevailed generally a very considerable degree of industry , prosperity and happiness .
this prosperity prevailed not only in the rural districts of the <name> and along the valley of the nile , but also among the merchants , and navigators , and artisans of <name> .
<name> became , in fact , very soon after it was founded , a very great and busy city .
many things conspired to make it at once a great commercial <unk> .
in the first place , it was the depot of export for all the surplus grain and other agricultural produce which was raised in such abundance along the egyptian valley .
this produce was brought down in boats to the upper point of the <name> , where the branches of the river divided , and thence down the <unk> branch to the city .
the city was not , in fact , situated directly upon this branch , but upon a narrow tongue of land , at a little distance from it , near the sea .
it was not easy to enter the channel directly , on account of the bars and <unk> at its mouth , produced by the eternal conflict between the waters of the river and the surges of the sea .
the water was deep , however , as <name> 's engineers had discovered , at the place where the city was built , and , by establishing the port there , and then cutting a canal across to the nile , they were enabled to bring the river and the sea at once into easy communication .
the produce of the valley was thus brought down the river and through the canal to the city .
here immense warehouses and granaries were erected for its reception , that it might be safely preserved until the ships that came into the port were ready to take it away .
these ships came from syria , from all the coasts of <name> minor , from greece , and from rome .
they brought the agricultural productions of their own countries , as well as articles of manufacture of various kinds ; these they sold to the merchants of <name> , and purchased the productions of egypt in return .
the port of <name> presented thus a constant picture of life and animation .
merchant ships were continually coming and going , or lying at anchor in the <unk> .
seamen were hoisting sails , or raising anchors , or rowing their capacious galleys through the water , singing , as they pulled , to the motion of the oars .
within the city there was the same ceaseless activity .
here groups of men were unloading the canal boats which had arrived from the river .
there porters were transporting bales of merchandise or sacks of grain from a warehouse to a pier , or from one landing to another the occasional parading of the king 's guards , or the arrival and departure of ships of war to land or to take away bodies of armed men , were occurrences that sometimes intervened to interrupt , or as perhaps the people then would have said , to adorn this scene of useful industry ; and now and then , for a brief period , these peaceful <unk> would be wholly suspended and set aside by a revolt or by a civil war , waged by rival brothers against each other , or <unk> by the conflicting claims of a mother and son .
these interruptions , however , were comparatively few , and , in ordinary cases , not of long continuance .
it was for the interest of all branches of the <name> line to do as little injury as possible to the commercial and agricultural operations of the realm .
in fact , it was on the prosperity of those operations that the revenues depended .
the rulers were well aware of this , and so , however <unk> two rival princes may have hated one another , and however desperately each party may have struggled to destroy all active combatants whom they should find in arms against them , they were both under every possible inducement to spare the private property and the lives of the peaceful population .
this population , in fact , engaged thus in profitable industry , constituted , with the avails of their labors , the very estate for which the combatants were contending .
seeing the subject in this light , the egyptian sovereigns , especially <name> and the earlier ptolemies , made every effort in their power to promote the commercial greatness of <name> .
they built palaces , it is true , but they also built warehouses .
one of the most expensive and celebrated of all the edifices that they reared was the <unk> which has been already alluded to .
this <unk> was a lofty tower , built of white marble .
it was situated upon the island of pharos , opposite to the city , and at some distance from it .
there was a sort of isthmus of shoals and <unk> connecting the island with the shore .
over these shallows a pier or causeway was built , which finally became a broad and inhabited neck .
the principal part of the ancient city , however , was on the main land .
the curvature of the earth requires that a <unk> on a coast should have a considerable elevation , otherwise its summit would not appear above the horizon , unless the mariner were very near .
to attain this elevation , the architects usually take advantage of some hill or <name> , or <name> eminence near the shore .
there was , however , no opportunity to do this at pharos ; for the island was , like the main land , level and low .
the requisite elevation could only be attained , therefore , by the masonry of an edifice , and the blocks of marble necessary for the work had to be brought from a great distance .
the alexandrian <unk> was reared in the time of ptolemy <unk> , the second monarch in the line .
no pains or expense were spared in its construction .
the edifice , when completed , was considered one of the seven wonders of the world .
it was indebted for its fame , however , in some degree , undoubtedly to the conspicuousness of its situation , rising , as it did , at the entrance of the greatest commercial <unk> of its time , and standing there , like a pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night , to attract the welcome gaze of every wandering mariner whose ship came within its horizon , and to awaken his gratitude by <unk> him its guidance and <unk> his fears .
the light at the top of the tower was produced by a fire , made of such combustibles as would emit the brightest flame .
this fire burned slowly through the day , and then was kindled up anew when the sun went down , and was continually <unk> through the night with fresh supplies of fuel .
in modern times , a much more convenient and economical mode is adopted to produce the requisite illumination .
a great blazing lamp burns brilliantly in the center of the lantern of the tower , and all that part of the radiation from the flame which would naturally have beamed upward , or downward , or laterally , or back toward the land , is so turned by a curious system of <unk> and <unk> lenses , most ingeniously contrived and very exactly adjusted , as to be thrown forward in one broad and thin , but brilliant sheet of light , which shoots out where its radiance is needed , over the surface of the sea .
before these inventions were perfected , far the largest portion of the light emitted by the illumination of <unk> towers streamed away <unk> in landward directions , or was lost among the stars .
of course , the <name> of erecting such an edifice as the pharos of <name> , and of maintaining it in the performance of its functions , was very great ; the question might , however , very naturally arise whether this <name> was justly due to the architect through whose scientific skill the work was actually accomplished , or to the monarch by whose power and resources the architect was sustained .
the name of the architect was <unk> .
he was a greek .
the monarch was , as has already been stated , the second ptolemy , called commonly ptolemy <unk> .
ptolemy ordered that , in completing the tower , a marble tablet should be built into the wall , at a suitable place near the summit , and that a proper inscription should be carved upon it , with his name as the builder of the edifice conspicuous thereon .
<unk> preferred inserting his own name .
he accordingly made the tablet and set it in its place .
he cut the inscription upon the face of it , in greek characters , with his own name as the author of the work .
he did this secretly , and then covered the face of the tablet with an artificial composition , made with lime , to imitate the natural surface of the stone .
on this outer surface he cut a new inscription , in which he inserted the name of the king .
in process of time the lime <unk> away , the king 's inscription disappeared , and his own , which thenceforward continued as long as the building endured , came out to view .
the pharos was said to have been four hundred feet high .
it was famed throughout the world for many centuries ; nothing , however , remains of it now but a heap of useless and unmeaning ruins .
besides the light that beamed from the summit of this lofty tower , there was another center of radiance and illumination in ancient <name> , which was in some respects still more conspicuous and renowned , namely , an immense library and museum established and maintained by the ptolemies .
the museum , which was first established , was not , as its name might now imply , a collection of curiosities , but an institution of learning , consisting of a body of learned men , who devoted their time to philosophical and scientific pursuits .
the institution was richly endowed , and magnificent buildings were erected for its use .
the king who established it began immediately to make a collection of books for the use of the members of the institution .
this was attended with great expense , as every book that was added to the collection required to be <unk> with a pen on parchment or <unk> with infinite labor and care .
great <name> of <unk> were constantly employed upon this work at the museum .
the kings who were most interested in forming this library would seize the books that were possessed by individual scholars , or that were deposited in the various cities of their dominions , and then , causing beautiful copies of them to be made by the <unk> of the museum , they would retain the originals for the great alexandrian library , and give the copies to the men or the cities that had been thus <unk> .
in the same manner they would borrow , as they called it , from all travelers who visited egypt , any valuable books which they might have in their possession , and , retaining the originals , give them back copies instead .
in process of time the library increased to four hundred thousand volumes .
there was then no longer any room in the buildings of the museum for further additions .
there was , however , in another part of the city , a great <name> called the <unk> .
this <name> was a very magnificent edifice , or , rather , group of edifices , dedicated to the god serapis .
the origin and history of this <name> were very remarkable .
the legend was this : it seems that one of the ancient and <unk> gods of the egyptians was a deity named serapis .
he had been , among other divinities , the object of egyptian adoration ages before <name> was built or the ptolemies reigned .
there was also , by a curious coincidence , a statue of the same name at a great commercial town named <unk> , which was built upon the extremity of a promontory which projected from <name> minor into the <unk> sea .
<unk> was , in some sense , the <name> of the north , being the center and seat of a great portion of the commerce of that quarter of the world .
the serapis of <unk> was considered as the protecting deity of seamen , and the navigators who came and went to and from the city made sacrifices to him , and offered him <unk> and prayers , believing that they were , in a great measure , dependent upon some mysterious and inscrutable power which he exercised for their safety in storms .
they carried the knowledge of his name , and tales of his imaginary <unk> , to all the places that they visited ; and thus the fame of the god became extended , first , to all the coasts of the <unk> sea , and subsequently to distant provinces and kingdoms .
the serapis of <unk> began to be considered every where as the <unk> god of seamen .
accordingly , when the first of the ptolemies was forming his various plans for adorning and <unk> <name> , he received , he said , one night , a divine intimation in a dream that he was to obtain the statue of serapis from <unk> , and set it up in <name> , in a suitable <name> which he was in the mean time to erect in honor of the god .
it is obvious that very great advantages to the city would result from the accomplishment of this design .
in the first place , a <name> to the god serapis would be a new distinction for it in the minds of the rural population , who would undoubtedly suppose that the deity honored by it was their own ancient god .
then the whole maritime and nautical interest of the world , which had been , accustomed to adore the god of <unk> , would turn to <name> as the great center of religious attraction , if their <unk> idol could be carried and placed in a new and magnificent <name> built expressly for him there .
<name> could never be the chief naval port and station of the world , unless it contained the sanctuary and shrine of the god of seamen .
ptolemy sent accordingly to the king of <unk> and proposed to purchase the idol .
the embassage was , however , unsuccessful .
the king refused to give up the god .
the negotiations were continued for two years , but all in vain .
at length , on account of some failure in the regular course of the seasons on that coast , there was a famine there , which became finally so severe that the people of the city were induced to consent to give up their deity to the egyptians in exchange for a supply of corn .
ptolemy sent the corn and received the idol .
he then built the <name> , which , when finished , surpassed in grandeur and magnificence almost every sacred structure in the world .
it was in this <name> that the successive additions to the alexandrian library were deposited , when the apartments of the museum became full .
in the end there were four hundred thousand rolls or volumes in the museum , and three hundred thousand in the <unk> .
the former was called the parent library , and the latter , being , as it were , the offspring of the first , was called the daughter .
ptolemy <unk> , who interested himself very greatly in collecting this library , wished to make it a complete collection of all the books in the world .
he employed scholars to read and study , and travelers to make extensive tours , for the purpose of learning what books existed among all the surrounding nations ; and , when he learned of their existence , he spared no pains or expense in attempting to procure either the originals themselves , or the most perfect and authentic copies of them .
he sent to athens and obtained the works of the most celebrated greek historians , and then causing , as in other cases , most beautiful <unk> to be made , he sent the <unk> back to athens , and a very large sum of money with them as an equivalent for the difference of value between originals and copies in such an exchange .
in the course of the inquiries which ptolemy made into the literature of the surrounding nations , in his search for <unk> to his library , he heard that the jews had certain sacred writings in their <name> at jerusalem , comprising a minute and extremely interesting history of their nation from the earliest periods and also many other books of sacred prophecy and poetry .
these books , which were , in fact , the hebrew scriptures of the old testament , were then wholly unknown to all nations except the jews , and among the jews were known only to priests and scholars .
they were kept sacred at jerusalem .
the jews would have considered them as <unk> in being exhibited to the view of pagan nations .
in fact , the learned men of other countries would not have been able to read them ; for the jews secluded themselves so closely from the rest of mankind , that their language was , in that age , scarcely ever heard beyond the confines of judea and galilee .
ptolemy very naturally thought that a copy of these sacred books would be a great acquisition to his library .
they constituted , in fact , the whole literature of a nation which was , in some respects , the most extraordinary that ever existed on the globe .
ptolemy conceived the idea , also , of not only adding to his library a copy of these writings in the original hebrew , but of causing a translation of them to be made into greek , so that they might easily be read by the greek and <name> scholars who were drawn in great <name> to his capital by the libraries and the learned institutions which he had established there .
the first thing to be effected , however , in accomplishing either of these plans , was to obtain the consent of the jewish authorities .
they would probably object to giving up any copy of their sacred writings at all .
there was one circumstance which led ptolemy to imagine that the jews would , at that time particularly , be averse to granting any request of such a nature coming from an egyptian king , and that was , that during certain wars which had taken place in previous reigns , a considerable number of prisoners had been taken by the egyptians , and had been brought to egypt as captives , where they had been sold to the inhabitants , and were now scattered over the land as slaves .
they were employed as servile laborers in <unk> the fields , or in turning enormous wheels to pump up water from the nile .
the masters of these hapless <unk> conceived , like other <unk> , that they had a right of property in their slaves .
this was in some respects true , since they had bought them of the government at the close of the war for a consideration ; and though they obviously derived from this circumstance no valid <unk> right or claim as against the men personally , it certainly would seem that it gave them a just claim against the government of whom they bought , in case of subsequent <unk> .
ptolemy or his minister , for it can not now be known who was the real actor in these transactions , determined on <unk> these slaves and sending them back to their native land , as a means of <unk> the jews and <unk> them to listen favorably to the request which he was about to prefer for a copy of their sacred writings .
he , however , paid to those who held the captives a very liberal sum for ransom .
the ancient historians , who never allow the interest of their narratives to suffer for want of a proper <unk> on their part of the scale on which the deeds which they record were performed , say that the number of slaves liberated on this occasion was a hundred and twenty thousand , and the sum paid for them , as compensation to the owners , was six hundred talents , equal to six hundred thousand dollars .
[ 1 ] [ footnote 1 : it <name> be sufficiently accurate for the general reader of history to consider the greek talent , referred to in such transactions as these , as equal in english money to two hundred and fifty pounds , in american to a thousand dollars .
it is curious to observe that , large as the total was that was paid for the liberation of these slaves , the amount paid for each individual was , after all , only a sum equal to about five dollars . ]
and yet this was only a preliminary expense to <unk> the way for the acquisition of a single series of books , to add to the variety of the immense collection .
after the liberation and return of the captives , ptolemy sent a splendid embassage to jerusalem , with very respectful letters to the high priest , and with very magnificent presents .
the embassadors were received with the highest honors .
the request of ptolemy that he should be allowed to take a copy of the sacred books for his library was very readily granted .
the priests caused copies to be made of all the sacred writings .
these copies were executed in the most magnificent style , and were splendidly illuminated with letters of gold .
the jewish government also , at ptolemy 's request , designated a company of hebrew scholars , six from each tribe  men learned in both the greek and hebrew languages  to proceed to <name> , and there , at the museum , to make a careful translation of the hebrew books into greek .
as there were twelve tribes , and six <unk> chosen from each , there were seventy-two <unk> in all .
they made their translation , and it was called the <unk> , from the latin <unk> <unk> , which means seventy-two .
although out of judea there was no feeling of reverence for these hebrew scriptures as books of divine authority , there was still a strong interest felt in them as very entertaining and curious works of history , by all the greek and <name> scholars who frequented <name> to study at the museum .
copies were accordingly made of the <unk> translation , and were taken to other countries ; and there , in process of time , copies of the copies were made , until at length the work became extensively circulated throughout the whole learned world .
when , finally , christianity became extended over the <name> empire , the priests and monks looked with even a stronger interest than the ancient scholars had felt upon this early translation of so important a portion of the sacred scriptures .
they made new copies for abbeys , monasteries , and colleges ; and when , at length , the <name> of printing was discovered , this work was one of the first on which the magic power of <unk> was tried .
the original manuscript made by the <unk> of the seventy-two , and all the early <unk> which were made from it , have long since been lost or destroyed ; but , instead of them , we have now hundreds of thousands of copies in compact printed volumes , scattered among the public and private libraries of christendom .
in fact , now , after the lapse of two thousand years , a copy of ptolemy 's <unk> may be obtained of any considerable bookseller in any country of the civilized world ; and though it required a national embassage , and an expenditure , if the accounts are true , of more than a million of dollars , originally to obtain it , it may be procured without difficulty now by two days' wages of an ordinary laborer .
besides the building of the pharos , the museum , and the <name> of serapis , the early ptolemies formed and executed a great many other plans tending to the same ends which the erection of these splendid edifices was designed to secure , namely , to concentrate in <name> all possible means of attraction , commercial , literary , and religious , so as to make the city the great center of interest , and the common resort for all mankind .
they raised immense revenues for these and other purposes by <unk> heavily the whole agricultural produce of the valley of the nile .
the inundations , by the boundless fertility which they annually produced , supplied the <name> <unk> .
thus the <unk> rains at the sources of the nile built the pharos at its mouth , and endowed the alexandrian library .
the taxes laid upon the people of egypt to supply the ptolemies with funds were , in fact , so heavy , that only the bare means of subsistence were left to the mass of the agricultural population .
in admiring the greatness and <name> of the city , therefore , we must remember that there was a gloomy counterpart to its splendor in the very extended destitution and poverty to which the mass of the people were everywhere doomed .
they lived in hamlets of wretched huts along the banks of the river , in order that the capital might be splendidly adorned with temples and palaces .
they passed their lives in darkness and ignorance , that seven hundred thousand volumes of expensive manuscripts might be enrolled at the museum for the use of foreign philosophers and scholars .
the policy of the ptolemies was , perhaps , on the whole , the best , for the general advancement and ultimate welfare of mankind , which could have been pursued in the age in which they lived and acted ; but , in applauding the results which they attained , we must not wholly forget the cost which they incurred in attaining them .
at the same cost , we could , at the present day , far surpass them .
if the people of the united states <name> surrender the comforts and conveniences which they individually enjoy  if the farmers scattered in their comfortable homes on the hill-sides and plains throughout the land <name> give up their houses , their furniture , their carpets , their books , and the privileges of their children , and then  withholding from the produce of their annual toil only a sufficient reservation to sustain them and their families through the year , in a life like that of a beast of burden , spent in some miserable and naked hovel  send the rest to some hereditary sovereign residing upon the atlantic <unk> , that he may build with the proceeds a splendid capital , they may have an <name> now that <name> infinitely exceed the ancient city of the ptolemies in splendor and renown .
the nation , too , would , in such a case , pay for its metropolis the same price , precisely , that the ancient egyptians paid for theirs .
the ptolemies expended the revenues which they raised by this taxation mainly in a very liberal and enlightened manner , for the accomplishment of the purposes which they had in view .
the building of the pharos , the removal of the statue of serapis , and the endowment of the museum and the library were great conceptions , and they were carried into effect in the most complete and perfect manner .
all the other operations which they devised and executed for the extension and aggrandizement of the city were conceived and executed in the same spirit of scientific and enlightened liberality .
streets were opened ; the most splendid palaces were built ; docks , piers and <unk> were constructed , and fortresses and towers were armed and garrisoned .
then every means was employed to attract to the city a great concourse from all the most <unk> nations then existing .
the highest inducements were offered to merchants , mechanics , and artisans to make the city their abode .
poets , painters , <unk> , and scholars of every nation and degree were made welcome , and every facility was afforded them for the prosecution of their various pursuits .
these plans were all eminently successful .
<name> rose rapidly to the highest consideration and importance ; and , at the time when <name>  born to preside over this scene of magnificence and splendor  came upon the stage , the city had but one rival in the world .
that rival was rome .

when the time was approaching in which <name> appeared upon the stage , rome was perhaps the only city that could be considered as the rival of <name> , in the estimation of mankind , in respect to interest and attractiveness as a capital .
in one respect , rome was vastly superior to the egyptian metropolis , and that was in the magnitude and extent of the military power which it wielded among the nations of the earth .
<name> ruled over egypt , and over a few of the neighboring coasts and islands ; but in the course of the three centuries during which she had been acquiring her greatness and fame , the <name> empire had extended itself over almost the whole civilized world .
egypt had been , thus far , too remote to be directly reached ; but the affairs of egypt itself became involved at length with the operations of the <name> power , about the time of <name> 's birth , in a very striking and peculiar manner ; and as the consequences of the transaction were the means of turning the whole course of the <name> 's subsequent history , a narration of it is necessary to a proper understanding of the circumstances under which she commenced her career .
in fact , it was the extension of the <name> empire to the limits of egypt , and the connections which thence arose between the leading <name> generals and the egyptian sovereign , which have made the story of this particular <name> so much more conspicuous , as an object of interest and attention to mankind , than that of any other one of the ten <unk> who rose successively in the same <name> line .
ptolemy <unk> , <name> 's father , was perhaps , in personal character , the most dissipated , degraded , and corrupt of all the sovereigns in the dynasty .
he spent his whole time in vice and <unk> .
the only honest accomplishment that he seemed to possess was his skill in playing upon the flute ; of this he was very vain .
he instituted musical contests , in which the musical performers of <name> played for prizes and crowns ; and he himself was accustomed to enter the lists with the rest as a competitor .
the people of <name> , and the world in general , considered such pursuits as these wholly unworthy the attention of the representative of so illustrious a line of sovereigns , and the abhorrence which they felt for the monarch 's vices and crimes was mingled with a feeling of contempt for the meanness of his ambition .
there was a doubt in respect to his title to the crown , for his birth , on the mother 's side , was irregular and ignoble .
instead , however , of attempting to confirm and secure his possession of power by a vigorous and prosperous administration of the government , he wholly abandoned all concern in respect to the course of public affairs ; and then , to guard against the danger of being deposed , he conceived the plan of getting himself recognized at rome as one of the allies of the <name> people .
if this were once done , he supposed that the <name> government would feel under an obligation to sustain him on his throne in the event of any threatened danger .
the <name> government was a sort of republic , and the two most powerful men in the state at this time were pompey and caesar .
caesar was in the ascendency at rome at the time that ptolemy made his application for an alliance .
pompey was absent in <name> minor , being engaged in prosecuting a war with <unk> , a very powerful monarch , who was at that time resisting the <name> power .
caesar was very deeply involved in debt , and was , moreover , very much in need of money , not only for relief from existing embarrassments , but as a means of subsequent expenditure , to enable him to accomplish certain great political schemes which he was entertaining .
after many negotiations and delays , it was agreed that caesar would exert his influence to secure an alliance between the <name> people and ptolemy , on condition that ptolemy paid him the sum of six thousand talents , equal to about six millions of dollars .
a part of the money , caesar said , was for pompey .
the title of ally was conferred , and ptolemy undertook to raise the money which he had promised by increasing the taxes of his kingdom .
the measures , however , which he thus adopted for the purpose of making himself the more secure in his possession of the throne , proved to be the means of <unk> him .
the discontent and disaffection of his people , which had been strong and universal before , though suppressed and concealed , broke out now into open violence .
that there should be laid upon them , in addition to all their other burdens , these new oppressions , heavier than those which they had endured before , and exacted for such a purpose too , was not to be endured .
to be compelled to see their country sold on any terms to the <name> people was sufficiently hard to bear ; but to be forced to raise , themselves , and pay the price of the transfer , was absolutely intolerable .
<name> commenced a revolt .
ptolemy was not a man to act decidedly against such a demonstration , or , in fact , to evince either calmness or courage in any emergency whatever .
his first thought was to escape from <name> to save his life .
his second , to make the best of his way to rome , to call upon the <name> people to come to the succor of their ally !
ptolemy left five children behind him in his flight the eldest was the <name> <name> , who had already reached maturity .
the second was the great <name> , the subject of this history .
<name> was , at this time , about eleven years old .
there were also two sons , but they were very young .
one of them was named ptolemy .
the <unk> determined on raising <name> to the throne in her father 's place , as soon as his flight was known .
they thought that the sons were too young to attempt to reign in such an emergency , as it was very probable that <unk> , the father , would attempt to recover his kingdom .
<name> very readily accepted the honor and power which were offered to her .
she established herself in her father 's palace , and began her reign in great magnificence and splendor .
in process of time she thought that her position would be strengthened by a marriage with a <name> <name> from some neighboring realm .
she first sent embassadors to make proposals to a <name> of syria named antiochus .
the embassadors came back , bringing word that antiochus was dead , but that he had a brother named seleucus , upon whom the succession fell .
<name> then sent them back to make the same offers to him .
he accepted the proposals , came to egypt , and he and <name> were married .
after trying him for a while , <name> found that , for some reason or other , she did not like him as a husband , and , accordingly she caused him to be strangled .
at length , after various other intrigues and much secret management , <name> succeeded in a second negotiation , and married a <name> , or a pretended <name> , from some country of <name> minor , whose name was <unk> .
she was better pleased with this second husband than she had been with the first , and she began , at last , to feel somewhat settled and established on her throne , and to be prepared , as she thought , to offer effectual resistance to her father in case he should ever attempt to return .
it was in the midst of the scenes , and surrounded by the influences which might be expected to prevail in the families of such a father and such a sister , that <name> spent those years of life in which the character is formed .
during all these revolutions , and exposed to all these exhibitions of <unk> wickedness , and of unnatural cruelty and crime , she was growing up in the <name> palaces a spirited and beautiful , but indulged and neglected child .
in the mean time , <unk> , the father , went on toward rome .
so far as his character and his story were known among the surrounding nations , he was the object of universal <unk> , both on account of his previous career of degrading vice , and now , still more , for this ignoble flight from the difficulties in which his vices and crimes had involved him .
he stopped , on the way , at the island of rhodes .
it happened that cato , the great <name> philosopher and general , was at rhodes at this time .
cato was a man of stern , unbending virtue , and of great influence at that period in public affairs .
ptolemy sent a messenger to inform cato of his arrival , supposing , of course , that the <name> general would hasten , on hearing of the fact , to pay his respects to so great a personage as he , a king of egypt  a ptolemy  though suffering under a temporary reverse of fortune .
cato directed the messenger to reply that , so far as he was aware , he had no particular business with ptolemy .
" say , however , to the king , " he added , " that , if he has any business with me , he may call and see me , if he pleases . "
ptolemy was obliged to suppress his resentment and submit .
he thought it very essential to the success of his plans that he should see cato , and secure , if possible , his interest and co-operation ; and he consequently made preparations for paying , instead of receiving , the visit , intending to go in the greatest <name> state that he could command .
he accordingly appeared at cato 's lodgings on the following day , magnificently dressed , and accompanied by many attendants .
cato , who was dressed in the plainest and most simple manner , and whose apartment was furnished in a style corresponding with the severity of his character , did not even rise when the king entered the room .
he simply pointed with his hand , and bade the visitor take a seat .
ptolemy began to make a statement of his case , with a view to obtaining cato 's influence with the <name> people to induce them to interpose in his behalf .
cato , however , far from evincing any disposition to espouse his visitor 's cause , <unk> him , in the plainest terms , for having abandoned his proper position in his own kingdom , to go and make himself a victim and a prey for the insatiable avarice of the <name> leaders .
" you can do nothing at rome , " he said , " but by the influence of bribes ; and all the resources of egypt <name> not be enough to satisfy the <name> <unk> for money . "
he concluded by recommending him to go back to <name> , and rely for his hopes of <unk> from the difficulties which surrounded him on the exercise of his own energy and resolution there .
ptolemy was greatly abashed at this <unk> , but , on consultation with his attendants and followers , it was decided to be too late now to return .
the whole party accordingly <unk> on board their galleys , and pursued their way to rome .
ptolemy found , on his arrival at the city , that caesar was absent in gaul , while pompey , on the other hand , who had returned victorious from his campaigns against <unk> , was now the great leader of influence and power at the capitol .
this change of circumstances was not , however , particularly unfavorable ; for ptolemy was on friendly terms with pompey , as he had been with caesar .
he had assisted him in his wars with <unk> by sending him a squadron of horse , in pursuance of his policy of cultivating friendly relations with the <name> people by every means in his power .
besides , pompey had received a part of the money which ptolemy had paid to caesar as the price of the <name> alliance , and was to receive his share of the rest in case ptolemy should ever be restored .
pompey was accordingly interested in <unk> the <name> fugitive 's cause .
he received him in his palace , entertained him in magnificent style , and took immediate measures for bringing his cause before the <name> senate , urging upon that body the adoption of immediate and vigorous measures for effecting his restoration , as an ally whom they were bound to protect against his rebellious subjects .
there was at first some opposition in the <name> senate against <unk> the cause of such a man , but it was soon put down , being overpowered in part by pompey 's authority , and in part silenced by ptolemy 's promises and bribes .
the senate determined to restore the king to his throne , and began to make arrangements for carrying the measure into effect .
the <name> provinces nearest to egypt were <unk> and syria , countries situated on the eastern and northeastern coast of the mediterranean sea , north of judea .
the forces stationed in these provinces would be , of course , the most convenient for furnishing the necessary troops for the expedition .
the province of <unk> was under the command of the consul <unk> .
<unk> was at this time at rome ; he had repaired to the capital for some temporary purpose , leaving his province and the troops stationed there under the command , for the time , of a sort of lieutenant general named <unk> .
it was concluded that this <unk> , with his syrian forces , should undertake the task of <unk> ptolemy on his throne .
while these plans and arrangements were yet immature , a circumstance occurred which threatened , for a time , wholly to defeat them .
it seems that when <name> 's father first left egypt , he had caused a report to be circulated there that he had been killed in the revolt .
the object of this stratagem was to cover and conceal his flight .
the government of <name> soon discovered the truth , and learned that the fugitive had gone in the direction of rome .
they immediately inferred that he was going to appeal to the <name> people for aid , and they determined that , if that were the case , the <name> people , before deciding in his favor , should have the opportunity to hear their side of the story as well as his .
they accordingly made preparations at once for sending a very imposing embassage to rome .
the deputation consisted of more than a hundred persons .
the object of <name> 's government in sending so large a number was not only to evince their respect for the <name> people , and their sense of the magnitude of the question at issue , but also to guard against any efforts that ptolemy might make to intercept the embassage on the way , or to buy off the members of it by bribes .
the number , however large as it was , proved insufficient to accomplish this purpose .
the whole <name> world was at this time in such a condition of disorder and violence , in the hands of the desperate and reckless military leaders who then bore sway , that there were everywhere abundant facilities for the commission of any conceivable crime .
ptolemy contrived , with the assistance of the fierce partisans who had espoused his cause , and who were deeply interested in his success on account of the rewards which were promised them , to <unk> and destroy a large proportion of this company before they reached rome .
some were assassinated ; some were poisoned ; some were tampered with and bought off by bribes .
a small remnant reached rome ; but they were so <unk> by the dangers which surrounded them , that they did not dare to take any public action in respect to the business which had been committed to their charge .
ptolemy began to congratulate himself on having completely <unk> his daughter in her efforts to protect herself against his designs .
instead of that , however , it soon proved that the effect of this atrocious treachery was exactly the contrary of what its <unk> had expected .
the knowledge of the facts became gradually extended among the people of rome and it awakened a universal indignation .
the party who had been originally opposed to ptolemy 's cause seized the opportunity to renew their opposition ; and they gained so much strength from the general <unk> which ptolemy 's crimes had awakened , that pompey found it almost impossible to sustain his cause .
at length the party opposed to ptolemy found , or pretended to find , in certain sacred books , called the <unk> oracles , which were kept in the custody of the priests , and were supposed to contain prophetic <unk> of the <name> of heaven in respect to the conduct of public affairs , the following passage :  " if a king of egypt should apply to you for aid , treat him in a friendly manner , but do not furnish him with troops ; for if you do , you <name> incur great danger .
"  this made new difficulty for ptolemy 's friends .
they attempted , at first , to evade this inspired injunction by denying the reality of it .
there was no such passage to be found , they said .
it was all an invention of their enemies .
this point seems to have been overruled , and then they attempted to give the passage some other than the obvious interpretation .
finally they maintained that , although it prohibited their furnishing ptolemy himself with troops , it did not forbid their sending an armed force into egypt under leaders of their own .
that they could certainly do ; and then , when the rebellion was suppressed , and <name> 's government overthrown , they could invite ptolemy to return to his kingdom and resume his crown in a peaceful manner .
this , they alleged , would not be " furnishing him with troops , " and , of course would not be disobeying the oracle .
these attempts to evade the direction of the oracle on the part of ptolemy 's friends , only made the debates and dissensions between them and his enemies more violent than ever .
pompey made every effort in his power to aid ptolemy 's cause ; but <unk> , after long hesitation and delay , decided that it would not be safe for him to embark in it .
at length , however , <unk> , the lieutenant who commanded in syria , was induced to undertake the enterprise .
on certain promises which he received from ptolemy , to be performed in case he succeeded , and with a certain encouragement , not very legal or regular , which pompey gave him , in respect to the employment of the <name> troops under his command , he resolved to march to egypt .
his route , of course , would lie along the shores of the mediterranean sea , and through the desert , to pelusium , which has already been mentioned as the frontier town on this side of egypt .
from pelusium he was to march through the heart of the <name> to <name> , and , if successful in his invasion , overthrow the government of <name> and <unk> , and then , inviting ptolemy to return , <unk> him on the throne .
in the prosecution of this dangerous enterprise , <unk> relied strongly on the assistance of a very remarkable man , then his second in command , who afterward acted a very important part in the subsequent history of <name> .
his name was <name> <name> .
<name> was born in rome , of a very distinguished family , but his father died when he was very young , and being left subsequently much to himself , he became a very wild and dissolute young man .
he wasted the property which his father had left him in folly and vice ; and then going on desperately in the same career , he soon incurred enormous debts , and involved himself , in consequence , in inextricable difficulties .
his creditors continually harassed him with <unk> for money , and with suits at law to compel payments which he had no means of making .
he was likewise incessantly pursued by the hostility of the many enemies that he had made in the city by his violence and his crimes .
at length he <unk> , and went to greece .
here <unk> , when on his way to syria , met him , and invited him to join his army rather than to remain where he was in idleness and destitution .
<name> , who was as proud and lofty in spirit as he was degraded in morals and condition , refused to do this unless <unk> would give him a command .
<unk> saw in the daring and reckless energy which <name> manifested the indications of the class of qualities which in those days made a successful soldier , and acceded to his terms .
he gave him the command of his cavalry .
<name> distinguished himself in the syrian campaigns that followed , and was now full of eagerness to engage in this egyptian enterprise .
in fact , it was mainly his zeal and enthusiasm to embark in the undertaking which was the means of deciding <unk> to consent to ptolemy 's proposals .
the danger and difficulty which they considered as most to be apprehended in the whole expedition was the getting across the desert to pelusium .
in fact , the great protection of egypt had always been her isolation .
the trackless and desolate sands , being wholly destitute of water , and utterly void , could be traversed , even by a caravan of peaceful travelers , only with great difficulty and danger .
for an army to attempt to cross them , exposed , as the troops would necessarily be , to the assaults of enemies who might advance to meet them on the way , and sure of encountering a terrible opposition from fresh and vigorous bands when they should arrive  <unk> and exhausted by the physical hardships of the way  at the borders of the inhabited country , was a desperate undertaking .
many instances occurred in ancient times in which vast bodies of troops , in attempting marches over the deserts by which egypt was surrounded , were wholly destroyed by famine or thirst , or overwhelmed by storms of sand .
these difficulties and dangers , however , did not at all intimidate <name> <name> .
the anticipation , in fact , of the <name> of <unk> them was one of the main inducements which led him to embark in the enterprise .
the perils of the desert constituted one of the charms which made the expedition so attractive .
he placed himself , therefore , at the head of his troop of cavalry , and set off across the sands in advance of <unk> , to take pelusium , in order thus to open a way for the main body of the army into egypt .
ptolemy accompanied <name> .
<unk> was to follow .
with all his faults , to call them by no severer name , <name> <name> possessed certain great excellences of character .
he was ardent , but then he was cool , collected , and sagacious ; and there was a certain <name> and manly generosity continually evincing itself in his conduct and character which made him a great favorite among his men .
he was at this time about twenty-eight years old , of a tall and manly form , and of an expressive and intellectual cast of countenance .
his forehead was high , his nose <unk> , and his eyes full of vivacity and life .
he was accustomed to dress in a very plain and careless manner , and he assumed an air of the utmost familiarity and freedom in his intercourse with his soldiers .
he would join them in their sports , joke with them , and good-naturedly receive their jokes in return ; and take his meals , standing with them around their rude tables , in the open field .
such habits of intercourse with his men in a commander of ordinary character would have been fatal to his ascendency over them ; but in <name> <unk> case , these <name> and familiar manners seemed only to make the military genius and the intellectual power which he possessed the more conspicuous and the more universally admired .
<name> conducted his troop of horsemen across the desert in a very safe and speedy manner , and arrived before pelusium .
the city was not prepared to resist him .
it surrendered at once , and the whole garrison fell into his hands as prisoners of war .
ptolemy demanded that they should all be immediately killed .
they were rebels , he said , and , as such , ought to be put to death .
<name> , however , as might have been expected from his character , absolutely refused to allow of any such <unk> .
ptolemy , since the power was not yet in his hands , was compelled to submit , and to postpone gratifying the spirit of vengeance which had so long been slumbering in his breast to a future day .
he could the more patiently submit to this necessity , since it appeared that the day of his complete and final triumph over his daughter and all her adherents was now very nigh at hand .
in fact , <name> and her government , when they heard of the arrival of <name> and ptolemy at pelusium , of the fall of that city , and of the approach of <unk> with an overwhelming force of <name> soldiers , were struck with dismay .
<unk> , the husband of <name> , had been , in former years , a personal friend of <name> 's .
<name> considered , in fact , that they were friends still , though required by what the historian calls their duty to fight each other for the possession of the kingdom .
the government of <name> raised an army .
<unk> took command of it , and advanced to meet the enemy .
in the mean time , <unk> arrived with the main body of the <name> troops , and commenced his march , in conjunction with <name> , toward the capital .
as they were obliged to make a circuit to the southward , in order to avoid the <unk> and lagoons which , on the northern coast of egypt , penetrate for some distance into the land , their course led them through the heart of the <name> .
many battles were fought , the romans every where gaining the victory .
the egyptian soldiers were , in fact , discontented and mutinous , perhaps , in part , because they considered the government on the side of which they were compelled to engage as , after all a usurpation .
at length a great final battle was fought , which settled the controversy .
<unk> was slain upon the field , and <name> was taken prisoner ; their government was wholly overthrown , and the way was opened for the march of the <name> armies to <name> .
<name> <name> , when judged by our standards , was certainly , as well as ptolemy , a depraved and vicious man ; but his depravity was of a very different type from that of <name> 's father .
the difference in the men , in one respect , was very clearly evinced by the objects toward which their interest and attention were respectively turned after this great battle .
while the contest had been going on , the king and <name> of egypt , <unk> and <name> , were , of course , in the view both of <name> and ptolemy , the two most conspicuous personages in the army of their enemies ; and while <name> would naturally watch with the greatest interest the fate of his friend , the king , ptolemy , would as naturally follow with the highest concern the <name> of his daughter .
accordingly , when the battle was over , while the mind of ptolemy might , as we should naturally expect , be chiefly occupied by the fact that his daughter was made a captive , <name> 's , we might suppose , would be engrossed by the tidings that his friend had been slain .
the one rejoiced and the other mourned .
<name> sought for the body of his friend on the field of battle , and when it was found , he gave himself wholly to the work of providing for it a most magnificent burial .
he seemed , at the funeral , to lament the death of his ancient comrade with real and unaffected grief .
ptolemy , on the other hand , was overwhelmed with <name> at finding his daughter his captive .
the <unk> hour for the gratification of his revenge had come at last , and the first use which he made of his power when he was put in possession of it at <name> was to order his daughter to be beheaded .

at the time when the unnatural quarrel between <name> 's father and her sister was working its way toward its dreadful termination , as related in the last chapter , she herself was residing at the <name> palace in <name> , a blooming and beautiful girl of about fifteen .
fortunately for her , she was too young to take any active part personally in the contention .
her two brothers were still younger than herself .
they all three remained , therefore , in the <name> palaces , quiet spectators of the revolution , without being either benefited or injured by it .
it is singular that the name of both the boys was ptolemy .
the excitement in the city of <name> was intense and universal when the <name> army entered it to <unk> <name> 's father upon his throne .
a very large portion of the inhabitants were pleased with having the former king restored .
in fact , it appears , by a retrospect of the history of kings that when a legitimate hereditary sovereign or dynasty is deposed and expelled by a rebellious population , no matter how intolerable may have been the tyranny , or how atrocious the crimes by which the <name> of the subject was exhausted , the lapse of a very few years is ordinarily sufficient to produce a very general readiness to acquiesce in a restoration ; and in this particular instance there had been no such superiority in the government of <name> , during the period while her power continued , over that of her father , which she had displaced , as to make this case an exception to the general rule .
the mass of the people , therefore  all those , especially , who had taken no active part in <name> 's government  were ready to welcome ptolemy back to his capital .
those who had taken such a part were all summarily executed by ptolemy 's orders .
there was , of course , a great excitement throughout the city on the arrival of the <name> army .
all the foreign influence and power which had been exercised in egypt thus far , and almost all the officers , whether civil or military , had been greek .
the coming of the romans was the introduction of a new element of interest to add to the endless variety of excitements which animated the capital .
the restoration of ptolemy was celebrated with games , spectacles , and festivities of every kind , and , of course , next to the king himself , the chief center of interest and attraction in all these public rejoicings would be the distinguished foreign generals by whose instrumentality the end had been gained .
<name> <name> was a special object of public regard and admiration at the time .
his eccentric manners , his <name> and honest air , his <name> simplicity of dress and demeanor , made him conspicuous ; and his interposition to save the lives of the captured garrison of pelusium , and the interest which he took in rendering such distinguished funeral honors to the enemy whom his army had slain in battle , impressed the people with the idea of a certain nobleness and magnanimity in his character , which , in spite of his faults , made him an object of general admiration and applause .
the very faults of such a man assume often , in the eyes of the world , the guise and semblance of virtues .
for example , it is related of <name> that , at one time in the course of his life , having a <name> to make a present of some kind to a certain person , in <unk> for a favor which he had received from him , he ordered his treasurer to send a sum of money to his friend  and named for the sum to be sent an amount considerably greater than was really required under the circumstances of the case  acting thus , as he often did , under the influence of a blind and <unk> generosity .
the treasurer , more prudent than his master , wished to reduce the amount , but he did not dare directly to propose a reduction ; so he counted out the money , and laid it in a pile in a place where <name> was to pass , thinking that when <name> saw the amount , he would perceive that it was too great .
<name> , in passing by , asked what money that was .
the treasurer said that it was the sum that he had ordered to be sent as a present to such a person , naming the individual intended .
<name> was quick to perceive the object of the treasurer 's <unk> .
he immediately replied , " ah !
is that all ?
i thought the sum i named would make a better appearance than that ; send him double the amount . "
to determine , under such circumstances as these , to double an extravagance merely for the purpose of <unk> the honest attempt of a faithful servant to diminish it , made , too , in so cautious and delicate a way , is most certainly a fault .
but it is one of those faults for which the world , in all ages , <name> persist in admiring and praising the <unk> .
in a word , <name> became the object of general attention and favor during his continuance at <name> .
whether he particularly attracted <name> 's attention at this time or not does not appear .
she , however , strongly attracted <unk> he admired her blooming beauty , her <unk> and wit , and her various accomplishments .
she was still , however , so young  being but fifteen years of age , while <name> was nearly thirty  that she probably made no very serious impression upon him .
a short time after this , <name> went back to rome , and did not see <name> again for many years .
when the two <name> generals went away from <name> , they left a considerable portion of the army behind them , under ptolemy 's command , to aid him in keeping possession of his throne .
<name> returned to rome .
he had acquired great renown by his march across the desert , and by the successful accomplishment of the invasion of egypt and the restoration of ptolemy .
his funds , too , were <unk> by the vast sums paid to him and to <unk> by ptolemy .
the amount which ptolemy is said to have agreed to pay as the price of his restoration was two thousand talents  equal to ten millions of dollars  a sum which shows on how great a scale the operations of this celebrated campaign were conducted .
ptolemy raised a large portion of the money required for his payments by <unk> the estates belonging to those friends of <unk> government whom he ordered to be slain .
it was said , in fact , that the <name> were very much increased of those that were condemned to die , by ptolemy 's standing in such urgent need of their property to meet his obligations .
<name> , through the results of this campaign , found himself suddenly raised from the position of a disgraced and homeless fugitive to that of one of the most wealthy and renowned , and , consequently , one of the most powerful personages in rome .
the great civil war broke out about this time between caesar and pompey .
<name> espoused the cause of caesar .
in the mean time , while the civil war between caesar and pompey was raging , ptolemy succeeded in maintaining his seat on the throne , by the aid of the <name> soldiers whom <name> and <unk> had left him , for about three years .
when he found himself drawing toward the close of life , the question arose to his mind to whom he should leave his kingdom .
<name> was the oldest child , and she was a <name> of great promise , both in respect to mental endowments and personal charms .
her brothers were considerably younger than she .
the claim of a son , though younger , seemed to be naturally stronger than that of a daughter ; but the commanding talents and rising influence of <name> appeared to make it doubtful whether it would be safe to pass her by .
the father settled the question in the way in which such difficulties were usually surmounted in the ptolemy family .
he ordained that <name> should marry the oldest of her brothers , and that they two should jointly occupy the throne .
adhering also , still , to the idea of the alliance of egypt with rome , which had been the leading principle of the whole policy of his reign , he solemnly committed the execution of his <name> and the guardianship of his children , by a provision of the instrument itself , to the <name> senate .
the senate accepted the appointment , and appointed pompey as the agent , on their part , to perform the duties of the trust .
the attention of pompey was , immediately after that time , too much engrossed by the civil war waged between himself , and caesar , to take any active steps in respect to the duties of his appointment .
it seemed , however , that none were necessary , for all parties in <name> appeared disposed , after the death of the king , to acquiesce in the arrangements which he had made , and to join in carrying them into effect .
<name> was married to her brother  yet , it is true , only a boy .
he was about ten years old .
she was herself about eighteen .
they were both too young to govern ; they could only reign .
the affairs of the kingdom were , accordingly , conducted by two ministers whom their father had designated .
these ministers were pothinus , a <unk> , who was a sort of secretary of state , and achillas , the commander-in-chief of the armies .
thus , though <name> , by these events , became nominally a <name> , her real accession to the throne was not yet accomplished .
there were still many difficulties and dangers to be passed through , before the period arrived when she became really a sovereign .
she did not , herself , make any immediate attempt to hasten this period , but seems to have acquiesced , on the other hand , very quietly , for a time , in the arrangements which her father had made .
pothinus was a <unk> .
he had been , for a long time , an officer of government under ptolemy , the father .
he was a proud , ambitious , and domineering man , determined to rule , and very unscrupulous in respect to the means which he adopted to accomplish his ends .
he had been accustomed to regard <name> as a mere child .
now that she was <name> , he was very unwilling that the real power should pass into her hands .
the jealousy and ill <name> which he felt toward her increased rapidly as he found , in the course of the first two or three years after her father 's death , that she was advancing rapidly in strength of character , and in the influence and ascendency which she was acquiring over all around her .
her beauty , her accomplishments , and a certain indescribable charm which pervaded all her demeanor , combined to give her great personal power .
but , while these things awakened in other minds feelings of interest in <name> and attachment to her , they only increased the jealousy and envy of pothinus .
<name> was becoming his rival .
he endeavored to thwart and circumvent her .
he acted toward her in a haughty and overbearing manner , in order to keep her down to what he considered her proper place as his <name> ; for he was yet the guardian both of <name> and her husband , and the regent of the realm .
<name> had a great deal of what is sometimes called spirit , and her resentment was aroused by this treatment .
pothinus took pains to enlist her young husband , ptolemy , on his side , as the quarrel advanced .
ptolemy was younger , and of a character much less marked and decided than <name> .
pothinus saw that he could maintain control over him much more easily and for a much longer time than over <name> .
he contrived to awaken the young ptolemy 's jealousy of his wife 's rising influence , and to induce him to join in efforts to thwart and counteract it .
these attempts to turn her husband against her only aroused <name> 's resentment the more .
hers was not a spirit to be <unk> .
the palace was filled with the dissensions of the rivals .
pothinus and ptolemy began to take measures for securing the army on their side .
an open rupture finally ensued , and <name> was expelled from the kingdom .
she went to syria .
syria was the nearest place of refuge , and then , besides , it was the country from which the aid had been furnished by which her father had been restored to the throne when he had been expelled , in a similar manner , many years before .
her father , it is true , had gone first to rome ; but the <unk> which he had <unk> for had been sent from syria .
<name> hoped to obtain the same assistance by going directly there .
nor was she disappointed .
she obtained an army , and commenced her march toward egypt , following the same track which <name> and <unk> had pursued in coming to <unk> her father .
pothinus raised an army and went forth to meet her .
he took achillas as the commander of the troops , and the young ptolemy as the nominal sovereign ; while he , as the young king 's guardian and prime minister , exercised the real power .
the troops of pothinus advanced to pelusium .
here they met the forces of <name> coming from the east .
the armies encamped not very far from each other , and both sides began to prepare for battle .
the battle , however , was not fought .
it was prevented by the occurrence of certain great and unforeseen events which at this crisis suddenly burst upon the scene of egyptian history , and turned the whole current of affairs into new and unexpected channels .
the breaking out of the civil war between the great <name> generals caesar and pompey , and their respective partisans , has already been mentioned as having occurred soon after the death of <name> 's father , and as having prevented pompey from undertaking the office of <unk> of the <name> .
this war had been raging ever since that time with terrible fury .
its distant thundering had been heard even in egypt , but it was too remote to awaken there any special alarm .
the immense armies of these two mighty conquerors had moved slowly  like two ferocious birds of prey , flying through the air , and fighting as they fly  across italy into greece , and from greece , through macedon , into thessaly , contending in dreadful struggles with each other as they advanced , and trampling down and destroying every thing in their way .
at length a great final battle had been fought at <unk> .
pompey had been totally defeated .
he had fled to the sea-shore , and there , with a few ships and a small number of followers , he had pushed out upon the mediterranean , not knowing whither to fly , and overwhelmed with wretchedness and despair .
caesar followed him in eager pursuit .
he had a small fleet of galleys with him , on board of which he had embarked two or three thousand men .
this was a force suitable , perhaps , for the pursuit of a fugitive , but wholly insufficient for any other design .
pompey thought of ptolemy .
he remembered the efforts which he himself had made for the cause of ptolemy <unk> , at rome , and the success of those efforts in securing that monarch 's restoration  an event through which alone the young ptolemy had been enabled to attain the crown .
he came , therefore to pelusium , and , <unk> his little fleet off the shore , sent to the land to ask ptolemy to receive and protect him .
pothinus , who was really the commander in ptolemy 's army , made answer to this application that pompey should be received and protected , and that he would send out a boat to bring him to the shore .
pompey felt some misgivings in respect to this proffered hospitality , but he finally concluded to go to the shore in the boat which pothinus sent for him .
as soon as he landed , the egyptians , by pothinus 's orders , stabbed and beheaded him on the sand .
pothinus and his council had decided that this would be the safest course .
if they were to receive pompey , they reasoned , caesar would be made their enemy ; if they refused to receive him , pompey himself would be offended , and they did not know which of the two it would be safe to <unk> ; for they did not know in what way , if both the generals were to be allowed to live , the war would ultimately end .
" but by killing pompey , " they said , " we shall be sure to please caesar and pompey himself <name> lie still .
"  in the mean time , caesar , not knowing to what part of egypt pompey had fled , pressed on directly to <name> .
he exposed himself to great danger in so doing , for the forces under his command were not sufficient to protect him in case of his becoming involved in difficulties with the authorities there .
nor could he , when once arrived on the egyptian coast , easily go away again ; for , at the season of the year in which these events occurred , there was a periodical wind which blew steadily toward that part of the coast , and , while it made it very easy for a fleet of ships to go to <name> , rendered it almost impossible for them to return .
caesar was very little accustomed to shrink from danger in any of his enterprises and plans , though still he was usually prudent and <unk> .
in this instance , however , his ardent interest in the pursuit of pompey overruled all considerations of personal safety .
he arrived at <name> , but he found that pompey was not there .
he anchored his vessels in the port , landed his troops , and established himself in the city .
these two events , the assassination of one of the great <name> generals on the eastern extremity of the coast , and the arrival of the other , at the same moment , at <name> , on the western , burst suddenly upon egypt together , like simultaneous <unk> of thunder .
the tidings struck the whole country with astonishment , and immediately engrossed universal attention .
at the camps both of <name> and ptolemy , at pelusium , all was excitement and wonder .
instead of thinking of a battle , both parties were wholly occupied in speculating on the results which were likely to <unk> , to one side or to the other , under the totally new and unexpected aspect which public affairs had assumed .
of course the thoughts of all were turned toward <name> .
pothinus immediately proceeded to the city , taking with him the young king .
achillas , too , either accompanied them , or followed soon afterward .
they carried with them the head of pompey , which they had cut off on the shore where they had killed him , and also a seal which they took from his finger .
when they arrived at <name> , they sent the head , wrapped up in a cloth , and also the seal , as presents to caesar .
accustomed as they were to the brutal deeds and heartless cruelties of the ptolemies , they supposed that caesar would <unk> at the spectacle of the dissevered and ghastly head of his great rival and enemy .
instead of this , he was shocked and displeased , and ordered the head to be buried with the most solemn and imposing funeral ceremonies .
he , however , accepted and kept the seal .
the device engraved upon it was a lion holding a sword in his paw  a fit emblem of the characters of the men , who , though in many respects magnanimous and just , had filled the whole world with the terror of their quarrels .
the army of ptolemy , while he himself and his immediate counselors went to <name> , was left at pelusium , under the command of other officers , to watch <name> .
<name> herself would have been pleased , also , to repair to <name> and appeal to caesar , if it had been in her power to do so ; but she was beyond the confines of the country , with a powerful army of her enemies ready to intercept her on any attempt to enter or pass through it .
she remained , therefore , at pelusium , uncertain what to do .
in the mean time , caesar soon found himself in a somewhat embarrassing situation at <name> .
he had been accustomed , for many years , to the possession and the exercise of the most absolute and despotic power , wherever he might be ; and now that pompey , his great rival , was dead , he considered himself the monarch and master of the world .
he had not , however , at <name> , any means sufficient to maintain and enforce such pretensions , and yet he was not of a spirit to abate , on that account , in the slightest degree , the advancing of them .
he established himself in the palaces of <name> as if he were himself the king .
he moved , in state , through the streets of the city , at the head of his guards , and displaying the customary emblems of supreme authority used at rome .
he claimed the six thousand talents which ptolemy <unk> had formerly promised him for procuring a treaty of alliance with rome , and he called upon pothinus to pay the balance due .
he said , moreover , that by the <name> of <unk> the <name> people had been made the <unk> ; and that it devolved upon him as the <name> consul , and , consequently , the representative of the <name> people , to assume that trust , and in the discharge of it to settle the dispute between ptolemy and <name> , and he called upon ptolemy to prepare and lay before him a statement of his claims , and the grounds on which he maintained his right to the throne to the exclusion of <name> .
on the other hand , pothinus , who had been as little accustomed to acknowledge a superior as caesar , though his supremacy and domination had been exercised on a somewhat humbler scale , was obstinate and <unk> in resisting all these demands , though the means and methods which he resorted to were of a character corresponding to his weak and ignoble mind .
he <unk> quarrels in the streets between the alexandrian populace and caesar 's soldiers .
he thought that , as the number of troops under caesar 's command in the city , and of vessels in the port , was small , he could tease and worry the romans with impunity , though he had not the courage openly to attack them .
he pretended to be a friend , or , at least , not an enemy , and yet he conducted himself toward them in an overbearing and insolent manner .
he had agreed to make arrangements for supplying them with food , and he did this by procuring damaged provisions of a most wretched quality ; and when the soldiers remonstrated , he said to them , that they who lived at other people's cost had no right to complain of their fare .
he caused wooden and earthen vessels to be used in the palace , and said , in explanation , that he had been compelled to sell all the gold and silver plate of the <name> household to meet the exactions of caesar .
he busied himself , too , about the city , in endeavoring to excite <unk> against caesar 's proposal to hear and decide the question at issue between <name> and ptolemy .
ptolemy was a sovereign , he said , and was not amenable to any foreign power whatever .
thus , without the courage or the energy to attempt any open , manly , and effectual system of hostility , he contented himself with making all the difficulty in his power , by urging an incessant pressure of petty , vexatious , and provoking , but useless annoyances .
caesar 's demands may have been unjust , but they were bold , manly , and undisguised .
the <unk> may have been right in resisting them ; but the mode was so mean and contemptible , that mankind have always taken part with caesar in the sentiments which they have formed as spectators of the contest .
with the very small force which caesar had at his command , and shut up as he was in the midst of a very great and powerful city , in which both the garrison and the population were growing more and more hostile to him every day , he soon found his situation was beginning to be attended with very serious danger .
he could not retire from the scene .
he probably would not have retired if he could have done so .
he remained , therefore , in the city , conducting himself all the time with <name> and <unk> , but yet maintaining , as at first , the same air of confident self-possession and superiority which always characterized his demeanor .
he , however , dispatched a messenger forthwith into syria , the nearest country under the <name> sway , with orders that several legions which were posted there should be embarked and forwarded to <name> with the utmost possible celerity .

in the mean time , while the events related in the last chapter were taking place at <name> , <name> remained anxious and uneasy in her camp , quite uncertain , for a time , what it was best for her to do .
she wished to be at <name> .
she knew very well that caesar 's power in controlling the course of affairs in egypt would necessarily be supreme .
she was , of course , very <name> in her <name> to be able to present her cause before him .
as it was , ptolemy and pothinus were in communication with the <unk> , and , for aught she knew , <unk> cultivating his favor , while she was far away , her cause unheard , her wrongs unknown , and perhaps even her existence forgotten .
of course , under such circumstances , she was very <name> to get to <name> .
but how to accomplish this purpose was a source of great perplexity .
she could not march thither at the head of an army , for the army of the king was strongly intrenched at pelusium , and effectually barred the way .
she could not attempt to pass alone , or with few attendants , through the country , for every town and village was occupied with garrisons and officers under the orders of pothinus , and she would be certainly intercepted .
she had no fleet , and could not , therefore , make the passage by sea .
besides , even if she could by any means reach the gates of <name> , how was she to pass safely through the streets of the city to the palace where caesar resided , since the city , except in caesar 's quarters , was wholly in the hands of pothinus 's government ?
the difficulties in the way of accomplishing her object seemed thus almost insurmountable .
she was , however , resolved to make the attempt .
she sent a message to caesar , asking permission to appear before him and plead her own cause .
caesar replied , urging her by all means to come .
she took a single boat , and with the smallest number of attendants possible , made her way along the coast to <name> .
the man on whom she principally relied in this hazardous expedition was a domestic named <unk> .
she had , however , some other attendants besides .
when the party reached <name> , they waited until night , and then advanced to the foot of the walls of the citadel .
here <unk> rolled the <name> up in a piece of <unk> , and , covering the whole package with a cloth , he tied it with a thong , so as to give it the appearance of a bale of ordinary merchandise , and then throwing the load across his shoulder , he advanced into the city .
<name> was at this time about twenty-one years of age , but she was of a slender and graceful form , and the burden was , consequently , not very heavy .
<unk> came to the gates of the palace where caesar was residing .
the guards at the gates asked him what it was that he was carrying .
he said that it was a present for caesar .
so they allowed him to pass , and the pretended <name> carried his package safely in .
when it was unrolled , and <name> came out to view , caesar was perfectly charmed with the spectacle .
in fact , the various conflicting emotions which she could not but feel under such circumstances as these , imparted a double interest to her beautiful and expressive face , and to her naturally bewitching manners .
she was excited by the adventure through which she had passed , and yet pleased with her narrow escape from its dangers .
the curiosity and interest which she felt on the one hand , in respect to the great personage into whose presence she had been thus strangely ushered , was very strong ; but then , on the other hand , it was <unk> and subdued by that feeling of timidity which , in new and unexpected situations like these , and under a consciousness of being the object of eager observation to the other sex , is inseparable from the nature of woman .
the conversation which caesar held with <name> deepened the impression which her first appearance had made upon him .
her intelligence and animation , the originality of her ideas , and the point and <unk> of her mode of expressing them , made her , independently of her personal charms , an exceedingly entertaining and agreeable companion .
she , in fact , completely won the great conqueror 's heart ; and , through the strong attachment to her which he immediately formed , he became wholly <unk> to act impartially between her and her brother in regard to their respective rights to the crown .
we call ptolemy <unk> brother ; for , though he was also , in fact , her husband , still , as he was only ten or twelve years of age at the time of <name> 's expulsion from <name> , the marriage had been probably regarded , thus far , only as a mere matter of form .
caesar was now about fifty-two .
he had a wife , named calpurnia , to whom he had been married about ten years .
she was living , at this time in an unostentatious and quiet manner at rome .
she was a <name> of an amiable and gentle character , <unk> attached to her husband , patient and forbearing in respect to his faults , and often anxious and unhappy at the thought of the difficulties and dangers in which his ardent and unbounded ambition so often involved him .
caesar immediately began to take a very strong interest in <unk> cause .
he treated her personally with the <unk> attention , and it was impossible for her not to <unk> in some degree the kind feeling with which he regarded her .
it was , in fact , something altogether new to her to have a warm and devoted friend , <unk> her cause , <unk> her protection , and seeking in every way to promote her happiness .
her father had all his life neglected her .
her brother , of years and understanding totally inferior to hers , whom she had been compelled to make her husband , had become her mortal enemy .
it is true that , in depriving her of her inheritance and <unk> her from her native land , he had been only the tool and instrument of more designing men .
this , however , far from improving the point of view from which she regarded him , made him appear not only hateful , but contemptible too .
all the officers of government , also , in the alexandrian court had turned against her , because they had supposed that they could control her brother more easily if she were away .
thus she had always been surrounded by selfish , mercenary , and implacable foes .
now , for the first time , she seemed to have a friend .
a protector had suddenly arisen to support and defend her ,  a man of very alluring person and manners , of a very <name> and generous spirit , and of the very highest station .
he loved her , and she could not refrain from loving him in return .
she committed her cause entirely into his hands , confided to him all her interests , and gave herself up wholly into his power .
nor was the unbounded confidence which she reposed in him <unk> , so far as related to his efforts to restore her to her throne .
the legions which caesar had sent for into syria had not yet arrived , and his situation in <name> was still very defenseless and very precarious .
he did not , however , on this account , abate in the least degree the <unk> and self confidence of the position which he had assumed , but he commenced immediately the work of securing <name> 's restoration .
this quiet assumption of the right and power to <unk> and decide such a question as that of the claim to the throne , in a country where he had accidentally landed and found rival claimants disputing for the succession , while he was still wholly destitute of the means of enforcing the superiority which he so coolly assumed , marks the immense ascendency which the <name> power had attained at this time in the estimation of mankind , and is , besides , specially characteristic of the genius and disposition of caesar .
very soon after <name> had come to him , caesar sent for the young ptolemy , and urged upon him the duty and expediency of restoring <name> .
ptolemy was beginning now to attain an age at which he might be supposed to have some opinion of his own on such a question .
he declared himself utterly opposed to any such design .
in the course of the conversation he learned that <name> had arrived at <name> , and that she was then concealed in caesar 's palace .
this intelligence awakened in his mind the greatest excitement and indignation .
he went away from caesar 's presence in a rage .
he tore the <unk> which he was accustomed to wear in the streets , from his head , threw it down , and trampled it under his feet .
he declared to the people that he was betrayed , and displayed the most violent indications of vexation and chagrin .
the chief subject of his complaint , in the attempts which he made to awaken the popular indignation against caesar and the romans , was the disgraceful impropriety of the position which his sister had assumed in surrendering herself as she had done to caesar .
it is most probable , however , unless his character was very different from that of every other ptolemy in the line , that what really awakened his jealousy and anger was fear of the commanding influence and power to which <name> was likely to attain through the agency of so distinguished a protector , rather than any other consequences of his friendship , or any real considerations of delicacy in respect to his sister 's good name or his own martial honor .
however this may be , ptolemy , together with pothinus and achillas , and all his other friends and adherents , who joined him in the terrible outcry that he made against the <unk> which he had discovered between <name> and caesar , succeeded in producing a very general and violent tumult throughout the city .
the populace were aroused , and began to assemble in great crowds , and full of indignation and anger .
some knew the facts , and acted under something like an understanding of the cause of their anger .
others only knew that the aim of this sudden outbreak was to assault the romans , and were ready , on any pretext , known or unknown , to join in any deeds of violence directed against these foreign intruders .
there were others still , and these , probably , far the larger portion , who knew nothing and understood nothing but that there was to be tumult and a riot in and around the palaces , and were , accordingly , eager to be there .
ptolemy and his officers had no large body of troops in <name> ; for the events which had thus far occurred since caesar 's arrival had succeeded each other so rapidly , that a very short time had yet elapsed , and the main army remained still at pelusium .
the main force , therefore , by which caesar was now attacked , consisted of the population of the city , headed , perhaps , by the few guards which the young king had at his command .
caesar , on his part , had but a small portion of his forces at the palace where he was attacked .
the rest were scattered about the city .
he , however , seems to have felt no alarm .
he did not even confine himself to acting on the defensive .
he sent out a detachment of his soldiers with orders to seize ptolemy and bring him in a prisoner .
soldiers trained , disciplined , and armed as the <name> veterans were , and nerved by the ardor and enthusiasm which seemed always to animate troops which were under caesar 's personal command , could accomplish almost any undertaking against a mere populace , however numerous or however furiously excited they might be .
the soldiers sallied out , seized ptolemy , and brought him in .
the populace were at first astounded at the daring presumption of this deed , and then exasperated at the indignity of it , considered as a violation of the person of their sovereign .
the tumult would have greatly increased , had it not been that caesar ,  who had now attained all his ends in thus having brought <name> and ptolemy both within his power ,  thought it most expedient to allay it .
he accordingly ascended to the window of a tower , or of some other elevated portion of his palace , so high that missiles from the mob below could not reach him , and began to make signals expressive of his wish to address them .
when silence was obtained , he made them a speech well calculated to quiet the excitement .
he told them that he did not pretend to any right to judge between <name> and ptolemy as their superior , but only in the performance of the duty solemnly assigned by ptolemy <unk> , the father , to the <name> people , whose representative he was .
other than this he claimed no jurisdiction in the case ; and his only wish , in the discharge of the duty which devolved upon him to consider the cause , was to settle the question in a manner just and <unk> to all the parties concerned , and thus arrest the progress of the civil war , which , if not arrested , threatened to involve the country in the most terrible calamities .
he counseled them , therefore , to disperse , and no longer disturb the peace of the city .
he would immediately take measures for trying the question between <name> and ptolemy , and he did not doubt , but that they would all be satisfied with his decision .
this speech , made , as it was , in the eloquent and persuasive , and yet dignified and imposing manner for which caesar 's <unk> to turbulent assemblies like these were so famed , produced a great effect .
some were convinced , others were silenced ; and those whose resentment and anger were not appeased , found themselves deprived of their power by the <unk> of the rest .
the mob was dispersed , and ptolemy remained with <name> in caesar 's custody .
the next day , caesar , according to his promise , convened an assembly of the principal people of <name> and officers of state , and then brought out ptolemy and <name> , that he might decide their cause .
the original <name> which ptolemy <unk> had executed had been deposited in the public archives of <name> , and carefully preserved there .
an authentic copy of it had been sent to rome .
caesar caused the original <name> to be brought out and read to the assembly .
the provisions of it were perfectly explicit and clear .
it required that <name> and ptolemy should be married , and then settled the sovereign power upon them jointly , as king and <name> .
it recognized the <name> commonwealth as the ally of egypt , and constituted the <name> government the <unk> of the <name> , and the guardian of the king and <name> .
in fact , so clear and explicit was this document , that the simple reading of it seemed to be of itself a decision of the question .
when , therefore , caesar announced that , in his judgment , <name> was entitled to share the supreme power with ptolemy , and that it was his duty , as the representative of the <name> power and the <unk> of the <name> , to protect both the king and the <name> in their respective rights , there seemed to be nothing that could be said against his decision .
besides <name> and ptolemy , there were two other children of ptolemy <unk> in the <name> family at this time .
one was a girl , named arsinoÃ« .
the other , a boy , was , singularly enough , named , like his brother , ptolemy .
these children were quite young , but caesar thought that it would perhaps gratify the <unk> , and lead them to acquiesce more readily in his decision , if he were to make some <name> provision for them .
he accordingly proposed to assign the island of cyprus as a realm for them .
this was literally a gift , for cyprus was at this time a <name> possession .
the whole assembly seemed satisfied with this decision except pothinus .
he had been so determined and inveterate an enemy to <name> , that , as he was well aware , her restoration must end in his downfall and ruin .
he went away from the assembly moodily determining that he would not submit to the decision , but would immediately adopt efficient measures to prevent its being carried into effect .
caesar made arrangements for a series of festivals and celebrations , to commemorate and confirm the <unk> of a good understanding between the king and the <name> , and the consequent termination of the war .
such celebrations , he judged , would have great influence in removing any remaining animosities from the minds of the people , and restore the dominion of a kind and friendly feeling throughout the city .
the people fell in with these measures , and cordially <unk> to give them effect ; but pothinus and achillas , though they suppressed all outward expressions of discontent , made incessant efforts in secret to organize a party , and to form plans for <unk> the influence of caesar , and making ptolemy again the sole and exclusive sovereign .
pothinus represented to all whom he could induce to listen to him that caesar 's real design was to make <name> <name> alone , and to depose ptolemy , and urged them to combine with him to resist a policy which would end in bringing egypt under the dominion of a woman .
he also formed a plan , in connection with achillas , for ordering the army back from pelusium .
the army consisted of thirty thousand men .
if that army could be brought to <name> and kept under pothinus 's orders , caesar and his three thousand <name> soldiers would be , they thought , wholly at their <name> .
there was , however , one danger to be guarded against in ordering the army to march toward the capital , and that was , that ptolemy , while under caesar 's influence , might open communication with the officers , and so obtain command of its movements , and thwart all the <unk> designs .
to prevent this , it was arranged between pothinus and achillas that the latter should make his escape from <name> , proceed immediately to the camp at pelusium , resume the command of the troops there , and conduct them himself to the capital ; and that in all these operations , and also subsequently on his arrival , he should obey no orders unless they came to him through pothinus himself .
although sentinels and guards were probably stationed at the gates and avenues leading from the city achillas contrived to effect his escape and to join the army .
he placed himself at the head of the forces , and commenced his march toward the capital .
pothinus remained all the time within the city as a spy , pretending to acquiesce in caesar 's decision , and to be on friendly terms with him , but really plotting for his overthrow , and obtaining all the information which his position enabled him to command , in order that he might co-operate with the army and achillas when they should arrive .
all these things were done with the utmost secrecy , and so cunning and adroit were the conspirators in forming and executing their plots , that caesar seems to have had no knowledge of the measures which his enemies were taking , until he suddenly heard that the main body of <unk> army was approaching the city , at least twenty thousand strong .
in the mean time , however , the forces which he had sent for from syria had not arrived , and no alternative was left but to defend the capital and himself as well as he could with the very small force which he had at his disposal .
he determined , however , first , to try the effect of orders sent out in ptolemy 's name to forbid the approach of the army to the city .
two officers were accordingly intrusted with these orders , and sent out to communicate them to achillas .
the names of these officers were <unk> and <unk> .
it shows in a very striking point of view to what an incredible exaltation the authority and consequence of a sovereign king rose in those ancient days , in the minds of men , that achillas , at the moment when these men made their appearance in the camp , bearing evidently some command from ptolemy in the city , considered it more prudent to kill them at once , without hearing their message , rather than to allow the orders to be delivered and then take the responsibility of disobeying them .
if he could succeed in marching to <name> and in taking possession of the city , and then in <unk> caesar and <name> and restoring ptolemy to the exclusive possession of the throne , he knew very well that the king would rejoice in the result , and would overlook all irregularities on his part in the means by which he had accomplished it , short of absolute disobedience of a known command .
whatever might be the commands that these messengers were bringing him , he supposed that they doubtless originated , not in ptolemy 's own free <name> , but that they were dictated by the authority of caesar .
still , they would be commands coming in ptolemy 's name , and the universal experience of officers serving under the military despots of those ancient days showed that , rather than to take the responsibility of directly disobeying a <name> order once received , it was safer to avoid receiving it by murdering the messengers .
achillas therefore directed the officers to be seized and slain .
they were accordingly taken off and <unk> by the soldiers , and then the bodies were borne away .
the soldiers , however , it was found , had not done their work effectually .
there was no interest for them in such a cold-blooded assassination , and perhaps something like a sentiment of compassion restrained their hands .
at any rate , though both the men were desperately wounded , one only died .
the other lived and recovered .
achillas continued to advance toward the city .
caesar , finding that the crisis which was approaching was becoming very serious in its character , took , himself , the whole command within the capital , and began to make the best arrangements possible under the circumstances of the case to defend himself there .
his <name> were altogether too small to defend the whole city against the overwhelming force which was advancing to assail it .
he accordingly intrenched his troops in the palaces and in the citadel , and in such other parts of the city as it seemed practicable to defend .
he barricaded all the streets and avenues leading to these points , and fortified the gates .
nor did he , while thus doing all in his power to employ the insufficient means of defense already in his hands to the best advantage , neglect the proper exertions for obtaining succor from abroad .
he sent off galleys to syria , to cyprus , to rhodes , and to every other point accessible from <name> where <name> troops might be expected to be found , urging the authorities there to forward re-enforcements to him with the utmost possible dispatch .
during all this time <name> and ptolemy remained in the palace with caesar , both ostensibly <unk> with him in his councils and measures for defending the city from achillas .
<name> , of course , was sincere and in <name> in this co-operation ; but ptolemy 's adhesion to the common cause was very little to be relied upon .
although , situated as he was , he was compelled to seem to be on caesar 's side , he must have secretly desired that achillas should succeed and caesar 's plans be overthrown .
pothinus was more active , though not less cautious in his hostility to them .
he opened secret communication with achillas , sending him information , from time to time , of what took place within the walls , and of the arrangements made there for the defense of the city against him , and gave him also directions how to proceed .
he was very wary and sagacious in all these movements , <unk> all the time to be on <unk> side .
he pretended to be very zealously employed in aiding caesar to secure more effectually the various points where attacks were to be expected , and in maturing and completing the arrangements for defense .
but , notwithstanding all his cunning , he was detected in his double dealing , and his career was suddenly brought to a close , before the great final conflict came on .
there was a barber in caesar 's household , who , for some cause or other , began to suspect pothinus ; and , having little else to do , he employed himself in watching the <unk> movements and reporting them to caesar .
caesar directed the barber to continue his observations .
he did so ; his suspicions were soon confirmed , and at length a letter , which pothinus had written to achillas , was intercepted and brought to caesar .
this furnished the necessary proof of what they called his guilt , and caesar ordered him to be beheaded .
this circumstance produced , of course , a great excitement within the palace , for pothinus had been for many years the great ruling minister of state ,  the king , in fact , in all but in name .
his execution alarmed a great many others , who , though in caesar 's power , were secretly wishing that achillas might prevail .
among those most disturbed by these fears was a man named ganymede .
he was the officer who had charge of arsinoÃ« , <name> 's sister .
the arrangement which caesar had proposed for establishing her in conjunction with her brother ptolemy over the island of cyprus had not gone into effect ; for , immediately after the decision of caesar , the attention of all concerned had been wholly engrossed by the tidings of the advance of the army , and by the busy preparations which were required on all hands for the impending contest .
arsinoÃ« , therefore , with her governor ganymede , remained in the palace .
ganymede had joined pothinus in his plots ; and when pothinus was beheaded , he concluded that it would be safest for him to fly .
he accordingly resolved to make his escape from the city , taking arsinoÃ« with him .
it was a very hazardous attempt but he succeeded in accomplishing it .
arsinoÃ« was very willing to go , for she was now beginning to be old enough to feel the impulse of that insatiable and reckless ambition which seemed to form such an essential element in the character of every son and daughter in the whole <unk> line .
she was insignificant and powerless where she was , but at the head of the army she might become immediately a <name> .
it resulted , in the first instance , as she had anticipated .
achillas and his army received her with acclamations .
under ganymede 's influence they decided that , as all the other members of the <name> family were in <unk> , being held captive by a foreign general , who had by chance obtained possession of the capital , and were thus <unk> for exercising the <name> power , the crown devolved upon arsinoÃ« ; and they accordingly proclaimed her <name> .
every thing was now prepared for a desperate and determined contest for the crown between <name> , with caesar for her minister and general , on the one side , and arsinoÃ« , with ganymede and achillas for her chief officers on the other .
the young ptolemy in the mean time , remained caesar 's prisoner , confused with the intricacies in which the quarrel had become involved , and scarcely knowing now what to wish in respect to the issue of the contest .
it was very difficult to foresee whether it would be best for him that <name> or that arsinoÃ« should succeed .

the war which ensued as the result of the intrigues and maneuvers described in the last chapter is known in the history of rome and <name> caesar as the <unk> war .
the events which occurred during the progress of it , and its termination at last in the triumph of caesar and <name> , <name> form the subject of this chapter .
achillas had greatly the advantage over caesar at the outset of the contest , in respect to the strength of the forces under his command .
caesar , in fact , had with him only a detachment of three or four thousand men , a small body of troops which he had hastily put on board a little squadron of <unk> galleys for pursuing pompey across the mediterranean .
when he set sail from the european shores with this inconsiderable fleet , it is probable that he had no expectation even of landing in egypt at all , and much less of being involved in great military undertakings there .
achillas , on the other hand , was at the head of a force of <unk> effective men .
his troops were , it is true , of a somewhat miscellaneous character , but they were all veteran soldiers , inured to the climate of egypt , and skilled in all the modes of warfare which were suited to the character of the country .
some of them were <name> soldiers , men who had come with the army of <name> <name> from syria when ptolemy <unk> , <name> 's father , was <unk> on the throne , and had been left in egypt , in ptolemy 's service , when <name> returned to rome .
some were native egyptians .
there was also in the army of achillas a large number of fugitive slaves ,  refugees who had made their escape from various points along the shores of the mediterranean , at different periods , and had been from time to time incorporated into the egyptian army .
these fugitives were all men of the most determined and desperate character .
achillas had also in his command a force of two thousand horse .
such a body of cavalry made him , of course , perfect master of all the open country outside the city walls .
at the head of these troops achillas gradually advanced to the very gates of <name> , invested the city on every side , and shut caesar closely in .
the danger of the situation in which caesar was placed was extreme ; but he had been so accustomed to succeed in <unk> himself from the most imminent perils , that neither he himself nor his army seem to have experienced any concern in respect to the result .
caesar personally felt a special pride and pleasure in encountering the difficulties and dangers which now beset him , because <name> was with him to witness his demeanor , to admire his energy and courage , and to reward by her love the efforts and sacrifices which he was making in <unk> her cause .
she confided every thing to him , but she watched all the proceedings with the most eager interest , elated with <name> in respect to the result , and proud of the champion who had thus volunteered to defend her .
in a word , her heart was full of gratitude , admiration , and love .
the immediate effect , too , of the emotions which she felt so strongly was greatly to heighten her natural charms .
the native force and energy of her character were softened and subdued .
her voice , which always possessed a certain inexpressible charm , was <unk> with new sweetness through the influence of affection .
her countenance beamed with fresh animation and beauty , and the <unk> and vivacity of her character , which became at later periods of her life boldness and eccentricity , now being softened and restrained within proper limits by the respectful regard with which she looked upon caesar , made her an enchanting companion .
caesar was , in fact , entirely intoxicated with the fascinations which she unconsciously displayed .
under other circumstances than these , a personal attachment so strong , formed by a military commander while engaged in active service , might have been expected to interfere in some degree with the discharge of his duties ; but in this case , since it was for <name> 's sake and her behalf that the operations which caesar had undertaken were to be prosecuted , his love for her only stimulated the spirit and energy with which he engaged in them .
the first measure to be adopted was , as caesar plainly perceived , to concentrate and strengthen his position in the city , so that he might be able to defend himself there against achillas until he should receive re-enforcements from abroad .
for this purpose he selected a certain group of palaces and <unk> which lay together near the head of the long pier of cause way which led to the pharos , and , withdrawing his troops from all other parts of the city , established them there .
the quarter which he thus occupied contained the great city <unk> and public granaries .
caesar brought together all the arms and munitions of war which he could find in other parts of the city , and also all the corn and other provisions which were contained either in the public <unk> or in private warehouses , and stored the whole within his lines .
he then inclosed the whole quarter with strong defenses .
the avenues leading to it were barricaded with walls of stone .
houses in the vicinity , which might have afforded shelter to an enemy , were demolished and the materials used in constructing walls wherever they were needed , or in strengthening the <unk> .
prodigious military engines , made to throw heavy stones , and beams of wood , and other ponderous missiles , were set up within his lines , and openings were made in the walls and other defenses of the citadel , wherever necessary , to facilitate the action of these machines .
there was a strong fortress situated at the head of the pier or mole leading to the island of pharos , which was without caesar 's lines , and still in the hands of the egyptian authorities .
the egyptians thus commanded the entrance to the mole .
the island itself , also , with the fortress at the other end of the pier , was still in the possession of the egyptian authorities , who seemed disposed to hold it for achillas .
the mole was very long , as the island was nearly a mile from the shore .
there was quite a little town upon the island itself , besides the fortress or castle built there to defend the place .
the garrison of this castle was strong , and the inhabitants of the town , too , constituted a somewhat formidable population , as they consisted of fishermen , sailors , <unk> , and such other desperate characters , as usually congregate about such a spot .
<name> and caesar , from the windows of their palace within the city , looked out upon this island , with the tall light house rising in the center of it and the castle at its base , and upon the long and narrow isthmus connecting it with the main land , and concluded that it was very essential that they should get possession of the post , commanding , as it did , the entrance to the harbor .
in the harbor , which was on the south side of the mole , and , consequently , on the side opposite to that from which achillas was advancing toward the city , there were lying a large number of egyptian vessels , some dismantled , and others manned and armed more or less effectively .
these vessels had not yet come into achillas 's hands , but it would be certain that he would take possession of them as soon as he should gain admittance to those parts of the city which caesar had abandoned .
this it was extremely important to prevent ; for , if achillas held this fleet , especially if he continued to command the island of pharos , he would be perfect master of all the approaches to the city on the side of the sea .
he could then not only receive re-enforcements and supplies himself from that quarter , but he could also effectually cut off the <name> army from all possibility of receiving any .
it became , therefore , as caesar thought , imperiously necessary that he should protect himself from this danger .
this he did by sending out an expedition to burn all the shipping in the harbor , and , at the same time , to take possession of a certain fort upon the island of pharos which commanded the entrance to the port .
this undertaking was abundantly successful .
the troops burned the shipping , took the fort , expelled the egyptian soldiers from it , and put a <name> garrison into it instead , and then returned in safety within caesar 's lines .
<name> witnessed these exploits from her palace windows with feelings of the highest admiration for the energy and valor which her <name> <unk> displayed .
the burning of the egyptian ships in this action , however fortunate for <name> and caesar , was attended with a catastrophe which has ever since been lamented by the whole civilized world .
some of the burning ships were driven by the wind to the shore , where they set fire to the buildings which were contiguous to the water .
the flames spread and produced an extensive conflagration , in the course of which the largest part of the great library was destroyed .
this library was the only general collection of the ancient writings that ever had been made , and the loss of it was never repaired .
the destruction of the egyptian fleet resulted also in the downfall and ruin of achillas .
from the time of arsinoÃ« 's arrival in the camp there had been a constant rivalry and jealousy between himself and ganymede , the <unk> who had accompanied arsinoÃ« in her flight .
two parties had been formed in the army , some declaring for achillas and some for ganymede .
arsinoÃ« advocated ganymede 's interests , and when , at length , the fleet was burned , she charged achillas with having been , by his neglect or incapacity , the cause of the loss .
achillas was tried , condemned , and beheaded .
from that time ganymede assumed the administration of arsinoÃ« 's government as her minister of state and the commander-in-chief of her armies .
about the time that these occurrences took place , the egyptian army advanced into those parts of the city from which caesar had withdrawn , producing those terrible scenes of panic and confusion which always attend a sudden and violent change of military possession within the precincts of a city .
ganymede brought up his troops on every side to the walls of caesar 's <unk> and intrenchments , and hemmed him closely in .
he cut off all avenues of approach to caesar 's lines by land , and commenced vigorous preparations for an assault .
he constructed engines for battering down the walls .
he opened shops and established <unk> in every part of the city for the manufacture of darts , spears , pikes , and all kinds of military machinery .
he built towers supported upon huge wheels , with the design of filling them with armed men when finally ready to make his assault upon caesar 's lines , and moving them up to the walls of the <unk> and palaces , so as to give to his soldiers the advantage of a lofty elevation in making their attacks .
he levied contributions on the <name> citizens for the necessary funds , and provided himself with men by pressing all the artisans , laborers , and men capable of bearing arms into his service .
he sent messengers back into the interior of the country , in every direction , summoning the people to arms , and calling for contributions of money and military stores .
these messengers were instructed to urge upon the people that , unless caesar and his army were at once expelled from <name> , there was imminent danger that the national independence of egypt would be forever destroyed .
the romans , they were to say , had extended their conquests over almost all the rest of the world .
they had sent one army into egypt before , under the command of <name> <name> , under the pretense of restoring ptolemy <unk> to the throne .
now another commander , with another force , had come , offering some other pretexts for interfering in their affairs .
these <name> encroachments , the messengers were to say , would end in the complete subjugation of egypt to a foreign power , unless the people of the country aroused themselves to meet the danger manfully , and to expel the intruders .
as caesar had possession of the island of pharos and of the harbor , ganymede could not cut him off from receiving such re-enforcements of men and arms as he might make arrangements for obtaining beyond the sea ; nor could he curtail his supply of food , as the granaries and magazines within caesar 's quarter of the city contained almost inexhaustible stores of corn .
there was one remaining point essential to the subsistence of an army besieged , and that was an abundant supply of water .
the palaces and <unk> which caesar occupied were supplied with water by means of numerous subterranean <unk> , which conveyed the water from the nile to vast <unk> built under ground , whence it was raised by buckets and <unk> engines for use .
in reflecting upon this circumstance , ganymede conceived the design of secretly digging a canal , so as to turn the waters of the sea by means of it into these <unk> .
this plan he carried into effect .
the consequence was , that the water in the <unk> was gradually changed .
it became first brackish , then more and more salt and bitter , until , at length , it was wholly impossible to use it .
for some time the army within could not understand these changes ; and when , at length , they discovered the cause the soldiers were panic-stricken at the thought , that they were now apparently wholly at the <name> of their enemies , since , without supplies of water , they must all immediately perish .
they considered it hopeless to attempt any longer to hold out , and urged caesar to <unk> the city , embark on board his galleys , and proceed to sea .
instead of doing this , however , caesar , ordering all other operations to be suspended , employed the whole laboring force of his command , under the direction of the captains of the several companies , in digging wells in every part of his quarter of the city .
fresh water , he said , was almost invariably found , at a moderate depth , upon <unk> , even upon ground lying in very close proximity to the sea .
the digging was successful .
fresh water , in great abundance , was found .
thus this danger was passed , and the men 's fears effectually relieved .
a short time after these transactions occurred , there came into the harbor one day , from along the shore west of the city , a small sloop , bringing the intelligence that a squadron of transports had arrived upon the coast to the westward of <name> , and had anchored there , being unable to come up to the city on account of an easterly wind which prevailed at that season of the year .
this squadron was one which had been sent across the mediterranean with arms , ammunition , and military stores for caesar , in answer to <unk> which he had made immediately after he had landed .
the transports being thus <unk> on the coast , and having nearly exhausted their supplies of water , were in distress ; and they accordingly sent forward the sloop , which was probably propelled by oars , to make known their situation to caesar , and to ask for succor .
caesar immediately went , himself , on board of one of his galleys , and ordering the remainder of his little fleet to follow him , he set sail out of the harbor , and then turned to the westward , with a view of proceeding along the coast to the place where the transports were lying .
all this was done secretly .
the land is so low in the vicinity of <name> that boats or galleys are out of sight from it at a very short distance from the shore .
in fact , travelers say that , in coming upon the coast , the illusion produced by the spherical form of the surface of the water and the low and level character of the coast is such that one seems actually to descend from the sea to the land .
caesar might therefore have easily kept his expedition a secret , had it not been that , in order to be provided with a supply of water for the transports immediately on reaching them , he stopped at a solitary part of the coast , at some distance from <name> , and sent a party a little way into the interior in search for water .
this party were discovered by the country people , and were intercepted by a troop of horse and made prisoners .
from these prisoners the egyptians learned that caesar himself was on the coast with a small squadron of galleys .
the tidings spread in all directions .
the people flocked together from every quarter .
they hastily collected all the boats and vessels which could be obtained at the villages in that region and from the various branches of the nile .
in the mean time , caesar had gone on to the anchorage ground of the squadron , and had taken the transports in tow to bring them to the city ; for the galleys , being propelled by oars , were in a measure independent of the wind .
on his return , he found quite a formidable naval armament assembled to dispute the passage .
a severe conflict ensued , but caesar was victorious .
the navy which the egyptians had so suddenly got together was as suddenly destroyed .
some of the vessels were burned , others sunk , and others captured ; and caesar returned in triumph to the port with his transports and stores .
he was welcomed with the acclamations of his soldiers , and , still more warmly , by the <name> and gratitude of <name> , who had been waiting during his absence in great anxiety and suspense to know the result of the expedition , aware as she was that her hero was exposing himself in it to the most imminent personal danger .
the arrival of these re-enforcements greatly improved caesar 's condition , and the circumstance of their coming forced upon the mind of ganymede a sense of the absolute necessity that he should gain possession of the harbor if he intended to keep caesar in check .
he accordingly determined to take immediate measures for forming a naval force .
he sent along the coast , and ordered every ship and galley that could be found in all the ports to be sent immediately to <name> .
he employed as many men as possible in and around the city in building more .
he <unk> some of the most magnificent edifices to procure timber as a material for making benches and oars .
when all was ready , he made a grand attack upon caesar in the port , and a terrible contest ensued for the possession of the harbor , the mole , the island , and the <unk> and fortresses commanding the entrances from the sea .
caesar well knew this contest would be a decisive one in respect to the final result of the war , and he accordingly went forth himself to take an active and personal part in the conflict .
he felt doubtless , too , a strong emotion of pride and pleasure in exhibiting his prowess in the sight of <name> , who could watch the progress of the battle from the palace windows , full of excitement at the dangers which he incurred , and of admiration at the feats of strength and valor which he performed .
during this battle the life of the great conqueror was several times in the most imminent danger .
he wore a habit or mantle of the imperial purple , which made him a conspicuous <name> for his enemies ; and , of course , wherever he went , in that place was the hottest of the fight .
once , in the midst of a scene of most dreadful confusion and din , he leaped from an <unk> boat into the water and swam for his life , holding his cloak between his teeth and drawing it through the water after him , that it might not fall into the hands of his enemies .
he carried , at the same time , as he swam , certain valuable papers which he wished to save , holding them above his head with one hand , while he propelled himself through the water with the other .
the result of this contest was another decisive victory for caesar .
not only were the ships which the egyptians had collected defeated and destroyed , but the mole , with the fortresses at each extremity of it , and the island , with the light house and the town of pharos , all fell into caesar 's hands .
the egyptians now began to be discouraged .
the army and the people , judging , as mankind always do , of the virtue of their military commanders solely by the criterion of success , began to be tired of the rule of ganymede and arsinoÃ« .
they sent secret messengers to caesar <unk> their discontent , and saying that , if he would liberate ptolemy  who , it <name> be recollected , had been all this time held as a sort of prisoner of state in caesar 's palaces  they thought that the people generally would receive him as their sovereign , and that then an arrangement might easily be made for an amicable adjustment of the whole controversy .
caesar was strongly inclined to accede to this proposal .
he accordingly called ptolemy into his presence and , taking him kindly by the hand , informed him of the wishes of the people of egypt , and gave him permission to go .
ptolemy , however , begged not to be sent away .
he professed the strongest attachment to caesar , and the utmost confidence in him , and he very much preferred , he said , to remain under his protection .
caesar replied that , if those were his sentiments , the separation would not be a lasting one .
" if we part as friends , " he said , " we shall soon meet again . "
by these and similar assurances he endeavored to encourage the young <name> , and then sent him away .
ptolemy was received by the egyptians with great <name> , and was immediately placed at the head of the government .
instead , however , of endeavoring to promote a settlement of the quarrel with caesar , he seemed to enter into it now himself , personally , with the utmost ardor , and began at once to make the most extensive preparations both by sea and land for a vigorous prosecution of the war .
what the result of these operations would have been can now not be known , for the general aspect of affairs was , soon after these transactions , totally changed by the occurrence of a new and very important event which suddenly intervened , and which turned the attention of all parties , both egyptians and romans , to the eastern quarter of the kingdom .
the tidings arrived that a large army under the command of a general named <unk> , whom caesar had dispatched into <name> for this purpose , had suddenly appeared at pelusium , had captured that city and were now ready to march to <name> .
the egyptian army immediately broke up its encampments in the neighborhood of <name> , and marched to the eastward to meet these new invaders , caesar followed them with all the forces that he could safely take away from the city .
he left the city in the night , and unobserved , and moved across the country with such celerity that he joined <unk> before the forces of ptolemy had arrived .
after various marches and maneuvers , the armies met , and a great battle was fought .
the egyptians were defeated .
ptolemy 's camp was taken .
as the <name> army burst in upon one side of it , the guards and attendants of ptolemy fled upon the other , clambering over the ramparts in the utmost terror and confusion .
the foremost fell headlong into the ditch below , which was thus soon filled to the brim with the dead and the dying ; while those who came behind pressed on over the bridge thus formed , trampling remorselessly , as they fled , on the bodies of their comrades , who lay writhing , struggling , and shrieking beneath their feet .
those who escaped reached the river .
they crowded together into a boat which lay at the bank and pushed off from the shore .
the boat was <unk> , and it sank as soon as it left the land .
the romans <name> the bodies which floated to the shore upon the bank again , and they found among them one , which , by the <name> <unk> which was upon it , the customary badge and armor of the egyptian kings , they knew to be the body of ptolemy .
the victory which caesar obtained in this battle and the death of ptolemy ended the war .
nothing now remained but for him to place himself at the head of the combined forces and march back to <name> .
the egyptian forces which had been left there made no resistance , and he entered the city in triumph .
he took arsinoÃ« prisoner .
he decreed that <name> should reign as <name> , and that she should marry her youngest brother , the other ptolemy ,  a boy at this time about eleven years of age .
a marriage with one so young was , of course , a mere form .
<name> remained , as before , the companion of caesar .
caesar had , in the mean time , incurred great censure at rome , and throughout the whole <name> world , for having thus turned aside from his own proper duties as the <name> consul , and the commander-in-chief of the armies of the empire , to <unk> himself in the quarrels of a remote and secluded kingdom with which the interests of the <name> commonwealth were so little connected .
his friends and the authorities at rome were continually urging him to return .
they were especially indignant at his protracted neglect of his own proper duties , from knowing that he was held in egypt by a guilty attachment to the <name> ,  thus not only violating his obligations to the state , but likewise inflicting upon his wife calpurnia , and his family at rome , an intolerable wrong .
but caesar was so fascinated by <name> 's charms , and by the mysterious and unaccountable influence which she exercised over him , that he paid no heed to any of these remonstrances .
even after the war was ended he remained some months in egypt to enjoy his favorite 's society .
he would spend whole nights in her company , in feasting and revelry .
he made a splendid <name> progress with her through egypt after the war was over , attended by a numerous train of <name> guards .
he formed a plan for taking her to rome , and marrying her there ; and he took measures for having the laws of the city altered so as to enable him to do so , though he was already married .
all these things produced great discontent and disaffection among caesar 's friends and throughout the <name> army .
the egyptians , too , strongly <unk> the conduct of <name> .
a son was born to her about this time , whom the <unk> named , from his father , <unk> .
<name> was regarded in the new relation of mother , which she now sustained , not with interest and sympathy , but with feelings of reproach and condemnation .
<name> was all this time growing more and more accomplished , and more and more beautiful ; but her vivacity and spirit , which had been so charming while it was simple and childlike , now began to appear more forward and bold .
it is the characteristic of pure and lawful love to soften and subdue the heart , and <unk> a gentle and quiet spirit into all its action ; while that which breaks over the barriers that god and nature have marked out for it , tends to make woman masculine and bold , to <unk> all her <unk> , and to destroy that gentleness and timidity of demeanor which have so great an influence in <unk> her charms .
<name> was beginning to experience these effects .
she was indifferent to the opinions of her subjects , and was only anxious to maintain as long as possible her guilty ascendency over caesar .
caesar , however , finally determined to set out on his return to the capital .
leaving <name> , accordingly , a sufficient force to secure the continuance of her power , he embarked the remainder of his forces in his transports and galleys , and sailed away .
he took the unhappy arsinoÃ« with him , intending to exhibit her as a trophy of his egyptian victories on his arrival at rome .

the war by which caesar <unk> <name> upon the throne was not one of very long duration .
caesar arrived in egypt in pursuit of pompey about the first of <name> ; the war was ended and <name> established in secure possession by the end of <name> ; so that the conflict , violent as it was while it continued , was very brief , the peaceful and commercial pursuits of the <unk> having been interrupted by it only for a few months .
nor did either the war itself , or the <unk> consequent upon it , extend very far into the interior of the country .
the city of <name> itself and the neighboring coasts were the chief scenes of the contest until <unk> arrived at pelusium .
he , it is true , marched across the <name> , and the final battle was fought in the interior of the country .
it was , however , after all , but a very small portion of the egyptian territory that was directly affected by the war .
the great mass of the people , occupying the <name> and fertile tracts which bordered the various branches of the nile , and the long and verdant valley which extended so far into the heart of the continent , knew nothing of the conflict but by vague and distant rumors .
the pursuits of the agricultural population went on , all the time , as steadily and prosperously as ever ; so that when the conflict was ended , and <name> entered upon the quiet and peaceful possession of her power , she found that the resources of her empire were very little impaired .
she availed herself , accordingly , of the revenues which poured in very abundantly upon her , to enter upon a career of the greatest luxury , magnificence , and splendor .
the injuries which had been done to the palaces and other public edifices of <name> the fire , and by the military operations of the siege , were repaired .
the bridges which had been down were rebuilt .
the canals which had been obstructed were opened again .
the sea-water was shut off from the palace <unk> ; the rubbish of demolished houses was removed ; the <unk> were cleared from the streets ; and the injuries which the palaces had suffered either from the violence of military engines or the rough occupation of the <name> soldiery , were repaired .
in a word , the city was speedily restored once more , so far as was possible , to its former order and beauty .
the five hundred , thousand manuscripts of the alexandrian library , which had been burned , could not , indeed , be restored ; but , in all other respects , the city soon resumed in appearance all its former splendor .
even in respect to the library , <name> made an effort to retrieve the loss .
she repaired the ruined buildings , and afterward , in the course of her life , she brought together , it was said , in a manner hereafter to be described , one or two hundred thousand rolls of manuscripts , as the commencement of a new collection .
the new library , however , never acquired the fame and distinction that had pertained to the old .
the former sovereigns of egypt , <name> 's ancestors , had generally , as has already been shown , devoted the immense revenues which they extorted from the <unk> of the valley of the nile to purposes of ambition .
<name> seemed now disposed to expend them in luxury and pleasure .
they , the ptolemies , had employed their resources in erecting vast structures , or founding magnificent institutions at <name> , to add to the <name> of the city , and to widen and extend their own fame .
<name> , on the other hand , as was , perhaps , naturally to be expected of a young , beautiful , and impulsive woman suddenly raised to so conspicuous a position , and to the possession of such unbounded wealth and power , expended her <name> revenues in plans of personal display , and in scenes of festivity , gayety , and enjoyment .
she adorned her palaces , built magnificent barges for pleasure excursions on the nile , and expended enormous sums for dress , for <unk> , and for sumptuous entertainments .
in fact , so lavish were her expenditures for these and similar purposes during the early years of her reign , that she is considered as having carried the extravagance of sensual luxury , and personal display , and splendor , beyond the limits that had ever before or have ever since been attained .
whatever of simplicity of character , and of gentleness and kindness of spirit she might have possessed in her earlier years , of course gradually disappeared under the influences of such a course of life as she now was leading .
she was beautiful and fascinating still , but she began to grow selfish , heartless , and designing .
her little brother ,  he was but eleven years of age , it <name> be recollected , when caesar arranged the marriage between them ,  was an object of jealousy to her .
he was now , of course , too young to take any actual share in the exercise of the <name> power , or to interfere at all in his sister 's plans or pleasures .
but then he was growing older .
in a few years he would be fifteen ,  which was the period of life fixed upon by <unk> arrangements , and , in fact , by the laws and usages of the egyptian kingdom ,  when he was to come into possession of power as king , and as the husband of <name> .
<name> was extremely unwilling that the change in her relations to him and to the government , which this period was to bring , should take place .
accordingly , just before the time arrived , she caused him to be poisoned .
his death released her , as she had intended , from all restraints , and thereafter she continued to reign alone .
during the remainder of her life , so far as the enjoyment of wealth and power , and of all other elements of external prosperity could go , <name> 's career was one of uninterrupted success .
she had no conscientious scruples to interfere with the most full and unrestrained indulgence of every propensity of her heart , and the means of indulgence were before her in the most unlimited profusion .
the only bar to her happiness was the impossibility of satisfying the impulses and passions of the human soul , when they once break over the bounds which the laws both of god and of nature <unk> for restraining them .
in the mean time , while <name> was spending the early years of her reign in all this luxury and splendor , caesar was pursuing his career , as the conqueror of the world , in the most successful manner .
on the death of pompey , he would naturally have succeeded at once to the enjoyment of the supreme power ; but his delay in egypt , and the extent to which it was known that he was entangled with <name> , encouraged and strengthened his enemies in various parts of the world .
in fact , a revolt which broke out in <name> minor , and which it was absolutely necessary that he should proceed at once to quell , was the immediate cause of his leaving egypt at last .
other plans for making head against caesar 's power were formed in spain , in africa , and in italy .
his military skill and energy , however , were so great , and the ascendency which he exercised over the minds of men by his personal presence was so unbounded , and so astonishing , moreover , was the celerity with which he moved from continent to continent , and from kingdom to kingdom , that in a very short period from the time of his leaving egypt , he had conducted most brilliant and successful campaigns in all the three quarters of the world then known , had put down effectually all opposition to his power , and then had returned to rome the acknowledged master of the world .
<name> , who had , of course , watched his career during all this time with great pride and pleasure , concluded , at last , to go to rome and make a visit to him there .
the people of rome were , however , not prepared to receive her very cordially .
it was an age in which vice of every kind was regarded with great indulgence , but the moral instincts of mankind were too strong to be wholly blinded to the true character of so conspicuous an example of wickedness as this .
arsinoÃ« was at rome , too , during this period of caesar 's life .
he had brought her there , it <name> be recollected , on his return from egypt , as a prisoner , and as a trophy of his victory .
his design was , in fact , to reserve her as a captive to <name> his triumph .
a triumph , according to the usages of the ancient romans , was a grand celebration decreed by the senate to great military commanders of the highest rank , when they returned from distant campaigns in which they had made great conquests or gained extraordinary victories .
caesar concentrated all his triumphs into one .
they were celebrated on his return to rome for the last time , after having completed the conquest of the world .
the processions of this triumph occupied four days .
in fact , there were four triumphs , one on each day for the four days .
the wars and conquests which these <unk> were intended to celebrate were those of gaul , of egypt , of <name> , and of africa ; and the processions on the several days consisted of endless trains of prisoners , trophies , arms , banners , pictures , images , <unk> of wagons loaded with plunder , captive princes and princesses , animals wild and tame , and every thing else which the conqueror had been able to bring home with him from his campaigns , to excite the curiosity or the admiration of the people of the city and illustrate the magnitude of his exploits .
of course , the <name> generals , when engaged in distant foreign wars , were ambitious of bringing back as many distinguished captives and as much public plunder as they were able to obtain , in order to add to the variety and splendor of the triumphal procession by which their victories were to be honored on their return .
it was with this view that caesar brought arsinoÃ« from egypt ; and he had retained her as his captive at rome until his conquests were completed and the time for his triumph arrived .
she , of course , formed a part of the triumphal train on the egyptian day .
she walked immediately before the chariot in which caesar rode .
she was in chains , like any other captive , though her chains in honor of her lofty rank , were made of gold .
the effect , however , upon the <name> population of seeing the unhappy <name> , overwhelmed as she was with sorrow and chagrin , as she moved slowly along in the train , among the other emblems and trophies of violence and plunder , proved to be by no means favorable to caesar .
the population were inclined to pity her , and to sympathize with her in her sufferings .
the sight of her distress recalled too , to their minds , the <unk> from duty which caesar had been guilty of in his yielding to the <unk> of <name> , and remaining so long in egypt to the neglect of his proper duties as a <name> minister of state .
in a word , the tide of admiration for caesar 's military exploits which had been setting so strongly in his favor , seemed inclined to turn , and the city was filled with murmurs against him even in the midst of his triumphs .
in fact , the pride and <unk> which led caesar to make his triumphs more splendid and imposing than any former conqueror had ever enjoyed , caused him to <unk> his part so as to produce effects the reverse of his intentions .
the case of arsinoÃ« was one example of this .
instead of impressing the people with a sense of the greatness of his exploits in egypt , in deposing one <name> and bringing her captive to rome , in order that he might place another upon the throne in her stead , it only reproduced anew the <unk> and <unk> which he had deserved by his actions there , but which , had it not been for the pitiable spectacle of arsinoÃ« in the train , might have been forgotten .
there were other examples of a similar character .
there were the feasts , for instance .
from the plunder which caesar had obtained in his various campaigns , he expended the most enormous sums in making feasts and spectacles for the populace at the time of his triumph .
a large portion of the populace was pleased , it is true , with the boundless indulgences thus offered to them ; but the better part of the <name> people were indignant at the waste and extravagance which were every where displayed .
for many days the whole city of rome presented to the view nothing but one wide-spread scene of riot and <unk> .
the people , instead of being pleased with this abundance , said that caesar must have practiced the most extreme and lawless extortion to have obtained the vast amount of money necessary to enable him to supply such unbounded and reckless waste .
there was another way , too , by which caesar turned public opinion strongly against himself , by the very means which he adopted for creating a sentiment in his favor .
the romans , among the other barbarous amusements which were practiced in the city , were specially fond of combats .
these combats were of various kinds .
they were fought sometimes between ferocious beasts of the same or of different species , as dogs against each other , or against bulls , lions , or tigers .
any animals , in fact , were employed for this purpose , that could be teased or goaded into anger and ferocity in a fight .
sometimes men were employed in these combats ,  captive soldiers , that had been taken in war , and brought to rome to fight in the <unk> there as gladiators .
these men were compelled to contend sometimes with wild beasts , and sometimes with one another .
caesar , knowing how highly the <name> assemblies enjoyed such scenes , determined to afford them the indulgence on a most magnificent scale , supposing , of course , that the greater and the more dreadful the fight , the higher would be the pleasure which the spectators would enjoy in witnessing it .
accordingly , in making preparations for the festivities attending his triumph , he caused a large artificial lake to be formed at a convenient place in the vicinity of rome , where it could be surrounded by the populace of the city , and there he made arrangements for a naval battle .
a great number of galleys were introduced into the lake .
they were of the usual size employed in war .
these galleys were manned with numerous soldiers .
<unk> captives were put upon one side , and egyptian upon the other ; and when all was ready , the two squadrons were ordered to approach and fight a real battle for the amusement of the enormous throngs of spectators that were assembled around .
as the nations from which the combatants in this conflict were respectively taken were hostile to each other , and as the men fought , of course , for their lives , the engagement was attended with the usual horrors of a desperate naval encounter .
hundreds were slain .
the dead bodies of the combatants fell from the galleys into the lake and the waters of it were dyed with their blood .
there were land combats , too , on the same grand scale .
in one of them five hundred foot soldiers , twenty elephants , and a troop of thirty horse were engaged on each side .
this combat , therefore , was an action greater , in respect to the number of the combatants , than the famous battle of lexington , which marked the commencement of the american war ; and in respect to the slaughter which took place , it was very probably ten times greater .
the horror of these scenes proved to be too much even for the populace , fierce and merciless as it was , which they were intended to amuse .
caesar , in his eagerness to <unk> all former exhibitions and shows , went beyond the limits within which the seeing of men butchered in bloody combats and dying in agony and despair would serve for a pleasure and a pastime .
the people were shocked ; and <unk> of caesar 's cruelty were added to the other suppressed reproaches and <unk> which every where arose .
<name> , during her visit to rome , lived openly with caesar at his residence , and this excited very general displeasure .
in fact , while the people pitied arsinoÃ« , <name> , notwithstanding her beauty and her thousand personal accomplishments and charms , was an object of general displeasure , so far as public attention , was turned toward her at all .
the public mind was , however , much engrossed by the great political movements made by caesar and the ends toward which he seemed to be aiming .
men accused him of designing to be made a king .
parties were formed for and against him ; and though men did not dare openly to utter their sentiments , their passions became the more violent in proportion to the external force by which they were suppressed .
<name> <name> was at rome at this time .
he warmly espoused caesar 's cause , and encouraged his design of making himself king .
he once , in fact , offered to place a <name> <unk> upon caesar 's head at some public celebration ; but the marks of public disapprobation which the act elicited caused him to desist .
at length , however , the time arrived when caesar determined to cause himself to be proclaimed king .
he took advantage of a certain remarkable <unk> of public affairs , which can not here be particularly described , but which seemed to him specially to favor his designs , and arrangements were made for having him invested with the regal power by the senate .
the murmurs and the discontent of the people at the indications that the time for the realization of their fears was drawing nigh , became more and more audible , and at length a conspiracy was formed to put an end to the danger by destroying the ambitious <unk> 's life .
two stern and determined men , brutus and cassius , were the leaders of this conspiracy .
they matured their plans , organized their band of associates , provided themselves secretly with arms , and when the senate convened , on the day in which the decisive vote was to have been passed , caesar himself presiding , they came up boldly around him in his presidential chair , and murdered him with their daggers .
<name> , from whom the plans of the conspirators had been kept profoundly secret , stood by , looking on stupefied and confounded while the deed was done , but utterly unable to render his friend any protection .
<name> immediately fled from the city and returned to egypt .
arsinoÃ« had gone away before .
caesar , either taking pity on her misfortunes , or impelled , perhaps , by the force of public sentiment , which seemed inclined to take part with her against him , set her at <name> immediately after the ceremonies of his triumph were over .
he would not , however , allow her to return into egypt , for fear , probably , that she might in some way or other be the means of disturbing the government of <name> .
she proceeded , accordingly , into syria , no longer as a captive , but still as an exile from her native land .
we shall hereafter learn what became of her there .
calpurnia mourned the death of her husband with sincere and unaffected grief .
she bore the wrongs which she suffered as a wife with a very patient and <unk> spirit , and loved her husband with the most devoted attachment to the end .
nothing can be more affecting than the proofs of her tender and anxious regard on the night immediately preceding the assassination .
there were certain slight and obscure indications of danger which her watchful devotion to her husband led her to observe , though they eluded the notice of all caesar 's other friends , and they filled her with apprehension and anxiety ; and when at length the bloody body was brought home to her from the senate-house , she was overwhelmed with grief and despair .
she had no children .
she accordingly looked upon <name> <name> as her nearest friend and protector , and in the confusion and terror which prevailed the next day in the city , she hastily packed together the money and other valuables contained in the house , and all her husband's books and papers , and sent them to <name> for safe keeping .

when the tidings of the assassination of caesar were first announced to the people of rome , all ranks and classes of men were struck with amazement and consternation .
no one knew what to say or do .
a very large and influential portion of the community had been caesar 's friends .
it was equally certain that there was a very powerful interest opposed to him .
no one could foresee which of these two parties would now <name> the day , and , of course , for a time , all was uncertainty and indecision .
<name> <name> came forward at once , and assumed the position of <unk> representative and the leader of the party on that side .
a <name> was found among caesar 's effects , and when the <name> was opened it appeared that large sums of money were left to the <name> people , and other large amounts to a nephew of the deceased , named octavius , who <name> be more particularly spoken of hereafter .
<name> was named in the <name> is the <unk> of it .
this and other circumstances seemed to authorize him to come forward as the head and the leader of the caesar party .
brutus and cassius , who remained openly in the city after their desperate deed had been performed , were the acknowledged leaders of the other party ; while the mass of the people were at first so astounded at the magnitude and suddenness of the revolution which the open and public assassination of a <name> emperor by a <name> senate denoted , that they knew not what to say or do .
in fact , the killing of <name> caesar , considering the exalted position which he occupied , the rank and station of the men who perpetrated the deed , and the very extraordinary publicity of the scene in which the act was performed , was , doubtless , the most conspicuous and most appalling case of assassination that has ever occurred .
the whole population of rome seemed for some days to be amazed and stupefied by the tidings .
at length , however , parties began to be more distinctly formed .
the lines of <unk> between them were gradually drawn , and men began to arrange themselves more and more unequivocally on the opposite sides .
for a short time the supremacy of <name> over the caesar party was readily acquiesced in and allowed .
at length , however , and before his arrangements were finally matured , he found that he had two formidable competitors upon his own side .
these were octavius and <unk> .
octavius , who was the nephew of caesar , already alluded to , was a very accomplished and elegant young man , now about nineteen years of age .
he was the son of <name> caesar 's niece .
[ 1 ] [ footnote 1 : this octavius on his subsequent elevation to imperial power , received the name of <name> caesar , and it is by this name that he is generally known in history .
he was , however , called octavius at the commencement of his career , and , to avoid confusion , we shall continue to designate him by this name to the end of our narrative . ]
he had always been a great favorite with his uncle .
every possible attention had been paid to his education , and he had been advanced by caesar , already , to positions of high importance in public life .
caesar , in fact , adopted him as his son , and made him his heir .
at the time of caesar 's death he was at <unk> , a city of <unk> , north of greece .
the troops under his command there offered to march at once with him , if he wished it , to rome , and avenge his uncle 's death .
octavius , after some hesitation , concluded that it would be most prudent for him to proceed thither first himself , alone , as a private person , and demand his rights as his uncle 's heir , according to the provisions of the <name> .
he accordingly did so .
he found , on his arrival , that the <name> , the property , the books and <unk> , and the substantial power of the government , were all in <name> 's hands .
<name> , instead of putting octavius into possession of his property and rights , found various pretexts for evasion and delay .
octavius was too young yet , he said , to assume such weighty responsibilities .
he was himself also too much pressed with the urgency of public affairs to attend to the business of the <name> .
with these and similar excuses as his justification , <name> seemed inclined to pay no regard whatever to octavius 's claims .
octavius , young as he was , possessed a character that was marked with great intelligence , spirit , and resolution .
he soon made many powerful friends in the city of rome and among the <name> senate .
it became a serious question whether he or <name> would gain the greatest ascendency in the party of caesar 's friends .
the contest for this ascendency was , in fact , protracted for two or three years , and led to a vast complication of intrigues , and maneuvers , and civil wars , which can not , however , be here particularly detailed .
the other competitor which <name> had to contend with was a distinguished <name> general named <unk> .
<unk> was an officer of the army , in very high command at the time of caesar 's death .
he was present in the <unk> on the day of the assassination .
he stole secretly away when he saw that the deed was done , and repaired to the camp of the army without the city and immediately assumed the command of the forces .
this gave him great power , and in the course of the contests which subsequently ensued between <name> and octavius , he took an active part , and held in some measure the balance between them .
at length the contest was finally closed by a <unk> of the three rivals .
finding that they could not either of them gain a decided victory over the others , they combined together , and formed the celebrated <unk> , which continued afterward for some time to wield the supreme command in the <name> world .
in forming this league of reconciliation , the three rivals held their conference on an island situated in one of the branches of the po , in the north of italy .
they manifested extreme jealousy and suspicion of each other in coming to this interview .
two bridges were built leading to the island , one from each bank of the stream .
the army of <name> was drawn up upon one side of the river , and that of octavius upon the other .
<unk> went first to the island by one of the bridges .
after examining the ground carefully , to make himself sure that it contained no ambuscade , he made a signal to the other generals , who then came over , each advancing by his own bridge , and accompanied by three hundred guards , who remained upon the bridge to secure a retreat for their masters in case of treachery .
the conference lasted three days , at the expiration of which time the articles were all agreed upon and signed .
this league being formed , the three confederates turned their united force against the party of the conspirators .
of this party brutus and cassius were still at the head .
the scene of the contests between octavius , <name> , and <unk> had been chiefly italy and the other central countries of europe .
brutus and cassius , on the other hand , had gone across the adriatic sea into the east immediately after caesar 's assassination .
they were now in <name> minor , and were employed in concentrating their forces , forming alliances with the various eastern powers , raising troops , bringing over to their side the <name> legions which were stationed in that quarter of the world , seizing magazines , and exacting contributions from all who could be induced to favor their cause .
among other <unk> which they sent , one went to egypt to demand aid from <name> .
<name> , however , was resolved to join the other side in the contest .
it was natural that she should feel grateful to caesar for his efforts and sacrifices in her behalf , and that she should be inclined to favor the cause of his friends .
accordingly , instead of sending troops to aid brutus and cassius , as they had desired her to do , she immediately fitted out an expedition to proceed to the coast of <name> , with a view of rendering all the aid in her power to <name> 's cause .
cassius , on his part , finding that <name> was determined on joining his enemies , immediately resolved on proceeding at once to egypt and taking possession of the country .
he also stationed a military force at <unk> , the southern promontory of greece , to watch for and intercept the fleet of <name> as soon as it should appear on the european shores .
all these plans , however  both those which <name> formed against cassius , and those which cassius formed against her  failed of accomplishment .
<name> 's fleet encountered a terrible storm , which dispersed and destroyed it .
a small remnant was driven upon the coast of africa , but nothing could be saved which could be made available for the purpose intended .
as for cassius 's intended expedition to egypt , it was not carried into effect .
the dangers which began now to threaten him from the direction of italy and rome were so imminent , that , at <unk> urgent request , he gave up the egyptian plan , and the two generals concentrated their forces to meet the armies of the <unk> which were now rapidly advancing to attack them .
they passed for this purpose across the hellespont from <unk> to <unk> , and entered thrace .
after various marches and <unk> , and a long succession of those maneuvers by which two powerful armies , approaching a contest , endeavor each to gain some position of advantage against the other , the various bodies of troops belonging , respectively , to the two powers , came into the vicinity of each other near philippi .
brutus and cassius arrived here first .
there was a plain in the neighborhood of the city , with a rising ground in a certain portion of it .
brutus took possession of this elevation , and intrenched himself there .
cassius posted his forces about three miles distant , near the sea .
there was a line of intrenchments between the two camps , which formed a chain of communication by which the positions of the two commanders were connected .
the armies were thus very advantageously posted .
they had the river <unk> and a marsh on the left of the ground that they occupied , while the plain was before them , and the sea behind .
here they awaited the arrival of their foes .
<name> , who was at this time at <unk> , a city not far distant from philippi , learning that brutus and cassius had taken their positions in anticipation of an attack , advanced immediately and encamped upon the plain .
octavius was detained by sickness at the city of <unk> , not very far distant .
<name> waited for him .
it was ten days before he came .
at length he arrived , though in coming he had to be borne upon a litter , being still too sick to travel in any other way .
<name> approached , and established his camp opposite to that of cassius , near the sea , while octavius took post opposite to brutus .
the four armies then paused , contemplating the probable results of the engagement that was about to ensue .
the forces on the two sides were nearly equal ; but on the republican side , that is , on the part of brutus and cassius , there was great inconvenience and suffering for want of a sufficient supply of provisions and stores .
there was some difference of opinion between brutus and cassius in respect to what it was best for them to do .
brutus was inclined to give the enemy battle .
cassius was reluctant to do so , since , under the circumstances in which they were placed , he considered it unwise to hazard , as they necessarily must do , the whole success of their cause to the chances of a single battle .
a council of war was convened , and the various officers were asked to give their opinions .
in this conference , one of the officers having recommended to postpone the conflict to the next <name> , brutus asked him what advantage he hoped to attain by such delay .
" if i gain nothing else , " replied the officer , " i shall live so much the longer . "
this answer touched cassius 's pride and military sense of honor .
rather than concur in a counsel which was thus , on the part of one of its advocates at least , dictated by what he considered an <unk> love of life , he preferred to retract his opinion .
it was agreed by the council that the army should maintain its ground and give the enemy battle .
the officers then repaired to their respective camps .
brutus was greatly pleased at this decision .
to fight the battle had been his original <name> , and as his counsels had prevailed , he was , of course , gratified with the prospect for the morrow .
he arranged a sumptuous entertainment in his tent , and invited all the officers of his division of the army to sup with him .
the party spent the night in <unk> pleasures , and in mutual congratulations at the prospect of the victory which , as they believed , awaited them on the morrow .
brutus entertained his guests with brilliant conversation all the evening , and inspired them with his own confident anticipations of success in the conflict which was to ensue .
cassius , on the other hand , in his camp by the sea , was silent and <unk> .
he <unk> privately with a few intimate friends .
on rising from the table , he took one of his officers aside , and , pressing his hand , said to him that he felt great misgivings in respect to the result of the contest .
" it is against my judgment , " said he , " that we thus hazard the <name> of rome on the event of one battle , fought under such circumstances as these .
whatever is the result , i wish you to bear me witness hereafter that i was forced into this measure by circumstances that i could not control .
i suppose , however , that i ought to take courage , notwithstanding the reasons that i have for these gloomy forebodings .
let us , therefore , <name> for the best ; and come and sup with me again to-morrow night .
to-morrow is my <unk> . "
the next morning , the <name> mantle  the customary signal displayed in <name> camps on the morning of a day of battle  was seen at the tops of the tents of the two commanding generals , waving there in the air like a banner .
while the troops , in obedience to this signal , were preparing themselves for the conflict , the two generals went to meet each other at a point midway between their two encampments , for a final consultation and agreement in respect to the arrangements of the day .
when this business was concluded , and they were about to separate , in order to proceed each to his own sphere of duty , cassius asked brutus what he intended to do in case the day should go against them .
" we <name> for the best , " said he , " and pray that the gods may <name> us the victory in this most momentous crisis .
but we must remember that it is the greatest and the most momentous of human affairs that are always the most uncertain , and we can not foresee what is to-day to be the result of the battle .
if it goes against us , what do you intend to do ?
do you intend to escape , or to die ? "
" when i was a young man , " said brutus , in reply , " and looked at this subject only as a question of theory , i thought it wrong for a man ever to take his own life .
however great the evils that threatened him , and however desperate his condition , i considered it his duty to live , and to wait patiently for better times .
but now , placed in the position in which i am , i see the subject in a different light .
if we do not gain the battle this day , i shall consider all <name> and possibility of saving our country forever gone , and i shall not leave the field of battle alive . "
cassius , in his despondency , had made the same resolution for himself before , and he was rejoiced to hear brutus utter these sentiments .
he grasped his colleague 's hand with a countenance expressive of the greatest animation and pleasure , and bade him farewell , saying , " we <name> go out boldly to face the enemy .
for we are certain either that we shall conquer them , or that we shall have nothing to fear from their victory over us . "
cassius 's dejection , and the tendency of his mind to take a despairing view of the prospects of the cause in which he was engaged , were owing , in some measure , to certain unfavorable omens which he had observed .
these omens , though really frivolous and wholly unworthy of attention , seem to have had great influence upon him , notwithstanding his general intelligence , and the remarkable strength and energy of his character .
they were as follows : in offering certain sacrifices , he was to wear , according to the usage prescribed on such occasions , a <name> of flowers , and it happened that the officer who brought the <name> , by mistake or accident , presented it wrong side before .
again , in some procession which was formed , and in which a certain image of gold , made in honor of him , was borne , the bearer of it stumbled and fell , and the image was thrown upon the ground .
this was a very dark presage of impending calamity .
then a great number of vultures and other birds of prey were seen for a number of days before the battle , hovering over the <name> army ; and several swarms of bees were found within the precincts of the camp .
so alarming was this last indication , that the officers altered the line of the intrenchments so as to shut out the <unk> spot from the camp .
these and other such things had great influence upon the mind of cassius , in convincing him that some great disaster was impending over him .
nor was brutus himself without warnings of this character , though they seem to have had less power to produce any serious impression upon his mind than in the case of cassius .
the most extraordinary warning which brutus received , according to the story of his ancient historians , was by a supernatural apparition which he saw , some time before , while he was in <name> minor .
he was encamped near the city of sardis at that time .
he was always accustomed to sleep very little , and would often , it was said , when all his officers had retired , and the camp was still , sit alone in his tent , sometimes reading , and sometimes revolving the anxious cares which were always pressing upon his mind .
one night he was thus alone in his tent , with a small lamp burning before him , sitting lost in thought , when he suddenly heard a movement as of some one entering the tent .
he looked up , and saw a strange , unearthly , and monstrous shape , which appeared to have just entered the door and was coming toward him .
the spirit gazed upon him as it advanced , but it did not speak .
brutus , who was not much accustomed to fear , boldly demanded of the apparition who and what it was , and what had brought it there .
" i am your evil spirit , " said the apparition .
" i shall meet you at philippi . "
" then , it seems , " said brutus , " that , at any rate , i shall see you again . "
the spirit made no reply to this , but immediately vanished .
brutus arose , went to the door of his tent , summoned the sentinels , and awakened the soldiers that were sleeping near .
the sentinels had seen nothing ; and , after the most diligent search , no trace of the mysterious visitor could be found .
the next morning brutus related to cassius the occurrence which he had witnessed .
cassius , though very sensitive , it seems , to the influence of omens affecting himself , was quite philosophical in his views in respect to those of other men .
he argued very rationally with brutus to convince him that the vision which he had seen was only a phantom of sleep , taking its form and character from the ideas and images which the situation in which brutus was then placed , and the fatigue and anxiety which he had endured , would naturally impress upon his mind .
but to return to the battle .
brutus fought against octavius ; while cassius , two or three miles distant , encountered <name> , that having been , as <name> be recollected , the disposition of the respective armies and their encampments upon the plain .
brutus was triumphantly successful in his part of the field .
his troops defeated the army of octavius , and got possession of his camp .
the men forced their way into <unk> tent , and pierced the litter in which they supposed that the sick general was lying through and through with their spears .
but the object of their desperate hostility was not there .
he had been borne away by his guards a few minutes before , and no one knew what had become of him .
the result of the battle was , however , unfortunately for those whose adventures we are now more particularly following , very different in cassius 's part of the field .
when brutus , after completing the conquest of his own immediate foes , returned to his elevated camp , he looked toward the camp of cassius , and was surprised to find that the tents had disappeared .
some of the officers around perceived weapons glancing and glittering in the sun in the place where cassius 's tents ought to appear .
brutus now suspected the truth , which was , that cassius had been defeated , and his camp had fallen into the hands of the enemy .
he immediately collected together as large a force as he could command , and marched to the relief of his colleague .
he found him , at last , posted with a small body of guards and attendants upon the top of a small elevation to which he had fled for safety .
cassius saw the troop of horsemen which brutus sent forward coming toward him , and supposed that it was a detachment from <name> 's army advancing to capture him .
he , however , sent a messenger forward to meet them , and ascertain whether they were friends or foes .
the messenger , whose name was <unk> , rode down .
the horsemen recognized <unk> , and , riding up eagerly around him , they dismounted from their horses to congratulate him on his safety , and to press him with inquiries in respect to the result of the battle and the fate of his master .
cassius , seeing all this , but not seeing it very distinctly , supposed that the troop of horsemen were enemies , and that they had surrounded <unk> , and had cut him down or made him prisoner .
he considered it certain , therefore , that all was now finally lost .
accordingly , in execution of a plan which he had previously formed , he called a servant , named <unk> , whom he directed to follow him , and went into a tent which was near .
when brutus and his horsemen came up , they entered the tent .
they found no living person within ; but the dead body of cassius was there , the head being totally dissevered from it .
<unk> was never afterward to be found .
brutus was overwhelmed with grief at the death of his colleague ; he was also oppressed by it with a double burden of responsibility and care , since now the whole conduct of affairs devolved upon him alone .
he found himself surrounded with difficulties which became more and more embarrassing every day .
at length he was compelled to fight a second battle .
the details of the contest itself we can not give , but the result of it was , that , notwithstanding the most unparalleled and desperate exertions made by brutus to keep his men to the work , and to maintain his ground , his troops were borne down and overwhelmed by the irresistible <unk> of his enemies , and his cause was irretrievably and hopelessly ruined .
when brutus found that all was lost , he allowed himself to be conducted off the field by a small body of guards , who , in their retreat , broke through the ranks of the enemy on a side where they saw that they should meet with the least resistance .
they were , however , pursued by a squadron of horse , the horsemen being eager to make brutus a prisoner .
in this emergency , one of brutus 's friends , named <unk> , conceived the design of pretending to be brutus , and , as such , surrendering himself a prisoner .
this plan he carried into effect .
when the troop came up , he called out for quarter , said that he was brutus , and begged them to spare his life , and to take him to <name> .
the men did so , rejoiced at having , as they imagined , secured so invaluable a prize .
in the mean time , the real brutus pressed on to make his escape .
he crossed a <name> which came in his way , and entered into a little <name> , which promised to afford a hiding-place , since it was encumbered with precipitous rocks and shaded with trees .
a few friends and officers accompanied brutus in his flight .
night soon came on , and he lay down in a little recess under a shelving rock , exhausted with fatigue and suffering .
then , raising his eyes to heaven , he <unk> , in lines quoted from a greek poet , the just judgment of god upon the foes who were at that hour <unk> in what he considered the ruin of his country .
he then , in his anguish and despair , enumerated by name the several friends and companions whom he had seen fall that day in battle , mourning the loss of each with bitter grief .
in the mean time , night was coming on , and the party , concealed thus in the wild <name> , were destitute and <unk> .
hungry and thirsty , and spent with fatigue as they were , there seemed to be no prospect for them of either rest or refreshment .
finally they sent one of their number to steal softly back to the rivulet which they had crossed in their retreat , to bring them some water .
the soldier took his helmet to bring the water in for want of any other vessel .
while brutus was drinking the water which they brought , a noise was heard in the opposite direction .
two of the officers were sent to ascertain the cause .
they came back soon , reporting that there was a party of the enemy in that quarter .
they asked where the water was which had been brought .
brutus told them that it had all been drunk , but that he would send immediately for more .
the messenger went accordingly to the <name> again , but he came back very soon , wounded and bleeding , and reported that the enemy was close upon them on that side too , and that he had narrowly escaped with his life .
the apprehensions of brutus 's party were greatly increased by these tidings ; it was evident that all <name> of being able to remain long concealed where they were must fast disappear .
one of the officers , named <unk> , then proposed to make the attempt to find his way out of the snare in which they had become involved .
he would go , he said , as cautiously as possible , avoiding all parties of the enemy , and being favored by the darkness of the night , he hoped to find some way of retreat .
if he succeeded , he would display a torch on a distant elevation which he designated , so that the party in the <name> , on seeing the light , might be assured of his safety .
he would then return and guide them all through the danger , by the way which he should have discovered .
this plan was approved , and <unk> accordingly departed .
in due time the light was seen burning at the place which had been pointed out , and indicating that <unk> had accomplished his undertaking .
brutus and his party were greatly cheered by the new <name> which this result awakened .
they began to watch and listen for their messenger 's return .
they watched and waited long , but he did not come .
on the way back he was intercepted and slain .
when at length all <name> that he would return was finally abandoned , some of the party , in the course of the despairing consultations which the unhappy fugitives held with one another , said that they must not remain any longer where they were , but must make their escape from that spot at all hazards .
" yes , " said brutus , " we must indeed make our escape from our present situation , but we must do it with our hands , and not with our feet . "
he meant by this that the only means now left to them to evade their enemies was <unk> .
when his friends understood that this was his meaning , and that he was resolved to put this design into execution in his own case , they were overwhelmed with sorrow .
brutus took them , one by one , by the hand and bade them farewell .
he thanked them for their fidelity in adhering to his cause to the last , and said that it was a source of great comfort and satisfaction to him that all his friends had proved so faithful and true .
" i do not complain of my hard fate , " he added , " so far as i myself am concerned .
i mourn only for my unhappy country .
as to myself , i think that my condition even now is better than that of my enemies ; for though i die , posterity <name> do me justice , and i shall enjoy forever the honor which virtue and integrity deserve ; while they , though they live , live only to reap the bitter fruits of injustice and of tyranny .
" after i am gone , " he continued , addressing his friends , as before , " think no longer of me , but take care of yourselves .
<name> , i am sure , <name> be satisfied with cassius 's death and mine .
he <name> not be disposed to pursue you <unk> any longer .
make peace with him on the best terms that you can . "
brutus then asked first one and then another of his friends to aid him in the last duty , as he seems to have considered it , of destroying his life ; but one after another declared that they could not do any thing to assist him in carrying into effect so dreadful a determination .
finally , he took with him an old and <unk> friend named <unk> , and went away a little , apart from the rest .
here he <unk> once more the favor which had been refused him before ,  begging that <unk> would hold out his sword .
<unk> still refused .
brutus then called one of his slaves .
upon this <unk> declared that he would do any thing rather than that brutus should die by the hand of a slave .
he took the sword , and .
with his right hand held it extended in the air .
with the left hand he covered his eyes , that he might not witness the horrible spectacle .
brutus , rushed upon the point of the weapon with such fatal force that he fell and immediately expired .
thus ended the great and famous battle of philippi , celebrated in history as marking the termination of the great conflict between the friends and the enemies of caesar , which agitated the world so deeply after the conqueror 's death .
this battle established the ascendency of <name> , and made him for a time the most conspicuous man , as <name> was , the most conspicuous woman , in the world .

<name> had seen <name> , it <name> be recollected , some years before , during his visit to egypt , when she was a young girl .
she was doubtless well acquainted with his character .
it was a character peculiarly fitted , in some respects , to <unk> the imagination of a woman so ardent , and impulsive , and bold as <name> was fast becoming .
<name> had , in fact , made himself an object of universal interest throughout the world , by his wild and eccentric manners and reckless conduct , and by the very extraordinary vicissitudes which had marked his career .
in moral character he was as utterly abandoned and depraved as it was possible to be .
in early life , as has already been stated , he plunged into such a course of dissipation and extravagance that he became utterly and hopelessly ruined ; or , rather , he would have been so , had he not , by the influence of that magic power of fascination which such characters often possess , succeeded in gaining a great ascendency over a young man of immense fortune , named <unk> , who for a time upheld him by becoming <unk> for his debts .
this resource , however , soon failed , and <name> was compelled to abandon rome , and to live for some years as a fugitive and exile , in dissolute wretchedness and want .
during all the subsequent vicissitudes through which he passed in the course of his career , the same habits of lavish expenditure continued , whenever he had funds at his command .
this trait of character took the form sometimes of a <name> generosity .
in his campaigns , the plunder which he acquired he usually divided among his soldiers , reserving nothing for himself .
this made his men enthusiastically devoted to him , and led them to consider his <unk> as a virtue , even when they did not themselves derive any direct advantage from it .
a thousand stories were always in circulation in camp of acts on his part illustrating his reckless disregard of the value of money , some ludicrous , and all eccentric and strange .
in his personal habits , too , he was as different as possible from other men .
he prided himself on being descended from hercules , and he affected a style of dress and a general air and manner in accordance with the savage character of this his pretended ancestor .
his features were sharp , his nose was arched and prominent , and he wore his hair and beard very long  as long , in fact , as he could make them grow .
these peculiarities imparted to his countenance a very wild and ferocious expression .
he adopted a style of dress , too , which , judged of with reference to the prevailing fashions of the time , gave to his whole appearance a rough , savage , and reckless air .
his manner and demeanor corresponded with his dress and appearance .
he lived in habits of the most <unk> familiarity with his soldiers .
he associated freely with them , ate and drank with them in the open air , and joined in their noisy mirth and rude and boisterous hilarity .
his commanding powers of mind , and the desperate recklessness of his courage , enabled him to do all this without danger .
these qualities inspired in the minds of the soldiers a feeling of profound respect for their commander ; and this good opinion he was enabled to retain , notwithstanding such habits of familiarity with his <unk> as would have been fatal to the influence of an ordinary man .
in the most prosperous portion of <name> 's career  for example , during the period immediately preceding the death of caesar  he addicted himself to vicious indulgences of the most open , public , and shameless character .
he had around him a sort of court , formed of <unk> , tumblers , <unk> , <unk> , and other similar characters of the lowest and most disreputable class .
many of these companions were singing and dancing girls , very beautiful , and very highly accomplished in the arts of their respective professions , but all totally corrupt and depraved .
public sentiment , even in that age and nation , strongly condemned this conduct .
the people were pagans , it is true , but it is a mistake to suppose that the formation of a moral sentiment in the community against such vices as these is a work which christianity alone can perform .
there is a law of nature , in the form of an instinct universal in the race , imperiously <unk> that the connection of the sexes shall consist of the union of one man with one woman , and that woman his wife , and very sternly <unk> every other .
so that there has probably never been a community in the world so corrupt , that a man could practice in it such vices as those of <name> , without not only violating his own sense of right and wrong , but also bringing upon himself the general condemnation of those around him .
still , the world is prone to be very tolerant in respect to the vices of the great .
such exalted personages as <name> seem to be judged by a different standard from common men .
even in the countries where those who occupy high stations of trust or of power are actually selected , for the purpose of being placed there , by the voices of their fellow-men , all inquiry into the personal character of a candidate is often suppressed , such inquiry being condemned as wholly irrelevant and improper , and they who succeed in attaining to power enjoy <unk> in their elevation which are denied to common men .
but , notwithstanding the influence of <name> 's rank and power in <unk> him from public censure , he carried his excesses to such an extreme that his conduct was very loudly and very generally condemned .
he would spend all the night in <unk> , and then , the next day , would appear in public , staggering in the streets .
sometimes he would enter the <unk> for the transaction of business when he was so intoxicated that it would be necessary for friends to come to his assistance to conduct him away .
in some of his journeys in the neighborhood of rome , he would take a troop of companions with him of the worst possible character , and travel with them openly and without shame .
there was a certain actress , named <unk> , whom he made his companion on one such occasion .
she was borne upon a litter in his train , and he carried about with him a vast collection of gold and silver plate , and of splendid table furniture , together with an endless supply of luxurious articles of food and of wine , to provide for the entertainments and banquets which he was to celebrate with her on the journey .
he would sometimes stop by the road side , pitch his tents , establish his kitchens , set his cooks at work to prepare a feast , spread his tables , and make a sumptuous banquet of the most costly , complete , and ceremonious character  all to make men wonder at the abundance and perfection of the means of luxury which he could <name> with him wherever he might go .
in fact , he always seemed to feel a special pleasure in doing strange and extraordinary things in order to excite surprise .
once on a journey he had lions harnessed to his carts to draw his baggage , in order to create a sensation .
notwithstanding the <unk> with which <name> abandoned himself to these luxurious pleasures when at rome , no man could endure exposure and hardship better when in camp or on the field .
in fact , he rushed with as much headlong precipitation into difficulty and danger when abroad , as into expense and dissipation when at home .
during his contests with octavius and <unk> , after caesar 's death , he once had occasion to pass the alps , which , with his customary recklessness , he attempted to traverse without any proper supplies of stores or means of transportation .
he was reduced , on the passage , together with the troops under his command , to the most extreme destitution and distress .
they had to feed on roots and herbs , and finally on the bark of trees ; and they barely preserved themselves , by these means , from actual starvation .
<name> seemed , however , to care nothing for all this , but pressed on through the difficulty and danger , manifesting the same daring and determined unconcern to the end .
in the same campaign he found himself at one time reduced to extreme destitution in respect to men .
his troops had been gradually wasted away until his situation had become very desperate .
he conceived , under these circumstances , the most extraordinary idea of going over alone to the camp of <unk> and enticing away his rival 's troops from under the very eyes of their commander .
this bold design was successfully executed .
<name> advanced alone , clothed in wretched garments , and with his matted hair and beard hanging about his breast and shoulders , up to <unk> 's lines .
the men , who knew him well , received him with acclamations ; and pitying the sad condition to which they saw that he was reduced , began to listen to what he had to say .
<unk> , who could not attack him , since he and <name> were not at that time in open hostility to each other , but were only rival commanders in the same army , ordered the trumpeters to sound in order to make a noise which should prevent the words of <name> from being heard .
this interrupted the negotiation ; but the men immediately disguised two of their number in female apparel , and sent them to <name> to make arrangements with him for putting themselves under his command , and offering , at the same time , to murder <unk> , if he would but speak the word .
<name> charged them to do <unk> no injury .
he , however , went over and took possession of the camp , and assumed the command of the army .
he treated <unk> himself , personally , with extreme politeness , and retained him as a subordinate under his command .
not far from the time of caesar 's death , <name> was married .
the name of the <name> was fulvia .
she was a widow at the time of her marriage with <name> , and was a woman of very marked and decided character .
she had led a wild and irregular life previous to that time , but she conceived a very strong attachment to her new husband and devoted herself to him from the time of her marriage with the most constant fidelity .
she soon acquired a very great ascendency over him , and was the means of effecting a very considerable reform in his conduct and character .
she was an ambitious and aspiring woman , and made many very efficient and successful efforts to promote the elevation and aggrandizement of her husband .
she appeared , also , to take a great pride and pleasure in exercising over him , herself , a great personal control .
she succeeded in these attempts in a manner that surprised every body .
it seemed astonishing to all mankind that such a tiger as he had been could be subdued by any human power .
nor was it by gentleness and <unk> that fulvia gained such power over her husband .
she was of a very stern and masculine character , and she seems to have mastered <name> by surpassing him in the use of his own weapons .
in fact , instead of attempting to soothe and <unk> him , she reduced him , it seems , to the necessity of resorting to various contrivances to soften and propitiate her .
once , for example , on his return from a campaign in which he had been exposed to great dangers , he disguised himself and came home at night in the garb of a courier bearing dispatches .
he caused himself to be ushered , muffled and disguised as he was , into fulvia 's apartments , where he handed her some pretended letters , which , he said , were from her husband ; and while fulvia was opening them in great excitement and trepidation , he threw off his disguise , and revealed himself to her by clasping her in his arms and kissing her in the midst of her amazement .
<name> 's marriage with fulvia , besides being the means of reforming his morals in some degree , softened and civilized him in respect to his manners .
his dress and appearance now assumed a different character .
in fact , his political elevation after caesar 's death soon became very exalted , and the various democratic arts by which he had sought to raise himself to it , being now no longer necessary , were , as usual in such cases , gradually discarded .
he lived in great style and splendor when at rome , and when absent from home , on his military campaigns , he began to exhibit the same pomp and parade in his equipage and in his arrangements as were usual in the camps of other <name> generals .
after the battle of philippi , described in the last chapter , <name>  who , with all his faults , was sometimes a very generous foe  as soon as the tidings of brutus 's death were brought to him , repaired immediately to the spot , and appeared to be quite shocked and concerned at the sight of the body .
he took off his own military cloak or mantle  which was a very magnificent and costly garment , being enriched with many expensive ornaments  and spread it over the corpse .
he then gave directions to one of the officers of his household to make arrangements for funeral ceremonies of a very imposing character , as a testimony of his respect for the memory of the deceased .
in these ceremonies it was the duty of the officer to have burned the military cloak which <name> had appropriated to the purpose of a pall , with the body .
he did not , however , do so .
the cloak being very valuable , he reserved it ; and he withheld , also , a considerable part of the money which had been given him for the expenses of the funeral .
he supposed that <name> would probably not inquire very closely into the details of the arrangements made for the funeral of his most inveterate enemy .
<name> , however , did inquire into them , and when he learned what the officer had done , he ordered him to be killed .
the various political changes which occurred , and the movements which took place among the several armies after the battle of philippi , can not be here detailed .
it is sufficient to say that <name> proceeded to the eastward through <name> minor , and in the course of the following year came into <unk> .
from this place he sent a messenger to egypt to <name> , summoning her to appear before him .
there were charges , he said , against her of having aided cassius and brutus in the late war instead of rendering assistance to him .
whether there really were any such charges , or whether they were only <unk> by <name> as pretexts for seeing <name> , the fame of whose beauty was very widely extended , does not certainly appear .
however this may be , he sent to summon the <name> to come to him .
the name of the messenger whom <name> dispatched on this errand was <unk> .
fulvia , <name> 's wife , was not with him at this time .
she had been left behind at rome .
<unk> proceeded to egypt and appeared at <name> 's court .
the <name> was at this time about twenty-eight , but more beautiful , as was said , than ever before .
<unk> was very much struck with her beauty and with a certain fascination in her voice and conversation , of which her ancient biographers often speak as one of the most irresistible of her charms .
he told her that she need have no fear of <name> .
it was of no consequence , he said , what charges there might be against her .
she would find that , in a very few days after she had entered into <unk> presence , she would be in great favor .
she might rely , in fact , he said , on gaining , very speedily , an unbounded ascendency over the general .
he advised her , therefore , to proceed to <unk> without fear ; and to present herself before <name> in as much pomp and magnificence as she could command .
he would answer , he said , for the result .
<name> determined to follow this advice .
in fact , her ardent and impulsive imagination was fired with the idea of making , a second time , the conquest of the greatest general and highest potentate in the world .
she began immediately to make provision for the voyage .
she employed all the resources of her kingdom in procuring for herself the most magnificent means of display , such as expensive and splendid dresses , <name> services of plate , ornaments of precious stones and of gold , and presents in great variety and of the most costly description for <name> .
she appointed , also , a numerous retinue of attendants to accompany her , and , in a word , made all the arrangements complete for an expedition of the most imposing and magnificent character .
while these preparations were going forward , she received new and frequent communications from <name> , urging her to hasten her departure ; but she paid very little attention to them .
it was evident that she felt quite independent , and was intending to take her own time .
at length , however , all was ready , and <name> set sail .
she crossed the mediterranean sea , and entered the mouth of the river <unk> .
<name> was at tarsus , a city upon the <unk> , a small distance above its mouth .
when <name> 's fleet had entered the river , she embarked on board a most magnificent barge which she had constructed for the occasion , and had brought with her across the sea .
this barge was the most magnificent and <unk> vessel that had ever been built .
it was adorned with carvings and decorations of the finest workmanship , and elaborately gilded .
the sails were of purple , and the oars were inlaid and tipped with silver .
upon the deck of this barge <name> <name> appeared , under a canopy of cloth of gold .
she was dressed very magnificently in the costume in which <name> , the goddess of beauty , was then generally represented .
she was surrounded by a company of beautiful boys , who attended upon her in the form of <unk> , and fanned her with their wings , and by a group of young girls representing the <unk> and the graces .
there was a band of musicians stationed upon the deck .
this music guided the oarsmen , as they kept time to it in their rowing ; and , soft as the <name> was , the strains were heard far and wide over the water and along the shores , as the beautiful vessel advanced on its way .
the performers were provided with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and all the other instruments customarily used in those times to produce music of a gentle and voluptuous kind .
[ illustration : meeting of <name> and <name> . ]
in fact , the whole spectacle seemed like a vision of enchantment .
tidings of the approach of the barge spread rapidly around , and the people of the country came down in crowds to the shores of the river to gaze upon it in admiration as it glided slowly along .
at the time of its arrival at tarsus , <name> was engaged in giving a public audience at some tribunal in his palace , but everybody ran to see <name> and the barge , and the great <unk> was left consequently alone , or , at least , with only a few official attendants near him .
<name> , on arriving at the city , landed , and began to pitch her tents on the shores .
<name> sent a messenger to bid her welcome , and to invite her to come and sup with him .
she declined the invitation , saying that it was more proper that he should come and sup with her .
she would accordingly expect him to come , she said , and her tents would be ready at the proper hour .
<name> complied with her proposal , and came to her entertainment .
he was received with a magnificence and splendor which amazed him .
the tents and pavilions where the entertainment was made were illuminated with an immense number of lamps .
these lamps were arranged in a very ingenious and beautiful manner , so as to produce an illumination of the most surprising brilliancy and beauty .
the immense number and variety , too , of the meats and wines , and of the vessels of gold and silver , with which the tables were loaded , and the magnificence and splendor of the dresses worn by <name> and her attendants , combined to render the whole scene one of bewildering enchantment .
the next day , <name> invited <name> to come and return his visit ; but , though he made every possible effort to provide a banquet as sumptuous and as sumptuously served as hers , he failed entirely in this attempt , and acknowledged himself completely outdone .
<name> was , moreover , at these interviews , perfectly fascinated with <unk> charms .
her beauty , her wit , her thousand accomplishments , and , above all , the tact , and adroitness , and self-possession which she displayed in assuming at once so boldly , and carrying out so adroitly , the idea of her social superiority over him , that he yielded his heart almost immediately to her undisputed sway .
the first use which <name> made of her power was to ask <name> , for her sake , to order her sister arsinoÃ« to be slain .
arsinoÃ« had gone , it <name> be recollected , to rome , to <name> caesar 's triumph there , and had afterward retired to <name> , where she was now living an exile .
<name> , either from a sentiment of past revenge , or else from some apprehensions of future danger , now desired that her sister should die .
<name> readily acceded to her request .
he sent an officer in search of the unhappy <name> .
the officer slew her where he found her , within the precincts of a <name> to which she had fled , supposing it a sanctuary which no degree of hostility , however extreme , would have dared to violate .
<name> remained at tarsus for some time , revolving in an incessant round of gayety and pleasure , and living in habits of unrestrained intimacy with <name> .
she was accustomed to spend whole days and nights with him in feasting and revelry .
the immense magnificence of these entertainments , especially on <name> 's part , were the wonder of the world .
she seems to have taken special pleasure in exciting <unk> surprise by the display of her wealth and the boundless extravagance in which she indulged .
at one of her banquets , <name> was expressing his astonishment at the vast number of gold cups , enriched with jewels , that were displayed on all sides .
" oh , " said she , " they are nothing ; if you like them , you shall have them all . "
so saying , she ordered her servants to <name> them to <name> 's house .
the next day she invited <name> again , with a large number of the chief officers of his army and court .
the table was spread with a new service of gold and silver vessels , more extensive and splendid than that of the preceding day ; and at the close of the supper , when the company was about to depart , <name> distributed all these treasures among the guests that had been present at the entertainment .
at another of these feasts , she carried her ostentation and display to the astonishing extreme of taking off from one of her <unk> a <name> of immense value and dissolving it in a cup of vinegar , [ 1 ] which she afterward made into a drink , such as was customarily used in those days , and then drank it .
she was proceeding to do the same with the other <name> , when some of the company arrested the proceeding , and took the remaining <name> away .
[ footnote 1 : pearls , being of the nature of shell in their composition and structure , are soluble in certain acids . ]
in the mean time , while <name> was thus wasting his time in luxury and pleasure with <name> , his public duties were neglected , and every thing was getting into confusion .
fulvia remained in italy .
her position and her character gave her a commanding political influence , and she exerted herself in a very energetic manner to sustain , in that quarter of the world , the interests of her husband 's cause .
she was surrounded with difficulties and dangers , the details of which can not , however , be here particularly described .
she wrote continually to <name> , urgently entreating him to come to rome , and displaying in her letters all those marks of agitation and distress which a wife would naturally feel under the circumstances in which she was placed .
the thought that her husband had been so completely drawn away from her by the guilty arts of such a woman , and led by her to abandon his wife and his family , and leave in neglect and confusion concerns of such momentous magnitude as those which demanded his attention at home , produced an excitement in her mind bordering upon <unk> .
<name> was at length so far influenced by the urgency of the case that he determined to return .
he broke up his quarters at tarsus and moved south toward tyre , which was a great naval port and station in those days .
<name> went with him .
they were to separate at tyre .
she was to embark there for egypt , and he for rome .
at least that was <name> 's plan , but it was not <name> 's .
she had determined that <name> should go with her to <name> .
as might have been expected , when the time came for the decision , the woman gained the day .
her <unk> , her arts , her caresses , her tears , prevailed .
after a brief struggle between the sentiment of love on the one hand and those of ambition and of duty combined on the other , <name> gave up the contest .
abandoning every thing else , he surrendered himself wholly to <name> 's control , and went with her to <name> .
he spent the <name> there , giving himself up with her to every species of sensual indulgence that the most remorseless license could tolerate , and the most unbounded wealth procure .
there seemed , in fact , to be no bounds to the extravagance and infatuation which <name> displayed during the <name> in <name> .
<name> devoted herself to him incessantly , day and night , filling up every moment of time with some new form of pleasure , in order that he might have no time to think of his absent wife , or to listen to the reproaches of his conscience .
<name> , on his part , surrendered himself a willing victim to these wiles , and entered with all his heart into the thousand plans of gayety and <unk> which <name> devised .
they had each a separate establishment in the city , which was maintained at an enormous cost , and they made a arrangement by which each was the guest of the other on alternate days .
these visits were spent in games , sports , spectacles , feasting , drinking , and in every species of riot , irregularity , and excess .
a curious instance is afforded of the accidental manner in which intelligence in respect to the scenes and incidents of private life in those ancient days is sometimes obtained , in a circumstance which occurred at this time at <name> 's court .
it seems that there was a young medical student at <name> that <name> , named philotas , who happened , in some way or other , to have formed an acquaintance with one of <name> 's domestics , a cook .
under the guidance of this cook , philotas went one day into the palace to see what was to be seen .
the cook took his friend into the kitchens , where , to philotas 's great surprise , he saw , among an infinite number and variety of other preparations , eight wild boars roasting before the fires , some being more and some less advanced in the process .
philotas asked what great company was to dine there that day .
the cook smiled at this question , and replied that there was to be no company at all , other than <name> 's ordinary party .
" but , " said the cook , in explanation , " we are obliged always to prepare several suppers , and to have them ready in succession at different hours , for no one can tell at what time they <name> order the entertainment to be served .
sometimes , when the supper has been actually carried in , <name> and <name> <name> get engaged in some new turn of their diversions , and conclude not to sit down just then to the table , and so we have to take the supper away , and presently bring in another . "
<name> had a son with him at <name> at this time , the child of his wife fulvia .
the name of the son , as well as that of the father , was <name> .
he was old enough to feel some sense of shame at his father's <unk> from duty , and to manifest some respectful regard for the rights and the honor of his mother .
instead of this , however , he imitated his father 's example , and , in his own way , was as reckless and extravagant as he .
the same philotas who is above referred to was , after a time , appointed to some office or other in the young <unk> household , so that he was accustomed to sit at his table and share in his <unk> enjoyments .
he relates that once , while they were feasting together , there was a guest present , a physician , who was a very vain and conceited man , and so talkative that no one else had any opportunity to speak .
all the pleasure of conversation was spoiled by his excessive <unk> .
philotas , however , at length puzzled him so completely with a question of logic ,  of a kind similar to those often discussed with great interest in ancient days ,  as to silence him for a time ; and young <name> was so much delighted with this feat , that he gave philotas all the gold and silver plate that there was upon the table , and sent all the articles home to him , after the entertainment was over , telling him .
to put his <name> and stamp upon them , and lock them up .
the question with which philotas puzzled the self-conceited physician was this .
it must be <unk> , however , that in those days it was considered that cold water in an intermittent fever was extremely dangerous , except in some peculiar cases , and in those the effect was good .
philotas then argued as follows : " in cases of a certain kind it is best to give water to a patient in an ague .
all cases of ague are cases of a certain kind .
therefore it is best in all cases to give the patient water . "
philotas having propounded his argument in this way , challenged the physician to point out the fallacy of it ; and while the physician sat perplexed and puzzled in his attempts to unravel the intricacy of it , the company enjoyed a temporary respite from his excessive <unk> .
philotas adds , in his account of this affair , that he sent the gold and silver plate back to young <name> again , being afraid to keep them .
<name> said that perhaps it was as well that this should be done , since many of the vessels were of great value on account of their rare and antique workmanship , and his father might possibly miss them and wish to know what had become of them .
as there were no limits , on the one hand , to the <unk> and grandeur of the pleasures to which <name> and <name> addicted themselves , so there were none to the low and <unk> tendencies which characterized them on the other .
sometimes , at midnight , after having been spending many hours in mirth and revelry in the palace , <name> would disguise himself in the dress of a slave , and <name> forth into the streets , excited with wine , in search of adventures .
in many cases , <name> herself , similarly disguised , would go out with him .
on these excursions <name> would take pleasure in involving himself in all sorts of difficulties and dangers  in street riots , drunken <unk> , and desperate quarrels with the populace  all for <name> 's amusement and his own .
stories of these adventures would circulate afterward among the people , some of whom would admire the free and jovial character of their eccentric visitor , and others would despise him as a <name> degrading himself to the level of a brute .
some of the amusements and pleasures which <name> and <name> pursued were innocent in themselves , though wholly unworthy to be made the serious business of life by personages on whom such exalted duties rightfully devolved .
they made various excursions upon the nile , and arranged parties of pleasure to go out on the water in the harbor , and to various rural retreats in the environs of the city .
once they went out on a <unk> , in boats , in the port .
<name> was unsuccessful ; and feeling chagrined that <name> should witness his ill-luck , he made a secret arrangement with some of the fishermen to dive down , where they could do so unobserved , and fasten fishes to his hook under the water .
by this plan he caught very large and fine fish very fast .
<name> , however , was too wary to be easily deceived by such a stratagem as this .
she observed the <unk> , but pretended not to observe it ; she expressed , on the other hand , the greatest surprise and delight at <name> 's good luck , and the extraordinary skill which it indicated .
the next day she wished to go a fishing again , and a party was accordingly made as on the day before .
she had , however , secretly instructed another fisherman to procure a dried and salted fish from the market , and , watching his opportunity , to get down into the water under the boats and attach it to the hook , before <name> 's divers could get there .
this plan succeeded , and <name> , in the midst of a large and <name> party that were looking on , pulled out an excellent fish , cured and dried , such as was known to every one as an imported article , bought in the market .
it was a fish of a kind that was brought originally from <name> minor .
the boats and the water all around them resounded with the shouts of merriment and laughter which this incident occasioned .
in the mean time , while <name> was thus spending his time in low and ignoble pursuits and in guilty pleasures at <name> , his wife fulvia , after exhausting all other means of inducing her husband to return to her , became desperate , and took measures for <unk> an open war , which she thought would compel him to return .
the extraordinary energy , influence , and talent which fulvia possessed , enabled her to do this in an effectual manner .
she organized an army , formed a camp , placed herself at the head of the troops , and sent such tidings to <name> of the dangers which threatened his cause as greatly alarmed him .
at the same time news came of great disasters in <name> minor , and of alarming insurrections among the provinces which had been committed to his charge there .
<name> saw that he must arouse himself from the spell which had enchanted him and break away from <name> , or that he would be wholly and irretrievably ruined .
he made , accordingly , a desperate effort to get free .
he bade the <name> farewell , embarked hastily in a fleet of galleys , and sailed away to tyre , leaving <name> in her palace , vexed , disappointed , and chagrined .

<name> , in parting with <name> as described in the last chapter , lost him for two or three years .
during this time <name> himself was involved in a great variety of difficulties and dangers , and passed through many eventful scenes , which , however , can not here be described in detail .
his life , during this period , was full of <unk> and excitement , and was spent probably in alternations of remorse for the past and anxiety for the future .
on landing at tyre , he was at first extremely perplexed whether to go to <name> minor or to rome .
his presence was imperiously demanded in both places .
the war which fulvia had <unk> was caused , in part , by the rivalry of octavius , and the collision of his interests with those of her husband .
<name> was very angry with her for having managed his affairs in such a way as to bring about a war .
after a time <name> and fulvia met at athens .
fulvia had retreated to that city , and was very seriously sick there , either from bodily disease , or from the influence of long-continued anxiety , vexation , and distress .
they had a <name> meeting .
neither party was disposed to exercise any <name> toward the other .
<name> left his wife rudely and roughly , after loading her with reproaches .
a short time afterward , she sank down in sorrow to the grave .
the death of fulvia was an event which proved to be of advantage to <name> .
it opened the way to a reconciliation between him and octavius .
fulvia had been extremely active in opposing octavius 's designs , and in organizing plans for resisting him .
he felt , therefore , a special hostility against her , and , through her , against <name> .
now , however , that she was dead , the way seemed to be in some sense opened for a reconciliation .
octavius had a sister , <name> , who had been the wife of a <name> general named <name> .
she was a very beautiful and a very accomplished woman , and of a spirit very different from that of fulvia .
she was gentle , affectionate , and kind , a lover of peace and <name> , and not at all disposed , like fulvia , to assert and maintain her influence over others by an overbearing and violent demeanor .
<name> 's husband died about this time , and , in the course of the movements and negotiations between <name> and octavius , the plan was proposed of a marriage between <name> and <name> , which , it was thought , would ratify and confirm the reconciliation .
this proposal was finally agreed upon , <name> was glad to find so easy a mode of settling his difficulties .
the people of rome , too , and the authorities there , knowing that the peace of the world depended upon the terms on which these two men stood with regard to each other , were extremely desirous that this arrangement should be carried into effect .
there was a law of the commonwealth forbidding the marriage of a widow within a specified period after the death of her husband .
that period had not , in <name> 's case , yet expired .
there was , however , so strong a <name> that no obstacle should be allowed to prevent this proposed union , or even to occasion delay , that the law was altered expressly for this case , and <name> and <name> were married .
the empire was divided between octavius and <name> , octavius receiving the western portion as his share , while the eastern was assigned to <name> .
it is not probable that <name> felt any very strong affection for his new wife , beautiful and gentle as she was .
a man , in fact , who had led such a life as his had been , must have become by this time incapable of any strong and pure attachment .
he , however , was pleased with the novelty of his acquisition , and seemed to forget for a time the loss of <name> .
he remained with <name> a year .
after that he went away on certain military enterprises which kept him some time from her .
he returned again , and again he went away .
all this time <unk> influence over him and over her brother was of the most salutary and excellent character .
she soothed their animosities , quieted their suspicions and jealousies , and at one time , when they were on the brink of open war , she effected a reconciliation between them by the most courageous and energetic , and at the same time , gentle and unassuming efforts .
at the time of this danger she was with her husband in greece ; but she persuaded him to send her to her brother at rome , saying that she was confident that she could arrange a settlement of the difficulties impending .
<name> allowed her to go .
she proceeded to rome , and procured an interview with her brother in the presence of his two principal officers of state .
here she pleaded her husband 's cause with tears in her eyes ; she defended his conduct , explained what seemed to be against him , and entreated her brother not to take such a course as should cast her down from being the happiest of women to being the most miserable .
" consider the circumstances of my case , " said she .
" the eyes of the world are upon me .
of the two most powerful men in the world , i am the wife of one and the sister of another .
if you allow rash counsels to go on and war to ensue , i am hopelessly ruined ; for , whichever is conquered , my husband or my brother , my own happiness <name> be for ever gone . "
octavius sincerely loved his sister , and he was so far softened by her entreaties that he consented to appoint an interview with <name> in order to see if their difficulties could be settled .
this interview was accordingly held .
the two generals came to a river , where , at the opposite banks , each embarked in a boat , and , being rowed out toward each other , they met in the middle of the stream .
a conference ensued , at which all the questions at issue were , for a time at least , very happily arranged .
<name> , however , after a time , began to become tired of his wife , and to sigh for <name> once more .
he left <name> at rome and proceeded to the eastward , under pretense of attending to the affairs of that portion of the empire ; but , instead of doing this , he went to <name> , and there renewed again his former intimacy with the egyptian <name> .
octavius was very indignant at this .
his former hostility to <name> , which had been in a measure appeased by the kind influence of <name> , now broke forth anew , and was heightened by the feeling of resentment naturally awakened by his sister 's wrongs public sentiment in rome , too , was setting very strongly against <name> .
<unk> were written , against him to ridicule him and <name> , and the most decided <unk> were passed upon his conduct .
<name> was universally beloved , and the sympathy which was every where felt for her increased and heightened very much the popular indignation which was felt against the man who could wrong so deeply such sweetness , and gentleness , and affectionate fidelity as hers .
after remaining for some time in <name> , and renewing his connection and intimacy with <name> , <name> went away again , crossing the sea into <name> , with the intention of prosecuting certain military undertakings there which imperiously demanded his attention .
his plan was to return as soon as possible to egypt after the object of his expedition should be accomplished .
he found , however , that he could not bear even a temporary absence from <name> .
his mind <unk> so much upon her , and upon the pleasures which he had enjoyed with her in egypt , and he longed so much to see her again , that he was wholly unfit for the discharge of his duties in the camp .
he became timid , inefficient , and <unk> , and almost every thing that he undertook ended <unk> .
the army , who understood perfectly well the reason of their <unk> <unk> and consequent ill fortune , were extremely indignant at his conduct , and the camp was filled with suppressed murmurs and complaints .
<name> , however , like other persons in his situation , was blind to all these indications of dissatisfaction ; probably he would have disregarded them if he had observed them .
at length , finding that he could bear his absence from his mistress no longer , he set out to march across the country , in the depth of the <name> , to the sea-shore , to a point where he had sent for <name> to come to join him .
the army endured incredible hardships and exposures in this march .
when <name> had once commenced the journey , he was so impatient to get forward that he compelled his troops to advance with a rapidity greater than their strength would bear .
they were , besides , not provided with proper tents or with proper supplies of provisions .
they were often obliged , therefore , after a long and fatiguing march during the day , to bivouac at night in the open air among the mountains , with scanty means of <unk> their hunger , and very little shelter from the cold rain , or from the storms of driving snow .
eight thousand men died on this march , from cold , fatigue , and exposure ; a greater sacrifice , perhaps , than had ever been made before to the mere ardor and impatience of a lover .
when <name> reached the shore , he advanced to a certain sea-port , near <unk> , where <name> was to land .
at the time of his arrival but a very small part of his army was left , and the few men that survived were in a miserably destitute condition .
<name> 's eagerness to see <name> became more and more excited as the time <name> nigh .
she did not come so soon as he had expected , and during the delay he seemed to pine away under the influence of love and sorrow .
he was silent , absent-minded , and sad .
he had no thoughts for any thing but the coming of <name> , and felt no interest in any other plans .
he watched for her incessantly , and would sometimes leave his place at the table , in the midst of the supper , and go down alone to the shore , where he would stand gazing out upon the sea , and saying mournfully to himself , " why does not she come ? "
the animosity and the ridicule which these things awakened against him , on the part of the army , were extreme ; but he was so utterly infatuated that he disregarded all the manifestations of public sentiment around him , and continued to allow his mind to be wholly engrossed with the single idea of <name> 's coming .
she arrived at last .
she brought a great supply of clothes and other necessaries for the use of <name> 's army , so that her coming not only gratified his love , but afforded him , also , a very essential relief , in respect to the military difficulties in which he was involved .
after some time spent in the enjoyment of the pleasure which being thus <unk> to <name> afforded him , <name> began again to think of the affairs of his government , which every month more and more imperiously demanded his attention .
he began to receive urgent calls from various quarters , rousing him to action .
in the mean time , <name>  who had been all this while waiting in distress and anxiety at rome , hearing continually the most gloomy accounts of her husband 's affairs , and the most humiliating tidings in respect to his infatuated devotion to <name>  resolved to make one more effort to save him .
she <unk> with her brother to allow her to raise troops and to collect supplies , and then proceed to the eastward to <unk> him .
octavius consented to this .
he , in fact , assisted <name> in making her preparations .
it is said , however , that he was influenced in this plan by his confident belief that this <name> attempt of his sister to <unk> her husband would fail , and that , by the failure of it , <name> would be put in the wrong , in the estimation of the <name> people , more absolutely and hopelessly than ever , and that the way would thus be prepared for his complete and final destruction .
<name> was rejoiced to obtain her brother 's aid to her undertaking , whatever the motive might be which induced him to afford it .
she accordingly levied a considerable body of troops , raised a large sum of money , provided clothes , and tents , and military stores for the army ; and when all was ready , she left italy and put to sea , having previously dispatched a messenger to her husband to inform him that she was coming .
<name> began now to be afraid that she was to lose <name> again , and she at once began to resort to the usual artifices employed in such cases , in order to retain her power over him .
she said nothing , but assumed the appearance of one pining under the influence of some secret suffering or sorrow .
she contrived to be often surprised in tears .
in such cases she would hastily brush her tears away , and assume a countenance of smiles and good humor , as if making every effort to be happy , though really oppressed with a heavy burden of anxiety and grief .
when <name> was near her she would seem overjoyed at his presence , and gaze upon him with an expression of the most devoted fondness .
when absent from him , she spent her time alone , always silent and dejected , and often in tears ; and she took care that the secret sorrows and sufferings that she endured should be duly made known to <name> , and that he should understand that they were all occasioned by her love for him , and by the danger which she apprehended that he was about to leave her .
the friends and secret agents of <name> , who reported these things to <name> , made , moreover , direct representations to him , for the purpose of <unk> his mind in her favor .
they had , in fact , the astonishing audacity to argue that <name> 's claims upon <name> for a continuance of his love were paramount to those of <name> .
she , that is , <name> , had been his wife , they said , only for a very short time .
<name> had been most <unk> attached to him for many years .
<name> was married to him , they alleged , not under the impulse of love , but from political considerations alone , to please her brother , and to ratify and confirm a political league made with him .
<name> , on the other hand , had given herself up to him in the most absolute and <unk> manner , under the influence solely of a personal affection which she could not control .
she had surrendered and sacrificed every thing to him .
for him she had lost her good name , alienated the affections of her subjects , made herself the object of reproach and censure to all mankind , and now she had left her native land to come and join him in his adverse fortunes .
considering how much she had done , and suffered , and sacrificed for his sake , it would be extreme and unjustifiable cruelty in him to forsake her now .
she never would survive such an abandonment .
her whole soul was so wrapped up in him , that she would pine away and die if he were now to forsake her .
<name> was distressed and agitated beyond measure by the <unk> in which he found that he was involved .
his duty , his inclination perhaps , certainly his ambition , and every dictate of <name> and policy required that he should break away from these <unk> at once and go to meet <name> .
but the spell that bound him was too mighty to be dissolved .
he yielded to <name> 's sorrows and tears .
he dispatched a messenger to <name> , who had by this time reached athens , in greece , directing her not to come any farther .
<name> , who seemed incapable of resentment or anger against her husband , sent back to ask what she should do with the troops , and money , and the military stores which she was bringing .
<name> directed her to leave them in greece .
<name> did so , and mournfully returned to her home .
as soon as she arrived at rome , octavius , her brother , whose indignation was now thoroughly aroused at the baseness of <name> , sent to his sister to say that she must leave <name> 's house and come to him .
a proper self-respect , he said , forbade her remaining any longer under the roof of such a man .
<name> replied that she would not leave her husband's house .
that house was her post of duty , whatever her husband might do , and there she would remain .
she accordingly retired within the precincts of her old home , and devoted herself in patient and <unk> sorrow to the care of the family and the children .
among these children was one young son of <name> 's , born during his marriage with her predecessor fulvia .
in the mean time , while <name> was thus faithfully though mournfully fulfilling her duties as wife and mother , in her husband's house at rome , <name> himself had gone with <name> to <name> , and was abandoning himself once more to a life of guilty pleasure there .
the greatness of mind which this beautiful and devoted wife thus displayed , attracted the admiration of all mankind .
it produced , however , one other effect , which <name> must have greatly <unk> .
it aroused a strong and universal feeling of indignation against the unworthy object toward whom this extraordinary magnanimity was displayed .
in the mean time , <name> gave himself up wholly to <name> 's influence and control , and managed all the affairs of the <name> empire in the east in the way best fitted to promote her aggrandizement and honor .
he made <name> his capital , celebrated triumphs there , arranged ostentatious expeditions into <name> and syria with <name> and her train , gave her whole provinces as presents , and exalted her two sons , <name> and ptolemy , children born during the period of his first acquaintance with her , to positions of the highest rank and station , as his own acknowledged sons .
the consequences of these and similar measures at rome were fatal to <name> 's character and standing .
octavius reported every thing to the <name> senate and people , and made <unk> <unk> and his various <unk> the ground of the heaviest accusations against him .
<name> , hearing of these things , sent his agents to rome and made accusations against octavius ; but these counter accusations were of no avail .
public sentiment was very strong and decided against him at the capital , and octavius began to prepare for war .
<name> perceived that he must prepare to defend himself .
<name> entered into the plans which he formed for this purpose with great ardor .
<name> began to levy troops , and collect and equip galleys and ships of war , and to make <unk> of money and military stores from all the eastern provinces and kingdoms .
<name> put all the resources of egypt at his disposal .
she furnished him with immense sums of money , and with an inexhaustible supply of corn , which she procured for this purpose from her dominions in the valley of the nile .
the various divisions of the immense armament which was thus provided for were ordered to rendezvous at ephesus , where <name> and <name> were awaiting to receive them , having proceeded there when their arrangements in egypt were completed , and they were ready to commence the campaign .
when all was ready for the expedition to set sail from ephesus , it was <name> 's judgment that it would be best for <name> to return to egypt , and leave him to go forth with the fleet to meet octavius alone .
<name> was , however , determined not to go away .
she did not dare to leave <name> at all to himself , for fear that in some way or other a peace would be effected between himself and octavius , which would result in his returning to <name> and abandoning her .
she accordingly contrived to persuade <name> to retain her with him , by bribing his chief counselor to advise him to do so .
his counselor 's name was <unk> .
<unk> , having received <name> 's money , while yet he pretended to be wholly disinterested in his advice , represented to <name> that it would not be reasonable to send <name> away , and deprive her of all participation in the <name> of the war , when she was <unk> so large a part of the expense of it .
besides , a large portion of the army consisted of egyptian troops , who would feel discouraged and disheartened if <name> were to leave them , and would probably act far less efficiently in the conflict than they would do if animated by the presence of their <name> .
then , moreover , such a woman as <name> was not to be considered , as many women would be , an embarrassment and a source of care to a military expedition which she might join , but a very efficient counselor and aid to it .
she was , he said , a very sagacious , energetic , and powerful <name> , accustomed to the command of armies and to the management of affairs of state , and her aid in the conduct of the expedition might be expected to <unk> very materially to its success .
<name> was easily won by such persuasions as these , and it was at length decided that <name> should accompany him .
<name> then ordered the fleet to move forward to the island of samos .
here it was brought to anchor and remained for some time , waiting for the coming in of new re-enforcements , and for the completion of the other arrangements .
<name> , as if becoming more and more infatuated as he approached the brink of his ruin , spent his time while the expedition remained at samos , not in maturing his plans and perfecting his arrangements for the tremendous conflict which was approaching , but in festivities , games , <unk> , and every species of riot and dissolute excess .
this , however , is not surprising .
men almost always , when in a situation analogous to his , fly to similar means of protecting themselves , in some small degree , from the pangs of remorse , and from the forebodings which stand ready to terrify and torment them at every instant in which these gloomy <unk> are not driven away by intoxication and revelry .
at least <name> found it so .
accordingly , an immense company of players , tumblers , fools , <unk> , and <unk> were ordered to assemble at samos , and to devote themselves with all zeal to the amusement of <name> 's court .
the island was one universal scene of riot and revelry .
people were astonished at such celebrations and displays , wholly unsuitable , as they considered them , to the occasion .
if such are the rejoicings , said they , which <name> <unk> before going into the battle , what festivities <name> he contrive on his return , joyous enough to express his pleasure if he shall gain the victory ?
after a time , <name> and <name> , with a magnificent train of attendants , left samos , and , passing across the <unk> sea , landed in greece , and advanced to athens , while the fleet , proceeding westward from samos , passed around <unk> , the southern promontory of greece , and then moved northward along the western coast of the peninsula .
<name> wished to go to athens for a special reason .
it was there that <name> had stopped on her journey toward her husband with re-enforcements and aid ; and while she was there , the people of athens , pitying her sad condition , and admiring the <name> spirit of mind which she displayed in her misfortunes , had paid her great attention , and during her stay among them had bestowed upon her many honors .
<name> now wished to go to the same place , and to triumph over her rival there , by making so great a display of her wealth and magnificence , and of her ascendency over the mind of <name> , as should entirely <unk> and <unk> the more unassuming pretensions of <name> .
she was not willing , it seems , to leave to the unhappy wife whom she had so cruelly wronged even the possession of a place in the hearts of the people of this foreign city , but must go and enviously strive to efface the impression which injured innocence had made , by an ostentatious exhibition of the triumphant prosperity of her own shameless wickedness .
she succeeded well in her plans .
the people of athens were amazed and bewildered at the immense magnificence that <name> exhibited before them .
she distributed vast sums of money among the people .
the city , in return , decreed to her the most exalted honors .
they sent a solemn embassy to her to present her with these decrees .
<name> himself , in the character of a citizen of athens , was one of the embassadors .
<name> received the deputation at her palace .
the reception was attended with the most splendid and imposing ceremonies .
one would have supposed that <name> 's cruel and unnatural hostility to <name> might now have been satisfied ; but it was not .
<name> , while he was at athens , and doubtless at <name> 's <unk> , sent a messenger to rome with a notice of <unk> to <name> , and with an order that she should leave his house .
<name> obeyed .
she went forth from her home , taking the children with her , and bitterly lamenting her cruel <name> .
in the mean time , while all these events had been <unk> in the east , octavius had been making his preparations for the coming crisis , and was now advancing with a powerful fleet across the sea .
he was armed with authority from the <name> senate and people , for he had obtained from them a decree deposing <name> from his power .
the charges made against him all related to <unk> and offenses arising out of his connection with <name> .
octavius contrived to get possession of a <name> which <name> had written before leaving rome , and which he had placed there in what he supposed a very sacred place of deposit .
the <unk> who had it in charge replied to octavius , when he demanded it , that they would not give it to him , but if he wished to take it they would not hinder him .
octavius then took the <name> , and read it to the <name> senate .
it provided , among other things , that at his death , if his death should happen at rome , his body should be sent to <name> to be given to <name> ; and it evinced in other ways a degree of <unk> and <unk> to the egyptian <name> which was considered wholly unworthy of a <name> chief magistrate .
<name> was accused , too , of having plundered cities and provinces , to make presents to <name> ; of having sent a library of two hundred thousand volumes to her from <unk> , to replace the one which <name> caesar had accidentally burned ; of having raised her sons , ignoble as their birth was , to high places of trust and power in the <name> government , and of having in many ways compromised the dignity of a <name> officer by his unworthy conduct in reference to her .
he used , for example , when presiding at a judicial tribunal , to receive <unk> sent him from <name> , and then at once turn off his attention from the proceedings going forward before him to read the letters .
[ 1 ] [ footnote 1 : these letters , in accordance with the scale of expense and extravagance on which <name> determined that every thing relating to herself and <name> should be done , were engraved on tablets made of <unk> , or <name> , or other hard and precious stones . ]
sometimes he did this when sitting in the chair of state , giving audience to embassadors and princes .
<name> probably sent these letters in at such times under the influence of a wanton disposition to show her power .
at one time , as octavius said in his arguments before the <name> senate , <name> was hearing a cause of the greatest importance , and during a time in the progress of the cause when one of the principal orators of the city was addressing him , <name> came passing by , when <name> suddenly arose , and , leaving the court without any ceremony , ran out to follow her .
these and a thousand similar tales exhibited <name> in so odious a light , that his friends forsook his cause , and his enemies gained a complete triumph .
the decree was passed against him , and octavius was authorized to <name> it into effect ; and accordingly , while <name> , with his fleet and army , was moving westward from samos and the <unk> sea , octavius was coming eastward and southward down the adriatic to meet him .
in process of time , after various maneuvers and delays , the two <unk> came into the vicinity of each other at a place called <unk> , which <name> be found upon the map on the western coast of epirus , north of greece .
both of the commanders had powerful fleets at sea , and both had great armies upon the land .
<name> was strongest in land troops , but his fleet was inferior to that of octavius , and he was himself inclined to remain on the land and fight the principal battle there .
but <name> would not consent to this .
she urged him to give octavius battle at sea .
the motive which induced her to do this has been supposed to be her wish to provide a more sure way of escape in case of an unfavorable issue to the conflict .
she thought that in her galleys she could make sail at once across the sea to <name> in case of defeat , whereas she knew not what would become of her if beaten at the head of an army on the land .
the ablest counselors and chief officers in the army urged <name> very strongly not to trust himself to the sea .
to all their arguments and remonstrances , however , <name> turned a deaf ear .
<name> must be allowed to have her way .
on the morning of the battle , when the ships were drawn up in array , <name> held the command of a division of fifty or sixty egyptian vessels , which were all completely manned , and well equipped with masts and sails .
she took good care to have every thing in perfect order for flight , in case flight should prove to be necessary .
with these ships she took a station in reserve , and for a time remained there a quiet witness of the battle .
the ships of octavius advanced to the attack of those of <name> , and the men fought from deck to deck with spears , <unk> , flaming darts , and every other destructive missile which the military <name> had then devised .
<name> 's ships had to contend against great disadvantages .
they were not only <unk> by those of octavius , but were far surpassed by them in the efficiency with which they were manned and armed .
still , it was a very obstinate conflict .
<name> , however , did not wait to see how it was to be finally decided .
as <name> 's forces did not immediately gain the victory , she soon began to yield to her fears in respect to the result , and , finally , fell into a panic and resolved to fly .
she ordered the oars to be manned and the sails to be hoisted , and then forcing her way through a portion of the fleet that was engaged in the contest , and throwing the vessels into confusion as she passed , she succeeded in getting to sea , and then pressed on , under full sail , down the coast to the southward .
<name> , as soon as he perceived that she was going , abandoning every other thought , and impelled by his insane <unk> to her , hastily called up a galley of five banks of oarsmen to pull with all their force after <name> 's flying squadron .
<name> , looking back from the deck of her vessel , saw this swift galley pressing on toward her .
she raised a signal at the stern of the vessel which she was in , that <name> might know for which of the fifty flying ships he was to steer .
guided by the signal , <name> came up to the vessel , and the sailors hoisted him up the side and helped him in .
<name> had , however , disappeared .
overcome with shame and confusion , she did not dare , it seems , to meet the look of the wretched victim of her arts whom she had now irretrievably ruined .
<name> did not seek her .
he did not speak a word .
he went forward to the prow of the ship , and , throwing himself down there alone , pressed his head between his hands , and seemed stunned and stupefied , and utterly overwhelmed with horror and despair .
he was , however , soon aroused from his stupor by an alarm raised on board his galley that they were pursued .
he rose from his seat , seized a spear , and , on ascending to the quarter-deck , saw that there were a number of small light boats , full of men and of arms , coming up behind them , and gaining rapidly upon his galley .
<name> , now free for a moment from his <unk> 's sway , and acting under the impulse of his own indomitable boldness and decision , instead of urging the oarsmen to press forward more rapidly in order to make good their escape , ordered the helm to be put about , and thus , turning the galley around , he faced his pursuers , and drove his ship into the midst of them .
a violent conflict ensued , the din and confusion of which was increased by the shocks and collisions between the boats and the galley .
in the end , the boats were beaten off , all excepting one : that one kept still hovering near , and the commander of it , who stood upon the deck , <unk> his spear with an aim at <name> , and seeking eagerly an opportunity to throw it , seemed by his attitude and the expression of his countenance to be animated by some peculiarly bitter feeling of hostility and hate .
<name> asked him who he was , that dared so fiercely to threaten him .
the man replied by giving his name , and saying that he came to avenge the death of his father .
it proved that he was the son of a man whom <name> had at a previous time , on some account or other , caused to be beheaded .
there followed an obstinate contest between <name> and this fierce assailant , in the end of which the latter was beaten off .
the boats then , having succeeded in making some prizes from <name> 's fleet , though they had failed in capturing <name> himself , gave up the pursuit and returned .
<name> then went back to his place , sat down in the prow , buried his face in his hands , and sank into the same condition of hopeless distress and anguish as before .
when husband and wife are overwhelmed with misfortune and suffering , each instinctively seeks a refuge in the sympathy and support of the other .
it is , however , far otherwise with such connections as that of <name> and <name> .
conscience , which remains calm and quiet in prosperity and <name> , rises up with sudden and unexpected violence as soon as the hour of calamity comes ; and thus , instead of mutual comfort and help , each finds in the thoughts of the other only the means of adding the horrors of remorse to the anguish of disappointment and despair .
so extreme was <name> 's distress , that for three days he and <name> neither saw nor spoke to each other .
she was overwhelmed with confusion and chagrin , and he was in such a condition of mental excitement that she did not dare to approach him .
in a word , reason seemed to have wholly lost its sway  his mind , in the alternations of his insanity , rising sometimes to fearful excitement , in paroxysms of uncontrollable rage , and then sinking again for a time into the stupor of despair .
in the mean time , the ships were passing down as rapidly as possible on the western coast of greece .
when they reached <unk> , the southern promontory of the peninsula , it was necessary to pause and consider what was to be done .
<name> 's women went to <name> and attempted to quiet and calm him .
they brought him food .
they persuaded him to see <name> .
a great number of merchant ships from the ports along the coast gathered around <name> 's little fleet and offered their services .
his cause , they said , was by no means desperate .
the army on the land had not been beaten .
it was not even certain that his fleet had been conquered .
they endeavored thus to revive the ruined commander 's sinking courage , and to urge him to make a new effort to retrieve his fortunes .
but all was in vain .
<name> was sunk in a hopeless despondency .
<name> was determined on going to egypt , and he must go too .
he distributed what treasure remained at his disposal among his immediate followers and friends , and gave them advice about the means of concealing themselves until they could make peace with octavius .
then , giving up all as lost , he followed <name> across the sea to <name> .

the case of <name> <name> affords one of the most extraordinary examples of the power of unlawful love to lead its <unk> and infatuated victim into the very jaws of open and recognized destruction that history records .
cases similar in character occur by thousands in common life ; but <name> 's , though perhaps not more striking in itself than a great multitude of others have been , is the most conspicuous instance that has ever been held up to the observation of mankind .
in early life , <name> was remarkable , as we have already seen , for a certain savage <unk> of character , and for a stern and indomitable recklessness of <name> , so great that it seemed impossible that any thing human should be able to tame him .
he was under the control , too , of an ambition so lofty and aspiring that it appeared to know no bounds ; and yet we find him taken possession of , in the very midst of his career , and in the height of his prosperity and success , by a woman , and so subdued by her arts and fascinations as to yield himself wholly to her guidance , and allow himself to be led about by her entirely at her <name> .
she <unk> whatever there might have been that was <name> and generous in his heart , and substitutes <unk> her own principles of malice and cruelty .
she <unk> all the fires of his ambition , originally so magnificent in its aims that the world seemed hardly large enough to afford it scope , and instead of this lofty passion , fills his soul with a love of the lowest , <unk> , and most ignoble pleasures .
she leads him to betray every public trust , to <unk> from himself all the affections of his countrymen , to repel most cruelly the kindness and <unk> of a beautiful and faithful wife , and , finally to expel this wife and all of his own legitimate family from his house ; and now , at last , she conducts him away in a most cowardly and ignoble flight from the field of his duty as a soldier  he knowing , all the time , that she is hurrying him to disgrace and destruction , and yet utterly without power to break from the control of his invisible chains .
the indignation which <name> 's base abandonment of his fleet and army at the battle of <unk> excited , over all that part of the empire which had been under his command , was extreme .
there was not the slightest possible excuse for such a flight .
his army , in which his greatest strength lay , remained unharmed , and even his fleet was not defeated .
the ships continued the combat until night , notwithstanding the betrayal of their cause by their commander .
they were at length , however , subdued .
the army , also , being discouraged , and losing all motive for resistance , yielded too .
in a very short time the whole country went over to octavius 's side .
in the mean time , <name> and <name> , on their first return to egypt , were completely beside themselves with terror .
<name> formed a plan for having all the treasures that she could save , and a certain number of galleys sufficient for the transportation of these treasures and a small company of friends , carried across the isthmus of suez and launched upon the red sea , in order that she might escape in that direction , and find some remote hiding-place and safe retreat on the shores of arabia or <name> , beyond the reach of octavius 's dreaded power .
she actually commenced this undertaking , and sent one or two of her galleys across the isthmus ; but the arabs seized them as soon as they reached their place of destination , and killed or captured the men that had them in charge , so that this desperate scheme was soon abandoned .
she and <name> then finally concluded to establish themselves at <name> , and made preparation , as well as they could , for defending themselves against octavius there .
<name> , when the first effects of his panic subsided , began to grow mad with vexation and resentment against all mankind .
he determined that he would have nothing to do with <name> or with any of her friends , but went off in a fit of sullen rage , and built a hermitage in a lonely place , on the island of pharos , where he lived for a time , cursing his folly and his wretched fate , and uttering the bitterest invectives against all who had been concerned in it .
here tidings came continually in , informing him of the <unk> of one after another of his armies , of the fall of his provinces in greece and <name> minor , and of the irresistible progress which octavius was now making toward universal dominion .
the tidings of these disasters coming incessantly upon him kept him in a continual fever of resentment and rage .
at last he became tired of his <unk> solitude , a sort of reconciliation ensued between himself and <name> , and he went back again to the city .
here he joined himself once more to <name> , and , collecting together what remained of their joint resources , they plunged again into a life of dissipation and vice , with the vain attempt to drown in mirth and wine the bitter regrets and the anxious forebodings which filled their souls .
they joined with them a company of <unk> as abandoned as themselves , and strove very hard to disguise and conceal their cares in their forced and unnatural gayety .
they could not , however , accomplish this purpose .
octavius was gradually advancing in his progress , and they knew very well that the time of his dreadful reckoning with them must soon come ; nor was there any place on earth in which they could look with any <name> of finding a refuge in it from his vindictive hostility .
<name> , warned by dreadful <unk> of what would probably at last be her fate , amused herself in studying the nature of poisons  not theoretically , but practically  making experiments with them on wretched prisoners and captives whom she compelled to take them in order that she and <name> might see the effects which they produced .
she made a collection of all the poisons which she could procure , and administered portions of them all , that she might see which were sudden and which were slow in their effects , and also learn which produced the greatest distress and suffering , and which , on the other hand , only benumbed and stupefied the faculties , and thus extinguished life with the least infliction of pain .
these experiments were not confined to such vegetable and mineral poisons as could be mingled with the food or administered in a <unk> .
<name> took an equal interest in the effects of the bite of venomous serpents and reptiles .
she procured specimens of all these animals , and tried them upon her prisoners , causing the men to be stung and bitten by them , and then watching the effects .
these investigations were made , not directly with a view to any practical use , which she was to make of the knowledge thus acquired , but rather as an agreeable occupation , to divert her mind , and to amuse <name> and her guests .
the variety in the forms and expressions which the agony of her poisoned victims assumed ,  their <unk> , their cries , their convulsions , and the <unk> of their features when struggling with death , furnished exactly the kind and degree of excitement which she needed to occupy and amuse her mind .
[ illustration : <name> testing the poisons upon the slaves ] <name> was not entirely at ease , however , during the progress of these terrible experiments .
his foolish and childish fondness for <name> was mingled with jealousy , suspicion , and distrust ; and he was so afraid that <name> might secretly poison him , that he would never take any food or wine without requiring that she should taste it before him .
at length , one day , <name> caused the petals of some flowers to be poisoned , and then had the flowers woven into the <unk> which <name> was to wear at supper .
in the midst of the feast , she pulled off the leaves of the flowers from her own <unk> and put them playfully into her wine , and then proposed that <name> should do the same with his <unk> , and that they should then drink the wine , <unk> , as it would be , with the color and the perfume of the flowers .
<name> entered very readily into this proposal , and when he was about to drink the wine , she arrested his hand , and told him that it was poisoned .
" you see now , " said she , " how vain it is for you to watch against me .
if it were possible for me to live without you , how easy it would be for me to devise ways and means to kill you . "
then , to prove that her words were true , she ordered one of the servants to drink <name> 's wine .
he did so , and died before their sight in dreadful agony .
the experiments which <name> thus made on the nature and effects of poison were not , however , wholly without practical result .
<name> learned from them , it is said , that the bite of the <unk> was the easiest and least painful mode of death .
the effect of the venom of that animal appeared to her to be the <unk> of the sensorium into a lethargy or stupor , which soon ended in death , without the intervention of pain .
this knowledge she seems to have laid up in her mind for future use .
the thoughts of <name> appear , in fact , to have been much disposed , at this time , to flow in gloomy channels , for she occupied herself a great deal in building for herself a sepulchral monument in a certain sacred portion of the city .
this monument had , in fact , been commenced many years ago , in accordance with a custom prevailing among egyptian sovereigns , of expending a portion of their revenues during their <unk> in building and decorating their own tombs .
<name> now turned her mind with new interest to her own mausoleum .
she finished it , provided it with the strongest possible bolts and bars , and , in a word , seemed to be preparing it in all respects for occupation .
in the mean time , octavius , having made himself master of all the countries which had formerly been under <name> 's sway , now advanced , meeting none to oppose him , from <name> minor into syria , and from syria toward egypt .
<name> and <name> made one attempt , while he was thus advancing toward <name> , to avert the storm which was impending over them , by sending an embassage to ask for some terms of peace .
<name> proposed , in this embassage , to give up every thing to his conqueror on condition that he might be permitted to retire unmolested with <name> to athens , and allowed to spend the remainder of their days there in peace ; and that the kingdom of egypt might descend to their children .
octavius replied that he could not make any terms with <name> , though he was willing to consent to any thing that was reasonable in behalf of <name> .
the messenger who came back from octavius with this reply spent some time in private interviews with <name> .
this aroused <name> 's jealousy and anger .
he accordingly ordered the unfortunate messenger to be scourged and then sent back to octavius , all <unk> with wounds , with orders to say to octavius that if it displeased him to have one of his servants thus punished , he might revenge himself by <unk> a servant of <name> 's who was then , as it happened , in octavius 's power .
the news at length suddenly arrived at <name> that octavius had appeared before pelusium , and that the city had fallen into his hands .
the next thing <name> and <name> well knew would be , that they should see him at the gates of <name> .
neither <name> nor <name> had any means of resisting his progress , and there was no place to which they could fly .
nothing was to be done but to await , in consternation and terror , the sure and inevitable doom which was now so near .
<name> gathered together all her treasures and sent them to her tomb .
these treasures consisted of great and valuable stores of gold , silver , precious stones , garments of the highest cost , and weapons , and vessels of exquisite workmanship and great value , the hereditary possessions of the egyptian kings .
she also sent to the mausoleum an immense quantity of flax , tow , torches , and other combustibles .
these she stored in the lower apartments of the monument , with the desperate determination of burning herself and her treasures together rather than to fall into the hands of the romans .
in the mean time , the army of octavius steadily continued its march across the desert from pelusium to <name> .
on the way , octavius learned , through the agents in communication with him from within the city what were the arrangements which <name> had made for the destruction of her treasure whenever the danger should become imminent of its falling into his hands .
he was extremely unwilling that this treasure should be lost .
besides its intrinsic value , it was an object of immense importance to him to get possession of it for the purpose of carrying it to rome as a trophy of his triumph .
he accordingly sent secret messengers to <name> , endeavoring to separate her from <name> , and to <unk> her mind with the profession that he felt only friendship for her , and did not mean to do her any injury , being in pursuit of <name> only .
these negotiations were continued from day to day while octavius was advancing .
at last the <name> army reached <name> , and invested it on every side .
as soon as octavius was established in his camp under the walls of the city , <name> planned a <name> , and he executed it , in fact , with considerable energy and success .
he issued suddenly from the gates , at the head of as strong a force as he could command , and attacked a body of octavius 's horsemen .
he succeeded in driving these horsemen away from their position , but he was soon driven back in his turn , and compelled to retreat to the city , fighting as he fled , to beat back his pursuers .
he was extremely elated at the success of this skirmish .
he came to <name> with a countenance full of animation and pleasure , took her in his arms and kissed her , all <unk> for battle as he was , and boasted greatly of the exploit which he had performed .
he praised , too , in the highest terms , the valor of one of the officers who had gone out with him to the fight , and whom he had now brought to the palace to present to <name> .
<name> rewarded the faithful captain 's prowess with a magnificent suit of armor made of gold .
notwithstanding this reward , however , the man deserted <name> that very night , and went over to the enemy .
almost all of <name> 's adherents were in the same state of mind .
they would have gladly gone over to the camp of octavius , if they could have found an opportunity to do so .
in fact , when the final battle was fought , the fate of it was decided by a grand <unk> in the fleet , which went over in a body to the side of octavius .
<name> was planning the operations of the day , and reconnoitering the movements of the enemy from an eminence which he occupied at the head of a body of foot soldiers  all the land forces that now remained to him  and looking off , from the eminence on which he stood , toward the harbor , he observed a movement among the galleys .
they were going out to meet the ships of octavius , which were lying at anchor not very far from them .
<name> supposed that his vessels were going to attack those of the enemy , and he looked to see what exploits they would perform .
they advanced toward octavius 's ships , and when they met them , <name> observed , to his utter amazement , that , instead of the furious combat that he had expected to see , the ships only exchanged friendly salutations , by the use of the customary naval signals ; and then his ships , passing quietly round , took their positions in the lines of the other fleet .
the two fleets had thus become merged and mingled into one .
<name> immediately decided that this was <name> 's treason .
she had made peace with octavius , he thought , and surrendered the fleet to him as one of the conditions of it .
<name> ran through the city , crying out that he was betrayed , and in a <unk> of rage sought the palace .
<name> fled to her tomb .
she took in with her one or two attendants , and bolted and barred the doors , securing the fastenings with the heavy catches and springs that she had previously made ready .
she then directed her women to call out through the door that she had killed herself within the tomb .
the tidings of her death were borne to <name> .
it changed his anger to grief and despair .
his mind , in fact , was now wholly lost to all balance and control , and it passed from the dominion of one <name> passion to another with the most capricious facility .
he cried out with the most bitter expressions of sorrow , mourning , he said , not so much <unk> death , for he should soon follow and join her , as the fact that she had proved herself so superior to him in courage at last , in having thus anticipated him in the work of <unk> .
he was at this time in one of the chambers of the palace , whither he had fled in despair , and was standing by a fire , for the morning was cold .
he had a favorite servant named eros , whom he greatly trusted , and whom he had made to take an oath long before , that whenever it should become necessary for him to die , eros should kill him .
this eros he now called to him , and telling him that the time was come , ordered him to take the sword and strike the blow .
eros took the sword while <name> stood up before him .
eros turned his head aside as if wishing that his eyes should not see the deed which his hands were about to perform .
instead , however , of piercing his master with it , he plunged it into his own breast , fell down at <name> 's feet , and died .
<name> gazed a moment at the shocking spectacle , and then said , " i thank thee for this , <name> eros .
thou hast set me an example .
i must do for myself what thou couldst not do for me . "
so saying , he took the sword from his servant 's hands , plunged it into his body , and staggering to a little bed that was near , fell over upon it in a swoon .
he had received a mortal wound .
the pressure , however , which was produced by the position in which he lay upon the bed , <unk> the wound a little , and stopped the flow of blood .
<name> came presently to himself again , and then began to beg and implore those around him to take the sword and put him out of his misery .
but no one would do it .
he lay for a time suffering great pain , and moaning incessantly , until , at length , an officer came into the apartment and told him that the story which he had heard of <unk> death was not true ; that she was still alive , shut up in her monument , and that she desired to see him there .
this intelligence was the source of new excitement and agitation .
<name> implored the by-standers to <name> him to <name> , that he might see her once more before he died .
they shrank from the attempt ; but , after some hesitation and delay , they concluded to undertake to remove him .
so , taking him in their arms , they bore him along , faint and dying , and marking their track with his blood , toward the tomb .
<name> would not open the gates to let the party in .
the city was all in uproar and confusion through the terror of the assault which octavius was making upon it , and she did not know what treachery might be intended .
she therefore went up to a window above , and letting down ropes and chains , she directed those below to fasten the dying body to them , that she and the two women with her might draw it up .
this was done .
those who witnessed it said that it was a most piteous sight to behold ,  <name> and her women above exhausting their strength in drawing the wounded and bleeding sufferer up the wall , while he , when he approached the window , feebly raised his arms to them , that they might lift him in .
the women had hardly strength sufficient to draw the body up .
at one time it seemed that the attempt would have to be abandoned ; but <name> reached down from the window as far as she could to get hold of <name> 's arms , and thus , by dint of great effort , they succeeded at last in taking him in .
they bore him to a couch which was in the upper room from which the window opened , and laid him down , while <name> wrung her hands and tore her hair , and uttered the most piercing lamentations and cries .
she leaned over the dying <name> , crying out incessantly with the most piteous exclamations of grief .
she bathed his face , which was covered with blood , and vainly endeavored to stanch his wound .
<name> urged her to be calm , and not to mourn his fate .
he asked for some wine .
they brought it to him and he drank it .
he then entreated <name> to save her life , if she possibly could do so , and to make some terms or other with octavius , so as to continue to live .
very soon after this he expired .
in the mean time , octavius had heard of the mortal wound which <name> had given himself ; for one of the by-standers had seized the sword the moment that the deed was done , and had hastened to <name> it to octavius , and to announce to him the death of his enemy .
octavius immediately desired to get <name> into his power .
he sent a messenger , therefore , to the tomb , who attempted to open a parley there with her .
<name> talked with the messenger through the <unk> or crevices , but could not be induced to open the door .
the messenger reported these facts to octavius .
octavius then sent another man with the messenger , and while one was engaging the attention of <name> and her women at the door below , the other obtained ladders , and succeeded in gaining admission into the window above .
<name> was warned of the success of this stratagem by the shrieks of her women , who saw the officer coming down the stairs .
she looked around , and observing at a glance that she was betrayed , and that the officer was coming to seize her , she <name> a little dagger from her robe , and was about to plunge it into her breast , when the officer grasped her arm just in time to prevent the blow .
he took the dagger from her , and then examined her clothes to see that there were no other secret weapons concealed there .
the capture of the <name> being reported to octavius , he appointed an officer to take her into close custody .
this officer was charged to treat her with all possible courtesy , but to keep a close and constant watch over her , and particularly to guard against allowing her any possible means or opportunity for <unk> .
in the mean time , octavius took formal possession of the city , marching in at the head of his troops with the most imposing pomp and parade .
a chair of state , magnificently decorated , was set up for him on a high elevation in a public square ; and here he sat , with circles of guards around him , while the people of the city , assembled before him in the dress of <unk> , and kneeling upon the pavement , begged his forgiveness , and implore him to spare the city .
these petitions the great conqueror graciously condescended to <name> .
many of the princes and generals who had served under <name> came next to beg the body of their commander , that they might give it an honorable burial .
these requests , however , octavius would not accede to , saying that he could not take the body away from <name> .
he , however , gave <name> leave to make such arrangements for the obsequies as she thought fit , and allowed her to appropriate such sums of money from her treasures for this purpose as she desired .
<name> accordingly made the necessary arrangements , and superintended the execution of them ; not , however , with any degree of calmness and composure , but in a state , on the contrary , of extreme agitation and distress .
in fact , she had been living now so long under the unlimited and unrestrained dominion of <name> and passion , that reason was pretty effectually <unk> , and all self-control was gone .
she was now nearly forty years of age , and , though traces of her inexpressible beauty remained , her bloom was faded , and her countenance was <name> with the effects of weeping , anxiety , and despair .
she was , in a word , both in body and mind , only the wreck and ruin of what she once had been .
when the burial ceremonies were performed , and she found that all was over  that <name> was forever gone , and she herself hopelessly and <unk> ruined  she gave herself up to a perfect <unk> of grief .
she beat her breast , and scratched and tore her flesh so dreadfully , in the vain efforts which she made to kill herself , in the paroxysms of her despair , that she was soon covered with <unk> and wounds , which , becoming inflamed and swelled , made her a shocking spectacle to see , and threw her into a fever .
she then conceived the idea of pretending to be more sick than she was , and so refusing food and starving herself to death .
she attempted to execute this design .
she rejected every medical remedy that was offered her , and would not eat , and lived thus some days without food .
octavius , to whom every thing relating to his captive was minutely reported by her attendants , suspected her design .
he was very unwilling that she should die , having set his heart on exhibiting her to the <name> people , on his return to the capital , in his triumphal procession .
he accordingly sent her orders , requiring that she should submit to the treatment prescribed by the physician , and take her food , enforcing these his commands with a certain threat which he imagined might have some influence over her .
and what threat does the reader imagine could possibly be devised to reach a mind so sunk , so desperate , so wretched as hers ?
every thing seemed already lost but life , and life was only an insupportable burden .
what interests , then , had she still remaining upon which a threat could take hold ?
octavius , in looking for some avenue by which he could reach her , reflected that she was a mother .
<unk> , the son of <name> caesar , and <name> , <name> , and ptolemy , <name> 's children , were still alive .
octavius imagined that in the secret recesses of her wrecked and ruined soul there might be some lingering principle of maternal affection remaining which he could goad into life and action .
he accordingly sent word to her that , if she did not yield to the physician and take her food , he would kill every one of her children .
the threat produced its effect .
the crazed and frantic patient became calm .
she received her food .
she submitted to the physician .
under his treatment her wounds began to heal , the fever was allayed , and at length she appeared to be gradually recovering .
when octavius learned that <name> had become composed , and seemed to be in some sense convalescent , he resolved to pay her a visit .
as he entered the room where she was confined , which seems to have been still the upper chamber of her tomb , he found her lying on a low and miserable bed , in a most wretched condition , and exhibiting such a spectacle of disease and wretchedness that he was shocked at beholding her .
she appeared , in fact , almost wholly bereft of reason .
when octavius came in , she suddenly leaped out of the bed , half naked as she was , and covered with bruises and wounds , and crawled miserably along to her conqueror 's feet in the attitude of a <unk> .
her hair was torn from her head , her limbs were swollen and disfigured , and great bandages appeared here and there , indicating that there were still worse injuries than these concealed .
from the midst of all this <unk> and misery there still beamed from her sunken eyes a great portion of their former beauty , and her voice still possessed the same inexpressible charm that had characterized it so strongly in the days of her prime .
octavius made her go back to her bed again and lie down .
<name> then began to talk and excuse herself for what she had done , attributing all the blame of her conduct to <name> .
octavius , however , interrupted her , and defended <name> from her <unk> , saying to her that it was not his fault so much as hers .
she then suddenly changed her tone , and acknowledging her sins , piteously implored <name> .
she begged octavius to pardon and spare her , as if now she were afraid of death and dreaded it , instead of desiring it as a boon .
in a word , her mind , the victim and the prey alternately of the most dissimilar and inconsistent passions , was now overcome by fear .
to propitiate octavius , she brought out a list of all her private treasures , and delivered it to him as a complete inventory of all that she had .
one of her <unk> , however , named <unk> , who was standing by , said to octavius that that list was not complete .
<name> had , he alleged , reserved several things of great value , which she had not put down upon it .
this assertion , thus suddenly exposing her <unk> , threw <name> into a violent rage .
she sprang from her bed and assaulted her secretary in a most furious manner .
octavius and the others who were here interposed , and compelled <name> to lie down again , which she did , uttering all the time the most grievous complaints at the wretched degradation to which she was reduced , to be insulted thus by her own servant at such a time .
if she had reserved any thing , she said , of her private treasures , it was only for presents to some of her faithful friends , to induce them the more zealously to <unk> with octavius in her behalf .
octavius replied by urging her to feel no concern on the subject whatever .
he freely gave her , he said , all that she had reserved , and he promised in other respects to treat her in the most honorable and courteous manner .
octavius was much pleased at the result of this interview .
it was obvious , as it appeared to him , that <name> had ceased to <name> to die ; that she now , on the contrary , wished to live , and that he should accordingly succeed in his <name> of taking her him to <name> his triumph at rome .
he accordingly made his arrangements for departure , and <name> was notified that in three days she was to set out , together with her children , to go into syria .
octavius said syria , as he did not wish to alarm <name> by speaking of rome .
she , however , understood well where the journey , if once commenced , would necessarily end , and she was fully determined in her own mind that she would never go there .
she asked to be allowed to pay one parting visit to <name> 's tomb .
this request was granted ; and she went to the tomb with a few attendants , carrying with her <unk> and garlands of flowers .
at the tomb her grief broke forth anew , and was as violent as ever .
she <unk> her lover 's death with loud cries and lamentations , uttered while she was placing the garlands upon the tomb , and offering the <unk> and incense , which were customary in those days , as expressions of grief .
" these , " said she , as she made the offerings , " are the last <unk> of affection that i can ever pay thee , my dearest , dearest lord .
i can not join thee , for i am a captive and a prisoner , and they <name> not let me die .
they watch me every hour , and are going to bear me far away , to exhibit me to thine enemies , as a badge and trophy of their triumph over thee .
oh <unk> , dearest <name> , with the gods where thou <name> now , since those that reign here on earth have utterly forsaken me ; implore them to save me from this fate , and let me die here in my native land , and be buried by thy side in this tomb . "
when <name> returned to her apartment again after this melancholy ceremony , she seemed to be more composed than she had been before .
she went to the bath , and then she attired herself handsomely for supper .
she had ordered supper that night to be very sumptuously served .
she was at <name> to make these arrangements , for the restrictions upon her movements , which had been imposed at first , were now removed , her appearance and demeanor having been for some time such as to lead octavius to suppose that there was no longer any danger that she would attempt <unk> .
her entertainment was arranged , therefore , according to her directions , in a manner corresponding with the customs of her court when she had been a <name> .
she had many attendants , and among them were two of her own women .
these women were <unk> and faithful servants and friends .
while she was at supper , a man tame to the door with a basket , and wished to enter .
the guards asked him what he had in his basket .
he opened it to let them see ; and , lifting up some green leaves which were laid over the top , he showed the soldiers that the basket was filled with figs .
he said that they were for <name> 's supper .
the soldiers admired the appearance of the figs , saying that they were very fine and beautiful .
the man asked the soldiers to take some of them .
this they declined , but allowed the man to pass in .
when the supper was ended , <name> sent all of her attendants away except the two women .
they remained .
after a little time , one of these women came out with a letter for octavius , which <name> had written , and which she wished to have immediately delivered .
one of the soldiers from the guard stationed at the gates was accordingly dispatched to <name> the letter .
octavius , when it was given to him , opened the envelope at once and read the letter , which was written , as was customary in those days , on a small tablet of metal .
he found that it was a brief but urgent petition from <name> , written evidently in agitation and excitement , praying that he would overlook her offense , and allow her to be buried with <name> .
octavius immediately inferred that she had destroyed herself .
he sent off some messengers at once , with orders to go directly to her place of confinement and ascertain the truth , intending to follow them himself immediately .
the messengers , on their arrival at the gates , found the sentinels and soldiers quietly on guard before the door , as if all were well .
on entering <name> 's room , however , they beheld a shocking spectacle .
<name> was lying dead upon a couch .
one of her women was upon the floor , dead too .
the other , whose name was <unk> , was sitting over the body of her mistress , fondly caressing her , arranging flowers in her hair , and adorning her <unk> .
the messengers of octavius , on witnessing this spectacle , were overcome with amazement , and demanded of <unk> what it could mean .
" it is all right , " said <unk> .
" <name> has acted in a manner worthy of a <name> descended from so <name> a line of kings . "
as <unk> said this , she began to sink herself , fainting , upon the bed , and almost immediately expired .
the by-standers were not only shocked at the spectacle which was thus presented before them , but they were perplexed and confounded in their attempts to discover by what means <name> and her women had succeeded in effecting their design .
they examined the bodies , but no marks of violence were to be discovered .
they looked all around the room , but no weapons , and no indication of any means of poison , were to be found .
they discovered something that appeared like the slimy track of an animal on the wall , toward a window , which they thought might have been produced by an <unk> ; but the reptile itself was nowhere to be seen .
they examined the body with great care , but no marks of any bite or sting were to be found , except that there were two very slight and scarcely discernible <unk> on the arm , which some persons fancied might have been so caused .
the means and manner of her death seemed to be involved in impenetrable mystery .
there were various rumors on the subject subsequently in circulation both at <name> and at rome , though the mystery was never fully solved .
some said that there was an <unk> concealed among the figs which the servant man brought in in the basket ; that he brought it in that manner , by a <unk> arrangement between him and <name> , and that , when she received it , she placed the creature on her arm .
others say that she had a small steel instrument like a needle , with a poisoned point , which she had kept concealed in her hair , and that she killed herself with that , without producing any visible wound .
another story was , that she had an <unk> in a box somewhere in her apartment , which she had reserved for this occasion , and when the time finally came , that she pricked and teased it with a golden <unk> to make it angry , and then placed it upon her flesh and received its sting .
which of these stones , if either of them , was true , could never be known .
it has , however , been generally believed among mankind that <name> died in some way or other by the <unk> sting of the <unk> , and paintings and sculptures without number have been made to illustrate and commemorate the scene .
this supposition in respect to the mode of her death is , in fact , confirmed by the action of octavius himself on his return to rome , which furnishes a strong indication of his opinion of the manner in which his captive at last eluded him .
disappointed in not being able to exhibit the <name> herself in his triumphal train , he caused a golden statue representing her to be made , with an image of an <unk> upon the arm of it , and this sculpture he caused to be borne conspicuously before him in his grand triumphal entry into the capital , as the token and trophy of the final downfall of the unhappy egyptian <name> .

preface .
one special object which the author of this series has had in view , in the plan and method which he has followed in the preparation of the successive volumes , has been to adapt them to the purposes of text-books in schools .
the study of a general <unk> of history , such as is frequently used as a text-book , is highly useful , if it comes in at the right stage of education , when the mind is sufficiently matured , and has acquired sufficient preliminary knowledge to understand and appreciate so condensed a generalization as a summary of the whole history of a nation contained in an ordinary volume must necessarily be .
without this degree of maturity of mind , and this preparation , the study of such a work <name> be , as it too frequently is , a mere mechanical committing to memory of names , and dates , and phrases , which awaken no interest , communicate no ideas , and impart no useful knowledge to the mind .
a class of ordinary pupils , who have not yet become much acquainted with history , would , accordingly , be more benefited by having their attention concentrated , at first , on detached and separate topics , such as those which form the subjects , respectively , of these volumes .
by studying thus fully the history of individual monarchs , or the narratives of single events , they can go more fully into detail ; they conceive of the transactions described as realities ; their reflecting and reasoning powers are occupied on what they read ; they take notice of the motives of conduct , of the gradual development of character , the good or ill desert of actions , and of the connection of causes and consequences , both in respect to the influence of wisdom and virtue on the one hand , and , on the other , of folly and crime .
in a word , their minds and hearts are occupied instead of merely their memories .
they reason , they sympathize , they pity , they approve , and they condemn .
they enjoy the real and true pleasure which constitutes the charm of historical study for minds that are mature ; and they acquire a taste for truth instead of fiction , which <name> tend to direct their reading into proper channels in all future years .
the use of these works , therefore , as text-books in classes , has been kept continually in mind in the preparation of them .
the running index on the tops of the pages is intended to serve instead of questions .
these <unk> can be used in their present form as topics , in respect to which , when announced in the class , the pupils are to repeat substantially what is said on the <name> ; or , on the other hand , questions in form , if that mode is preferred , can be readily framed from them by the teacher .
in all the volumes , a very regular system of division is observed , which <name> greatly facilitate the <unk> of lessons .

<name> was the founder of the ancient persian empire  a monarchy , perhaps , the most wealthy and magnificent which the world has ever seen .
of that strange and incomprehensible principle of human nature , under the influence of which vast masses of men , notwithstanding the universal instinct of aversion to control , combine , under certain circumstances , by millions and millions , to maintain , for many successive centuries , the representatives of some one great family in a condition of exalted , and absolute , and utterly irresponsible ascendency over themselves , while they toil for them , watch over them , submit to endless and most humiliating privations in their behalf , and commit , if commanded to do so , the most inexcusable and atrocious crimes to sustain the <unk> they have thus made in their lofty estate , we have , in the case of this persian monarchy , one of the most extraordinary exhibitions .
the persian monarchy appears , in fact , even as we look back upon it from this remote distance both of space and of time , as a very vast wave of human power and grandeur .
it swelled up among the populations of <name> , between the persian gulf and the caspian sea , about five hundred years before christ , and rolled on in undiminished magnitude and <name> for many centuries .
it bore upon its crest the <name> line of astyages and his successors .
<name> was , however , the first of the princes whom it held up conspicuously to the admiration of the world and he rode so gracefully and gallantly on the lofty crest that mankind have given him the credit of raising and sustaining the magnificent <unk> on which he was borne .
how far we are to consider him as founding the monarchy , or the monarchy as raising and illustrating him , <name> appear more fully in the course of this narrative .
<unk> with this persian monarchy in the east , there flourished in the west the small but very efficient and vigorous republics of greece .
the greeks had a written character for their language which could be easily and rapidly executed , while the ordinary language of the persians was scarcely written at all .
there was , it is true , in this latter nation , a certain learned character , which was used by the priests for their mystic records , and also for certain sacred books which constituted the only national archives .
it was , however , only slowly and with difficulty that this character could be penned , and , when penned , it was unintelligible to the great mass of the population .
for this reason , among others , the greeks wrote narratives of the great events which occurred in their day , which narratives they so embellished and adorned by the picturesque lights and shades in which their genius enabled them to present the scenes and characters described as to make them universally admired , while the surrounding nations produced nothing but formal governmental records , not worth to the community at large the toil and labor necessary to <unk> them and make them intelligible .
thus the greek writers became the historians , not only of their own republics , but also of all the nations around them ; and with such admirable genius and power did they fulfill this function , that , while the records of all other nations <unk> with them have been almost entirely neglected and forgotten , the language of the greeks has been preserved among mankind , with infinite labor and toil , by successive generations of scholars , in every civilized nation , for two thousand years , solely in order that men may continue to read these tales .
two greek historians have given us a narrative of the events connected with the life of <name>  herodotus and xenophon .
these writers disagree very materially in the statements which they make , and modern readers are divided in opinion on the question which to believe .
in order to present this question fairly to the minds of our readers , we must commence this volume with some account of these two authorities , whose guidance , conflicting as it is , furnishes all the light which we have to follow .
herodotus was a philosopher and scholar .
xenophon was a great general .
the one spent his life in solitary study , or in visiting various countries in the pursuit of knowledge ; the other distinguished himself in the command of armies , and in distant military expeditions , which he conducted with great energy and skill .
they were both , by birth , men of wealth and high station , so that they occupied , from the beginning , conspicuous positions in society ; and as they were both energetic and enterprising in character , they were led , each , to a very romantic and adventurous career , the one in his travels , the other in his campaigns , so that their personal history and their exploits attracted great attention even while they lived .
herodotus was born in the year 484 before christ , which was about fifty years after the death of the <name> whose history forms the subject of this volume .
he was born in the grecian state of <unk> , in <name> minor , and in the city of <unk> .
<unk> , as may be seen from the map at the commencement of this volume , was in the southwestern part of <name> minor , near the shores of the Ã¦gean sea .
herodotus became a student at a very early age .
it was the custom in greece , at that time , to give to young men of his rank a good intellectual education .
in other nations , the training of the young men , in wealthy and powerful families , was confined almost exclusively to the use of arms , to horsemanship , to athletic feats , and other such accomplishments as would give them a manly and graceful personal bearing , and enable them to excel in the various friendly contests of the public games , as well as prepare them to maintain their ground against their enemies in personal combats on the field of battle .
the greeks , without neglecting these things , taught their young men also to read and to write , explained to them the structure and the philosophy of language , and trained them to the study of the poets , the orators , and the historians which their country had produced .
thus a general taste for intellectual pursuits and pleasures was diffused throughout the community .
public affairs were discussed , before large audiences assembled for the purpose , by orators who felt a great pride and pleasure in the exercise of the power which they had acquired of persuading , convincing , or exciting the mighty masses that listened to them ; and at the great public celebrations which were customary in those days , in addition to the <unk> , the races , the games , and the military spectacles , there were certain literary entertainments provided , which constituted an essential part of the public pleasures .
tragedies were acted , poems recited , odes and <unk> <name> , and narratives of martial enterprises and exploits , and geographical and historical descriptions of neighboring nations , were read to vast throngs of listeners , who , having been accustomed from infancy to witness such performances , and to hear them applauded , had learned to appreciate and enjoy them .
of course , these literary exhibitions would make impressions , more or less strong , on different minds , as the mental temperaments and characters of individuals varied .
they seem to have exerted a very powerful influence on the mind of herodotus in his early years .
he was inspired , when very young , with a great zeal and ardor for the attainment of knowledge ; and as he advanced toward maturity , he began to be ambitious of making new discoveries , with a view of communicating to his countrymen , in these great public assemblies , what he should thus acquire .
accordingly , as soon as he arrived at a suitable age , he resolved to set out upon a tour into foreign countries , and to bring back a report of what he should see and hear .
the intercourse of nations was , in those days , mainly carried on over the waters of the mediterranean sea ; and in times of peace , almost the only mode of communication was by the ships and the caravans of the merchants who traded from country to country , both by sea and on the land .
in fact , the knowledge which one country possessed of the geography and the manners and customs of another , was almost wholly confined to the reports which these merchants circulated .
when military expeditions invaded a territory , the commanders , or the writers who accompanied them , often wrote descriptions of the scenes which they witnessed in their campaigns , and described briefly the countries through which they passed .
these cases were , however , comparatively rare ; and yet , when they occurred , they furnished accounts better authenticated , and more to be relied upon , and expressed , moreover , in a more systematic and regular form , than the reports of the merchants , though the information which was derived from both these sources combined was very insufficient , and tended to excite more curiosity than it gratified .
herodotus , therefore , conceived that , in thoroughly exploring the countries on the shores of the mediterranean and in the interior of <name> , examining their geographical position , inquiring into their history , their institutions , their manners , customs , and laws , and writing the results for the entertainment and instruction of his countrymen , he had an ample field before him for the exercise of all his powers .
he went first to egypt .
egypt had been until that time , closely shut up from the rest of mankind by the jealousy and watchfulness of the government .
but now , on account of some recent political changes , which <name> be hereafter more particularly alluded to , the way was opened for travelers from other countries to come in .
herodotus was the first to avail himself of this opportunity .
he spent some time in the country , and made himself minutely acquainted with its history , its antiquities , its political and social condition at the time of his visit , and with all the other points in respect to which he supposed that his countrymen would wish to be informed .
he took copious notes of all that he saw .
from egypt he went westward into <unk> , and thence he traveled slowly along the whole southern shore of the mediterranean sea as far as to the straits of gibraltar , noting , with great care , every thing which presented itself to his own personal observation , and <unk> himself of every possible source of information in respect to all other points of importance for the object which he had in view .
the straits of gibraltar were the ends of the earth toward the westward in those ancient days , and our traveler accordingly , after reaching them , returned again to the eastward .
he visited tyre , and the cities of <unk> , on the eastern coast of the mediterranean sea , and thence went still farther eastward to <unk> and babylon .
it was here that he obtained the materials for what he has written in respect to the medes and persians , and to the history of <name> .
after spending some time in these countries , he went on by land still further to the eastward , into the heart of <name> .
the country of <unk> was considered as at " the end of the earth " in this direction .
herodotus penetrated for some distance into the almost trackless wilds of this remote land , until he found that he had gone as far from the great center of light and power on the shores of the Ã¦gean sea as he could expect the curiosity of his countrymen to follow him .
he passed thence round toward the north , and came down through the countries north of the danube into greece , by way of the epirus and macedon .
to make such a journey as this was , in fact , in those days , almost to explore the whole known world .
it ought , however , here to be stated , that many modern scholars , who have examined , with great care , the accounts which herodotus has given of what he saw and heard in his wanderings , doubt very seriously whether his journeys were really as extended as he pretends .
as his object was to read what he was intending to write at great public assemblies in greece , he was , of course , under every possible inducement to make his narrative as interesting as possible , and not to <unk> at all from whatever there might be extraordinary either in the extent of his wanderings or in the <unk> of the objects and scenes which he saw , or in the romantic nature of the adventures which he met with in his protracted tour .
cicero , in <unk> him as a writer , says that he was the first who evinced the power to adorn a historical narrative .
between adorning and <unk> , the line is not to be very distinctly marked ; and herodotus has often been accused of having drawn more from his fancy than from any other source , in respect to a large portion of what he relates and describes .
some do not believe that he ever even entered half the countries which he professes to have thoroughly explored , while others find , in the minuteness of his specifications , something like conclusive proof that he related only what he actually saw .
in a word , the question of his <unk> has been discussed by successive generations of scholars ever since his day , and strong parties have been formed who have gone to extremes in the opinions they have taken ; so that , while some confer upon him the title of the father of history , others say it would be more in accordance with his merits to call him the father of lies .
in controversies like this , and , in fact , in all controversies , it is more agreeable to the mass of mankind to take sides strongly with one party or the other , and either to believe or disbelieve one or the other fully and cordially .
there is a class of minds , however , more calm and better balanced than the rest , who can deny themselves this pleasure , and who see that often , in the most bitter and decided controversies , the truth lies between .
by this class of minds it has been generally supposed that the narratives of herodotus are substantially true , though in many cases highly colored and embellished , or , as cicero called it , adorned , as , in fact , they inevitably must have been under the circumstances in which they were written .
we can not follow minutely the circumstances of the subsequent life of herodotus .
he became involved in some political disturbances and difficulties in his native state after his return , in consequence of which he retired , partly a fugitive and partly an exile , to the island of samos , which is at a little distance from <unk> , and not far from the shore .
here he lived for some time in seclusion , occupied in writing out his history .
he divided it into nine books , to which , respectively , the names of the nine muses were afterward given , to designate them .
the island of samos , where this great literary work was performed , is very near to <unk> , where , a few hundred years later , the <unk> <name> , in a similar retirement , and in the use of the same language and character , wrote the book of revelation .
when a few of the first books of his history were completed , herodotus went with the manuscript to <name> , at the great celebration of the <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> were periods recurring at intervals of about four years .
by means of them the greeks reckoned their time .
the <unk> were celebrated as they occurred , with games , shows , spectacles , and parades , which were conducted on so magnificent a scale that vast crowds were accustomed to assemble from every part of greece to witness and join in them .
they were held at <name> , a city on the western side of greece .
nothing now remains to <name> the spot but some acres of confused and unintelligible ruins .
the personal fame of herodotus and of his travels had preceded him , and when he arrived at <name> he found the curiosity and eagerness of the people to listen to his narratives extreme .
he read copious extracts from his accounts , so far as he had written them , to the vast assemblies which convened to hear him , and they were received with unbounded applause ; and inasmuch as these assemblies comprised nearly all the statesmen , the generals , the philosophers , and the scholars of greece , applause expressed by them became at once universal renown .
herodotus was greatly gratified at the interest which his countrymen took in his narratives , and he determined thenceforth to devote his time <unk> to the continuation and completion of his work .
it was twelve years , however , before his plan was finally accomplished .
he then repaired to athens , at the time of a grand festive celebration which was held in that city , and there he appeared in public again , and read extended portions of the additional books that he had written .
the admiration and applause which his work now elicited was even greater than before .
in deciding upon the passages to be read , herodotus selected such as would be most likely to excite the interest of his grecian hearers , and many of them were glowing accounts of grecian exploits in former wars which had been waged in the countries which he had visited .
to expect that , under such circumstances , herodotus should have made his history wholly impartial , would be to suppose the historian not human .
the athenians were greatly pleased with the narratives which herodotus thus read to them of their own and of their ancestors ' exploits .
they considered him a national benefactor for having made such a record of their deeds , and , in addition to the unbounded applause which they bestowed upon him , they made him a public <name> of a large sum of money .
during the remainder of his life herodotus continued to enjoy the high degree of literary renown which his writings had acquired for him  a renown which has since been extended and increased , rather than diminished , by the lapse of time .
as for xenophon , the other great historian of <name> , it has already been said that he was a military commander , and his life was accordingly spent in a very different manner from that of his great competitor for historic fame .
he was born at athens , about thirty years after the birth of herodotus , so that he was but a child while herodotus was in the midst of his career .
when he was about twenty-two years of age , he joined a celebrated military expedition which was formed in greece , for the purpose of proceeding to <name> minor to enter into the service of the governor of that country .
the name of this governor was <name> ; and to distinguish him from <name> the great , whose history is to form the subject of this volume , and who lived about one hundred and fifty years before him , he is commonly called <name> the younger .
this expedition was headed by a grecian general named <unk> .
the soldiers and the subordinate officers of the expedition did not know for what special service it was designed , as <name> had a treasonable and guilty object in view , and he kept it accordingly concealed , even from the agents who were to aid him in the execution of it .
his plan was to make war upon and <unk> his brother <unk> , then king of persia , and consequently his sovereign .
<name> was a very young man , but he was a man of a very energetic and accomplished character , and of unbounded ambition .
when his father died , it was arranged that <unk> , the older son , should succeed him .
<name> was extremely unwilling to submit to this supremacy of his brother .
his mother was an artful and unprincipled woman , and <name> , being the youngest of her children , was her favorite .
she encouraged him in his ambitious designs ; and so desperate was <name> himself in his determination to accomplish them , that it is said he attempted to assassinate his brother on the day of his coronation .
his attempt was discovered , and it failed .
his brother , however , instead of punishing him for the treason , had the generosity to pardon him , and sent him to his government in <name> minor .
<name> immediately turned all his thoughts to the plan of raising an army and making war upon his brother , in order to gain forcible possession of his throne .
that he might have a plausible pretext for making the necessary military preparations , he pretended to have a quarrel with one of his neighbors , and wrote , <unk> , many letters to the king , affecting solicitude for his safety , and asking aid .
the king was thus deceived , and made no preparations to resist the force which <name> was assembling , not having the remotest suspicion that its <name> was babylon .
the auxiliary army which came from greece to enter into <unk> service under these circumstances , consisted of about thirteen thousand men .
he had , it was said , a hundred thousand men besides ; but so celebrated were the greeks in those days for their courage , their discipline , their powers of endurance , and their indomitable tenacity and energy , that <name> very properly considered this corps as the flower of his army .
xenophon was one of the younger grecian generals .
the army crossed the hellespont , and entered <name> minor , and , passing across the country , reached at last the famous pass of <unk> , in the southwestern part of the country  a narrow defile between the mountains and the sea , which opens the only passage in that quarter toward the persian regions beyond .
here the suspicions which the greeks had been for some time inclined to feel , that they were going to make war upon the persian monarch himself , were confirmed , and they refused to proceed .
their unwillingness , however , did not arise from any <unk> of conscience about the guilt of treason , or the wickedness of helping an ungrateful and unprincipled wretch , whose forfeited life had once been given to him by his brother , in making war upon and destroying his benefactor .
soldiers have never , in any age of the world , any thing to do with <unk> of conscience in respect to the work which their commanders give them to perform .
the greeks were perfectly willing to serve in this or in any other undertaking ; but , since it was rebellion and treason that was asked of them , they considered it as specially hazardous , and so they concluded that they were entitled to extra pay .
<name> made no objection to this demand ; an arrangement was made accordingly , and the army went on .
<unk> assembled suddenly the whole force of his empire on the plains of babylon  an immense army , consisting , it is said , of over a million of men .
such vast forces occupy , necessarily , a wide extent of country , even when drawn up in battle array .
so great , in fact , was the extent occupied in this case , that the greeks , who conquered all that part of the king 's forces which was directly opposed to them , supposed , when night came , at the close of the day of battle , that <name> had been every where victorious ; and they were only <unk> when , the next day , messengers came from the persian camp to inform them that <name> 's whole force , excepting themselves , was defeated and dispersed , and that <name> himself was slain , and to summon them to surrender at once and unconditionally to the conquerors .
the greeks refused to surrender .
they formed themselves immediately into a compact and solid body , fortified themselves as well as they could in their position , and prepared for a desperate defense .
there were about ten thousand of them left , and the persians seem to have considered them too formidable to be attacked .
the persians entered into negotiations with them , offering them certain terms on which they would be allowed to return peaceably into greece .
these negotiations were protracted from day to day for two or three weeks , the persians treacherously using toward them a friendly tone , and evincing a disposition to treat them in a liberal and generous manner .
this threw the greeks off their guard , and finally the persians contrived to get <unk> and the leading greek generals into their power at a feast , and then they seized and murdered them , or , as they would perhaps term it , executed them as rebels and traitors .
when this was reported in the grecian camp , the whole army was thrown at first into the utmost consternation .
they found themselves two thousand miles from home , in the heart of a hostile country , with an enemy nearly a hundred times their own number close upon them , while they themselves were without provisions , without horses , without money ; and there were deep rivers , and rugged mountains , and every other possible physical obstacle to be surmounted , before they could reach their own frontiers .
if they surrendered to their enemies , a hopeless and most miserable slavery was their inevitable doom .
under these circumstances , xenophon , according to his own story , called together the surviving officers in the camp , urged them not to despair , and recommended that immediate measures should be taken for commencing a march toward greece .
he proposed that they should elect commanders to take the places of those who had been killed , and that , under their new organization , they should immediately set out on their return .
these plans were adopted .
he himself was chosen as the commanding general , and under his guidance the whole force was conducted safely through the countless difficulties and dangers which beset their way , though they had to defend themselves , at every step of their progress , from an enemy so vastly more numerous than they , and which was hanging on their flanks and on their rear , and making the most incessant efforts to surround and capture them .
this retreat occupied two hundred and fifteen days .
it has always been considered as one of the greatest military achievements that has ever been performed .
it is called in history the retreat of the ten thousand .
xenophon acquired by it a double immortality .
he led the army , and thus attained to a military renown which <name> never fade ; and he afterward wrote a narrative of the exploit , which has given him an equally extended and permanent literary fame .
some time after this , xenophon returned again to <name> as a military commander , and distinguished himself in other campaigns .
he acquired a large fortune , too , in these wars , and at length retired to a villa , which he built and adorned magnificently , in the neighborhood of <name> , where herodotus had acquired so extended a fame by reading his histories .
it was probably , in some degree , through the influence of the success which had attended the labors of herodotus in this field , that xenophon was induced to enter it .
he devoted the later years of his life to writing various historical memoirs , the two most important of which that have come down to modern times are , first , the narrative of his own expedition , under <name> the younger , and , secondly , a sort of romance or tale founded on the history of <name> the great .
this last is called the <unk> ; and it is from this work , and from the history written by herodotus , that nearly all our knowledge of the great persian monarch is derived .
the question how far the stories which herodotus and xenophon have told us in relating the history of the great persian king are true , is of less importance than one would at first imagine ; for the case is one of those numerous instances in which the narrative itself , which genius has written , has had far greater influence on mankind than the events themselves exerted which the narrative professes to record .
it is now far more important for us to know what the story is which has for eighteen hundred years been read and listened to by every generation of men , than what the actual events were in which the tale thus told had its origin .
this consideration applies very extensively to history , and especially to ancient history .
the events themselves have long since ceased to be of any great interest or importance to readers of the present day ; but the accounts , whether they are fictitious or real , partial or impartial , honestly true or embellished and colored , since they have been so widely circulated in every age and in every nation , and have impressed themselves so universally and so permanently in the mind and memory of the whole human race , and have penetrated into and colored the literature of every civilized people , it becomes now necessary that every well-informed man should understand .
in a word , the real <name> is now a far less important personage to mankind than the <name> of herodotus and xenophon , and it is , accordingly , their story which the author proposes to relate in this volume .
the reader <name> understand , therefore , that the end and aim of the work is not to guarantee an exact and certain account of <name> as he actually lived and acted , but only to give a true and faithful summary of the story which for the last two thousand years has been in circulation respecting him among mankind .

there are records coming down to us from the very earliest times of three several kingdoms situated in the heart of <unk> , media , and persia , the two latter of which , at the period when they first emerge indistinctly into view , were more or less connected with and dependent upon the former .
astyages was the king of media ; cambyses was the name of the ruling <name> or magistrate of persia .
cambyses married mandane , the daughter of astyages , and <name> was their son .
in <unk> the circumstances of his birth , herodotus relates , with all seriousness , the following very extraordinary story : while mandane was a maiden , living at her father 's palace and home in media , astyages awoke one morning terrified by a dream .
he had dreamed of a great inundation , which overwhelmed and destroyed his capital , and submerged a large part of his kingdom .
the great rivers of that country were liable to very destructive floods , and there would have been nothing extraordinary or alarming in the king 's imagination being haunted , during his sleep , by the image of such a calamity , were it not that , in this case , the deluge of water which produced such disastrous results seemed to be , in some mysterious way , connected with his daughter , so that the dream appeared to portend some great calamity which was to originate in her .
he thought it perhaps indicated that after her marriage she should have a son who would rebel against him and seize the supreme power , thus overwhelming his kingdom as the inundation had done which he had seen in his dream .
to guard against this imagined danger , astyages determined that his daughter should not be married in media , but that she should be provided with a husband in some foreign land , so as to be taken away from media altogether .
he finally selected cambyses , the king of persia , for her husband .
persia was at that time a comparatively small and circumscribed dominion , and cambyses , though he seems to have been the supreme ruler of it , was very far beneath astyages in rank and power .
the distance between the two countries was considerable , and the institutions and customs of the people of persia were simple and rude , little likely to awaken or encourage in the minds of their princes any treasonable or ambitious designs .
astyages thought , therefore , that in sending mandane there to be the wife of the king , he had taken effectual precautions to guard against the danger portended by his dream .
mandane was accordingly married , and conducted by her husband to her new home .
about a year afterward her father had another dream .
he dreamed that a vine proceeded from his daughter , and , growing rapidly and luxuriantly while he was regarding it , extended itself over the whole land .
now the vine being a symbol of <unk> and plenty , astyages might have considered this vision as an omen of good ; still , as it was good which was to be derived in some way from his daughter , it naturally awakened his fears anew that he was doomed to find a rival and competitor for the possession of his kingdom in <unk> son and heir .
he called together his soothsayers , related his dream to them , and asked for their interpretation .
they decided that it meant that mandane would have a son who would one day become a king .
astyages was now seriously alarmed , and he sent for mandane to come home , ostensibly because he wished her to pay a visit to her father and to her native land , but really for the purpose of having her in his power , that he might destroy her child so soon as one should be born .
mandane came to media , and was established by her father in a residence near his palace , and such officers and domestics were put in charge of her household as astyages could rely upon to do whatever he should command .
things being thus arranged , a few months passed away , and then mandane 's child was born .
immediately on hearing of the event , astyages sent for a certain officer of his court , an unscrupulous and hardened man , who possessed , as he supposed , enough of depraved and reckless resolution for the commission of any crime , and addressed him as follows : " i have sent for you , harpagus , to commit to your charge a business of very great importance .
i confide fully in your principles of obedience and fidelity , and depend upon your doing , yourself , with your own hands , the work that i require .
if you fail to do it , or if you attempt to evade it by putting it off upon others , you <name> suffer severely .
i wish you to take mandane 's child to your own house and put him to death .
you may accomplish the object in any mode you please , and you may arrange the circumstances of the burial of the body , or the disposal of it in any other way , as you think best ; the essential thing is , that you see to it , yourself , that the child is killed . "
harpagus replied that whatever the king might command it was his duty to do , and that , as his master had never hitherto had occasion to censure his conduct , he should not find him wanting now .
harpagus then went to receive the infant .
the attendants of mandane had been ordered to deliver it to him .
not at all suspecting the object for which the child was thus taken away , but naturally supposing , on the other hand , that it was for the purpose of some visit , they arrayed their unconscious charge in the most <unk> and costly of the robes which mandane , his mother , had for many months been interested in preparing for him , and then gave him up to the custody of harpagus , expecting , doubtless , that he would be very speedily returned to their care .
although harpagus had expressed a ready willingness to obey the cruel <unk> of the king at the time of receiving it , he manifested , as soon as he received the child , an extreme degree of anxiety and distress .
he immediately sent for a herdsman named <unk> to come to him .
in the mean time , he took the child home to his house , and in a very excited and agitated manner related to his wife what had passed .
he laid the child down in the apartment , leaving it neglected and alone , while he conversed with his wife in a harried and anxious manner in respect to the dreadful situation in which he found himself placed .
she asked him what he intended to do .
he replied that he certainly should not , himself , destroy the child .
" it is the son of mandane , " said he .
" she is the king 's daughter .
if the king should die , mandane would succeed him , and then what terrible danger would <unk> over me if she should know me to have been the slayer of her son ! "
harpagus said , moreover , that he did not dare absolutely to disobey the orders of the king so far as to save the child 's life , and that he had sent for a herdsman , whose pastures extended to wild and desolate forests and mountains  the gloomy haunts of wild beasts and birds of prey  intending to give the child to him , with orders to <name> it into those solitudes and abandon it there .
his name was <unk> .
while they were speaking this herdsman came in .
he found harpagus and his wife talking thus together , with countenances expressive of anxiety and distress , while the child , uneasy under the confinement and inconveniences of its splendid dress , and terrified at the strangeness of the scene and the circumstances around it , and perhaps , moreover , experiencing some dawning and embryo emotions of resentment at being laid down in neglect , cried aloud and incessantly .
harpagus gave the astonished herdsman his charge .
he , afraid , as harpagus had been in the presence of astyages , to evince any hesitation in respect to obeying the orders of his superior , whatever they might be , took up the child and bore it away .
he carried it to his hut .
it so happened that his wife , whose name was <unk> , had at that very time a new-born child , but it was dead .
her dead son had , in fact , been born during the absence of <unk> .
he had been extremely unwilling to leave his home at such a time , but the summons of harpagus must , he knew , be obeyed .
his wife , too , not knowing what could have occasioned so sudden and urgent a call , had to bear , all the day , a burden of anxiety and solicitude in respect to her husband , in addition to her disappointment and grief at the loss of her child .
her anxiety and grief were changed for a little time into astonishment and curiosity at seeing the beautiful babe , so magnificently dressed , which her husband brought to her , and at hearing his extraordinary story .
he said that when he first entered the house of harpagus and saw the child lying there , and heard the directions which harpagus gave him to <name> it into the mountains and leave it to die , he supposed that the babe belonged to some of the domestics of the household , and that harpagus wished to have it destroyed in order to be relieved of a burden .
the richness , however , of the infant 's dress , and the deep anxiety and sorrow which was indicated by the countenances and by the conversation of harpagus and his wife , and which seemed altogether too <name> to be excited by the concern which they would probably feel for any servant 's offspring , appeared at the time , he said , inconsistent with that supposition , and perplexed and bewildered him .
he said , moreover , that in the end , harpagus had sent a man with him a part of the way when he left the house , and that this man had given him a full explanation of the case .
the child was the son of mandane , the daughter of the king , and he was to be destroyed by the orders of astyages himself , for fear that at some future period he might attempt to usurp the throne .
they who know any thing of the feelings of a mother under the circumstances in which <unk> was placed , can imagine with what emotions she received the little sufferer , now nearly exhausted by <unk> , fatigue , and fear , from her husband 's hands , and the <unk> pleasure with which she <name> him to her bosom , to comfort and relieve him .
in an hour she was , as it were , herself his mother , and she began to plead hard with her husband for his life .
<unk> said that the child could not possibly be saved .
harpagus had been most <name> and positive in his orders , and he was coming himself to see that they had been executed .
he would demand , undoubtedly , to see the body of the child , to assure himself that it was actually dead .
<unk> , instead of being convinced by her husband's reasoning , only became more and more <name> in her desires that the child might be saved .
she rose from her couch and clasped her husband 's knees , and begged him with the most <name> entreaties and with many tears to <name> her request .
her husband was , however , inexorable .
he said that if he were to yield , and attempt to save the child from its doom , harpagus would most certainly know that his orders had been disobeyed , and then their own lives would be forfeited , and the child itself sacrificed after all , in the end .
the thought then occurred to <unk> that her own dead child might be substituted for the living one , and be exposed in the mountains in its stead .
she proposed this plan , and , after much anxious doubt and hesitation , the herdsman consented to adopt it .
they took off the splendid robes which adorned the living child , and put them on the corpse , each equally unconscious of the change .
the little limbs of the son of mandane were then more simply clothed in the coarse and scanty covering which belonged to the new character which he was now to assume , and then the babe was restored to its place in <unk> bosom .
<unk> placed his own dead child , completely disguised as it was by the <name> robes it wore , in the little basket or cradle in which the other had been brought , and , accompanied by an attendant , whom he was to leave in the forest to keep watch over the body , he went away to seek some wild and desolate solitude in which to leave it exposed .
[ illustration : the exposure of the infant . ]
three days passed away , during which the attendant whom the herdsman had left in the forest watched near the body to prevent its being devoured by wild beasts or birds of prey , and at the end of that time he brought it home .
the herdsman then went to harpagus to inform him that the child was dead , and , in proof that it was really so , he said that if harpagus would come to his hut he could see the body .
harpagus sent some messenger in whom he could confide to make the observation .
the herdsman exhibited the dead child to him , and he was satisfied .
he reported the result of his mission to harpagus , and harpagus then ordered the body to be buried .
the child of mandane , whom we may call <name> , since that was the name which he subsequently received , was brought up in the herdsman 's hut , and passed every where for <unk> child .
harpagus , after receiving the report of his messenger , then informed astyages that his orders had been executed , and that the child was dead .
a trusty messenger , he said , whom he had sent for the purpose , had seen the body .
although the king had been so <name> to have the deed performed , he found that , after all , the knowledge that his orders had been obeyed gave him very little satisfaction .
the fears , prompted by his selfishness and ambition , which had led him to commit the crime , gave place , when it had been perpetrated , to remorse for his unnatural cruelty .
mandane mourned incessantly the death of her innocent babe , and loaded her father with reproaches for having destroyed it , which he found it very hard to bear .
in the end , he repented bitterly of what he had done .
the secret of the child 's preservation remained concealed for about ten years .
it was then discovered in the following manner : <name> , like <name> , cÃ¦sar , <name> the conqueror , <name> , and other commanding minds , who obtained a great ascendancy over masses of men in their <unk> years , evinced his dawning superiority at a very early period of his boyhood .
he took the lead of his playmates in their sports , and made them submit to his regulations and decisions .
not only did the peasants ' boys in the little hamlet where his reputed father lived thus yield the precedence to him , but sometimes , when the sons of men of rank and station came out from the city to join them in their plays , even then <name> was the acknowledged head .
one day the son of an officer of king astyages 's court  his father 's name was <unk>  came out , with other boys from the city , to join these village boys in their sports .
they were playing king .
<name> was the king .
herodotus says that the other boys chose him as such .
it was , however , probably such a sort of choice as that by which kings and emperors are made among men , a yielding more or less voluntary on the part of the subjects to the resolute and determined energy with which the <unk> places himself upon the throne .
during the progress of the play , a quarrel arose between <name> and the son of <unk> .
the latter would not obey , and <name> beat him .
he went home and complained bitterly to his father .
the father went to astyages to protest against such an indignity offered to his son by a peasant boy , and demanded that the little tyrant should be punished .
probably far the larger portion of intelligent readers of history consider the whole story as a romance ; but if we look upon it as in any respect true , we must conclude that the median monarchy must have been , at that time , in a very rude and simple condition indeed , to allow of the submission of such a question as this to the personal <unk> of the reigning king .
however this may be , herodotus states that <unk> went to the palace of astyages , taking his son with him , to offer proofs of the violence of which the herdsman 's son had been guilty , by showing the <unk> and bruises that had been produced by the blows .
" is this the treatment , " he asked , indignantly , of the king , when he had completed his statement , " that my boy is to receive from the son of one of your slaves ? "
astyages seemed to be convinced that <unk> had just cause to complain , and he sent for <unk> and his son to come to him in the city .
when they arrived , <name> advanced into the presence of the king with that courageous and manly bearing which romance writers are so fond of <unk> to boys of <name> birth , whatever may have been the circumstances of their early training .
astyages was much struck with his appearance and air .
he , however , sternly laid to his charge the accusation which <unk> had brought against him .
pointing to <unk> 's son , all bruised and swollen as he was , he asked , " is that the way that you , a mere herdsman 's boy , dare to treat the son of one of my nobles ? "
the little <name> looked up into his stern judge 's face with an undaunted expression of countenance , which , considering the circumstances of the case , and the smallness of the scale on which this embryo heroism was represented , was partly ludicrous and partly sublime .
" my lord , " said he , " what i have done i am able to justify .
i did punish this boy , and i had a right to do so .
i was king , and he was my subject , and he would not obey me .
if you think that for this i deserve punishment myself , here i am ; i am ready to suffer it . "
if astyages had been struck with the appearance and manner of <name> at the commencement of the interview , his admiration was awakened far more strongly now , at hearing such words , uttered , too , in so exalted a tone , from such a child .
he remained a long time silent .
at last he told <unk> and his son that they might retire .
he would take the affair , he said , into his own hands , and dispose of it in a just and proper manner .
astyages then took the herdsman aside , and asked him , in an <name> tone , whose boy that was , and where he had obtained him .
<unk> was terrified .
he replied , however , that the boy was his own son , and that his mother was still living at home , in the hut where they all resided .
there seems to have been something , however , in his appearance and manner , while making these assertions , which led astyages not to believe what he said .
he was convinced that there was some unexplained mystery in respect to the origin of the boy , which the herdsman was <unk> withholding .
he assumed a displeased and threatening air , and ordered in his guards to take <unk> into custody .
the terrified herdsman then said that he would explain all , and he accordingly related honestly the whole story .
astyages was greatly rejoiced to find that the child was alive .
one would suppose it to be almost inconsistent with this feeling that he should be angry with harpagus for not having destroyed it .
it would seem , in fact , that harpagus was not amenable to serious censure , in any view of the subject , for he had taken what he had a right to consider very effectual measures for carrying the orders of the king into faithful execution .
but astyages seems to have been one of those inhuman monsters which the possession and long-continued exercise of despotic power have so often made , who take a calm , quiet , and deliberate satisfaction in torturing to death any wretched victim whom they can have any pretext for destroying , especially if they can invent some new means of torment to give a fresh <unk> to their pleasure .
these monsters do not act from passion .
men are sometimes inclined to <unk> great cruelties and crimes which are perpetrated under the influence of sudden anger , or from the terrible impulse of those impetuous and uncontrollable emotions of the human soul which , when once excited , seem to make men insane ; but the crimes of a tyrant are not of this kind .
they are the calm , deliberate , and sometimes carefully <unk> <unk> of a nature essentially <unk> .
when , therefore , astyages learned that harpagus had failed of literally obeying his command to destroy , with his own hand , the infant which had been given him , although he was pleased with the consequences which had resulted from it , he immediately perceived that there was another pleasure besides that he was to derive from the transaction , namely , that of gratifying his own imperious and ungovernable <name> by taking vengeance on him who had failed , even in so slight a degree , of fulfilling its dictates .
in a word , he was glad that the child was saved , but he did not consider that that was any reason why he should not have the pleasure of punishing the man who saved him .
thus , far from being transported by any sudden and violent feeling of resentment to an inconsiderate act of revenge , astyages began , calmly and coolly , and with a deliberate malignity more worthy of a demon than of a man , to consider how he could best accomplish the purpose he had in view .
when , at length , his plan was formed , he sent for harpagus to come to him .
harpagus came .
the king began the conversation by asking harpagus what method he had employed for destroying the child of mandane , which he , the king , had delivered to him some years before .
harpagus replied by stating the exact truth .
he said that , as soon as he had received the infant , he began immediately to consider by what means he could effect its destruction without involving himself in the guilt of murder ; that , finally , he had determined upon employing the herdsman <unk> to expose it in the forest till it should perish of hunger and cold ; and , in order to be sure that the king 's <unk> was fully obeyed , he charged the herdsman , he said , to keep strict watch near the child till it was dead , and then to bring home the body .
he had then sent a confidential messenger from his own household to see the body and provide for its interment .
he solemnly assured the king , in conclusion , that this was the real truth , and that the child was actually destroyed in the manner he had described .
the king then , with an appearance of great satisfaction and pleasure , informed harpagus that the child had not been destroyed after all , and he related to him the circumstances of its having been exchanged for the dead child of <unk> , and brought up in the herdsman 's hut .
he informed him , too , of the singular manner in which the fact that the infant had been preserved , and was still alive , had been discovered .
he told harpagus , moreover , that he was greatly rejoiced at this discovery .
" after he was dead , as i supposed , " said he , " i bitterly repented of having given orders to destroy him .
i could not bear my daughter 's grief , or the reproaches which she incessantly uttered against me .
but the child is alive , and all is well ; and i am going to give a grand entertainment as a festival of rejoicing on the occasion . "
astyages then requested harpagus to send his son , who was about thirteen years of age , to the palace , to be a companion to <name> , and , inviting him very specially to come to the entertainment , he dismissed him with many marks of attention and honor .
harpagus went home , trembling at the thought of the imminent danger which he had incurred , and of the narrow escape by which he had been saved from it .
he called his son , directed him to prepare himself to go to the king , and dismissed him with many charges in respect to his behavior , both toward the king and toward <name> .
he related to his wife the conversation which had taken place between himself and astyages , and she rejoiced with him in the apparently happy issue of an affair which might well have been expected to have been their ruin .
the sequel of the story is too horrible to be told , and yet too essential to a right understanding of the influences and effects produced on human nature by the possession and exercise of despotic and irresponsible power to be omitted .
harpagus came to the festival .
it was a grand entertainment .
harpagus was placed in a conspicuous position at the table .
a great variety of dishes were brought in and set before the different guests , and were eaten without question .
toward the close of the feast , astyages asked harpagus what he thought of his fare .
harpagus , half terrified with some mysterious presentiment of danger , expressed himself well pleased with it .
astyages then told him there was plenty more of the same kind , and ordered the attendants to bring the basket in .
they came accordingly , and uncovered a basket before the wretched guest , which contained , as he saw when he looked into it , the head , and hands , and feet of his son .
astyages asked him to help himself to whatever part he liked !
the most astonishing part of the story is yet to be told .
it relates to the action of harpagus in such an emergency .
he looked as composed and placid as if nothing unusual had occurred .
the king asked him if he knew what he had been eating .
he said that he did ; and that whatever was agreeable to the <name> of the king was always pleasing to him ! !
it is hard to say whether despotic power exerts its worst and most <unk> influences on those who wield it , or on those who have it to bear ; on its masters , or on its slaves .
after the first feelings of pleasure which astyages experienced in being relieved from the sense of guilt which oppressed his mind so long as he supposed that his orders for the murder of his infant grandchild had been obeyed , his former uneasiness lest the child should in future years become his rival and competitor for the possession of the median throne , which had been the motive originally <unk> him to the commission of the crime , returned in some measure again , and he began to consider whether it was not incumbent on him to take some measures to guard against such a result .
the end of his deliberations was , that he concluded to send for the magi , or soothsayers , as he had done in the case of his dream , and obtain their judgment on the affair in the new aspect which it had now assumed .
when the magi had heard the king 's narrative of the circumstances under which the discovery of the child 's preservation had been made , through complaints which had been preferred against him on account of the manner in which he had exercised the prerogatives of a king among his playmates , they decided at once that astyages had no cause for any further apprehensions in respect to the dreams which had disturbed him previous to his grandchild 's birth .
" he has been a king , " they said , " and the danger is over .
it is true that he has been a monarch only in play , but that is enough to satisfy and fulfill the <unk> of the vision .
occurrences very slight and trifling in themselves are often found to accomplish what seemed of very serious magnitude and moment , as portended .
your grandchild has been a king , and he <name> never reign again .
you have , therefore , no further cause to fear , and may send him to his parents in persia with perfect safety . "
the king determined to adopt this advice .
he ordered the soothsayers , however , not to <unk> their <unk> and vigilance , and if any signs or omens should appear to indicate approaching danger , he charged them to give him immediate warning .
this they faithfully promised to do .
they felt , they said , a personal interest in doing it ; for <name> being a persian <name> , his accession to the median throne would involve the subjection of the medes to the persian dominion , a result which they wished in every account to avoid .
so , promising to watch <unk> for every indication of danger , they left the presence of the king .
the king then sent for <name> .
it seems that <name> , though astonished at the great and mysterious changes which had taken place in his condition , was still ignorant of his true history .
astyages now told him that he was to go into persia .
" you <name> rejoin there , " said he , " your true parents , who , you <name> find , are of very different rank in life from the herdsman whom you have lived with thus far .
you <name> make the journey under the charge and escort of persons that i have appointed for the purpose .
they <name> explain to you , on the way , the mystery in which your parentage and birth seems to you at present enveloped .
you <name> find that i was induced many years ago , by the influence of an untoward dream , to treat you injuriously .
but all has ended well , and you can now go in peace to your proper home . "
as soon as the preparations for the journey could be made , <name> set out , under the care of the party appointed to conduct him , and went to persia .
his parents were at first dumb with astonishment , and were then overwhelmed with gladness and <name> at seeing their <unk> and long-lost babe reappear , as if from the dead , in the form of this tall and handsome boy , with health , intelligence , and happiness beaming in his countenance .
they overwhelmed him with caresses , and the heart of mandane , especially , was filled with pride and pleasure .
as soon as <name> became somewhat settled in his new home , his parents began to make arrangements for giving him as complete an education as the means and opportunities of those days afforded .
xenophon , in his narrative of the early life of <name> , gives a minute , and , in some respects , quite an extraordinary account of the mode of life led in cambyses 's court .
the sons of all the nobles and officers of the court were educated together , within the precincts of the <name> palaces , or , rather , they spent their time together there , occupied in various pursuits and avocations , which were intended to train them for the duties of future life , though there was very little of what would be considered , in modern times , as education .
they were not generally taught to read , nor could they , in fact , since there were no books , have used that <name> if they had acquired it .
the only intellectual instruction which they seem to have received was what was called learning justice .
the boys had certain teachers , who explained to them , more or less formally , the general principles of right and wrong , the injunctions and <unk> of the laws , and the obligations resulting from them , and the rules by which controversies between man and man , arising in the various relations of life , should be settled .
the boys were also trained to apply these principles and rules to the cases which occurred among themselves , each acting as judge in turn , to discuss and decide the questions that arose from time to time , either from real transactions as they occurred , or from hypothetical cases invented to put their powers to the test .
to stimulate the exercise of their powers , they were rewarded when they decided right , and punished when they decided wrong .
<name> himself was punished on one occasion for a wrong decision , under the following circumstances : a bigger boy took away the coat of a smaller boy than himself , because it was larger than his own , and gave him his own smaller coat instead .
the smaller boy complained of the wrong , and the case was referred to <name> for his <unk> .
after hearing the case , <name> decided that each boy should keep the coat that fitted him .
the teacher condemned this as a very unjust decision .
" when you are called upon , " said he , " to consider a question of what fits best , then you should determine as you have done in this case ; but when you are appointed to decide whose each coat is , and to <unk> it to the proper owner , then you are to consider what constitutes right possession , and whether he who takes a thing by force from one who is weaker than himself , should have it , or whether he who made it or purchased it should be protected in his property .
you have decided against law , and in favor of violence and wrong . "
<name> 's sentence was thus condemned , and he was punished for not reasoning more soundly .
the boys at this persian court were trained to many manly exercises .
they were taught to wrestle and to run .
they were instructed in the use of such arms as were employed in those times , and rendered dexterous in the use of them by daily exercises .
they were taught to put their skill in practice , too , in hunting excursions , which they took , by turns , with the king , in the neighboring forest and mountains .
on these occasions , they were armed with a bow , and a quiver of arrows , a shield , a small sword or dagger which was worn at the side in a sort of scabbard , and two javelins .
one of these was intended to be thrown , the other to be retained in the hand , for use in close combat , in case the wild beast , in his desperation , should advance to a personal <unk> .
these hunting expeditions were considered extremely important as a part of the system of youthful training .
they were often long and fatiguing .
the young men became inured , by means of them , to toil , and privation , and exposure .
they had to make long marches , to encounter great dangers , to engage in desperate conflicts , and to submit sometimes to the inconveniences of hunger and thirst , as well as exposure to the extremes of heat and cold , and to the violence of storms .
all this was considered as precisely the right sort of discipline to make them good soldiers in their future martial campaigns .
<name> was not , himself , at this time , old enough to take a very active part in these severer services , as they belonged to a somewhat advanced stage of persian education , and he was yet not quite twelve years old .
he was a very beautiful boy , tall and graceful in form and his countenance was striking and expressive .
he was very <name> and open in his disposition and character , speaking honestly , and without fear , the sentiments of his heart , in any presence and on all occasions .
he was extremely kind hearted , and amiable , too , in his disposition , averse to saying or doing any thing which could give pain to those around him .
in fact , the <unk> and cordiality of his address and manners , and the unaffected <unk> and sincerity which characterized his disposition , made him a universal favorite .
his frankness , his childish simplicity , his vivacity , his personal <name> and beauty , and his generous and self-sacrificing spirit , rendered him the object of general admiration throughout the court , and filled mandane 's heart with maternal gladness and pride .

when <name> was about twelve years old , if the narrative which xenophon gives of his history is true , he was invited by his grandfather astyages to make a visit to media .
as he was about ten years of age , according to herodotus , when he was restored to his parents , he could have been residing only two years in persia when he received this invitation .
during this period , astyages had received , through mandane and others , very glowing descriptions of the intelligence and vivacity of the young <name> , and he naturally felt a <name> to see him once more .
in fact , <name> 's personal attractiveness and beauty , joined to a certain <name> and <name> generosity of spirit which he seems to have manifested in his earliest years , made him a universal favorite at home , and the reports of these qualities , and of the various sayings and doings on <name> 's part , by which his disposition and character were revealed , awakened strongly in the mind of astyages that kind of interest which a grandfather is always very prone to feel in a handsome and precocious grandchild .
as <name> had been sent to persia as soon as his true rank had been discovered , he had had no opportunities of seeing the splendor of <name> life in media , and the manners and habits of the persians were very plain and simple .
<name> was accordingly very much impressed with the magnificence of the scenes to which he was introduced when he arrived in media , and with the <unk> and luxuries , the pomp and display , and the spectacles and parades in which the median court abounded .
astyages himself took great pleasure in witnessing and increasing his little grandson 's admiration for these wonders .
it is one of the most extraordinary and beautiful of the provisions which god has made for securing the continuance of human happiness to the very end of life , that we can renew , through sympathy with children , the pleasures which , for ourselves alone , had long since , through repetition and <unk> , lost their charm .
the rides , the walks , the flowers gathered by the road-side , the rambles among pebbles on the beach , the songs , the games , and even the little picture-book of childish tales which have utterly and entirely lost their power to affect the mind even of middle life , directly and alone , regain their magic influence , and call up vividly all the old emotions , even to the heart of <unk> age , when it seeks these enjoyments in companionship and sympathy with children or grandchildren beloved .
by giving to us this capacity for renewing our own sensitiveness to the impressions of pleasure through sympathy with childhood , god has provided a true and effectual remedy for the <unk> and insensibility of age .
let any one who is in the decline of years , whose time passes but heavily away , and who supposes that nothing can awaken interest in his mind or give him pleasure , make the experiment of taking children to a ride or to a concert , or to see a menagerie or a museum , and he <name> find that there is a way by which he can again enjoy very highly the pleasures which he had supposed were for him forever exhausted and gone .
this was the result , at all events , in the case of astyages and <name> .
the monarch took a new pleasure in the luxuries and splendors which had long since lost their charm for him , in observing their influence and effect upon the mind of his little grandson .
<name> , as we have already said , was very <name> and open in his disposition , and spoke with the utmost freedom of every thing that he saw .
he was , of course , a privileged person , and could always say what the feeling of the moment and his own childish conceptions prompted , without danger .
he had , however , according to the account which xenophon gives , a great deal of good sense , as well as of <unk> and brilliancy ; so that , while his remarks , through their originality and point , attracted every one 's attention , there was a native politeness and sense of propriety which restrained him from saying any thing to give pain .
even when he disapproved of and condemned what he saw in the arrangements of his grandfather 's court or household , he did it in such a manner  so ingenuous , good-natured , and unassuming , that it amused all and offended none .
in fact , on the very first interview which astyages had with <name> , an instance of the boy 's readiness and tact occurred , which impressed his grandfather very much in his favor .
the persians , as has been already remarked , were accustomed to dress very plainly , while , on the other hand , at the median court the superior officers , and especially the king , were always very splendidly adorned .
accordingly , when <name> was introduced into his grandfather 's presence , he was quite dazzled with the display .
the king wore a purple robe , very richly adorned , with a belt and collars , which were embroidered highly , and set with precious stones .
he had bracelets , too , upon his wrists , of the most costly character .
he wore flowing locks of artificial hair , and his face was painted , after the median manner .
<name> gazed upon this <name> spectacle for a few moments in silence , and then exclaimed , " why , mother !
what a handsome man my grandfather is ! "
such an exclamation , of course , made great amusement both for the king himself and for the others who were present ; and at length mandane , somewhat <unk> , it must be confessed , asked <name> which of the two he thought the handsomest , his father or his grandfather .
<name> escaped from the danger of deciding such a formidable question by saying that his father was the handsomest man in persia , but his grandfather was the handsomest of all the medes he had ever seen .
astyages was even more pleased by this proof of his <unk> adroitness and good sense than he had been with the compliment which the boy had paid to him ; and thenceforward <name> became an established favorite , and did and said , in his grandfather 's presence , almost whatever he pleased .
when the first childish feelings of excitement and curiosity had subsided , <name> seemed to attach very little value to the fine clothes and <name> trappings with which his grandfather was disposed to adorn him , and to all the other external marks of parade and display , which were generally so much prized among the medes .
he was much more inclined to continue in his former habits of plain dress and frugal means than to imitate median ostentation and luxury .
there was one pleasure , however , to be found in media , which in persia he had never enjoyed , that he prized very highly .
that was the pleasure of learning to ride on horseback .
the persians , it seems , either because their country was a rough and mountainous region , or for some other cause , were very little accustomed to ride .
they had very few horses , and there were no bodies of cavalry in their armies .
the young men , therefore , were not trained to the <name> of horsemanship .
even in their hunting excursions they went always on foot , and were accustomed to make long marches through the forests and among the mountains in this manner , loaded heavily , too , all the time , with the burden of arms and provisions which they were obliged to <name> .
it was , therefore , a new pleasure to <name> to mount a horse .
horsemanship was a great <name> among the medes .
their horses were beautiful and fleet , and splendidly caparisoned .
astyages provided for <name> the best animals which could be procured , and the boy was very proud and happy in exercising himself in the new accomplishment which he thus had the opportunity to acquire .
to ride is always a great source of pleasure to boys ; but in that period of the world , when physical strength was so much more important and more highly valued than at present , horsemanship was a vastly greater source of gratification than it is now .
<name> felt that he had , at a single leap , <unk> his power , and thus risen at once to a far higher rank in the scale of being than he had occupied before ; for , as soon as he had once learned to be at home in the saddle , and to subject the spirit and the power of his horse to his own <name> , the courage , the strength , and the speed of the animal became , in fact , almost personal <unk> of his own .
he felt , accordingly , when he was galloping over the plains , or pursuing deer in the park , or running over the <unk> with his companions , as if it was some <unk> strength and speed of his own that he was exercising , and which , by some magic power , was attended by no <unk> exertion , and followed by no fatigue .
the various officers and servants in astyages 's household , as well as astyages himself , soon began to feel a strong interest in the young <name> .
each took a pleasure in explaining to him what pertained to their several departments , and in teaching him whatever he desired to learn .
the attendant highest in rank in such a household was the cup-bearer .
he had the charge of the tables and the wine , and all the general arrangements of the palace seem to have been under his direction .
the cup-bearer in astyages 's court was a sacian .
he was , however , less a friend to <name> than the rest .
there was nothing within the range of his official duties that he could teach the boy ; and <name> did not like his wine .
besides , when astyages was engaged , it was the cup-bearer 's duty to guard him from interruption , and at such times he often had occasion to restrain the young <name> from the <name> of entering his grandfather 's apartments as often as he pleased .
at one of the entertainments which astyages gave in his palace , <name> and mandane were invited ; and astyages , in order to gratify the young <name> as highly as possible , set before him a great variety of dishes  meats , and <unk> , and delicacies of every kind  all served in costly vessels , and with great parade and ceremony .
he supposed that <name> would have been <unk> with the luxury and splendor of the entertainment .
he did not , however , seem much pleased .
astyages asked him the reason , and whether the feast which he saw before him was not a much finer one than he had been accustomed to see in persia .
<name> said , in reply , that it seemed to him to be very troublesome to have to eat a little of so many separate things .
in persia they managed , he thought , a great deal better .
" and how do you manage in persia ? "
asked astyages .
" why , in persia , " replied <name> , " we have plain bread and meat , and eat it when we are hungry ; so we get health and strength , and have very little trouble . "
astyages laughed at this simplicity , and told <name> that he might , if he preferred it , live on plain bread and meat while he remained in media , and then he would return to persia in as good health as he came .
<name> was satisfied ; he , however , asked his grandfather if he would give him all those things which had been set before him , to dispose of as he thought proper ; and on his grandfather 's <unk> , he began to call the various attendants up to the table , and to distribute the costly dishes to them , in return , as he said , for their various kindnesses to him .
" this , " said he to one , " is for you , because you take pains to teach me to ride ; this , " to another , " for you , because you gave me a javelin ; this to you , because you serve my grandfather well and faithfully ; and this to you , because you honor my mother . "
thus he went on until he had distributed all that he had received , though he omitted , as it seemed <unk> , to give any thing to the sacian cup-bearer .
this sacian being an officer of high rank , of tall and handsome figure , and beautifully dressed , was the most conspicuous attendant at the feast , and could not , therefore , have been accidentally passed by .
astyages accordingly asked <name> why he had not given any thing to the sacian  the servant whom , as he said , he liked better than all the others .
" and what is the reason , " asked <name> , in reply , " that this sacian is such a favorite with you ? "
" have you not observed , " replied astyages , " how gracefully and elegantly he pours out the wine for me , and then hands me the cup ? "
the sacian was , in fact , uncommonly accomplished in respect to the personal <name> and dexterity for which <unk> in those days were most highly valued , and which constitute , in fact , so essential a part of the qualifications of a master of ceremonies at a <name> court in every age .
<name> , however , instead of yielding to this argument , said , in reply , that he could come into the room and pour out the wine as well as the sacian could do it , and he asked his grandfather to allow him to try .
astyages consented .
<name> then took the <unk> of wine , and went out .
in a moment he came in again , stepping grandly , as he entered , in mimicry of the sacian , and with a countenance of assumed gravity and <unk> , which imitated so well the air and manner of the cup-bearer as greatly to amuse the whole company assembled .
<name> advanced thus toward the king and presented him with the cup , imitating , with the <name> and dexterity natural to childhood , all the ceremonies which he had seen the cup-bearer himself perform , except that of tasting the wine .
the king and mandane laughed heartily .
<name> then , throwing off his assumed character , jumped up into his grandfather 's lap and kissed him , and turning to the cup-bearer , he said , " now , sacian , you are ruined .
i shall get my grandfather to appoint me in your place .
i can hand the wine as well as you , and without tasting it myself at all . "
" but why did you not taste it ? "
asked astyages ; " you should have performed that part of the duty as well as the rest . "
it was , in fact , a very essential part of the duty of a cup-bearer to taste the wine that he offered before presenting it to the king .
he did this , however , not by putting the cup to his lips , but by pouring out a little of it into the palm of his hand .
this custom was adopted by these ancient despots to guard against the danger of being poisoned ; for such a danger would of course be very much diminished by requiring the officer who had the custody of the wine , and without whose knowledge no foreign substance could well be introduced into it , always to drink a portion of it himself immediately before <unk> it to the king .
to astyages 's question why he had not tasted the wine , <name> replied that he was afraid it was poisoned .
" what led you to imagine that it was poisoned ? "
asked his grandfather .
" because , " said <name> , " it was poisoned the other day , when you made a feast for your friends , on your <unk> .
i knew by the effects .
it made you all crazy .
the things that you do not allow us boys to do , you did yourselves , for you were very rude and noisy ; you all bawled together , so that nobody could hear or understand what any other person said .
presently you went to singing in a very ridiculous manner , and when a singer ended his song , you applauded him , and declared that he had <name> admirably , though nobody had paid attention .
you went to telling stories , too , each one of his own accord , without succeeding in making any body listen to him .
finally , you got up and began to dance , but it was out of all rule and measure ; you could not even stand erect and steadily .
then , you all seemed to forget who and what you were .
the guests paid no regard to you as their king , but treated you in a very familiar and disrespectful manner , and you treated them in the same way ; so i thought that the wine that produced these effects must have been poisoned . "
of course , <name> did not seriously mean that he thought the wine had been actually poisoned .
he was old enough to understand its nature and effects .
he undoubtedly intended his reply as a playful satire upon the intemperate excesses of his grandfather 's court .
" but have not you ever seen such things before ? "
asked astyages .
" does not your father ever drink wine until it makes him <name> ? "
" no , " replied <name> , " indeed he does not .
he drinks only when he is thirsty , and then only enough for his thirst , and so he is not harmed . "
he then added , in a contemptuous tone , " he has no sacian cup-bearer , you may depend , about him . "
" what is the reason , my son , " here asked mandane , " why you dislike this sacian so much ? "
" why , every time that i want to come and see my grandfather , " replied <name> , " this <unk> man always stops me , and <name> not let me come in .
i wish , grandfather , you would let me have the rule over him just for three days . "
" why , what would you do to him ? "
asked astyages .
" i would treat him as he treats me now , " replied <name> .
" i would stand at the door , as he does when i want to come in , and when he was coming for his dinner , i would stop him and say , 'you can not come in now ; he is busy with some men . ' "
in saying this , <name> imitated , in a very ludicrous manner , the gravity and dignity of the sacian 's air and manner .
" then , " he continued , " when he came to supper , i would say , 'he is bathing now ; you must come some other time ; ' or else , 'he is going to sleep , and you <name> disturb him . '
so i would torment him all the time , as he now torments me , in keeping me out when i want to come and see you . "
such conversation as this , half playful , half <name> , of course amused astyages and mandane very much , as well as all the other listeners .
there is a certain charm in the simplicity and confiding frankness of childhood , when it is honest and sincere , which in <name> 's case was heightened by his personal <name> and beauty .
he became , in fact , more and more a favorite the longer he remained .
at length , the indulgence and the attentions which he received began to produce , in some degree , their usual injurious effects .
<name> became too talkative , and sometimes he appeared a little vain .
still , there was so much true kindness of heart , such consideration for the feelings of others , and so respectful a regard for his grandfather , his mother , and his uncle , [ a ] that his faults were overlooked , and he was the life and soul of the company in all the social gatherings which took place in the palaces of the king .
[ footnote a : the uncle here referred to was mandane 's brother .
his name was <unk> .
he was at this time a <name> <name> , the heir apparent to the throne .
he figures very conspicuously in the subsequent portions of xenophon 's history as astyages 's successor on the throne .
herodotus does not mention him at all , but makes <name> himself the direct successor of astyages . ]
at length the time arrived for mandane to return to persia .
astyages proposed that she should leave <name> in media , to be educated there under his grandfather 's charge .
mandane replied that she was willing to gratify her father in every thing , but she thought it would be very hard to leave <name> behind , unless he was willing , of his own accord , to stay .
astyages then proposed the subject to <name> himself .
" if you <name> stay , " said he , " the sacian shall no longer have power to keep you from coming in to see me ; you shall come whenever you choose .
then , besides , you shall have the use of all my horses , and of as many more as you please , and when you go home at last you shall take as many as you wish with you .
then you may have all the animals in the park to hunt .
you can pursue them on horseback , and shoot them with bows and arrows , or kill them with javelins , as men do with wild beasts in the woods .
i <name> provide boys of your own age to play with you , and to ride and hunt with you , and <name> have all sorts of arms made of suitable size for you to use ; and if there is any thing else that you should want at any time , you <name> only have to ask me for it , and i <name> immediately provide it . "
the pleasure of riding and of hunting in the park was very <unk> to <name> 's mind , and he consented to stay .
he represented to his mother that it would be of great advantage to him , on his final return to persia , to be a skillful and powerful horseman , as that would at once give him the superiority over all the persian youths , for they were very little accustomed to ride .
his mother had some fears lest , by too long a residence in the median court , her son should acquire the luxurious habits , and proud and haughty manners , which would be constantly before him in his grandfather 's example ; but <name> said that his grandfather , being imperious himself , required all around him to be submissive , and that mandane need not fear but that he would return at last as dutiful and docile as ever .
it was decided , therefore , that <name> should stay , while his mother , bidding her child and her father farewell , went back to persia .
after his mother was gone , <name> <unk> himself very strongly to all persons at his grandfather 's court by the nobleness and generosity of character which he evinced , more and more , as his mind was gradually developed .
he applied himself with great diligence to acquiring the various accomplishments and arts then most highly prized , such as leaping , <unk> , racing , riding , throwing the javelin , and drawing the bow .
in the friendly contests which took place among the boys , to test their comparative excellence in these exercises , <name> would challenge those whom he knew to be superior to himself , and allow them to enjoy the pleasure of victory , while he was satisfied , himself , with the superior stimulus to exertion which he derived from coming thus into comparison with attainments higher than his own .
he pressed forward boldly and ardently , undertaking every thing which promised to be , by any possibility , within his power ; and , far from being disconcerted and discouraged at his mistakes and failures , he always joined merrily in the laugh which they occasioned , and renewed his attempts with as much ardor and alacrity as before .
thus he made great and rapid progress , and learned first to equal and then to surpass one after another of his companions , and all without exciting any jealousy or envy .
it was a great amusement both to him and to the other boys , his playmates , to hunt the animals in the park , especially the deer .
the park was a somewhat extensive domain , but the animals were soon very much diminished by the slaughter which the boys made among them .
astyages endeavored to supply their places by procuring more .
at length , however , all the sources of supply that were conveniently at hand were exhausted ; and <name> , then finding that his grandfather was put to no little trouble to obtain tame animals for his park , proposed , one day , that he should be allowed to go out into the forests , to hunt the wild beasts with the men .
" there are animals enough there , grandfather , " said <name> , " and i shall consider them all just as if you had procured them expressly for me . "
in fact , by this time <name> had grown up to be a tall and handsome young man , with strength and vigor sufficient , under favorable circumstances , to endure the fatigues and exposures of real hunting .
as his person had become developed , his mind and manners , too , had undergone a change .
the gayety , the <unk> , the self-confidence , and talkative vivacity of his childhood had disappeared , and he was fast becoming reserved , sedate , deliberate , and cautious .
he no longer entertained his grandfather 's company by his mimicry , his <unk> , and his childish wit .
he was silent ; he observed , he listened , he shrank from publicity , and spoke , when he spoke at all , in subdued and gentle tones .
instead of crowding forward eagerly into his grandfather 's presence on all occasions , <unk> and <unk> , as he had done before , he now became , of his own accord , very much afraid of <unk> trouble or interruption .
he did not any longer need a sacian to restrain him , but became , as xenophon expresses it , a sacian to himself , taking great care not to go into his grandfather 's apartments without previously ascertaining that the king was disengaged ; so that he and the sacian now became very great friends .
this being the state of the case , astyages consented that <name> should go out with his son <unk> into the forests to hunt at the next opportunity .
the party set out , when the time arrived , on horseback , the hearts of <name> and his companions bounding , when they mounted their steeds , with feelings of elation and pride .
there were certain attendants and guards appointed to keep near to <name> , and to help him in the rough and <name> parts of the country , and to protect him from the dangers to which , if left alone , he would doubtless have been exposed .
<name> talked with these attendants , as they rode along , of the mode of hunting , of the difficulties of hunting , the characters and the habits of the various wild beasts , and of the dangers to be shunned .
his attendants told him that the dangerous beasts were bears , lions , tigers , boars , and <unk> ; that such animals as these often attacked and killed men , and that he must avoid them ; but that stags , wild goats , wild sheep , and wild asses were harmless , and that he could hunt such animals as they as much as he pleased .
they told him , moreover , that steep , <name> , and broken ground was more dangerous to the huntsman than any beasts , however ferocious ; for riders , off their guard , driving impetuously over such ways , were often thrown from their horses , or fell with them over precipices or into chasms , and were killed .
[ illustration : <name> 's hunting . ]
<name> listened very attentively to these instructions , with every disposition to give heed to them ; but when he came to the trial , he found that the ardor and impetuosity of the <name> drove all considerations of <name> wholly from his mind .
when the men got into the forest , those that were with <name> roused a stag , and all set off eagerly in pursuit , <name> at the head .
away went the stag over rough and dangerous ground .
the rest of the party turned aside , or followed cautiously , while <name> urged his horse forward in the wildest excitement , thinking of nothing , and seeing nothing but the stag bounding before him .
the horse came to a chasm which he was obliged to leap .
but the distance was too great ; he came down upon his knees , threw <name> violently forward almost over his head , and then , with a bound and a scramble , recovered his feet and went on .
<name> clung <unk> to the horse 's mane , and at length succeeded in getting back to the saddle , though , for a moment his life was in the most imminent danger .
his attendants were extremely terrified , though he himself seemed to experience no feeling but the pleasurable excitement of the <name> ; for , as soon as the obstacle was cleared , he pressed on with new impetuosity after the stag , overtook him , and killed him with his javelin .
then , alighting from his horse , he stood by the side of his victim , to wait the coming up of the party , his countenance beaming with an expression of triumph and delight .
his attendants , however , on their arrival , instead of applauding his exploit , or seeming to share his pleasure , sharply reproved him for his recklessness and daring .
he had entirely disregarded their instructions , and they threatened to report him to his grandfather .
<name> looked perplexed and uneasy .
the excitement and the pleasure of victory and success were struggling in his mind against his dread of his grandfather 's displeasure .
just at this instant he heard a new halloo .
another party in the neighborhood had roused fresh game .
all <name> 's returning sense of duty was blown at once to the winds .
he sprang to his horse with a shout of wild enthusiasm , and rode off toward the scene of action .
the game which had been started , a furious wild boar , just then issued from a thicket directly before him .
<name> , instead of <unk> the danger , as he ought to have done , in obedience to the orders of those to whom his grandfather had intrusted him , dashed on to meet the boar at full speed , and aimed so true a thrust with his javelin against the beast as to <unk> him in the forehead .
the boar fell , and lay upon the ground in dying struggles , while <name> 's heart was filled with <name> and triumph even greater than before .
when <unk> came up , he reproved <name> anew for running such risks .
<name> received the reproaches meekly , and then asked <unk> to give him the two animals that he had killed ; he wanted to <name> them home to his grandfather .
" by no means , " said <unk> , " your grandfather would be very much displeased to know what you had done .
he would not only condemn you for acting thus , but he would <unk> us too , severely , for allowing you to do so . "
" let him punish me , " said <name> , " if he wishes , after i have shown him the stag and the boar , and you may punish me too , if you think best ; but do let me show them to him . "
<unk> consented , and <name> made arrangements to have the bodies of the beasts and the bloody javelins carried home .
<name> then presented the carcasses to his grandfather , saying that it was some game which he had taken for him .
the javelins he did not exhibit directly , but he laid them down in a place where his grandfather would see them .
astyages thanked him for his presents , but he said he had no such need of presents of game as to wish his grandson to expose himself to such imminent dangers to take it .
" well , grandfather , " said <name> , " if you do not want the meat , give it to me , and i <name> divide it among my friends . "
astyages agreed to this , and <name> divided his booty among his companions , the boys , who had before hunted with him in the park .
they , of course , took their several portions home , each one carrying with his share of the gift a glowing account of the valor and prowess of the giver .
it was not generosity which led <name> thus to give away the fruits of his toil , but a <name> to widen and extend his fame .
when <name> was about fifteen or sixteen years old , his uncle <unk> was married , and in celebrating his nuptials , he formed a great hunting party , to go to the frontiers between media and <unk> to hunt there , where it was said that game of all kinds was very plentiful , as it usually was , in fact , in those days , in the neighborhood of disturbed and unsettled frontiers .
the very causes which made such a region as this a safe and frequented haunt for wild beasts , made it unsafe for men , and <unk> did not consider it prudent to venture on his excursion without a considerable force to attend him .
his hunting party formed , therefore , quite a little army .
they set out from home with great pomp and ceremony , and proceeded to the frontiers in regular organization and order , like a body of troops on a march .
there was a squadron of horsemen , who were to hunt the beasts in the open parts of the forest , and a considerable detachment of <unk> footmen also , who were to rouse the game , and drive them out of their lurking places in the glens and thickets .
<name> accompanied this expedition .
when <unk> reached the frontiers , he concluded , instead of contenting himself and his party with hunting wild beasts , to make an incursion for plunder into the assyrian territory , that being , as <unk> expresses it , a more <name> enterprise than the other .
the nobleness , it seems , consisted in the greater <unk> of the danger , in having to contend with armed men instead of ferocious brutes , and in the higher value of the prizes which they would obtain in case of success .
the idea of there being any injustice or wrong in this wanton and <unk> <unk> upon the territories of a neighboring nation seems not to have entered the mind either of the <name> robber himself or of his historian .
<name> distinguished himself very conspicuously in this expedition , as he had done in the hunting excursion before ; and when , at length , this nuptial party returned home , loaded with booty , the tidings of <name> 's exploits went to persia .
cambyses thought that if his son was beginning to take part , as a soldier , in military campaigns , it was time for him to be recalled .
he accordingly sent for him , and <name> began to make preparations for his return .
the day of his departure was a day of great sadness and sorrow among all his companions in media , and , in fact , among all the members of his grandfather 's household .
they accompanied him for some distance on his way , and took leave of him , at last , with much regret and many tears .
<name> distributed among them , as they left him , the various articles of value which he possessed , such as his arms , and ornaments of various kinds , and costly articles of dress .
he gave his median robe , at last , to a certain youth whom he said he loved the best of all .
the name of this special favorite was araspes .
as these his friends parted from him , <name> took his leave of them , one by one , as they returned , with many proofs of his affection for them , and with a very sad and heavy heart .
the boys and young men who had received these presents took them home , but they were so valuable , that they or their parents , supposing that they were given under a momentary impulse of feeling , and that they ought to be returned , sent them all to astyages .
astyages sent them to persia , to be restored to <name> .
<name> sent them all back again to his grandfather , with a request that he would distribute them again to those to whom <name> had originally given them , " which , " said he , " grandfather , you must do , if you wish me ever to come to media again with pleasure and not with shame . "
such is the story which xenophon gives of <name> 's visit to media , and in its romantic and incredible details it is a specimen of the whole narrative which this author has given of his hero 's life .
it is not , at the present day , supposed that these , and the many similar stories with which xenophon 's books are filled , are true history .
it is not even thought that xenophon really intended to offer his narrative as history , but rather as an historical romance  a fiction founded on fact , written to amuse the warriors of his times , and to serve as a vehicle for <unk> such principles of philosophy , of morals , and of military science as seemed to him worthy of the attention of his countrymen .
the story has no air of reality about it from beginning to end , but only a sort of poetical fitness of one part to another , much more like the contrived coincidences of a romance writer than like the real events and transactions of actual life .
a very large portion of the work consists of long discourses on military , moral , and often metaphysical philosophy , made by generals in council , or commanders in conversation with each other when going into battle .
the occurrences and incidents out of which these conversations arise always take place just as they are wanted and arrange themselves in a manner to produce the highest dramatic effect ; like the stag , the broken ground , and the wild boar in <name> 's hunting , which came , one after another , to furnish the hero with poetical occasions for displaying his juvenile bravery , and to produce the most picturesque and poetical grouping of incidents and events .
xenophon too , like other writers of romances , makes his hero a model of military virtue and magnanimity , according to the ideas of the times .
he displays superhuman sagacity in <unk> his foes , he performs prodigies of valor , he forms the most sentimental attachments , and receives with a romantic confidence the <unk> of men who come over to his side from the enemy , and who , being traitors to old friends , would seem to be only worthy of suspicion and distrust in being received by new ones .
every thing , however , results well ; all whom he <unk> in prove worthy ; all whom he <unk> prove base .
all his friends are generous and <name> , and all his enemies treacherous and cruel .
every prediction which he makes is verified , and all his enterprises succeed ; or if , in any respect , there occurs a partial failure , the incident is always of such a character as to heighten the impression which is made by the final and triumphant success .
such being the character of xenophon 's tale , or rather drama , we shall content ourselves , after giving this specimen of it , with adding , in some subsequent chapters , a few other scenes and incidents drawn from his narrative .
in the mean time , in relating the great leading events of <name> 's life , we shall take herodotus for our guide , by following his more sober , and , probably , more trustworthy record .

the scene of our narrative must now be changed , for a time , from persia and media , in the east , to <name> minor , in the west , where the great croesus , originally king of <name> , was at this time gradually extending his empire along the shores of the Ã¦gean sea .
the name of croesus is associated in the minds of men with the idea of boundless wealth , the phrase " as <name> as croesus " having been a common proverb in all the modern languages of europe for many centuries .
it was to this croesus , king of <name> , whose story we are about to relate , that the proverb alludes .
the country of <name> , over which this famous sovereign originally ruled , was in the western part of <name> minor , bordering on the Ã¦gean sea .
croesus himself belonged to a dynasty , or race of kings , called the <unk> .
the founder of this line was gyges , who displaced the dynasty which preceded him and established his own by a revolution effected in a very remarkable manner .
the circumstances were as follows : the name of the last monarch of the old dynasty  the one , namely , whom gyges displaced  was <unk> .
gyges was a household servant in <unk> 's family  a sort of slave , in fact , and yet , as such slaves often were in those rude days , a personal favorite and boon companion of his master .
<unk> was a dissolute and unprincipled tyrant .
he had , however , a very beautiful and modest wife , whose name was <unk> .
<unk> was very proud of the beauty of his <name> , and was always <unk> it , though , as the event proved , he could not have felt for her any true and honest affection .
in some of his revels with gyges , when he was boasting of <unk> 's charms , he said that the beauty of her form and figure , when <unk> , was even more exquisite than that of her features ; and , finally , the monster , growing more and more excited , and having rendered himself still more of a brute than he was by nature by the influence of wine , declared that gyges should see for himself .
he would conceal him , he said , in the <name> 's bed-chamber , while she was undressing for the night .
gyges remonstrated very earnestly against this proposal .
it would be doing the innocent <name> , he said , a great wrong .
he assured the king , too , that he believed fully all that he said about <unk> 's beauty , without applying such a test , and he begged him not to insist upon a proposal with which it would be criminal to comply .
the king , however , did insist upon it , and gyges was compelled to yield .
whatever is offered as a favor by a <unk> despot to an humble inferior , it would be death to refuse .
gyges allowed himself to be placed behind a <unk> door of the king 's apartment , when the king retired to it for the night .
there he was to remain while the <name> began to <unk> herself for retiring , with a strict injunction to withdraw at a certain time which the king designated , and with the utmost caution , so as to prevent being observed by the <name> .
gyges did as he was ordered .
the beautiful <name> laid aside her garments and made her toilet for the night with all the quiet composure and confidence which a woman might be expected to feel while in so sacred and inviolable a sanctuary , and in the presence and under the guardianship of her husband .
just as she was about to retire to rest , some movement alarmed her .
it was gyges going away .
she saw him .
she instantly understood the case .
she was overwhelmed with indignation and shame .
she , however , suppressed and concealed her emotions ; she spoke to <unk> in her usual tone of voice , and he , on his part , secretly rejoiced in the adroit and successful manner in which his little contrivance had been carried into execution .
the next morning <unk> sent , by some of her confidential messengers , for gyges to come to her .
he came , with some forebodings , perhaps , but without any direct reason for believing that what he had done had been discovered .
<unk> , however , informed him that she knew all , and that either he or her husband must die .
gyges earnestly remonstrated against this decision , and <unk> forgiveness .
he explained the circumstances under which the act had been performed , which seemed , at least so far as he was concerned , to <unk> the deed .
the <name> was , however , fixed and decided .
it was wholly inconsistent with her ideas of womanly delicacy that there should be two living men who had both been admitted to her bed-chamber .
" the king , " she said , " by what he has done , has forfeited his claims to me and resigned me to you .
if you <name> kill him , seize his kingdom , and make me your wife , all shall be well ; otherwise you must prepare to die . "
from this hard alternative , gyges chose to assassinate the king , and to make the lovely object before him his own .
the excitement of indignation and resentment which glowed upon her cheek , and with which her bosom was heaving , made her more beautiful than ever .
" how shall our purpose be accomplished ? "
asked gyges .
" the deed , " she replied , " shall be perpetrated in the very place which was the scene of the dishonor done to me .
i <name> admit you into our bed-chamber in my turn , and you shall kill <unk> in his bed . "
when night came , <unk> stationed gyges again behind the same door where the king had placed him .
he had a dagger in his hand .
he waited there till <unk> was asleep .
then at a signal given him by the <name> , he entered , and stabbed the husband in his bed .
he married <unk> , and possessed himself of the kingdom .
after this , he and his successors reigned for many years over the kingdom of <name> , constituting the dynasty of the <unk> , from which , in process of time , king croesus descended .
the successive sovereigns of this dynasty gradually extended the lydian power over the countries around them .
the name of <unk> father , who was the monarch that immediately preceded him , was <unk> .
<unk> waged war toward the southward , into the territories of the city of miletus .
he made annual incursions into the country of the <unk> for plunder , always taking care , however , while he seized all the movable property that he could find , to leave the villages and towns , and all the hamlets of the laborers without injury .
the reason for this was , that he did not wish to drive away the population , but to encourage them to remain and cultivate their lands , so that there might be new flocks and herds , and new stores of corn , and fruit , and wine , for him to plunder from in succeeding years .
at last , on one of these marauding excursions , some fires which were accidentally set in a field spread into a neighboring town , and destroyed , among other buildings , a <name> consecrated to <name> .
after this , <unk> found himself quite unsuccessful in all his expeditions and campaigns .
he sent to a famous oracle to ask the reason .
" you can expect no more success , " replied the oracle , " until you rebuild the <name> that you have destroyed . "
but how could he rebuild the <name> ?
the site was in the <unk> country .
his men could not build an edifice and defend themselves , at the same time , from the attacks of their foes .
he concluded to demand a truce of the <unk> until the reconstruction should be completed , and he sent embassadors to miletus , accordingly , to make the proposal .
the proposition for a truce resulted in a permanent peace , by means of a very singular stratagem which <unk> , the king of miletus , practiced upon <unk> .
it seems that <unk> supposed that <unk> had been reduced to great distress by the loss and destruction of provisions and stores in various parts of the country , and that he would soon be forced to yield up his kingdom .
this was , in fact , the case ; but <unk> determined to disguise his real condition , and to destroy , by an artifice , all the hopes which <unk> had formed from the supposed scarcity in the city .
when the herald whom <unk> sent to miletus was about to arrive , <unk> collected all the corn , and grain , and other provisions which he could command , and had them heaped up in a public part of the city , where the herald was to be received , so as to present indications of the most ample abundance of food .
he collected a large body of his soldiers , too , and gave them leave to feast themselves without <unk> on what he had thus gathered .
accordingly , when the herald came in to deliver his message , he found the whole city given up to feasting and revelry , and he saw stores of provisions at hand , which were in process of being distributed and consumed with the most prodigal profusion .
the herald reported this state of things to <unk> .
<unk> then gave up all hopes of reducing miletus by famine , and made a permanent peace , binding himself to its stipulations by a very solemn treaty .
to celebrate the event , too , he built two temples to <name> instead of one .
a story is related by herodotus of a remarkable escape made by arion at sea , which occurred during the reign of <unk> , the father of croesus .
we <name> give the story as herodotus relates it , leaving the reader to judge for himself whether such tales were probably true , or were only introduced by herodotus into his narrative to make his histories more entertaining to the grecian assemblies to whom he read them .
arion was a celebrated singer .
he had been making a tour in sicily and in the southern part of italy , where he had acquired considerable wealth , and he was now returning to corinth .
he embarked at tarentum , which is a city in the southern part of italy , in a corinthian vessel , and put to sea .
when the sailors found that they had him in their power , they determined to <name> and murder him .
they accordingly seized his gold and silver , and then told him that he might either kill himself or jump overboard into the sea .
one or the other he must do .
if he would kill himself on board the vessel , they would give him decent burial when they reached the shore .
arion seemed at first at a loss how to decide in so hard an alternative .
at length he told the sailors that he would throw himself into the sea , but he asked permission to sing them one of his songs before he took the fatal plunge .
they consented .
he accordingly went into the cabin , and spent some time in dressing himself magnificently in the splendid and <unk> robes in which he had been accustomed to appear upon the stage .
at length he reappeared , and took his position on the side of the ship , with his harp in his hand .
he sang his song , accompanying himself upon the harp , and then , when he had finished his performance , he leaped into the sea .
the seamen divided their plunder and pursued their voyage .
arion , however , instead of being drowned , was taken up by a <unk> that had been charmed by his song , and was borne by him to <unk> , which is the promontory formed by the southern extremity of the peloponnesus .
there arion landed in safety .
from <unk> he proceeded to corinth , wearing the same dress in which he had plunged into the sea .
on his arrival , he complained to the king of the crime which the sailors had committed , and narrated his wonderful escape .
the king did not believe him , but put him in prison to wait until the ship should arrive .
when at last the vessel came , the king summoned the sailors into his presence , and asked them if they knew any thing of arion .
arion himself had been previously placed in an adjoining room , ready to be called in as soon as his presence was required .
the mariners answered to the question which the king put to them , that they had seen arion in tarentum , and that they had left him there .
arion was then himself called in .
his sudden appearance , clothed as he was in the same dress in which the mariners had seen him leap into the sea , so terrified the <unk> criminals , that they confessed their guilt , and were all punished by the king .
a marble statue , representing a man seated upon a <unk> , was erected at <unk> to commemorate this event , where it remained for centuries afterward , a monument of the wonder which arion had achieved .
at length <unk> died and croesus succeeded him .
croesus extended still further the power and fame of the lydian empire , and was for a time very successful in all his military schemes .
by looking upon the map , the reader <name> see that the Ã¦gean sea , along the coasts of <name> minor , is studded with islands .
these islands were in those days very fertile and beautiful , and were densely inhabited by a commercial and maritime people , who possessed a multitude of ships , and were very powerful in all the adjacent seas .
of course their land forces were very few , whether of horse or of foot , as the habits and manners of such a <unk> people were all foreign to modes of warfare required in land campaigns .
on the sea , however , these islanders were supreme .
croesus formed a scheme for attacking these islands and bringing them under his sway , and he began to make preparations for building and <unk> a fleet for this purpose , though , of course , his subjects were as unused to the sea as the nautical islanders were to military operations on the land .
while he was making these preparations , a certain philosopher was visiting at his court : he was one of the seven wise men of greece , who had recently come from the peloponnesus .
croesus asked him if there was any news from that country .
" i heard , " said the philosopher , " that the inhabitants of the islands were preparing to invade your dominions with a squadron of ten thousand horse . "
croesus , who supposed that the philosopher was serious , appeared greatly pleased and elated at the prospect of his <unk> enemies attempting to meet him as a body of cavalry .
" no doubt , " said the philosopher , after a little pause , " you would be pleased to have those sailors attempt to contend with you on horseback ; but do you not suppose that they <name> be equally pleased at the prospect of encountering lydian <unk> on the ocean ? "
croesus perceived the absurdity of his plan , and abandoned the attempt to execute it .
croesus acquired the enormous wealth for which he was so celebrated from the golden sands of the river <unk> , which flowed through his kingdom .
the river brought the particles of gold , in grains , and globules , and flakes , from the mountains above , and the servants and slaves of croesus washed the sands , and thus separated the heavier deposit of the metal .
in respect to the origin of the gold , however , the people who lived upon the banks of the river had a different explanation from the simple one that the waters brought down the treasure from the mountain ravines .
they had a story that , ages before , a certain king , named <unk> , rendered some service to a god , who , in his turn , offered to <name> him any favor that he might ask .
<unk> asked that the power might be granted him to turn whatever he touched into gold .
the power was bestowed , and <unk> , after changing various objects around him into gold until he was satisfied , began to find his new acquisition a source of great inconvenience and danger .
his clothes , his food , and even his drink , were changed to gold when he touched them .
he found that he was about to starve in the midst of a world of treasure , and he implored the god to take back the fatal gift .
the god directed him to go and bathe in the <unk> , and he should be restored to his former condition .
<unk> did so , and was saved , but not without transforming a great portion of the sands of the stream into gold during the process of his restoration .
croesus thus attained quite speedily to a very high degree of wealth , prosperity , and renown .
his dominions were widely extended ; his palaces were full of treasures ; his court was a scene of <unk> magnificence and splendor .
while in the enjoyment of all this grandeur , he was visited by solon , the celebrated grecian <unk> , who was traveling in that part of the world to observe the institutions and customs of different states .
croesus received solon with great distinction , and showed him all his treasures .
at last he one day said to him , " you have traveled , solon , over many countries , and have studied , with a great deal of attention and care , all that you have seen .
i have heard great <unk> of your wisdom , and i should like very much to know who , of all the persons you have ever known , has seemed to you most fortunate and happy . "
the king had no doubt that the answer would be that he himself was the one .
" i think , " replied solon , after a pause , " that <unk> , an athenian citizen , was the most fortunate and happy man i have ever known . "
" <unk> , an athenian ! "
repeated croesus , surprised .
" what was there in his case which you consider so remarkable ? "
" he was a peaceful and quiet citizen of athens , " said solon .
" he lived happily with his family , under a most excellent government , enjoying for many years all the pleasures of domestic life .
he had several amiable and virtuous children , who all grew up to maturity , and loved and honored their parents as long as they lived .
at length , when his life was drawing toward its natural termination , a war broke out with a neighboring nation , and <unk> went with the army to defend his country .
he aided very essentially in the defeat of the enemy , but fell , at last , on the field of battle .
his countrymen greatly lamented his death .
they buried him publicly where he fell , with every circumstance of honor . "
solon was proceeding to recount the domestic and social virtues of <unk> , and the peaceful happiness which he enjoyed as the result of them , when croesus interrupted him to ask who , next to <unk> , he considered the most fortunate and happy man .
solon , after a little farther reflection , mentioned two brothers , <unk> and <unk> , private persons among the greeks , who were celebrated for their great personal strength , and also for their devoted attachment to their mother .
he related to croesus a story of a feat they performed on one occasion , when their mother , at the celebration of some public festival , was going some miles to a <name> , in a car to be drawn by oxen .
there happened to be some delay in bringing the oxen , while the mother was waiting in the car .
as the oxen did not come , the young men took hold of the pole of the car themselves , and walked off at their ease with the load , amid the acclamations of the spectators , while their mother 's heart was filled with exultation and pride .
croesus here interrupted the philosopher again , and expressed his surprise that he should place private men , like those whom he had named , who possessed no wealth , or prominence , or power , before a monarch like him , occupying a station of such high authority and renown , and possessing such boundless treasures .
" croesus , " replied solon , " i see you now , indeed , at the height of human power and grandeur .
you reign supreme over many nations , and you are in the enjoyment of unbounded affluence , and every species of luxury and splendor .
i can not , however , decide whether i am to consider you a fortunate and happy man , until i know how all this is to end .
if we consider seventy years as the allotted period of life , you have a large portion of your existence yet to come , and we can not with certainty pronounce any man happy till his life is ended . "
this conversation with solon made a deep impression upon <unk> mind , as was afterward proved in a remarkable manner ; but the impression was not a pleasant or a salutary one .
the king , however , suppressed for the time the resentment which the presentation of these unwelcome truths awakened within him , though he treated solon afterward with indifference and neglect , so that the philosopher soon found it best to withdraw .
croesus had two sons .
one was deaf and dumb .
the other was a young man of uncommon promise , and , of course , as he only could succeed his father in the government of the kingdom , he was naturally an object of the king 's particular attention and care .
his name was <unk> .
he was unmarried .
he was , however , old enough to have the command of a considerable body of troops , and he had often distinguished himself in the lydian campaigns .
one night the king had a dream about <unk> which greatly alarmed him .
he dreamed that his son was destined to die of a wound received from the point of an iron spear .
the king was made very uneasy by this ominous dream .
he determined at once to take every precaution in his power to avert the threatened danger .
he immediately detached <unk> from his command in the army , and made provision for his marriage .
he then very carefully collected all the darts , javelins , and every other <unk> weapon that he could find about the palace , and caused them to be deposited carefully in a secure place , where there could be no danger even of an accidental injury from them .
about that time there appeared at the court of croesus a stranger from <unk> , a neighboring state , who presented himself at the palace and asked for protection .
he was a <name> of the <name> family of <unk> , and his name was <unk> .
he had had the misfortune , by some unhappy accident , to kill his brother ; his father , in consequence of it , had banished him from his native land , and he was now homeless , friendless , and destitute .
croesus received him kindly .
" your family have always been my friends , " said he , " and i am glad of the opportunity to make some return by extending my protection to any member of it suffering misfortune .
you shall reside in my palace , and all your wants shall be supplied .
come in , and forget the calamity which has befallen you , instead of distressing yourself with it as if it had been a crime . "
thus croesus received the unfortunate <unk> into his household .
after the <name> had been <unk> in his new home for some time , messengers came from <unk> , a neighboring state , saying that a wild boar of enormous size and unusual ferocity had come down from the mountains , and was lurking in the cultivated country , in thickets and glens , from which , at night , he made great havoc among the flocks and herds , and asking that croesus would send his son , with a band of hunters and a pack of dogs , to help them destroy the common enemy .
croesus consented immediately to send the dogs and the men , but he said that he could not send his son .
" my son , " he added , " has been lately married , and his time and attention are employed about other things . "
when , however , <unk> himself heard of this reply , he remonstrated very earnestly against it , and begged his father to allow him to go .
" what <name> the world think of me , " said he " if i shut myself up to these <unk> pursuits and enjoyments , and shun those dangers and toils which other men consider it their highest honor to share ?
what <name> my fellow-citizens think of me , and how shall i appear in the eyes of my wife ?
she <name> despise me . "
croesus then explained to his son the reason why he had been so careful to avoid exposing him to danger .
he related to him the dream which had alarmed him .
" it is on that account , " said he , " that i am so anxious about you .
you are , in fact , my only son , for your speechless brother can never be my heir . "
<unk> said , in reply , that he was not surprised , under those circumstances , at his father 's anxiety ; but he maintained that this was a case to which his caution could not properly apply .
" you dreamed , " he said , " that i should be killed by a weapon pointed with iron ; but a boar has no such weapon .
if the dream had portended that i was to perish by a tusk or a tooth , you might reasonably have restrained me from going to hunt a wild beast ; but <unk> instruments are the weapons of men , and we are not going , in this expedition , to contend with men . "
the king , partly convinced , perhaps , by the arguments which <unk> offered , and partly overborne by the urgency of his request , finally consented to his request and allowed him to go .
he consigned him , however , to the special care of <unk> , who was likewise to accompany the expedition , charging <unk> to keep constantly by his side , and to watch over him with the utmost vigilance and fidelity .
the band of huntsmen was organized , the dogs prepared , and the train departed .
very soon afterward , a messenger came back from the hunting ground , breathless , and with a countenance of extreme concern and terror , bringing the dreadful tidings that <unk> was dead .
<unk> himself had killed him .
in the ardor of the <name> , while the huntsmen had surrounded the boar , and were each intent on his own personal danger while in close combat with such a monster , and all were hurling darts and javelins at their ferocious foe , the spear of <unk> missed its aim , and entered the body of the unhappy <name> .
he bled to death on the spot .
soon after the messenger had made known these terrible tidings , the hunting train , transformed now into a funeral procession , appeared , bearing the dead body of the king 's son , and followed by the wretched <unk> himself , who was wringing his hands , and crying out incessantly in accents and exclamations of despair .
he begged the king to kill him at once , over the body of his son , and thus put an end to the unutterable agony that he endured .
this second calamity was more , he said , than he could bear .
he had killed before his own brother , and now he had murdered the son of his greatest benefactor and friend .
croesus , though overwhelmed with anguish , was disarmed of all resentment at witnessing <unk> 's suffering .
he endeavored to soothe and quiet the agitation which the unhappy man endured , but it was in vain .
<unk> could not be calmed .
croesus then ordered the body of his son to be buried with proper honors .
the funeral services were performed with great and solemn ceremonies , and when the body was interred , the household of croesus returned to the palace , which was now , in spite of all its splendor , shrouded in gloom .
that night  at midnight  <unk> , finding his mental anguish insupportable retired from his apartment to the place where <unk> had been buried , and killed himself over the grave .
* * * * * solon was wise in saying that he could not tell whether wealth and grandeur were to be accounted as happiness till he saw how they would end .
croesus was plunged into <unk> grief , and into extreme dejection and misery for a period of two years , in consequence of this calamity , and yet this calamity was only the beginning of the end .
chapter v. accession of <name> to the throne .
b.c .
<unk> change in the character of cyrus.  his <unk>  <unk> of <unk>  <name> makes great progress in mental and personal <unk>  harpagus 's plans for <unk>  suspicions of <unk>  condition of <unk>  discontent in <unk>  proceedings of <unk>  his deportment toward <unk>  co-operation in <unk>  harpagus writes to cyrus.  harpagus 's singular method of conveying his letter to cyrus.  contents of <unk> letter.  excitement of cyrus.  <name> <unk> to <unk> plan.  how to raise an army.  the day of <unk>  the day of <unk>  speech of cyrus.  ardor of the <unk>  <unk> of <unk>  the battle.  rage of <unk>  his vengeance on the <unk>  defeat and capture of <unk>  interview with <unk>  <name> king of media and <unk>  confinement of <unk>  acquiescence of the <unk>  death of <unk>  suddenness of <unk> <unk>  harpagus .
while croesus had thus , on his side of the river <unk>  which was the stream that marked the boundary between the lydian empire on the west and the persian and assyrian dominions on the east  been employed in building up his grand structure of outward magnificence and splendor , and in contending , within , against an overwhelming tide of domestic misery and woe , great changes had taken place in the situation and prospects of <name> .
from being an artless and <unk> child , he had become a calculating , ambitious , and aspiring man , and he was preparing to take his part in the great public contests and struggles of the day , with the same eagerness for <unk> , and the same unconcern for the welfare and happiness of others , which always <unk> the spirit of ambition and love of power .
although it is by no means certain that what xenophon relates of his visit to his grandfather astyages is meant for a true narrative of facts , it is not at all improbable that such a visit might have been made , and that occurrences , somewhat similar , at least , to those which his narrative records , may have taken place .
it may seem strange to the reader that a man who should , at one time , wish to put his grandchild to death , should , at another , be disposed to treat him with such a profusion of kindness and attention .
there is nothing , however , really extraordinary in this .
nothing is more fluctuating than the <name> of a despot .
man , accustomed from infancy to govern those around him by his own impetuous <name> , never learns self-control .
he gives himself up to the dominion of the passing animal emotions of the hour .
it may be jealousy , it may be revenge , it may be parental fondness , it may be hate , it may be love  whatever the feeling is that the various incidents of life , as they occur , or the influences , irritating or exhilarating , which are produced by food or wine , awaken in his mind , he follows its impulse blindly and without reserve .
he loads a favorite with kindness and caresses at one hour , and <unk> his assassination the next .
he imagines that his infant grandchild is to become his rival , and he deliberately orders him to be left in a gloomy forest alone , to die of cold and hunger .
when the imaginary danger has passed away , he seeks amusement in making the same grandchild his plaything , and <unk> him with favors bestowed solely for the gratification of the giver , under the influence of an affection almost as purely animal as that of a lioness for her young .
favors of such a sort can awaken no permanent gratitude in any heart , and thus it is quite possible that <name> might have evinced , during the simple and guileless days of his childhood , a deep veneration and affection for his grandfather , and yet , in subsequent years , when he had arrived at full maturity , have learned to regard him simply in the light of a great political potentate , as likely as any other potentate around him to become his rival or his enemy .
this was , at all events , the result .
<name> , on his return to persia , grew rapidly in strength and stature , and soon became highly distinguished for his personal <name> , his winning manners , and for the various martial accomplishments which he had acquired in media , and in which he excelled almost all his companions .
he gained , as such princes always do , a vast ascendency over the minds of all around him .
as he advanced toward maturity , his mind passed from its interest in games , and hunting , and athletic sports , to plans of war , of conquest , and of extended dominion .
in the mean time , harpagus , though he had , at the time when he endured the horrid punishment which astyages inflicted upon him , expressed no resentment , still he had secretly felt an extreme indignation and anger , and he had now , for fifteen years , been nourishing covert schemes and plans for revenge .
he remained all this time in the court of astyages , and was apparently his friend .
he was , however , in heart a most bitter and implacable enemy .
he was looking continually for a plan or prospect which should promise some <name> of affording him his <unk> revenge .
his eyes were naturally turned toward <name> .
he kept up a communication with him so far as it was possible , for astyages watched very closely what passed between the two countries , being always suspicious of plots against his government and crown .
harpagus , however , contrived to evade this vigilance in some degree .
he made continual reports to <name> of the tyranny and <unk> of astyages , and of the <unk> of the realm of media , and he endeavored to stimulate his rising ambition to the <name> of one day possessing for himself both the median and persian throne .
in fact , persia was not then independent of media .
it was more or less connected with the government of astyages , so that cambyses , the chief ruler of persia , <name> 's father , is called sometimes a king and sometimes a <unk> , which last title is equivalent to that of viceroy or governor general .
whatever his true and proper title may have been , persia was a median <unk> , and <name> , therefore , in forming plans for gaining possession of the median throne , would consider himself as rather endeavoring to rise to the supreme command in his own native country , than as projecting any scheme for foreign conquest .
harpagus , too , looked upon the subject in the same light .
accordingly , in pushing forward his plots toward their execution , he operated in media as well as persia , he ascertained , by diligent and sagacious , but by very covert inquiries , who were discontented and ill at ease under the dominion of astyages , and by sympathizing with and encouraging them , he increased their discontent and <unk> .
whenever astyages , in the exercise of his tyranny inflicted an injury upon a powerful subject , harpagus espoused the cause of the injured man , condemned , with him , the intolerable oppression of the king , and thus fixed and perpetuated his enmity .
at the same time , he took pains to collect and to <unk> among the medes all the information which he could obtain favorable to <name> , in respect to his talents , his character , and his just and generous spirit , so that , at length , the ascendency of astyages , through the instrumentality of these measures , was very extensively undermined , and the way was rapidly becoming prepared for <name> 's accession to power .
during all this time , moreover , harpagus was personally very deferential and obsequious to astyages , and professed an unbounded <unk> to his interests .
he maintained a high rank at court and in the army , and astyages relied upon him as one of the most obedient and submissive of his servants , without entertaining any suspicion whatever of his true designs .
at length a favorable occasion arose , as harpagus thought , for the execution of his plans .
it was at a time when astyages had been guilty of some unusual acts of tyranny and oppression , by which he had produced extensive dissatisfaction among his people .
harpagus communicated , very cautiously , to the principal men around him , the designs that he had long been forming for deposing astyages and elevating <name> in his place .
he found them favorably inclined to the plan .
the way being thus prepared , the next thing was to contrive some secret way of communicating with <name> .
as the proposal which he was going to make was that <name> should come into media with as great a force as he could command , and head an insurrection against the government of astyages , it would , of course , be death to him to have it discovered .
he did not dare to trust the message to any living messenger , for fear of betrayal ; nor was it safe to send a letter by any ordinary mode of transmission , lest the letter should be intercepted by some of astyages 's spies , and thus the whole plot be discovered .
he finally adopted the following very extraordinary plan : [ illustration : the secret correspondence . ]
he wrote a letter to <name> , and then taking a hare , which some of his huntsmen had caught for him , he opened the body and concealed the letter within .
he then sewed up the skin again in the most careful manner , so that no signs of the <unk> should remain .
he delivered this hare , together with some nets and other hunting apparatus , to certain trustworthy servants , on whom he thought he could rely , charging them to deliver the hare into <name> 's own hands , and to say that it came from harpagus , and that it was the request of harpagus that <name> should open it himself and alone .
harpagus concluded that this mode of making the communication was safe ; for , in case the persons to whom the hare was intrusted were to be seen by any of the spies or other persons employed by astyages on the frontiers , they would consider them as hunters returning from the <name> with their game , and would never think of examining the body of a hare , in the hands of such a party , in search after a clandestine correspondence .
the plan was perfectly successful .
the men passed into persia without any suspicion .
they delivered the hare to <name> , with their message .
he opened the hare , and found the letter .
it was in substance as follows : " it is plain , <name> , that you are a favorite of heaven , and that you are destined to a great and glorious career .
you could not otherwise have escaped , in so miraculous a manner , the <unk> set for you in your infancy .
astyages meditated your death , and he took such measures to effect it as would seem to have made your destruction sure .
you were saved by the special interposition of heaven .
<name> are aware by what extraordinary incidents you were preserved and discovered , and what great and unusual prosperity has since attended you .
you know , too , what cruel punishments astyages inflicted upon me , for my humanity in saving you .
the time has now come for retribution .
from this time the authority and the dominions of astyages may be yours .
persuade the persians to revolt .
put yourself at the head of an army , and march into media .
i shall probably myself be appointed to command the army sent out to oppose you .
if so , we <name> join our forces when we meet , and i <name> enter your service .
i have conferred with the leading nobles in media , and they are all ready to espouse your cause .
you may rely upon finding every thing thus prepared for you here ; come , therefore , without any delay . "
<name> was thrown into a fever of excitement and agitation on reading this letter .
he determined to accede to harpagus 's proposal .
he revolved in his mind for some time the measures by which he could raise the necessary force .
of course he could not openly announce his plan and enlist an army to effect it , for any avowed and public movement of that kind would be immediately made known to astyages , who , by being thus <unk> of his enemies ' designs , might take effectual measures to circumvent them .
he determined to resort to deceit , or , as he called it , stratagem ; nor did he probably have any distinct perception of the <unk> of such a mode of proceeding .
the demon of war <unk> and justifies falsehood and treachery , in all its forms , on the part of his <unk> .
he always <unk> a forgery , a false pretense , or a lie : he calls it a stratagem .
<name> had a letter prepared , in the form of a commission from astyages , appointing him commander of a body of persian forces to be raised for the service of the king .
<name> read the <unk> document in the public assembly of the persians , and called upon all the warriors to join him .
when they were organized , he ordered them to assemble on a certain day , at a place that he named , each one provided with a woodman 's ax .
when they were thus mustered , he marched them into a forest , and set them at work to clear a piece of ground .
the army toiled all day , <unk> the trees , and piling them up to be burned .
they cleared in this way , as herodotus states , a piece of ground eighteen or twenty <unk> in extent .
<name> kept them thus engaged in severe and incessant toil all the day , giving them , too , only coarse food and little rest .
at night he dismissed them , commanding them to assemble again the second day .
on the second day , when they came together , they found a great banquet prepared for them , and <name> directed them to devote the day to feasting and making <name> .
there was an abundance of meats of all kinds , and <name> wines in great profusion .
the soldiers gave themselves up for the whole day to merriment and revelry .
the toils and the hard fare of the day before had prepared them very effectually to enjoy the rest and the luxuries of this festival .
they spent the hours in feasting about their camp-fires and reclining on the grass , where they amused themselves and one another by relating tales , or joining in <name> songs and dances .
at last , in the evening , <name> called them together , and asked them which day they had liked the best .
they replied that there was nothing at all to like in the one , and nothing to be disliked in the other .
they had had , on the first day , hard work and bad fare , and on the second , uninterrupted ease and the most luxurious pleasures .
" it is indeed so , " said <name> , " and you have your <name> in your own hands to make your lives pass like either of these days , just as you choose .
if you <name> follow me , you <name> enjoy ease , abundance , and luxury .
if you refuse , you must remain as you are , and toil on as you do now , and endure your present privations and hardships to the end of your days . "
he then explained to them his designs .
he told them that although media was a great and powerful kingdom , still that they were as good soldiers as the medes , and with the arrangements and preparations which he had made , they were sure of victory .
the soldiers received this proposal with great enthusiasm and <name> .
they declared themselves ready to follow <name> wherever he should lead them , and the whole body immediately commenced making preparations for the expedition .
astyages was , of course , soon informed of these proceedings .
he sent an order to <name> , summoning him immediately into his presence .
<name> sent back word , in reply , that astyages would probably see him sooner than he wished , and went on vigorously with his preparations .
when all was ready , the army marched , and , crossing the frontiers , they entered into media .
in the mean time , astyages had collected a large force , and , as had been anticipated by the conspirators , he put it under the command of harpagus .
harpagus made known his design of going over to <name> as soon as he should meet him , to as large a portion of the army as he thought it prudent to admit to his confidence ; the rest knew nothing of the plan ; and thus the median army advanced to meet the invaders , a part of the troops with minds intent on resolutely meeting and <unk> their enemies , while the rest were secretly preparing to go over at once to their side .
when the battle was joined , the honest part of the median army fought valiantly at first , but soon , thunderstruck and utterly confounded at seeing themselves abandoned and betrayed by a large body of their comrades , they were easily overpowered by the triumphant persians .
some were taken prisoners ; some fled back to astyages ; and others , following the example of the deserters , went over to <name> 's camp and swelled the <name> of his train .
<name> , thus <unk> by the <unk> he had received , and encouraged by the flight or dispersion of all who still wished to oppose him , began to advance toward the capital .
astyages , when he heard of the <unk> of harpagus and of the discomfiture of his army , was thrown into a perfect phrensy of rage and hate .
the <unk> prediction of his dream seemed now about to be fulfilled , and the magi , who had taught him that when <name> had once been made king of the boys in sport , there was no longer any danger of his aspiring to regal power , had proved themselves false .
they had either intentionally deceived him , or they were ignorant themselves , and in that case they were worthless impostors .
although the danger from <name> 's approach was imminent in the extreme , astyages could not take any measures for guarding against it until he had first gratified the despotic cruelty of his nature by taking vengeance on these false <unk> .
he directed to have them all seized and brought before him , and then , having upbraided them with bitter reproaches for their false predictions , he ordered them all to be crucified .
he then adopted the most decisive measures for raising an army .
he ordered every man capable of bearing arms to come forward , and then , putting himself at the head of the immense force which he had thus raised , he advanced to meet his enemy .
he supposed , no doubt , that he was sure of victory ; but he <unk> the power which the discipline , the resolution , the concentration , and the terrible energy of <name> 's troops gave to their formidable array .
he was defeated .
his army was totally cut to pieces , and he himself was taken prisoner .
harpagus was present when he was taken , and he exulted in <unk> triumph over the fallen tyrant 's ruin .
astyages was filled with rage and despair .
harpagus asked him what he thought now of the supper in which he had compelled a father to feed on the flesh of his child .
astyages , in reply , asked harpagus whether he thought that the success of <name> was owing to what he had done .
harpagus replied that it was , and <unk> explained to astyages the plots he had formed , and the preparations which he had made for <name> 's invasion , so that astyages might see that his destruction had been effected by harpagus alone , in terrible retribution for the atrocious crime which he had committed so many years before , and for which the vengeance of the sufferer had slumbered , during the long interval , only to be more complete and overwhelming at last .
astyages told harpagus that he was a miserable wretch , the most foolish and most wicked of mankind .
he was the most foolish , for having plotted to put power into another 's hands which it would have been just as easy for him to have secured and retained in his own ; and he was the most wicked , for having betrayed his country , and delivered it over to a foreign power , merely to gratify his own private revenge .
the result of this battle was the complete overthrow of the power and kingdom of astyages , and the establishment of <name> on the throne of the united kingdom of media and persia .
<name> treated his grandfather with kindness after his victory over him .
he kept him confined , it is true , but it was probably that indirect and qualified sort of confinement which is all that is usually enforced in the case of princes and kings .
in such cases , some extensive and often sumptuous residence is assigned to the illustrious prisoner , with grounds sufficiently extensive to afford every necessary range for recreation and exercise , and with bodies of troops for keepers , which have much more the form and appearance of military guards of honor attending on a <name> , than of <unk> confining a prisoner .
it was probably in such an imprisonment as this that astyages passed the remainder of his days .
the people , having been wearied with his despotic tyranny , rejoiced in his downfall , and acquiesced very readily in the milder and more <unk> government of <name> .
astyages came to his death many years afterward , in a somewhat remarkable manner .
<name> sent for him to come into persia , where he was himself then residing .
the officer who had astyages in charge , conducted him , on the way , into a desolate wilderness , where he perished of fatigue , exposure , and hunger .
it was supposed that this was done in obedience to secret orders from <name> , who perhaps found the charge of such a prisoner a burden .
the officer , however , was cruelly punished for the act ; but even this may have been only for appearances , to divert the minds of men from all suspicion that <name> could himself have been an accomplice in such a crime .
the whole revolution which has been described in this chapter , from its first <unk> to its final accomplishment , was effected in a very short period of time , and <name> thus found himself very unexpectedly and suddenly elevated to a throne .
harpagus continued in his service , and became subsequently one of his most celebrated generals .

as soon as <name> had become established on his throne as king of the medes and persians , his influence and power began to extend westward toward the confines of the empire of croesus , king of <name> .
croesus was aroused from the dejection and stupor into which the death of his son had plunged him , as related in a former chapter , by this threatening danger .
he began to consider very earnestly what he could do to avert it .
the river <unk> , a great river of <name> minor , which flows northward into the black sea , was the eastern boundary of the lydian empire .
croesus began to entertain the design of raising an army and crossing the <unk> , to invade the empire of <name> , thinking that that would perhaps be safer policy than to wait for <name> to cross the <unk> , and bring the war upon him .
still , the enterprise of invading persia was a vast undertaking , and the responsibility great of being the aggressor in the contest .
after carefully considering the subject in all its aspects , croesus found himself still perplexed and undecided .
the greeks had a method of looking into futurity , and of ascertaining , as they imagined , by supernatural means , the course of future events , which was peculiar to that people ; at least no other nation seems ever to have practiced it in the precise form which prevailed among them .
it was by means of the oracles .
there were four or five localities in the grecian countries which possessed , as the people thought , the property of inspiring persons who visited them , or of giving to some natural object certain supernatural powers by which future events could be foretold .
the three most important of these oracles were situated respectively at delphi , at <unk> , and at the oasis of jupiter ammon .
delphi was a small town built in a sort of valley , shaped like an <unk> , on the southern side of mount <unk> .
mount <unk> is north of the peloponnesus , not very far from the shores of the gulf of corinth .
delphi was in a picturesque and romantic situation , with the mountain behind it , and steep , precipitous rocks descending to the level country before .
these precipices answered instead of walls to defend the <name> and the town .
in very early times a cavern or fissure in the rocks was discovered at delphi , from which there issued a stream of gaseous vapor , which produced strange effects on those who <unk> it .
it was supposed to inspire them .
people resorted to the place to obtain the benefit of these inspirations , and of the knowledge which they imagined they could obtain by means of them .
finally , a <name> was built , and a priestess resided constantly in it , to <unk> the vapor and give the responses .
when she gave her answers to those who came to consult the oracle , she sat upon a sort of <unk> stool , which was called the sacred tripod .
these stools were greatly celebrated as a very important part of the sacred apparatus of the place .
this oracle became at last so renowned , that the greatest potentates , and even kings , came from great distances to consult it , and they made very <name> and costly presents at the shrine when they came .
these presents , it was supposed , tended to induce the god who presided over the oracle to give to those who made them favorable and auspicious replies .
the deity that dictated the predictions of this oracle was apollo .
there was another circumstance , besides the existence of the cave , which <unk> the locality where this oracle was situated .
the people believed that this spot was the exact center of the earth , which of course they considered as one vast plain .
there was an ancient story that jupiter , in order to determine the central point of creation , liberated two eagles at the same time , in opposite quarters of the heavens , that they might fly toward one another , and so <name> the middle point by the place of their meeting .
they met at delphi .
another of the most celebrated oracles was at <unk> .
<unk> was northwest of delphi , in the epirus , which was a country in the western part of what is now turkey in europe , and on the shores of the adriatic sea .
the origin of the oracle at <unk> was , as the priestesses there told herodotus , as follows : in very ancient times , two black doves were set at <name> in thebes , which was a very venerable and sacred city of egypt .
one flew toward the north and the other toward the west .
the former crossed the mediterranean , and then continued its flight over the peloponnesus , and over all the southern provinces of greece , until it reached <unk> .
there it alighted on a <unk> , and said , in a human voice , that that spot was divinely appointed for the seat of a sacred oracle .
the other dove flew to the oasis of jupiter ammon .
there were three priestesses at <unk> in the days of herodotus .
their names were <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
the answers of the oracle were , for a time , obtained by the priestesses from some appearances which they observed in the sacred beech on which the dove alighted , when the tree was agitated by the wind .
in later times , however , the responses were obtained in a still more singular manner .
then was a brazen statue of a man , holding a whip in his hand .
the whip had three lashes , which were formed of brazen chains .
at the end of each chain was an <unk> , as it was called , which was a row of little knots or knobs , such as were commonly appended to the lashes of whips used in those days for <unk> criminals .
these heavy lashes <name> suspended in the hand of the statue over a great brazen <unk> , in such a manner that the wind would <unk> them , from time to time , against its sides , causing the <unk> to ring and resound like a gong .
there was , however , something in this <unk> supernatural and divine ; for , though it was not loud , it was very long continued , when once the margin of the <unk> was touched , however gently , by the lashes .
in fact , it was commonly said that if touched in the morning , it would be night before the <unk> would have died entirely away .
such a belief could be very easily sustained among the common people ; for a large , open-mouthed vessel like the <unk> <unk> , with thin sides formed of sonorous metal , might be kept in a state of continual vibration by the wind alone .
they who wished to consult this oracle came with <name> presents both for the priestesses and for the shrine , and when they had made the offerings , and performed the preliminary ceremonies required , they propounded their questions to the priestesses , who obtained the replies by interpreting , according to certain rules which they had formed , the sounds emitted by the mysterious gong .
the second black dove which took its flight from thebes alighted , as we have already said , in the oasis of jupiter ammon .
this oasis was a small fertile spot in the midst of the deserts of africa , west of egypt , about a hundred miles from the nile , and somewhat nearer than that to the mediterranean sea .
it was first discovered in the following manner : a certain king was marching across the deserts , and his army , having exhausted their supplies of water , were on the point of perishing with thirst , when a ram mysteriously appeared , and took a position before them as their guide .
they followed him , and at length came suddenly upon a green and fertile valley , many miles in length .
the ram conducted them into this valley , and then suddenly vanished , and a copious fountain of water sprung up in the place where he had stood .
the king , in gratitude for this divine interposition , consecrated the spot and built a <name> upon it , which was called the <name> of jupiter ammon .
the dove alighted here , and ever afterward the oracles delivered by the priests of this <name> were considered as divinely inspired .
these three were the most important oracles .
there were , however , many others of subordinate consequence , each of which had its own peculiar ceremonies , all senseless and absurd .
at one there was a sort of <unk> cave in the rocks , the spot being inclosed by an artificial wall .
the cave was about six feet wide and eight feet deep .
the descent into it was by a ladder .
previously to consulting this oracle certain ceremonies were necessary , which it required several days to perform .
the applicant was to offer sacrifices to many different deities , and to purify himself in various ways .
he was then conducted to a stream in the neighborhood of the oracle , where he was to be anointed and washed .
then he drank a certain magical water , called the water of forgetfulness , which made him forget all previous sorrows and cares .
afterward he drank of another enchanted cup , which contained the water of remembrance ; this was to make him remember all that should be communicated to him in the cave .
he then descended the ladder , and received within the cave the responses of the oracle .
at another of these oracles , which was situated in attica , the magic virtue was supposed to reside in a certain marble statue , carved in honor of an ancient and celebrated prophet , and placed in a <name> .
whoever wished to consult this oracle must abstain from wine for three days , and from food of every kind for twenty-four hours preceding the application .
he was then to offer a ram as a sacrifice ; and afterward , taking the skin of the ram from the carcass , he was to spread it out before the statue and lie down upon it to sleep .
the answers of the oracle came to him in his dreams .
but to return to croesus .
he wished to ascertain , by consulting some of these oracles , what the result of his proposed invasion of the dominions of <name> would be , in case he should undertake it ; and in order to determine which of the various oracles were most worthy of reliance , he conceived the plan of putting them all to a preliminary test .
he effected this object in the following manner : he dispatched a number of messengers from sardis , his capital , sending one to each of the various oracles .
he directed these messengers to make their several journeys with all convenient dispatch ; but , in order to provide for any cases of accidental detention or delay , he allowed them all one hundred days to reach their several places of destination .
on the hundredth day from the time of their leaving sardis , they were all to make applications to the oracles , and inquire what croesus , king of <name> , was doing at that time .
of course he did not tell them what he should be doing ; and as the oracles themselves could not possibly know how he was employed by any human powers , their answers would seem to test the validity of their claims to powers divine .
croesus kept the reckoning of the days himself with great care , and at the hour appointed on the hundredth day , he employed himself in boiling the flesh of a turtle and of a lamb together in a brazen vessel .
the vessel was covered with a lid , which was also of brass .
he then awaited the return of the messengers .
they came in due time , one after another , bringing the replies which they had severally obtained .
the replies were all unsatisfactory , except that of the oracle at delphi .
this answer was in verse , as , in fact , the responses of that oracle always were .
the priestess who sat upon the tripod was accustomed to give the replies in an incoherent and <unk> manner , as impostors are very apt to do in uttering prophecies , and then the attendant priests and secretaries wrote them out in verse .
the verse which the messenger brought back from the <unk> tripod was in greek ; but some idea of its style , and the import of it , is conveyed by the following imitation : " i number the sands , i measure the sea , what 's hidden to others is known to me .
the lamb and the turtle are <unk> slow with brass above them and brass below . "
of course , croesus decided that the <unk> oracle was the one that he must rely upon for guidance in respect to his projected campaign .
and he now began to prepare to consult it in a manner corresponding with the vast importance of the subject , and with his own boundless wealth .
he provided the most extraordinary and sumptuous presents .
some of these treasures were to be deposited in the <name> , as sacred gifts , for permanent preservation there .
others were to be offered as a burnt sacrifice in honor of the god .
among the latter , besides an incredible number of living victims , he caused to be prepared a great number of couches , magnificently decorated with silver and gold , and <unk> and other vessels of gold , and dresses of various kinds richly embroidered , and numerous other articles , all intended to be used in the ceremonies preliminary to his application to the oracle .
when the time arrived , a vast concourse of people assembled to witness the spectacle .
the animals were sacrificed , and the people feasted on the flesh ; and when these ceremonies were concluded , the couches , the <unk> , the utensils of every kind , the dresses  every thing , in short , which had been used on the occasion , were heaped up into one great <unk> pile , and set on fire .
every thing that was combustible was consumed , while the gold was melted , and ran into plates of great size , which were afterward taken out from the ashes .
thus it was the workmanship only of these articles which was destroyed and lost by the fire .
the gold , in which the chief value consisted , was saved .
it was gold from the <unk> .
besides these articles , there were others made , far more magnificent and costly , for the <name> itself .
there was a silver cistern or tank , large enough to hold three thousand gallons of wine .
this tank was to be used by the inhabitants of delphi in their great festivals .
there was also a smaller cistern , or immense <unk> , as it might , perhaps , more properly be called , which was made of gold .
there were also many other smaller presents , such as basins , vases , and statues , all of silver and gold , and of the most costly workmanship .
the gold , too , which had been taken from the fire , was cast again , a part of it being formed into the image of a lion , and the rest into large plates of metal for the lion to stand upon .
the image was then set up upon the plates , within the precincts of the <name> .
there was one piece of statuary which croesus presented to the oracle at delphi , which was , in some respects , more extraordinary than any of the rest .
it was called the <unk> .
it was an image representing a woman , a servant in the household of croesus , whose business it was to bake the bread .
the reason that induced croesus to honor this <unk> with a statue of gold was , that on one occasion during his childhood she had saved his life .
the mother of croesus died when he was young , and his father married a second time .
the second wife wished to have some one of her children , instead of croesus , succeed to her husband 's throne .
in order , therefore , to remove croesus out of the way , she prepared some poison and gave it to the <unk> , instructing her to put it into the bread which croesus was to eat .
the <unk> received the poison and promised to obey .
but , instead of doing so , she revealed the intended murder to croesus , and gave the poison to the <name> 's own children .
in gratitude for this fidelity to him , croesus , when he came to the throne , caused this statue to be made , and now he placed it at delphi , where he supposed it would forever remain .
the memory of his faithful servant was indeed <unk> by the measure , though the statue itself , as well as all these other treasures , in process of time disappeared .
in fact , statues of brass or of marble generally make far more <unk> monuments than statues of gold ; and no structure or object of <name> is likely to be very permanent among mankind unless the workmanship is worth more than the material .
croesus did not proceed himself to delphi with these presents , but sent them by the hands of trusty messengers , who were instructed to perform the ceremonies required , to offer the gifts , and then to make inquiries of the oracle in the following terms .
" croesus the sovereign of <name> and of various other kingdoms , in return for the wisdom which has marked your former declarations , has sent you these gifts .
he now furthermore desires to know whether it is safe for him to proceed against the persians , and if so , whether it is best for him to seek the assistance of any allies . "
the answer was as follows : " if croesus crosses the <unk> , and <unk> a war with persia , a mighty empire <name> be overthrown .
it <name> be best for him to form an alliance with the most powerful states of greece . "
croesus was extremely pleased with this response .
he immediately resolved on undertaking the expedition against <name> ; and to express his gratitude for so favorable an answer to his questions , he sent to delphi to inquire what was the number of inhabitants in the city , and , when the answer was reported to him , he sent a present of a sum of money to every one .
the <unk> , in their turn , conferred special privileges and honors upon the <unk> and upon croesus in respect to their oracle , giving them the precedence in all future consultations , and conferring upon them other marks of distinction and honor .
at the time when croesus sent his present to the inhabitants of delphi , he took the opportunity to address another inquiry to the oracle , which was , whether his power would ever decline .
the oracle replied in a <unk> of greek verse , similar in its style to the one recorded on the previous occasion .
it was as follows : " <unk> a mule shall mount upon the median throne , then , and not till then , shall great croesus fear to lose his own . "
this answer pleased the king quite as much as the former one had done .
the allusion to the contingency of a mule 's reigning in media he very naturally regarded as only a <unk> and <unk> mode of expressing an utter impossibility .
croesus considered himself and the continuance of his power as perfectly secure .
he was fully confirmed in his determination to organize his expedition without any delay , and to proceed immediately to the proper measures for obtaining the grecian alliance and aid which the oracle had recommended .
the plans which he formed , and the events which resulted , <name> be described in subsequent chapters .
in respect to these grecian oracles , it is proper here to state , that there has been much discussion among scholars on the question how they were enabled to maintain , for so long a period , so extended a credit among a people as intellectual and well informed as the greeks .
it was doubtless by means of a variety of contrivances and influences that this end was attained .
there is a natural love of the marvelous among the humbler classes in all countries , which leads them to be very ready to believe in what is mystic and supernatural ; and they accordingly exaggerate and color such real incidents as occur under any strange or remarkable circumstances , and invest any unusual phenomena which they witness with a miraculous or supernatural interest .
the cave at delphi might really have emitted gases which would produce quite striking effects upon those who <unk> them ; and how easy it would be for those who witnessed these effects to imagine that some divine and miraculous powers must exist in the <unk> current which produced them .
the priests and priestesses , who inhabited the temples in which these oracles were contained , had , of course , a strong interest in keeping up the belief of their reality in the minds of the community ; so were , in fact , all the inhabitants of the cities which sprung up around them .
they derived their support from the visitors who frequented these places , and they contrived various ways for drawing contributions , both of money and gifts , from all who came .
in one case there was a sacred stream near an oracle , where persons , on permission from the priests , were allowed to bathe .
after the bathing , they were expected to throw pieces of money into the stream .
what afterward , in such cases , became of the money , it is not difficult to imagine .
nor is it necessary to suppose that all these priests and priestesses were impostors .
having been trained up from infancy to believe that the inspirations were real , they would continue to look upon them as such all their lives .
even at the present day we shall all , if we closely <unk> our mental habits , find ourselves continuing to take for granted , in our <unk> years , what we <unk> imbibed or were erroneously taught in infancy , and that , often , in cases where the most obvious dictates of reason , or even the plain testimony of our senses , might show us that our notions are false .
the priests and priestesses , therefore , who imposed on the rest of mankind , may have been as honestly and as deep in the delusion themselves as any of their <unk> .
the answers of the oracles were generally vague and indefinite , and susceptible of almost any interpretation , according to the result .
whenever the event corresponded with the prediction , or could be made to correspond with it by the ingenuity of the <unk> , the story of the coincidence would , of course , be every where spread abroad , becoming more striking and more exact at each repetition .
where there was a failure , it would not be direct and absolute , on account of the <unk> and <unk> of the response , and there would therefore be no interest felt in hearing or in circulating the story .
the cases , thus , which would tend to establish the truth of the oracle , would be universally known and remembered , while those of a contrary bearing would be speedily forgotten .
there is no doubt , however , that in many cases the responses were given in collusion with the one who consulted the oracle , for the purpose of deceiving others .
for example , let us suppose that croesus wished to establish strongly the <unk> of the <unk> oracle in the minds of his countrymen , in order to encourage them to enlist in his armies , and to engage in the enterprise which he was contemplating against <name> with resolution and confidence ; it would have been easy for him to have let the priestess at delphi know what he was doing on the day when he sent to inquire , and thus himself to have directed her answer .
then , when his messengers returned , he would appeal to the answer as proof of the reality of the inspiration which seemed to furnish it .
<name> the great certainly did , in this way , act in collusion with the priests at the <name> of jupiter ammon .
* * * * * the fact that there have been so many and such successful cases of falsehood and imposture among mankind in respect to revelations from heaven , is no indication , as some <unk> suppose , that no revelation is true , but is , on the other hand , strong evidence to the contrary .
the author of human existence has given no instincts in vain ; and the universal tendency of mankind to believe in the supernatural , to look into an unseen world , to seek , and to imagine that they find , revelations from heaven , and to expect a continuance of existence after this earthly life is over , is the strongest possible natural evidence that there is an unseen world ; that man may have true communications with it ; that a personal deity reigns , who <unk> and <unk> of human conduct , and that there is a future state of being .
in this point of view , the absurd oracles of greece , and the universal <unk> which they obtained , constitute strong evidence that there is somewhere to be found inspiration and prophecy really divine .

b.c .

there were , in fact , three inducements which combined their influence on the mind of croesus , in leading him to cross the <unk> , and invade the dominions of the medes and persians : first , he was ambitious to extend his own empire ; secondly , he feared that if he did not attack <name> , <name> would himself cross the <unk> and attack him ; and , thirdly , he felt under some obligation to consider himself the ally of astyages , and thus bound to espouse his cause , and to aid him in putting down , if possible , the usurpation of <name> , and in recovering his throne .
he felt under this obligation because astyages was his brother-in-law ; for the latter had married , many years before , a daughter of <unk> , who was the father of croesus .
this , as croesus thought , gave him a just title to interfere between the <unk> king and the rebel who had <unk> him .
under the influence of all these reasons combined , and encouraged by the responses of the oracle , he determined on attempting the invasion .
the first measure which he adopted was to form an alliance with the most powerful of the states of greece , as he had been directed to do by the oracle .
after much inquiry and consideration , he concluded that the <unk> state was the most powerful .
their chief city was sparta , in the peloponnesus .
they were a warlike , stern , and indomitable race of men , capable of bearing every possible hardship , and of enduring every degree of fatigue and toil , and they desired nothing but military <name> for their reward .
this was a species of wages which it was very easy to pay ; much more easy to furnish than coin , even for croesus , notwithstanding the abundant supplies of gold which he was accustomed to obtain from the sands of the <unk> .
croesus sent embassadors to sparta to inform the people of the plans which he contemplated , and to ask their aid .
he had been instructed , he said , by the oracle at delphi , to seek the alliance of the most powerful of the states of greece , and he accordingly made application to them .
they were gratified with the compliment implied in selecting them , and acceded readily to his proposal .
besides , they were already on very friendly terms with croesus ; for , some years before , they had sent to him to procure some gold for a statue which they had occasion to erect , offering to give an equivalent for the value of it in such productions as their country afforded .
croesus supplied them with the gold that they needed , but generously refused to receive any return .
in the mean time , croesus went on , energetically , at sardis , making the preparations for his campaign .
one of his counselors , whose name was <unk> , ventured , one day , strongly to dissuade him from undertaking the expedition .
" you have nothing to gain by it , " said he , " if you succeed , and every thing to lose if you fail .
consider what sort of people these persians are whom you are going to combat .
they live in the most rude and simple manner , without luxuries , without pleasures , without wealth .
if you conquer their country , you <name> find nothing in it worth bringing away .
on the other hand , if they conquer you , they <name> come like a vast band of <unk> into <name> , where there is every thing to tempt and reward them .
i counsel you to leave them alone , and to remain on this side the <unk> , thankful if <name> <name> be contented to remain on the other . "
but croesus was not in a mood of mind to be persuaded by such reasoning .
when all things were ready , the army commenced its march and moved eastward , through one province of <name> minor after another , until they reached the <unk> .
this river is a considerable stream , which rises in the interior of the country , and flows northward into the <unk> sea .
the army encamped on the banks of it , and some plan was to be formed for crossing the stream .
in accomplishing this object , croesus was aided by a very celebrated engineer who accompanied his army , named <unk> .
<unk> was a native of miletus , and is generally called in history , <unk> the <unk> .
he was a very able mathematician and <unk> , and many accounts remain of the discoveries and performances by which he acquired his renown .
for example , in the course of his travels , he at one time visited egypt , and while there , he contrived a very simple way of measuring the height of the pyramids .
he set up a pole on the plain in an upright position , and then measured the pole and also its shadow .
he also measured the length of the shadow of the pyramid .
he then calculated the height of the pyramid by this proportion : as the length of shadow of the pole is to that of the pole itself , so is the length of the shadow of the pyramid to its height .
<unk> was an astronomer as well as a philosopher and engineer .
he learned more exactly the true length of the year than it had been known before ; and he also made some calculations of <unk> , at least so far as to predict the year in which they would happen .
one eclipse which he predicted happened to occur on the day of a great battle between two contending armies .
it was cloudy , so that the combatants could not see the sun .
this circumstance , however , which concealed the eclipse itself , only made the darkness which was caused by it the more intense .
the armies were much terrified at this sudden cessation of the light of day , and supposed it to be a warning from heaven that they should desist from the combat .
<unk> the <unk> was the author of several of the geometrical <unk> and demonstrations now included in the elements of euclid .
the celebrated fifth proposition of the first book , so famous among all the modern nations of europe as the great stumbling block in the way of beginners in the study of geometry , was his .
the discovery of the truth expressed in this proposition , and of the complicated demonstration which establishes it , was certainly a much greater mathematical performance than the measuring of the altitude of the pyramids by their shadow .
but to return to croesus .
<unk> undertook the work of transporting the army across the river .
he examined the banks , and found , at length , a spot where the land was low and level for some distance from the stream .
he caused the army to be brought up to the river at this point , and to be encamped there , as near to the bank as possible , and in as compact a form .
he then employed a vast number of laborers to cut a new channel for the waters , behind the army , leading out from the river above , and <unk> it again at a little distance below .
when this channel was finished , he turned the river into its new course , and then the army passed without difficulty over the former bed of the stream .
the <unk> being thus passed , croesus moved on in the direction of media .
but he soon found that he had not far to go to find his enemy .
<name> had heard of his plans through deserters and spies , and he had for some time been advancing to meet him .
one after the other of the nations through whose dominions he had passed , he had subjected to his sway , or , at least , brought under his influence by treaties and alliances , and had received from them all re-enforcements to swell the <name> of his army .
one nation only remained  the babylonians .
they were on the side of croesus .
they were jealous of the growing power of the medes and persians , and had made a league with croesus , promising to aid him in the war .
the other nations of the east were in alliance with <name> , and he was slowly moving on , at the head of an immense combined force , toward the <unk> , at the very time when croesus was crossing the stream .
the scouts , therefore , that preceded the army of croesus on its march , soon began to fall back into the camp , with intelligence that there was a large armed force coming on to meet them , the advancing columns filling all the roads , and threatening to overwhelm them .
the scouts from the army of <name> carried back similar intelligence to him .
the two armies accordingly halted and began to prepare for battle .
the place of their meeting was called <unk> .
it was in the province of <unk> , and toward the eastern part of <name> minor .
a great battle was fought at <unk> .
it was continued all day , and remained undecided when the sun went down .
the combatants separated when it became dark , and each withdrew from the field .
each king found , it seems , that his antagonist was more formidable than he had imagined , and on the morning after the battle they both seemed inclined to remain in their respective encampments , without evincing any disposition to renew the contest .
croesus , in fact , seems to have considered that he was fortunate in having so far repulsed the formidable invasion which <name> had been intending for him .
he considered <name> 's army as repulsed , since they had withdrawn from the field , and showed no disposition to return to it .
he had no doubt that <name> would now go back to media again , having found how well prepared croesus had been to receive him .
for himself , he concluded that he ought to be satisfied with the advantage which he had already gained , as the result of one campaign , and return again to sardis to recruit his army , the force of which had been considerably impaired by the battle , and so postpone the grand invasion till the next season .
he accordingly set out on his return .
he dispatched messengers , at the same time , to babylon , to sparta , to egypt , and to other countries with which he was in alliance , informing these various nations of the great battle of <unk> and its results , and asking them to send him , early in the following spring , all the re-enforcements that they could command , to join him in the grand campaign which he was going to make the next season .
he continued his march homeward without any interruption , sending off , from time to time , as he was moving through his own dominions , such portions of his troops as desired to return to their homes , <unk> upon them to come back to him in the spring .
by this temporary <unk> of a portion of his army , he saved the expense of maintaining them through the <name> .
very soon after croesus arrived at sardis , the whole country in the neighborhood of the capital was thrown into a state of universal alarm by the news that <name> was close at hand .
it seems that <name> had remained in the vicinity of <unk> long enough to allow croesus to return , and to give him time to dismiss his troops and establish himself securely in the city .
he then suddenly resumed his march , and came on toward sardis with the utmost possible dispatch .
croesus , in fact , had no announcement of his approach until he heard of his arrival .
all was now confusion and alarm , both within and without the city .
croesus hastily collected all the forces that he could command .
he sent immediately to the neighboring cities , summoning all the troops in them to hasten to the capital .
he enrolled all the inhabitants of the city that were capable of bearing arms .
by these means he collected , in a very short time , quite a formidable force , which he <name> up , in battle array , on a great plain not far from the city , and there waited , with much anxiety and solicitude , for <name> to come on .
the lydian army was superior to that of <name> in cavalry , and as the place where the battle was to be fought was a plain , which was the kind of ground most favorable for the operations of that species of force , <name> felt some solicitude in respect to the impression which might be made by it on his army .
nothing is more terrible than the onset of a squadron of horse when charging an enemy upon the field of battle .
they come in vast bodies , sometimes consisting of many thousands , with the speed of the wind , the men flourishing their <unk> and rending the air with the most unearthly cries , those in advance being driven irresistibly on by the weight and impetus of the masses behind .
the dreadful torrent bears down and <unk> every thing that attempts to resist its way .
they trample one another and their enemies together promiscuously in the dust ; the foremost of the column press on with the utmost fury , afraid quite as much of the headlong torrent of friends coming on behind them , as of the line of fixed and motionless enemies who stand ready to receive them before .
these enemies , stationed to withstand the charge , arrange themselves in triple or quadruple rows , with the shafts of their spears planted against the ground , and the points directed forward and upward to receive the advancing horsemen .
these spears <unk> and kill the foremost horses ; but those that come on behind , leaping and plunging over their fallen companions , soon break through the lines and put their enemies to flight , in a scene of indescribable havoc and confusion .
croesus had large bodies of horse , while <name> had no efficient troops to oppose them .
he had a great number of camels in the rear of his army , which had been employed as beasts of burden to transport the baggage and stores of the army on their march .
<name> concluded to make the experiment of opposing these camels to the cavalry .
it is frequently said by the ancient historians that the horse has a natural antipathy to the camel , and can not bear either the smell or the sight of one , though this is not found to be the case at the present day .
however the fact might have been in this respect , <name> determined to arrange the camels in his front as he advanced into battle .
he accordingly ordered the baggage to be removed , and , releasing their ordinary drivers from the charge of them , he assigned each one to the care of a soldier , who was to mount him , armed with a spear .
even if the supposed antipathy of the horse for the camel did not take effect , <name> thought that their large and heavy bodies , defended by the spears of their riders , would afford the most effectual means of resistance against the shock of the lydian squadrons that he was now able to command .
the battle commenced , and the squadrons of horse came on .
but , as soon as they came near the camels , it happened that , either from the influence of the antipathy above referred to , or from alarm at the novelty of the spectacle of such huge and <unk> beasts , or else because of the substantial resistance which the camels and the spears of their riders made to the shock of their charge , the horses were soon thrown into confusion and put to flight .
in fact , a general panic seized them , and they became totally unmanageable .
some threw their riders ; others , seized with a sort of phrensy , became entirely independent of control .
they turned , and trampled the foot soldiers of their own army under foot , and threw the whole body into disorder .
the consequence was , that the army of croesus was wholly defeated ; they fled in confusion , and crowded in vast throngs through the gates into the city , and fortified themselves there .
<name> advanced to the city , invested it closely on all sides , and commenced a siege .
but the appearances were not very encouraging .
the walls were lofty , thick , and strong , and the <name> within the city were amply sufficient to guard them .
nor was the prospect much more promising of being soon able to reduce the city by famine .
the wealth of croesus had enabled him to lay up almost inexhaustible stores of food and clothing , as well as treasures of silver and gold .
he hoped , therefore , to be able to hold out against the besiegers until help should come from some of his allies .
he had sent messengers to them , asking them to come to his rescue without any delay , before he was shut up in the city .
the city of sardis was built in a position naturally strong , and one part of the wall passed over <name> precipices which were considered entirely impassable .
there was a sort of <name> or <name> gorge in this quarter , outside of the walls , down which dead bodies were thrown on one occasion subsequently , at a time when the city was besieged , and beasts and birds of prey fed upon them there undisturbed , so lonely was the place and so desolate .
in fact , the walls that crowned these precipices were considered absolutely inaccessible , and were very slightly built and very feebly guarded .
there was an ancient legend that , a long time before , when a certain males was king of <name> , one of his wives had a son in the form of a lion , whom they called <name> , and an oracle declared that if this <name> were carried around the walls of the city , it would be rendered impregnable , and should never be taken .
they carried <name> , therefore , around , so far as the regular walls extended .
when they came to this precipice of rocks , they returned , considering that this part of the city was impregnable without any such ceremony .
a spur or eminence from the mountain of <unk> , which was behind the city , projected into it at this point , and there was a strong citadel built upon its summit .
[ illustration : the siege of sardis . ]
<name> continued the siege fourteen days , and then he determined that he must , in some way or other , find the means of carrying it by assault , and to do this he must find some place to scale the walls .
he accordingly sent a party of horsemen around to explore every part , offering them a large reward if they would find any place where an entrance could be effected .
the horsemen made the circuit , and reported that their search had been in vain .
at length a certain soldier , named <unk> , after studying for some time the precipices on the side which had been deemed inaccessible , saw a sentinel , who was stationed on the walls above , leave his post and come climbing down the rocks for some distance to get his helmet , which had accidentally dropped down .
<unk> watched him both as he descended and as he returned .
he reflected on this discovery , communicated it to others , and the <unk> of scaling the rock and the walls at that point was discussed .
in the end , the attempt was made and was successful .
<unk> went up first , followed by a few daring spirits who were ambitious of the <name> of the exploit .
they were not at first observed from above .
the way being thus shown , great <name> followed on , and so large a force succeeded in thus gaining an entrance that the city was taken .
in the dreadful confusion and din of the storming of the city , croesus himself had a very narrow escape from death .
he was saved by the miraculous speaking of his deaf and dumb son  at least such is the story .
<name> had given positive orders to his soldiers , both before the great battle on the plain and during the siege , that , though they might slay <unk> else they pleased , they must not harm croesus , but must take him alive .
during the time of the storming of the town , when the streets were filled with infuriated soldiers , those on the one side wild with the excitement of triumph , and those on the other maddened with rage and despair , a party , rushing along , overtook croesus and his helpless son , whom the unhappy father , it seems , was making a desperate effort to save .
the persian soldiers were about to <unk> croesus with their spears , when the son , who had never spoken before , called out , " it is croesus ; do not kill him . "
the soldiers were arrested by the words , and saved the monarch 's life .
they made him prisoner , and bore him away to <name> .
croesus had sent , a long time before , to inquire of the <unk> oracle by what means the power of speech could be restored to his son .
the answer was , that that was a boon which he had better not ask ; for the day on which he should hear his son speak for the first time , would be the darkest and most unhappy day of his life .
<name> had not ordered his soldiers to spare the life of croesus in battle from any sentiment of humanity toward him , but because he wished to have his case reserved for his own decision .
when croesus was brought to him a captive , he ordered him to be put in chains , and carefully guarded .
as soon as some degree of order was restored in the city , a large funeral pile was erected , by his directions , in a public square , and croesus was brought to the spot .
fourteen lydian young men , the sons , probably , of the most prominent men in the state , were with him .
the pile was large enough for them all , and they were placed upon it .
they were all laid upon the wood .
croesus raised himself and looked around , surveying with extreme consternation and horror the preparations which were making for lighting the pile .
his heart sank within him as he thought of the dreadful fate that was before him .
the spectators stood by in solemn silence , awaiting the end .
croesus broke this awful pause by crying out , in a tone of anguish and despair , " oh solon !
solon !
solon ! "
the officers who had charge of the execution asked him what he meant .
<name> , too , who was himself personally superintending the scene , asked for an explanation .
croesus was , for a time , too much agitated and distracted to reply .
there were difficulties in respect to language , too , which embarrassed the conversation , as the two kings could speak to each other only through an interpreter .
at length croesus gave an account of his interview with solon , and of the sentiment which the philosopher had expressed , that no one could decide whether a man was truly prosperous and happy till it was determined how his life was to end .
<name> was greatly interested in this narrative ; but , in the mean time , the interpreting of the conversation had been slow , a considerable period had elapsed , and the officers had lighted the fire .
the pile had been made extremely combustible , and the fire was rapidly making its way through the whole mass .
<name> eagerly ordered it to be extinguished .
the efforts which the soldiers made for this purpose seemed , at first , likely to be fruitless ; but they were aided very soon by a sudden shower of rain , which , coming down from the mountains , began , just at this time , to fall ; and thus the flames were extinguished , and croesus and the captives saved .
<name> immediately , with a <unk> very common among great monarchs in the treatment of both enemies and favorites , began to consider croesus as his friend .
he ordered him to be unbound , brought him near his person , and treated him with great consideration and honor .
croesus remained after this for a long time with <name> , and accompanied him in his subsequent campaigns .
he was very much incensed at the oracle at delphi for having deceived him by its false responses and predictions , and thus led him into the terrible snare into which he had fallen .
he procured the fetters with which he had been chained when placed upon the pile , and sent them to delphi with orders that they should be thrown down upon the threshold of the <name>  the visible symbol of his captivity and ruin  as a reproach to the oracle for having <unk> him and caused his destruction .
in doing this , the messengers were to ask the oracle whether <unk> like that which had been practiced on croesus was the kind of gratitude it evinced to one who had enriched it by such a profusion of offerings and gifts .
to this the priests of the oracle said in reply , that the destruction of the lydian dynasty had long been decreed by the fates , in retribution for the guilt of gyges , the founder of the line .
he had murdered his master , and usurped the throne , without any title to it whatever .
the judgments of heaven had been denounced upon gyges for this crime , to fall on himself or on some of his descendants .
the <unk> apollo at delphi had done all in his power to postpone the falling of the blow until after the death of croesus , on account of the <unk> <unk> which he had made to the oracle ; but he had been unable to effect it : the decrees of fate were inexorable .
all that the oracle could do was to postpone  as it had done , it said , for three years  the execution of the sentence , and to give croesus warning of the evil that was impending .
this had been done by announcing to him that his crossing the <unk> would cause the destruction of a mighty empire , meaning that of <name> , and also by informing him that when he should find a mule upon the throne of media he must expect to lose his own .
<name> , who was descended , on the father 's side , from the persian stock , and on the mother 's from that of media , was the hybrid sovereign represented by the mule .
when this answer was reported to croesus , it is said that he was satisfied with the explanations , and admitted that the oracle was right , and that he himself had been unreasonable and wrong .
however this may be , it is certain that , among mankind at large , since croesus 's day , there has been a great disposition to overlook whatever of <unk> there may have been in the falsehood and imposture of the oracle , through admiration of the adroitness and dexterity which its ministers evinced in saving themselves from exposure .

in his advance toward the dominions of croesus in <name> minor , <name> had passed to the northward of the great and celebrated city of babylon .
babylon was on the euphrates , toward the southern part of <name> .
it was the capital of a large and very fertile region , which extended on both sides of the euphrates toward the persian gulf .
the limits of the country , however , which was subject to babylon , varied very much at different times , as they were extended or contracted by revolutions and wars .
the river euphrates was the great source of fertility for the whole region through which it flowed .
the country watered by this river was very densely populated , and the inhabitants were industrious and peaceable , cultivating their land , and living quietly and happily on its fruits .
the surface was intersected with canals , which the people had made for conveying the water of the river over the land for the purpose of <unk> it .
some of these canals were navigable .
there was one great trunk which passed from the euphrates to the <unk> , supplying many minor canals by the way , that was navigable for vessels of considerable burden .
the traffic of the country was , however , mainly conducted by means of boats of moderate size , the construction of which seemed to herodotus very curious and remarkable .
the city was enormously large , and required immense supplies of food , which were brought down in these boats from the agricultural country above .
the boats were made in the following manner : first a frame was built , of the shape of the intended boat , broad and shallow , and with the stem and stern of the same form .
this frame was made of willows , like a basket , and , when finished , was covered with a <unk> of skins .
a layer of reeds was then spread over the bottom of the boat to protect the frame , and to distribute evenly the pressure of the cargo .
the boat , thus finished , was laden with the produce of the country , and was then floated down the river to babylon .
in this navigation the boatmen were careful to protect the leather <unk> from injury by avoiding all contact with rocks , or even with the gravel of the shores .
they kept their craft in the middle of the stream by means of two oars , or , rather , an oar and a paddle , which were worked , the first at the bows , and the second at the stern .
the advance of the boat was in some measure accelerated by these boatmen , though their main function was to steer their vessel by keeping it out of eddies and away from projecting points of land , and directing its course to those parts of the stream where the current was swiftest , and where it would consequently be borne forward most rapidly to its destination .
these boats were generally of very considerable size , and they carried , in addition to their cargo and crew , one or more beasts of burden  generally asses or mules .
these animals were allowed the pleasure , if any pleasure it was to them , of sailing thus idly down the stream , for the sake of having them at hand at the end of the voyage , to <name> back again , up the country , the skins , which constituted the most valuable portion of the craft they sailed in .
it was found that these skins , if carefully preserved , could be easily transported up the river , and would answer the purpose of a second voyage .
accordingly , when the boats arrived at babylon , the cargo was sold , the boats were broken up , the skins were folded into packs , and in this form the mules carried them up the river again , the boatmen driving the mules as they walked by their side .
babylon was a city of immense extent and magnitude .
in fact , the accounts given of the space which it covered have often been considered incredible .
these accounts make the space which was included within the walls four or five times as large as london .
a great deal of this space was , however , occupied by parks and gardens connected with the <name> palaces , and by open squares .
then , besides , the houses occupied by the common people in the ancient cities were of fewer stories in height , and consequently more extended on the ground , than those built in modern times .
in fact , it is probable that , in many instances , they were mere ranges of huts and hovels , as is the case , indeed , to a considerable extent , in oriental cities , at the present day , so that it is not at all impossible that even so large an area as four or five times the size of london may have been included within the fortifications of the city .
in respect to the walls of the city , very extraordinary and apparently contradictory accounts are given by the various ancient authors who described them .
some make them seventy-five and others two or three hundred feet high .
there have been many discussions in respect to the comparative <unk> of these several statements , and some ingenious attempts have been made to reconcile them .
it is not , however , at all surprising that there should be such a diversity in the dimensions given , for the <unk> of an ancient city was seldom of the same height in all places .
the structure necessarily varied according to the nature of the ground , being high wherever the ground without was such as to give the enemy an advantage in an attack , and lower in other situations , where the conformation of the surface was such as to afford , of itself , a partial protection .
it is not , perhaps , impossible that , at some particular points  as , for example , across glens and ravines , or along steep declivities  the walls of babylon may have been raised even to the very extraordinary height which herodotus <unk> to them .
the walls were made of bricks , and the bricks were formed of <name> and earth , which was dug from a trench made outside of the lines .
this trench served the purpose of a ditch , to strengthen the fortification when the wall was completed .
the water from the river , and from streams flowing toward the river , was admitted to these ditches on every side , and kept them always full .
the sides of these ditches were lined with bricks too , which were made , like those of the walls , from the earth obtained from the excavations .
they used for all this masonry a cement made from a species of <unk> , which was found in great quantities floating down one of the rivers which flowed into the euphrates , in the neighborhood of babylon .
the river euphrates itself flowed through the city .
there was a <unk> or low wall along the banks of it on either side , with openings at the terminations of the streets leading to the water , and flights of steps to go down .
these openings were secured by gates of brass , which , when closed , would prevent an enemy from gaining access to the city from the river .
the great streets , which terminated thus at the river on one side , extended to the walls of the city on the other , and they were crossed by other streets at right angles to them .
in the outer walls of the city , at the extremities of all these streets , were massive gates of brass , with hinges and frames of the same metal .
there were a hundred of these gates in all .
they were guarded by watch-towers on the walls above .
the watch-towers were built on both the inner and outer faces of the wall , and the wall itself was so broad that there was room between these watch-towers for a chariot and four to drive and turn .
the river , of course , divided the city into two parts .
the king's palace was in the center of one of these divisions , within a vast circular inclosure , which contained the palace buildings , together with the spacious courts , and parks , and gardens pertaining to them .
in the center of the other division was a corresponding inclosure , which contained the great <name> of <unk> .
here there was a very lofty tower , divided into eight separate towers , one above another , with a winding staircase to ascend to the summit .
in the upper story was a sort of chapel , with a couch , and a table , and other furniture for use in the sacred ceremonies , all of gold .
above this , on the highest platform of all , was a grand observatory , where the <unk> <unk> made their celestial observations .
there was a bridge across the river , connecting one section of the city with the other , and it is said that there was a subterranean passage under the river also , which was used as a private communication between two public edifices  palaces or <unk>  which were situated near the extremities of the bridge .
all these constructions were of the most grand and imposing character .
in addition to the architectural magnificence of the buildings , the gates and walls were embellished with a great variety of sculptures : images of animals , of every form and in every attitude ; and men , single and in groups , models of great sovereigns , and representations of hunting scenes , battle scenes , and great events in the <unk> history .
the most remarkable , however , of all the wonders of babylon  though perhaps not built till after <name> 's time  were what were called the hanging gardens .
although called the hanging gardens , they were not suspended in any manner , as the name might denote , but were supported upon arches and walls .
the arches and walls sustained a succession of terraces , rising one above another , with broad flights of steps for ascending to them , and on these terraces the gardens were made .
the upper terrace , or platform , was several hundred feet from the ground ; so high , that it was necessary to build arches upon arches within , in order to attain the requisite elevation .
the lateral thrust of these arches was sustained by a wall twenty-five feet in thickness , which surrounded the garden on all sides , and rose as high as the <unk> tier of arches , upon which would , of course , be concentrated the pressure and weight of all the pile .
the whole structure thus formed a sort of artificial hill , square in form , and rising , in a succession of terraces , to a broad and level area upon the top .
the extent of this grand square upon the summit was four hundred feet upon each side .
the surface which served as the foundation for the gardens that adorned these successive terraces and the area above was formed in the following manner : over the masonry of the arches there was laid a pavement of broad flat stones , sixteen feet long and four feet wide .
over these there was placed a stratum of reeds , laid in <unk> , and above them another flooring of bricks , cemented closely together , so as to be impervious to water .
to make the security complete in this respect , the upper surface of this brick flooring was covered with sheets of lead , overlapping each other in such a manner as to convey all the water which might <unk> through the mold away to the sides of the garden .
the earth and mold were placed upon this surface , thus prepared , and the stratum was so deep as to allow large trees to take root and grow in it .
there was an engine constructed in the middle of the upper terrace , by which water could be drawn up from the river , and distributed over every part of the vast pile .
the gardens , thus completed , were filled to profusion with every species of tree , and plant , and vine , which could produce fruit or flowers to enrich or adorn such a scene .
every country in communication with babylon was made to contribute something to increase the endless variety of <unk> beauty which was here literally <unk> .
gardeners of great experience and skill were constantly employed in cultivating the <unk> , <unk> the fruit-trees and the vines , preserving the walks , and introducing new varieties of vegetation .
in a word , the hanging gardens of babylon became one of the wonders of the world .
the country in the neighborhood of babylon , extending from the river on either hand was in general level and low , and subject to inundations .
one of the sovereigns of the country , a <name> named <unk> , had formed the grand design of constructing an immense lake , to take off the superfluous water in case of a flood , and thus prevent an overflow .
she also opened a great number of lateral and winding channels for the river , wherever the natural disposition of the surface afforded facilities for doing so , and the earth which was taken out in the course of these excavations was employed in raising the banks by artificial terraces , such as are made to confine the mississippi at new orleans , and are there called levees .
[ b ] the object of <unk> in these measures was <unk> .
she wished , in the first place , to open all practicable channels for the flow of the water , and then to confine the current within the channels thus made .
she also wished to make the navigation of the stream as intricate and complicated as possible , so that , while the natives of the country might easily find their way , in boats , to the capital , a foreign enemy , if he should make the attempt , might be confused and lost .
these were the rivers of babylon on the banks of which the captive jews sat down and wept when they remembered zion .
[ footnote b : from the french word <unk> , raised . ]
this <name> <unk> seems to have been quite distinguished for her engineering and architectural plans .
it was she that built the bridge across the euphrates , within the city ; and as there was a feeling of jealousy and ill <name> , as usual in such a case , between the two divisions of the town which the river formed , she caused the bridge to be constructed with a movable platform or draw , by means of which the communication might be cut off at pleasure .
this draw was generally up at night and down by day .
herodotus relates a curious anecdote of this <name> , which , if true , <unk> in another way the peculiar originality of mind and the ingenuity which characterized all her operations .
she caused her tomb to be built , before her death , over one of the principal gates of the city .
upon the <unk> of this monument was a very conspicuous inscription to this effect : " if any one of the sovereigns , my successors , shall be in extreme want of money , let him open my tomb and take what he may think proper ; but let him not resort to this resource unless the urgency is extreme . "
the tomb remained for some time after the <name> 's death quite undisturbed .
in fact , the people of the city avoided this gate altogether , on account of the dead body deposited above it , and the spot became well-nigh deserted .
at length , in process of time , a subsequent sovereign , being in want of money , ventured to open the tomb .
he found , however , no money within .
the gloomy vault contained nothing but the dead body of the <name> , and a label with this inscription : " if your avarice were not as insatiable as it is base , you would not have intruded on the repose of the dead . "
it was not surprising that <name> , having been so successful in his enterprises thus far , should now begin to turn his thoughts toward this great <unk> empire , and to feel a <name> to bring it under his sway .
the first thing , however , was to confirm and secure his lydian conquests .
he spent some time , therefore , in organizing and arranging , at sardis , the affairs of the new government which he was to substitute for that of croesus there .
he designated certain portions of his army to be left for garrisons in the conquered cities .
he appointed persian officers , of course , to command these forces ; but , as he wished to conciliate the <unk> , he appointed many of the municipal and civil officers of the country from among them .
there would appear to be no danger in doing this , as , by giving the command of the army to persians , he retained all the real power directly in his own hands .
one of these civil officers , the most important , in fact , of all , was the grand treasurer .
to him <name> committed the charge of the stores of gold and silver which came into his possession at sardis , and of the revenues which were afterward to <unk> .
<name> appointed a lydian named <unk> to this trust , hoping by such measures to conciliate the people of the country , and to make them more ready to submit to his sway .
things being thus arranged , <name> , taking croesus with him , set out with the main army to return toward the east .
as soon as he had left <name> , <unk> excited the <unk> to revolt .
the name of the commander-in-chief of the military forces which <name> had left was <unk> .
<unk> abandoned the city and retired toward the coast where he contrived to raise a large army , formed partly of <unk> and partly of bodies of foreign troops , which he was enabled to hire by means of the treasures which <name> had put under his charge .
he then advanced to sardis , took possession of the town , and shut up <unk> , with his persian troops , in the citadel .
when the tidings of these events came to <name> , he was very much incensed , and determined to destroy the city .
croesus , however , <unk> very earnestly in its behalf .
he recommended that <name> , instead of burning sardis , should send a sufficient force to <unk> the population , and that he should then <unk> such laws and make such arrangements as should turn the minds of the people to habits of luxury and pleasure .
" by doing this , " said croesus , " the people <name> , in a short time , become so <unk> and so <unk> that you <name> have nothing to fear from them . "
<name> decided on adopting this plan .
he dispatched a median named <unk> , an officer of his army , at the head of a strong force , with orders to go back to sardis , to deliver <unk> from his danger , to seize and put to death all the leaders in the lydian rebellion excepting <unk> .
<unk> was to be saved alive , and sent a prisoner to <name> in persia .
<unk> did not wait for the arrival of <unk> .
as soon as he heard of his approach , he abandoned the ground , and fled <unk> to the city of <unk> , and sought refuge there .
when <unk> had reached sardis and <unk> the government of <name> there , he sent messengers to <unk> , demanding the surrender of the fugitive .
the people of <unk> were uncertain whether they ought to comply .
they said that they must first consult an oracle .
there was a very ancient and celebrated oracle near miletus .
they sent messengers to this oracle , demanding to know whether it were according to the <name> of the gods or not that the fugitive should be surrendered .
the answer brought back was , that they might surrender him .
they were accordingly making arrangements for doing this , when one of the citizens , a very prominent and influential man , named <unk> , expressed himself not satisfied with the reply .
he did not think it possible , he said , that the oracle could really counsel them to deliver up a helpless fugitive to his enemies .
