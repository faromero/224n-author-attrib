preface .
this tale originally appeared as a serial in the monthly packet , beginning in <name> , 1880 .
the writer 's intention was to embody in each knot ( like the medicine so <unk> , but <unk> , concealed in the jam of our early childhood ) one or more mathematical questions  in arithmetic , algebra , or geometry , as the case might be  for the amusement , and possible <unk> , of the fair readers of that magazine .

" goblin , lead them up and down . "
the ruddy glow of sunset was already fading into the sombre shadows of night , when two travellers might have been observed swiftly  at a pace of six miles in the hour  descending the rugged side of a mountain ; the younger bounding from crag to crag with the agility of a <name> , while his companion , whose aged limbs seemed ill at ease in the heavy chain armour habitually worn by tourists in that district , toiled on painfully at his side .
as is always the case under such circumstances , the younger knight was the first to break the silence .
" a goodly pace , i trow ! "
he exclaimed .
" we sped not thus in the ascent ! "
" goodly , indeed ! "
the other echoed with a groan .
" we <unk> it but at three miles in the hour . "
" and on the dead level our pace is   ? "
the younger suggested ; for he was weak in statistics , and left all such details to his aged companion .
" four miles in the hour , " the other wearily replied .
" not an ounce more , " he added , with that love of metaphor so common in old age , " and not a farthing less ! "
" 't was three hours past high noon when we left our hostelry , " the young man said , musingly .
" we shall scarce be back by <unk> .
perchance mine host <name> roundly deny us all food ! "
" he <name> chide our tardy return , " was the grave reply , " and such a rebuke <name> be meet . "
" a brave conceit ! "
cried the other , with a <name> laugh .
" and should we bid him bring us yet another course , i trow his answer <name> be <unk> ! "
" we shall but get our deserts , " sighed the elder knight , who had never seen a joke in his life , and was somewhat displeased at his <unk> untimely levity .
" 'twill be nine of the clock , " he added in an undertone , " by the time we regain our hostelry .
full many a mile shall we have <unk> this day ! "
" how many ?
how many ? "
cried the eager youth , ever <unk> for knowledge .
the old man was silent .
" tell me , " he answered , after a moment 's thought , " what time it was when we stood together on yonder peak .
not exact to the minute ! "
he added hastily , reading a protest in the young man 's face .
" an ' thy guess be within one poor half-hour of the <name> , 't is all i ask of thy mother's son !
then <name> i tell thee , true to the last inch , how far we shall have trudged betwixt three and nine of the clock . "
a groan was the young man 's only reply ; while his convulsed features and the deep wrinkles that chased each other across his manly brow , revealed the abyss of arithmetical agony into which one chance question had plunged him .
knot ii .
eligible apartments .
" straight down the crooked <name> , and all round the square . "
" let 's ask balbus about it , " said <name> .
" all right , " said lambert .
" he can guess it , " said <name> .
" rather , " said lambert .
no more words were needed : the two brothers understood each other perfectly .
[ illustration : " balbus was assisting his mother-in-law to convince the dragon . " ]
balbus was waiting for them at the hotel : the journey down had tired him , he said : so his two pupils had been the round of the place , in search of lodgings , without the old tutor who had been their inseparable companion from their childhood .
they had named him after the hero of their latin <unk> , which overflowed with anecdotes of that versatile genius  anecdotes whose <unk> in detail was more than compensated by their sensational <unk> .
" balbus has overcome all his enemies " had been marked by their tutor , in the margin of the book , " successful bravery . "
in this way he had tried to extract a moral from every anecdote about balbus  sometimes one of warning , as in " balbus had borrowed a healthy dragon , " against which he had written " rashness in speculation "  sometimes of encouragement , as in the words " influence of sympathy in united action , " which stood opposite to the anecdote " balbus was assisting his mother-in-law to convince the dragon "  and sometimes it dwindled down to a single word , such as " <name> , " which was all he could extract from the touching record that " balbus , having scorched the tail of the dragon , went away . "
his pupils liked the short morals best , as it left them more room for marginal illustrations , and in this instance they required all the space they could get to exhibit the rapidity of the hero 's departure .
their report of the state of things was discouraging .
that most fashionable of <unk> , little <unk> , was " <unk> " ( as the boys expressed it ) from end to end .
but in one square they had seen no less than four cards , in different houses , all announcing in flaming capitals " eligible apartments . "
" so there 's plenty of choice , after all , you see , " said spokesman <name> in conclusion .
" that does n't follow from the data , " said balbus , as he rose from the easy chair , where he had been dozing over the little <unk> gazette .
" they may be all single rooms .
however , we may as well see them .
i shall be glad to stretch my legs a bit . "
an <unk> <unk> might have objected that the operation was needless , and that this long , lank creature would have been all the better with even shorter legs : but no such thought occurred to his loving pupils .
one on each side , they did their best to keep up with his gigantic strides , while <name> repeated the sentence in their father's letter , just received from abroad , over which he and lambert had been puzzling .
" he says a friend of his , the governor of   what was that name again , lambert ? "
( " <unk> , " said lambert . )
" well , yes .
the governor of   <unk>   wants to give a very small dinner-party , and he means to ask his father 's brother-in-law , his brother 's father-in-law , his father-in-law 's brother , and his brother-in-law 's father : and we 're to guess how many guests there <name> be . "
there was an anxious pause .
" how large did he say the pudding was to be ? "
balbus said at last .
" take its cubical contents , divide by the cubical contents of what each man can eat , and the <unk>   " " he did n't say anything about pudding , " said <name> , "  and here 's the square , " as they turned a corner and came into sight of the " eligible apartments . "
" it is a square ! "
was balbus ' first cry of delight , as he gazed around him .
" beautiful !
<unk> !
<unk> !
and rectangular ! "
the boys looked round with less enthusiasm .
" number nine is the first with a card , " said <unk> lambert ; but balbus would not so soon awake from his dream of beauty .
" see , boys ! "
he cried .
" twenty doors on a side !
what symmetry !
each side divided into twenty-one equal parts !
it 's delicious ! "
" shall i knock , or ring ? "
said <name> , looking in some perplexity at a square brass plate which bore the simple inscription " ring also . "
" both , " said balbus .
" that 's an <unk> , my boy .
did you never see an <unk> before ? "
" i could n't hardly read it , " said <name> , <unk> .
" it 's no good having an <unk> , if they do n't keep it clean . "
" which there is one room , gentlemen , " said the smiling landlady .
" and a sweet room too !
as snug a little <unk>   " " we <name> see it , " said balbus gloomily , as they followed her in .
" i knew how it would be !
one room in each house !
no view , i suppose ? "
" which indeed there is , gentlemen ! "
the landlady indignantly protested , as she <name> up the blind , and indicated the back garden .
" cabbages , i perceive , " said balbus .
" well , they 're green , at any rate . "
" which the greens at the shops , " their hostess explained , " are by no means <unk> upon .
here you has them on the premises , and of the best . "
" does the window open ? "
was always balbus ' first question in testing a lodging : and " does the chimney smoke ? "
his second .
satisfied on all points , he secured the refusal of the room , and they moved on to number twenty-five .
this landlady was grave and stern .
" i 've nobbut one room left , " she told them : " and it gives on the <unk> . "
" but there are cabbages ? "
balbus suggested .
the landlady visibly relented .
" there is , sir , " she said : " and good ones , though i say it as should n't .
we ca n't rely on the shops for greens .
so we grows them ourselves . "
" a singular advantage , " said balbus : and , after the usual questions , they went on to fifty-two .
" and i 'd gladly accommodate you all , if i could , " was the greeting that met them .
" we are but mortal , " ( " irrelevant ! "
muttered balbus ) " and i've let all my rooms but one . "
" which one is a <unk> , i perceive , " said balbus : " and looking out on  on cabbages , i presume ? "
" yes , indeed , sir ! "
said their hostess .
" whatever other folks may do , we grows our own .
for the shops   " " an excellent arrangement ! "
balbus interrupted .
" then one can really depend on their being good .
does the window open ? "
the usual questions were answered satisfactorily : but this time <name> added one of his own invention  " does the cat scratch ? "
the landlady looked round suspiciously , as if to make sure the cat was not listening , " i <name> not deceive you , gentlemen , " she said .
" it do scratch , but not without you pulls its whiskers !
it 'll never do it , " she repeated slowly , with a visible effort to recall the exact words of some written agreement between herself and the cat , " without you pulls its whiskers ! "
" much may be excused in a cat so treated , " said balbus , as they left the house and crossed to number seventy-three , leaving the landlady <unk> on the doorstep , and still murmuring to herself her parting words , as if they were a form of blessing , "   not without you pulls its whiskers ! "
at number seventy-three they found only a small shy girl to show the house , who said " yes 'm " in answer to all questions .
" the usual room , " said balbus , as they marched in : " the usual <unk> , the usual cabbages .
i suppose you ca n't get them good at the shops ? "
" yes 'm , " said the girl .
" well , you may tell your mistress we <name> take the room , and that her plan of growing her own cabbages is simply admirable ! "
" yes 'm , " said the girl , as she showed them out .
" one <unk> and three <unk> , " said balbus , as they returned to the hotel .
" we <name> take as our <unk> the one that gives us the least walking to do to get to it . "
" must we walk from door to door , and count the steps ? "
said lambert .
" no , no !
figure it out , my boys , figure it out ! "
balbus gaily exclaimed , as he put pens , ink , and paper before his hapless pupils , and left the room .
" i say !
it 'll be a job ! "
said <name> .
" rather ! "
said lambert .
knot iii .
mad mathesis .
" i waited for the train . "
" well , they call me so because i am a little mad , i suppose , " she said , <unk> , in answer to <name> 's <unk> question as to how she came by so strange a <unk> .
" you see , i never do what sane people are expected to do <unk> .
i never wear long trains , ( talking of trains , that 's the charing cross metropolitan station  i've something to tell you about that ) , and i never play <unk> .
i ca n't cook an <unk> .
i ca n't even set a broken limb !
there's an <unk> for you ! "
<name> was her niece , and full twenty years her <name> ; in fact , she was still attending a high school  an institution of which mad mathesis spoke with undisguised aversion .
" let a woman be meek and lowly ! "
she would say .
" none of your high schools for me ! "
but it was <unk> just now , and <name> was her guest , and mad mathesis was showing her the sights of that eighth wonder of the world  london .
" the charing cross metropolitan station ! "
she resumed , waving her hand towards the entrance as if she were introducing her niece to a friend .
" the <unk> and <unk> extension is just completed , and the trains now run round and round continuously  skirting the border of wales , just touching at york , and so round by the east coast back to london .
the way the trains run is most peculiar .
the westerly ones go round in two hours ; the easterly ones take three ; but they always manage to start two trains from here , opposite ways , punctually every <unk> . "
" they part to meet again , " said <name> , her eyes filling with tears at the romantic thought .
" no need to cry about it ! "
her aunt grimly remarked .
" they do n't meet on the same line of rails , you know .
talking of meeting , an idea strikes me ! "
she added , changing the subject with her usual abruptness .
" let's go opposite ways round , and see which can meet most trains .
no need for a <unk>  ladies ' saloon , you know .
you shall go whichever way you like , and we 'll have a bet about it ! "
" i never make bets , " <name> said very gravely .
" our excellent <unk> has often warned us   " " you 'd be none the worse if you did ! "
mad mathesis interrupted .
" in fact , you 'd be the better , i 'm certain ! "
" neither does our excellent <unk> approve of puns , " said <name> .
" but we 'll have a match , if you like .
let me choose my train , " she added after a brief mental calculation , " and i 'll engage to meet exactly half as many again as you do . "
" not if you count fair , " mad mathesis bluntly interrupted .
" remember , we only count the trains we meet on the way .
you must n't count the one that starts as you start , nor the one that arrives as you arrive . "
" that <name> only make the difference of one train , " said <name> , as they turned and entered the station .
" but i never travelled alone before .
there 'll be no one to help me to alight .
however , i do n't mind .
let's have a match . "
a ragged little boy overheard her remark , and came running after her .
" buy a box of <unk> , miss ! "
he pleaded , pulling her shawl to attract her attention .
<name> stopped to explain .
" i never smoke cigars , " she said in a meekly apologetic tone .
" our excellent <unk>   , " but mad mathesis impatiently hurried her on , and the little boy was left gazing after her with round eyes of amazement .
the two ladies bought their tickets and moved slowly down the central platform , mad mathesis <unk> on as usual  <name> silent , anxiously <unk> the calculation on which she rested her hopes of winning the match .
" mind where you go , dear ! "
cried her aunt , checking her just in time .
" one step more , and you 'd have been in that pail of cold water ! "
" i know , i know , " <name> said , dreamily .
" the pale , the cold , and the <unk>   " " take your places on the <unk> ! "
shouted a <name> .
" what are they for ! "
<name> asked in a terrified whisper .
" merely to help us into the trains . "
the elder <name> spoke with the nonchalance of one quite used to the process .
" very few people can get into a carriage without help in less than three seconds , and the trains only stop for one second . "
at this moment the whistle was heard , and two trains rushed into the station .
a moment 's pause , and they were gone again ; but in that brief interval several hundred passengers had been shot into them , each flying straight to his place with the accuracy of a <unk> bullet  while an equal number were showered out upon the <unk> .
three hours had passed away , and the two friends met again on the charing cross platform , and eagerly compared notes .
then <name> turned away with a sigh .
to young impulsive hearts , like hers , disappointment is always a bitter pill .
mad mathesis followed her , full of kindly sympathy .
" try again , my love ! "
she said , cheerily .
" let us vary the experiment .
we <name> start as we did before , but not to begin counting till our trains meet .
when we see each other , we <name> say 'one ! '
and so count on till we come here again . "
<name> brightened up .
" i shall win that , " she exclaimed eagerly , " if i may choose my train ! "
another shriek of engine whistles , another <unk> of <unk> , another living avalanche plunging into two trains as they flashed by : and the travellers were off again .
each gazed eagerly from her carriage window , holding up her handkerchief as a signal to her friend .
a rush and a roar .
two trains shot past each other in a tunnel , and two travellers leaned back in their corners with a sigh  or rather with two sighs  of relief .
" one ! "
<name> murmured to herself .
" won !
it 's a word of good omen .
this time , at any rate , the victory <name> be mine ! "
but was it ?
knot iv .
the dead reckoning .
" i did dream of <unk> to-night . "
noonday on the open sea within a few degrees of the equator is apt to be <unk> warm ; and our two travellers were now <unk> clad in suits of dazzling white linen , having laid aside the <unk> which they had found not only <unk> in the cold mountain air they had lately been breathing , but a necessary precaution against the daggers of the <unk> who infested the heights .
their <unk> was over , and they were now on their way home , in the monthly packet which plied between the two great ports of the island they had been exploring .
along with their armour , the tourists had laid aside the <unk> speech it had pleased them to affect while in knightly disguise , and had returned to the ordinary style of two country gentlemen of the twentieth century .
stretched on a pile of cushions , under the shade of a huge umbrella , they were lazily watching some native fishermen , who had come on board at the last landing-place , each carrying over his shoulder a small but heavy sack .
a large <unk> , that had been used for cargo at the last port , stood on the deck ; and round this the fishermen had gathered , and , with much unintelligible jabber , seemed to be weighing their sacks .
" more like sparrows in a tree than human talk , is n't it ? "
the elder tourist remarked to his son , who smiled feebly , but would not exert himself so far as to speak .
the old man tried another listener .
" what have they got in those sacks , captain ? "
he inquired , as that great being passed them in his never ending parade to and fro on the deck .
the captain paused in his march , and towered over the travellers  tall , grave , and serenely <unk> .
" fishermen , " he explained , " are often passengers in my ship .
these five are from <unk>  the place we last touched at  and that 's the way they <name> their money .
the money of this island is heavy , gentlemen , but it costs little , as you may guess .
we buy it from them by weight  about five shillings a pound .
i fancy a ten <unk> would buy all those sacks . "
by this time the old man had closed his eyes  in order , no doubt , to concentrate his thoughts on these interesting facts ; but the captain failed to realise his motive , and with a grunt resumed his monotonous march .
meanwhile the fishermen were getting so noisy over the <unk> that one of the sailors took the precaution of carrying off all the weights , leaving them to amuse themselves with such substitutes in the form of <unk> , <unk> , & c. , as they could find .
this brought their excitement to a speedy end : they carefully hid their sacks in the folds of the jib that lay on the deck near the tourists , and strolled away .
when next the captain 's heavy footfall passed , the younger man roused himself to speak .
" what did you call the place those fellows came from , captain ? "
he asked .
" <unk> , sir . "
" and the one we are bound for ? "
the captain took a long breath , plunged into the word , and came out of it nobly .
" they call it <unk> , sir . "
" k  i give it up ! "
the young man faintly said .
he stretched out his hand for a glass of iced water which the compassionate steward had brought him a minute ago , and had set down , unluckily , just outside the shadow of the umbrella .
it was scalding hot , and he decided not to drink it .
the effort of making this resolution , coming close on the fatiguing conversation he had just gone through , was too much for him : he sank back among the cushions in silence .
his father courteously tried to make amends for his nonchalance .
" whereabouts are we now , captain ? "
said he , " have you any idea ? "
the captain cast a pitying look on the ignorant landsman .
" i could tell you that , sir , " he said , in a tone of lofty condescension , " to an inch ! "
" you do n't say so ! "
the old man remarked , in a tone of languid surprise .
" and mean so , " persisted the captain .
" why , what do you suppose would become of my ship , if i were to lose my longitude and my latitude ?
could you make anything of my dead reckoning ? "
" nobody could , i 'm sure ! "
the other heartily rejoined .
but he had overdone it .
" it 's perfectly intelligible , " the captain said , in an offended tone , " to any one that understands such things . "
with these words he moved away , and began giving orders to the men , who were preparing to hoist the jib .
our tourists watched the operation with such interest that neither of them remembered the five <unk> , which in another moment , as the wind filled out the jib , were whirled overboard and fell heavily into the sea .
but the poor fishermen had not so easily forgotten their property .
in a moment they had rushed to the spot , and stood uttering cries of fury , and pointing , now to the sea , and now to the sailors who had caused the disaster .
the old man explained it to the captain .
" let us make it up among us , " he added in conclusion .
" ten pounds <name> do it , i think you said ? "
[ illustration ] but the captain put aside the suggestion with a wave of the hand .
" no , sir ! "
he said , in his grandest manner .
" you <name> excuse me , i am sure ; but these are my passengers .
the accident has happened on board my ship , and under my orders .
it is for me to make compensation . "
he turned to the angry fishermen .
" come here , my men ! "
he said , in the <unk> dialect .
" tell me the weight of each sack .
i saw you weighing them just now . "
then ensued a perfect babel of noise , as the five natives explained , all screaming together , how the sailors had carried off the weights , and they had done what they could with whatever came handy .
two iron <unk> , three blocks , six <unk> , four <unk> , and a large hammer , were now carefully weighed , the captain superintending and noting the results .
but the matter did not seem to be settled , even then : an angry discussion followed , in which the sailors and the five natives all joined : and at last the captain approached our tourists with a disconcerted look , which he tried to conceal under a laugh .
" it 's an absurd difficulty , " he said .
" perhaps one of you gentlemen can suggest something .
it seems they weighed the sacks two at a time ! "
" if they did n't have five separate <unk> , of course you ca n't value them separately , " the youth hastily decided .
" let 's hear all about it , " was the old man 's more cautious remark .
" they did have five separate <unk> , " the captain said , " but  well , it beats me entirely ! "
he added , in a sudden burst of <unk> .
" here's the result .
first and second sack weighed twelve pounds ; second and third , thirteen and a half ; third and fourth , eleven and a half ; fourth and fifth , eight : and then they say they had only the large hammer left , and it took three sacks to weigh it down  that 's the first , third and fifth  and they weighed sixteen pounds .
there , gentlemen !
did you ever hear anything like that ? "
the old man muttered under his breath " if only my sister were here ! "
and looked helplessly at his son .
his son looked at the five natives .
the five natives looked at the captain .
the captain looked at nobody : his eyes were cast down , and he seemed to be saying softly to himself " contemplate one another , gentlemen , if such be your good pleasure .
i contemplate myself ! "
knot v. <unk> and crosses .
" look here , upon this picture , and on this . "
" and what made you choose the first train , <unk> ? "
said mad mathesis , as they got into the cab .
" could n't you count better than that ? "
" i took an extreme case , " was the tearful reply .
" our excellent <unk> always says 'when in doubt , my dears , take an extreme case . '
and i was in doubt . "
" does it always succeed ? "
her aunt enquired .
<name> sighed .
" not always , " she reluctantly admitted .
" and i can't make out why .
one day she was telling the little girls  they make such a noise at tea , you know  'the more noise you make , the less jam you <name> have , and vice <unk> . '
and i thought they would n't know what <unk> <unk> ' meant : so i explained it to them .
i said 'if you make an infinite noise , you 'll get no jam : and if you make no noise , you 'll get an infinite lot of jam . '
but our excellent <unk> said that wasn't a good instance .
why was n't it ? "
she added plaintively .
her aunt evaded the question .
" one sees certain objections to it , " she said .
" but how did you work it with the metropolitan trains ?
none of them go infinitely fast , i believe . "
" i called them hares and tortoises , " <name> said  a little timidly , for she dreaded being laughed at .
" and i thought there could n't be so many hares as tortoises on the line : so i took an extreme case  one hare and an infinite number of tortoises . "
" an extreme case , indeed , " her aunt remarked with admirable gravity : " and a most dangerous state of things ! "
" and i thought , if i went with a tortoise , there would be only one hare to meet : but if i went with the hare  you know there were crowds of tortoises ! "
" it was n't a bad idea , " said the elder <name> , as they left the cab , at the entrance of burlington house .
" you shall have another chance to-day .
we 'll have a match in marking pictures . "
<name> brightened up .
" i should like to try again , very much , " she said .
" i 'll take more care this time .
how are we to play ? "
to this question mad mathesis made no reply : she was busy drawing lines down the margins of the catalogue .
" see , " she said after a minute , " i've drawn three columns against the names of the pictures in the long room , and i want you to fill them with <unk> and crosses  crosses for good marks and <unk> for bad .
the first column is for choice of subject , the second for arrangement , the third for colouring .
and these are the conditions of the match .
you must give three crosses to two or three pictures .
you must give two crosses to four or five   " " do you mean only two crosses ? "
said <name> .
" or may i count the <unk> pictures among the <unk> pictures ? "
" of course you may , " said her aunt .
" any one , that has three eyes , may be said to have two eyes , i suppose ? "
<name> followed her aunt 's dreamy gaze across the crowded gallery , <unk> to find that there was a <unk> person in sight .
" and you must give one cross to nine or ten . "
" and which wins the match ? "
<name> asked , as she carefully entered these conditions on a blank leaf in her catalogue .
" whichever marks <unk> pictures . "
" but suppose we marked the same number ? "
" then whichever uses most marks . "
<name> considered .
" i do n't think it 's much of a match , " she said .
" i shall <name> nine pictures , and give three crosses to three of them , two crosses to two more , and one cross each to all the rest . "
" <name> you , indeed ? "
said her aunt .
" wait till you 've heard all the conditions , my impetuous child .
you must give three <unk> to one or two pictures , two <unk> to three or four , and one ought to eight or nine .
i do n't want you to be too hard on the <unk> 's . "
<name> quite gasped as she wrote down all these fresh conditions .
" it 's a great deal worse than circulating decimals ! "
she said .
" but i'm determined to win , all the same ! "
her aunt smiled grimly .
" we can begin here , " she said , as they paused before a gigantic picture , which the catalogue informed them was the " portrait of lieutenant brown , mounted on his favorite elephant . "
" he looks awfully conceited ! "
said <name> .
" i do n't think he was the elephant 's favorite lieutenant .
what a hideous picture it is !
and it takes up room enough for twenty ! "
" mind what you say , my dear ! "
her aunt interposed .
" it 's by an <unk> ! "
but <name> was quite reckless .
" i do n't care who it 's by ! "
she cried .
" and i shall give it three bad marks ! "
aunt and niece soon drifted away from each other in the crowd , and for the next half-hour <name> was hard at work , putting in marks and rubbing them out again , and hunting up and down for suitable pictures .
this she found the hardest part of all .
" i can't find the one i want ! "
she exclaimed at last , almost crying with vexation .
" what is it you want to find , my dear ? "
the voice was strange to <name> , but so sweet and gentle that she felt attracted to the owner of it , even before she had seen her ; and when she turned , and met the smiling looks of two little old ladies , whose round dimpled faces , exactly alike , seemed never to have known a care , it was as much as she could do  as she confessed to aunt <name> afterwards  to keep herself from hugging them both .
" i was looking for a picture , " she said , " that has a good subject  and that 's well arranged  but badly coloured . "
the little old ladies glanced at each other in some alarm .
" calm yourself , my dear , " said the one who had spoken first , " and try to remember which it was .
what was the subject ? "
" was it an elephant , for instance ? "
the other sister suggested .
they were still in sight of lieutenant brown .
" i do n't know , indeed ! "
<name> impetuously replied .
" you know it doesn't matter a bit what the subject is , so long as it 's a good one ! "
once more the sisters exchanged looks of alarm , and one of them whispered something to the other , of which <name> caught only the one word " mad . "
" they mean aunt <name> , of course , " she said to herself  <unk> , in her innocence , that london was like her native town , where everybody knew everybody else .
" if you mean my aunt , " she added aloud , " she's there  just three pictures beyond lieutenant brown . "
" ah , well !
then you 'd better go to her , my dear ! "
her new friend said , soothingly .
" <unk> find you the picture you want .
good-bye , dear ! "
" good-bye , dear ! "
echoed the other sister , " mind you do n't lose sight of your aunt ! "
and the pair trotted off into another room , leaving <name> rather perplexed at their manner .
" they 're real darlings ! "
she <unk> .
" i wonder why they pity me so ! "
and she wandered on , murmuring to herself " it must have two good marks , and   " knot <name> .
her radiancy .
" one <unk> thing that my have got , <unk> [ a ] that thing my no can do .
you <unk> you no <unk> what ?
bamboo . "
they landed , and were at once conducted to the palace .
about half way they were met by the governor , who welcomed them in english  a great relief to our travellers , whose guide could speak nothing but <unk> .
" i do n't half like the way they grin at us as we go by ! "
the old man whispered to his son .
" and why do they say <unk> ! '
so often ? "
" it alludes to a local custom , " replied the governor , who had overheard the question .
" such persons as happen in any way to <unk> her radiancy are usually beaten with rods . "
[ illustration : " why do they say <unk> ! '
so often ? " ]
the old man shuddered .
" a most <unk> local custom ! "
he remarked with strong emphasis .
" i wish we had never landed !
did you notice that black fellow , <name> , opening his great mouth at us ?
i verily believe he would like to eat us ! "
<name> appealed to the governor , who was walking at his other side .
" do they often eat distinguished strangers here ? "
he said , in as indifferent a tone as he could assume .
" not often  not ever ! "
was the welcome reply .
" they are not good for it .
pigs we eat , for they are fat .
this old man is thin . "
" and thankful to be so ! "
muttered the elder traveller .
" beaten we shall be without a doubt .
it 's a comfort to know it wo n't be beaten without the b !
my dear boy , just look at the peacocks ! "
they were now walking between two unbroken lines of those gorgeous birds , each held in check , by means of a golden collar and chain , by a black slave , who stood well behind , so as not to interrupt the view of the glittering tail , with its network of rustling feathers and its hundred eyes .
the governor smiled proudly .
" in your honour , " he said , " her radiancy has ordered up ten thousand additional peacocks .
she <name> , no doubt , decorate you , before you go , with the usual <name> and feathers . "
" it 'll be <name> without the s ! "
faltered one of his hearers .
" come , come !
do n't lose heart ! "
said the other .
" all this is full of charm for me . "
" you are young , <name> , " sighed his father ; " young and light-hearted .
for me , it is charm without the c. " " the old one is sad , " the governor remarked with some anxiety .
" he has , without doubt , effected some fearful crime ? "
" but i have n't ! "
the poor old gentleman hastily exclaimed .
" tell him i have n't , <name> ! "
" he has not , as yet , " <name> gently explained .
and the governor repeated , in a satisfied tone , " not as yet . "
" yours is a wondrous country ! "
the governor resumed , after a pause .
" now here is a letter from a friend of mine , a merchant , in london .
he and his brother went there a year ago , with a thousand pounds apiece ; and on <unk> they had sixty thousand pounds between them ! "
" how did they do it ? "
<name> eagerly exclaimed .
even the elder traveller looked excited .
the governor handed him the open letter .
" anybody can do it , when once they know how , " so ran this <unk> document .
" we borrowed nought : we stole nought .
we began the year with only a thousand pounds apiece : and last <unk> we had sixty thousand pounds between us  sixty thousand golden sovereigns ! "
<name> looked grave and thoughtful as he handed back the letter .
his father hazarded one guess .
" was it by gambling ? "
" a <unk> never <unk> , " said the governor gravely , as he ushered them through the palace gates .
they followed him in silence down a long passage , and soon found themselves in a lofty hall , lined entirely with peacocks ' feathers .
in the centre was a pile of crimson cushions , which almost concealed the figure of her radiancy  a plump little damsel , in a robe of green satin dotted with silver stars , whose pale round face lit up for a moment with a <unk> as the travellers bowed before her , and then relapsed into the exact expression of a wax doll , while she languidly murmured a word or two in the <unk> dialect .
the governor interpreted .
" her radiancy <unk> you .
she notes the impenetrable <unk> of the old one , and the imperceptible acuteness of the youth . "
here the little potentate clapped her hands , and a troop of slaves instantly appeared , carrying trays of coffee and sweetmeats , which they offered to the guests , who had , at a signal from the governor , seated themselves on the carpet .
" <unk> ! "
muttered the old man .
" one might as well be at a <unk> 's !
ask for a <name> bun , <name> ! "
" not so loud ! "
his son whispered .
" say something complimentary ! "
for the governor was evidently expecting a speech .
" we thank her exalted <unk> , " the old man timidly began .
" we <unk> in the light of her smile , which   " " the words of old men are weak ! "
the governor interrupted angrily .
" let the youth speak ! "
" tell her , " cried <name> , in a wild burst of eloquence , " that , like two grasshoppers in a volcano , we are shrivelled up in the presence of her spangled vehemence ! "
" it is well , " said the governor , and translated this into <unk> .
" i am now to tell you , " he proceeded , " what her radiancy requires of you before you go .
the yearly competition for the post of imperial <unk> is just ended ; you are the judges .
you <name> take account of the rate of work , the lightness of the <unk> , and their warmth .
usually the competitors differ in one point only .
thus , last year , <unk> and <unk> made the same number of <unk> in the <unk> , and they were equally light ; but <unk> 's were twice as warm as <unk> 's and she was pronounced twice as good .
but this year , woe is me , who can judge it ?
three competitors are here , and they differ in all points !
while you settle their claims , you shall be lodged , her radiancy bids me say , free of expense  in the best dungeon , and abundantly fed on the best bread and water . "
the old man groaned .
" all is lost ! "
he wildly exclaimed .
but <name> heeded him not : he had taken out his note-book , and was calmly <unk> down the particulars .
" three they be , " the governor proceeded , " <unk> , <name> , and <unk> .
<unk> makes 5 <unk> while <name> makes 2 ; but <unk> makes 4 while <unk> makes 3 !
again , so <unk> is <unk> 's handiwork , 5 of her <unk> weigh no more than one of <unk> 's ; yet <name> 's is lighter still  5 of hers <name> but balance 3 of <unk> 's !
and for warmth one of <name> 's is equal to 4 of <unk> 's ; yet one of <unk> 's is as warm as 3 of <name> 's ! "
here the little <name> once more clapped her hands .
" it is our signal of dismissal ! "
the governor hastily said .
" pay her radiancy your farewell compliments  and walk out backwards . "
the walking part was all the elder tourist could manage .
<name> simply said " tell her radiancy we are transfixed by the spectacle of her serene <unk> , and bid an agonized farewell to her condensed <unk> ! "
" her radiancy is pleased , " the governor reported , after duly translating this .
" she casts on you a glance from her imperial eyes , and is confident that you <name> catch it ! "
" that i warrant we shall ! "
the elder traveller moaned to himself <unk> .
once more they bowed low , and then followed the governor down a winding staircase to the imperial dungeon , which they found to be lined with coloured marble , lighted from the roof , and splendidly though not luxuriously furnished with a bench of polished <unk> .
" i trust you <name> not delay the calculation , " the governor said , <unk> them in with much ceremony .
" i have known great inconvenience  great and serious inconvenience  result to those unhappy ones who have delayed to execute the commands of her radiancy !
and on this occasion she is resolute : she says the thing must and shall be done : and she has ordered up ten thousand additional bamboos ! "
with these words he left them , and they heard him lock and bar the door on the outside .
" i told you how it would end ! "
moaned the elder traveller , wringing his hands , and quite forgetting in his anguish that he had himself proposed the expedition , and had never predicted anything of the sort .
" oh that we were well out of this miserable business ! "
" courage ! "
cried the younger cheerily .
" <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> !  the end of all this <name> be <name> ! "
" <name> without the l ! "
was all the poor old man could say , as he rocked himself to and fro on the <unk> bench .
" <name> without the l ! "

" base is the slave that pays . "
" aunt <name> ! "
" my child ? "
" would you mind writing it down at once ?
i shall be quite certain to forget it if you do n't ! "
" my dear , we really must wait till the cab stops .
how can i possibly write anything in the midst of all this jolting ? "
" but really i shall be forgetting it ! "
<name> 's voice took the plaintive tone that her aunt never knew how to resist , and with a sigh the old <name> <name> forth her <name> tablets and prepared to record the amount that <name> had just spent at the <unk> 's shop .
her expenditure was always made out of her <unk> purse , but the poor girl knew , by bitter experience , that sooner or later " mad mathesis " would expect an exact account of every <name> that had gone , and she waited , with <unk> impatience , while the old <name> turned the tablets over and over , till she had found the one headed " petty cash . "
" here 's the place , " she said at last , " and here we have <unk> luncheon duly entered .
one glass lemonade ( why ca n't you drink water , like me ? )
three sandwiches ( they never put in half mustard enough .
i told the young woman so , to her face ; and she tossed her head  like her impudence ! )
and seven biscuits .
total <unk> well , now for to-day 's ? "
" one glass of lemonade   " <name> was beginning to say , when suddenly the cab <name> up , and a courteous <unk> was handing out the bewildered girl before she had had time to finish her sentence .
her aunt pocketed the tablets instantly .
" business first , " she said : " petty cash  which is a form of pleasure , whatever you may think  afterwards . "
and she proceeded to pay the driver , and to give voluminous orders about the luggage , quite deaf to the entreaties of her unhappy niece that she would enter the rest of the luncheon account .
" my dear , you really must cultivate a more capacious mind ! "
was all the consolation she vouchsafed to the poor girl .
" are not the tablets of your memory wide enough to contain the record of one single luncheon ? "
" not wide enough !
not half wide enough ! "
was the passionate reply .
the words came in aptly enough , but the voice was not that of <name> , and both ladies turned in some surprise to see who it was that had so suddenly struck into their conversation .
a fat little old <name> was standing at the door of a cab , helping the driver to extricate what seemed an exact duplicate of herself : it would have been no easy task to decide which was the fatter , or which looked the more <unk> of the two sisters .
" i tell you the <unk> is n't half wide enough ! "
she repeated , as her sister finally emerged , somewhat after the fashion of a <unk> from a <unk> , and she turned to appeal to <name> .
" is it , dear ? "
she said , trying hard to bring a frown into a face that dimpled all over with smiles .
" some folks is too wide for 'em , " growled the <unk> .
[ illustration : " i tell you the <unk> is n't half wide enough ! " ]
" do n't provoke me , man ! "
cried the little old <name> , in what she meant for a tempest of fury .
" say another word and i 'll put you into the county court , and <name> you for a <unk> <unk> ! "
the cabman touched his hat , and marched off , grinning .
" nothing like a little law to cow the ruffians , my dear ! "
she remarked confidentially to <name> .
" you saw how he <unk> when i mentioned the <unk> <unk> ?
not that i 've any idea what it means , but it sounds very grand , does n't it ? "
" it 's very provoking , " <name> replied , a little vaguely .
" very ! "
the little old <name> eagerly repeated .
" and we 're very much provoked indeed .
are n't we , sister ? "
" i never was so provoked in all my life ! "
the fatter sister assented , <unk> .
by this time <name> had recognised her <unk> acquaintances , and , drawing her aunt aside , she hastily whispered her reminiscences .
" i met them first in the <name> academy  and they were very kind to me  and they were lunching at the next table to us , just now , you know  and they tried to help me to find the picture i wanted  and i 'm sure they 're dear old things ! "
" friends of yours , are they ? "
said mad mathesis .
" well , i like their looks .
you can be civil to them , while i get the tickets .
but do try and arrange your ideas a little more <unk> ! "
and so it came to pass that the four ladies found themselves seated side by side on the same bench waiting for the train , and chatting as if they had known one another for years .
" now this i call quite a remarkable coincidence ! "
exclaimed the smaller and more talkative of the two sisters  the one whose legal knowledge had annihilated the <unk> .
" not only that we should be waiting for the same train , and at the same station  that would be curious enough  but actually on the same day , and the same hour of the day !
that 's what strikes me so forcibly ! "
she glanced at the fatter and more silent sister , whose chief function in life seemed to be to support the family opinion , and who meekly responded  " and me too , sister ! "
" those are not independent coincidences   " mad mathesis was just beginning , when <name> ventured to interpose .
" there 's no jolting here , " she pleaded meekly .
" would you mind writing it down now ? "
out came the <name> tablets once more .
" what was it , then ? "
said her aunt .
" one glass of lemonade , one sandwich , one biscuit  oh dear me ! "
cried poor <name> , the historical tone suddenly changing to a wail of agony .
" toothache ? "
said her aunt calmly , as she wrote down the items .
the two sisters instantly opened their <unk> and produced two different remedies for <unk> , each marked " <unk> . "
" it is n't that ! "
said poor <name> .
" thank you very much .
it 's only that i can't remember how much i paid ! "
" well , try and make it out , then , " said her aunt .
" you 've got yesterday 's luncheon to help you , you know .
and here 's the luncheon we had the day before  the first day we went to that shop  one glass lemonade , four sandwiches , ten biscuits .
total , <unk> " she handed the tablets to <name> , who gazed at them with eyes so dim with tears that she did not at first notice that she was holding them upside down .
the two sisters had been listening to all this with the deepest interest , and at this juncture the smaller one softly laid her hand on <name> 's arm .
" do you know , my dear , " she said <unk> , " my sister and i are in the very same predicament !
quite identically the very same predicament !
are n't we , sister ? "
" quite identically and absolutely the very   " began the fatter sister , but she was constructing her sentence on too large a scale , and the little one would not wait for her to finish it .
" yes , my dear , " she resumed ; " we were lunching at the very same shop as you were  and we had two glasses of lemonade and three sandwiches and five biscuits  and neither of us has the least idea what we paid .
have we , sister ? "
" quite identically and absolutely   " murmured the other , who evidently considered that she was now a whole sentence in arrears , and that she ought to discharge one obligation before contracting any fresh <unk> ; but the little <name> broke in again , and she retired from the conversation a bankrupt .
" would you make it out for us , my dear ? "
pleaded the little old <name> .
" you can do arithmetic , i trust ? "
her aunt said , a little anxiously , as <name> turned from one tablet to another , vainly trying to collect her thoughts .
her mind was a blank , and all human expression was rapidly fading out of her face .
a gloomy silence ensued .
knot viii .
de omnibus <unk> .
" this little pig went to market : this little pig staid at home . "
" by her radiancy 's express command , " said the governor , as he conducted the travellers , for the last time , from the imperial presence , " i shall now have the ecstasy of escorting you as far as the outer gate of the military quarter , where the agony of parting  if indeed nature can survive the shock  must be endured !
from that gate <unk> start every quarter of an hour , both ways   " " would you mind repeating that word ? "
said <name> .
" <unk>   ? "
" <unk> , " the governor repeated .
" you call them omnibuses in england .
they run both ways , and you can travel by one of them all the way down to the harbour . "
the old man breathed a sigh of relief ; four hours of courtly ceremony had wearied him , and he had been in constant terror lest something should call into use the ten thousand additional bamboos .
in another minute they were crossing a large <unk> , paved with marble , and tastefully decorated with a <unk> in each corner .
soldiers , carrying pigs , were marching in all directions : and in the middle stood a gigantic officer giving orders in a voice of thunder , which made itself heard above all the uproar of the pigs .
" it is the commander-in-chief ! "
the governor hurriedly whispered to his companions , who at once followed his example in <unk> themselves before the great man .
the commander gravely bowed in return .
he was covered with gold lace from head to foot : his face wore an expression of deep misery : and he had a little black pig under each arm .
still the gallant fellow did his best , in the midst of the orders he was every moment issuing to his men , to bid a courteous farewell to the departing guests .
" farewell , oh old one  <name> these three to the south corner  and farewell to thee , thou young one  put this fat one on the top of the others in the western sty  may your shadows never be less  woe is me , it is wrongly done !
empty out all the <unk> , and begin again ! "
and the soldier <unk> upon his sword , and wiped away a tear .
" he is in distress , " the governor explained as they left the court .
" her radiancy has commanded him to place twenty-four pigs in those four <unk> , so that , as she goes round the court , she may always find the number in each sty nearer to ten than the number in the last . "
" does she call ten nearer to ten than nine is ? "
said <name> .
" surely , " said the governor .
" her radiancy would admit that ten is nearer to ten than nine is  and also nearer than eleven is . "
" then i think it can be done , " said <name> .
the governor shook his head .
" the commander has been transferring them in vain for four months , " he said .
" what <name> remains ?
and her radiancy has ordered up ten thousand additional   " " the pigs do n't seem to enjoy being transferred , " the old man hastily interrupted .
he did not like the subject of bamboos .
" they are only provisionally transferred , you know , " said the governor .
" in most cases they are immediately carried back again : so they need not mind it .
and all is done with the greatest care , under the personal superintendence of the commander-in-chief . "
" of course she would only go once round ? "
said <name> .
" alas , no ! "
sighed their conductor .
" round and round .
round and round .
these are her radiancy 's own words .
but oh , agony !
here is the outer gate , and we must part ! "
he sobbed as he shook hands with them , and the next moment was briskly walking away .
" he might have waited to see us off ! "
said the old man , piteously .
" and he need n't have begun whistling the very moment he left us ! "
said the young one , severely .
" but look sharp  here are two <unk> in the act of starting ! "
unluckily , the <unk> omnibus was full .
" never mind ! "
said <name> , cheerily .
" we 'll walk on till the next one <unk> us . "
they trudged on in silence , both thinking over the military problem , till they met an omnibus coming from the sea .
the elder traveller took out his watch .
" just twelve minutes and a half since we started , " he remarked in an absent manner .
suddenly the vacant face brightened ; the old man had an idea .
" my boy ! "
he shouted , bringing his hand down upon <name> 's shoulder so suddenly as for a moment to transfer his centre of gravity beyond the base of support .
thus taken off his guard , the young man wildly staggered forwards , and seemed about to plunge into space : but in another moment he had gracefully recovered himself .
" problem in <unk> and <unk> , " he remarked  in tones where filial respect only just managed to conceal a shade of annoyance .
" what is it ? "
he hastily added , fearing his father might have been taken ill. " <name> you have some <name> ? "
" when <name> the next omnibus overtake us ?
when ?
when ? "
the old man cried , growing more excited every moment .
<name> looked gloomy .
" give me time , " he said .
" i must think it over . "
and once more the travellers passed on in silence  a silence only broken by the distant squeals of the unfortunate little pigs , who were still being provisionally transferred from sty to sty , under the personal superintendence of the commander-in-chief .

a serpent with corners .
" water , water , every where , nor any drop to drink . "
" it 'll just take one more pebble . "
" what ever are you doing with those buckets ? "
the speakers were <name> and lambert .
place , the beach of little <unk> .
time , <unk> , p.m. <name> was floating a bucket in another a size larger , and trying how many pebbles it would <name> without sinking .
lambert was lying on his back , doing nothing .
for the next minute or two <name> was silent , evidently deep in thought .
suddenly he started .
" i say , look here , lambert ! "
he cried .
" if it 's alive , and slimy , and with legs , i do n't care to , " said lambert .
" did n't balbus say this morning that , if a body is immersed in liquid , it <unk> as much liquid as is equal to its own bulk ? "
said <name> .
" he said things of that sort , " lambert vaguely replied .
" well , just look here a minute .
here 's the little bucket almost quite immersed : so the water displaced ought to be just about the same bulk .
and now just look at it ! "
he took out the little bucket as he spoke , and handed the big one to lambert .
" why , there 's hardly a <unk> !
do you mean to say that water is the same bulk as the little bucket ? "
" course it is , " said lambert .
" well , look here again ! "
cried <name> , triumphantly , as he poured the water from the big bucket into the little one .
" why , it does n't half fill it ! "
" that 's its business , " said lambert .
" if balbus says it 's the same bulk , why , it is the same bulk , you know . "
" well , i do n't believe it , " said <name> .
" you need n't , " said lambert .
" besides , it 's dinner-time .
come along . "
they found balbus waiting dinner for them , and to him <name> at once propounded his difficulty .
" let 's get you helped first , " said balbus , briskly cutting away at the joint .
" you know the old proverb <unk> first , mechanics afterwards ' ? "
the boys did not know the proverb , but they accepted it in perfect good <name> , as they did every piece of information , however startling , that came from so infallible an authority as their tutor .
they ate on steadily in silence , and , when dinner was over , <name> set out the usual array of pens , ink , and paper , while balbus repeated to them the problem he had prepared for their afternoon 's task .
" a friend of mine has a flower-garden  a very pretty one , though no great size  " " how big is it ? "
said <name> .
" that 's what you have to find out ! "
balbus gaily replied .
" all i tell you is that it is oblong in shape  just half a yard longer than its width  and that a <unk> , one yard wide , begins at one corner and runs all round it . "
" joining into itself ? "
said <name> .
" not joining into itself , young man .
just before doing that , it turns a corner , and runs round the garden again , alongside of the first portion , and then inside that again , winding in and in , and each lap touching the last one , till it has used up the whole of the area . "
" like a serpent with corners ? "
said lambert .
" exactly so .
and if you walk the whole length of it , to the last inch , keeping in the centre of the path , it 's exactly two miles and half a furlong .
now , while you find out the length and breadth of the garden , i 'll see if i can think out that sea-water puzzle . "
" you said it was a flower-garden ? "
<name> inquired , as balbus was leaving the room .
" i did , " said balbus .
" where do the flowers grow ? "
said <name> .
but balbus thought it best not to hear the question .
he left the boys to their problem , and , in the silence of his own room , set himself to unravel <name> 's mechanical paradox .
" to fix our thoughts , " he murmured to himself , as , with hands <unk> in his pockets , he paced up and down the room , " we <name> take a cylindrical glass jar , with a scale of inches marked up the side , and fill it with water up to the <unk> <name> : and we <name> assume that every inch depth of jar contains a pint of water .
we <name> now take a solid cylinder , such that every inch of it is equal in bulk to half a pint of water , and plunge 4 inches of it into the water , so that the end of the cylinder comes down to the <unk> <name> .
well , that <unk> 2 pints of water .
what becomes of them ?
why , if there were no more cylinder , they would lie comfortably on the top , and fill the jar up to the <unk> <name> .
but unfortunately there is more cylinder , occupying half the space between the <unk> and the <unk> marks , so that only one pint of water can be accommodated there .
what becomes of the other pint ?
why , if there were no more cylinder , it would lie on the top , and fill the jar up to the <unk> <name> .
but unfortunately   shade of <name> ! "
he exclaimed , in sudden accents of terror .
" when does the water stop rising ? "
a bright idea struck him .
" i 'll write a little essay on it , " he said .
* * * * * balbus 's <unk> " when a solid is immersed in a liquid , it is well known that it <unk> a portion of the liquid equal to itself in bulk , and that the level of the liquid rises just so much as it would rise if a quantity of liquid had been added to it , equal in bulk to the solid .
<unk> says , precisely the same process occurs when a solid is partially immersed : the quantity of liquid displaced , in this case , equalling the portion of the solid which is immersed , and the rise of the level being in proportion .
" suppose a solid held above the surface of a liquid and partially immersed : a portion of the liquid is displaced , and the level of the liquid rises .
but , by this rise of level , a little bit more of the solid is of course immersed , and so there is a new displacement of a second portion of the liquid , and a consequent rise of level .
again , this second rise of level causes a yet further immersion , and by consequence another displacement of liquid and another rise .
it is self-evident that this process must continue till the entire solid is immersed , and that the liquid <name> then begin to <unk> whatever holds the solid , which , being connected with it , must for the time be considered a part of it .
if you hold a stick , six feet long , with its end in a tumbler of water , and wait long enough , you must eventually be immersed .
the question as to the source from which the water is supplied  which belongs to a high branch of mathematics , and is therefore beyond our present scope  does not apply to the sea .
let us therefore take the familiar instance of a man standing at the edge of the sea , at <unk> , with a solid in his hand , which he partially <unk> : he remains steadfast and unmoved , and we all know that he must be drowned .
the multitudes who daily perish in this manner to attest a philosophical truth , and whose bodies the unreasoning wave casts sullenly upon our <unk> shores , have a truer claim to be called the martyrs of science than a <unk> or a kepler .
to use <unk> 's eloquent phrase , they are the unnamed <unk> of the nineteenth century .
" [ b ] * * * * * " there 's a fallacy somewhere , " he murmured drowsily , as he stretched his long legs upon the sofa .
" i must think it over again . "
he closed his eyes , in order to concentrate his attention more perfectly , and for the next hour or so his slow and regular breathing bore witness to the careful deliberation with which he was investigating this new and perplexing view of the subject .
[ illustration : " he remains steadfast and unmoved . " ]

knot x. <name> buns .
" yea , buns , and buns , and buns ! "
old song .
" how very , very sad ! "
exclaimed <name> ; and the eyes of the gentle girl filled with tears as she spoke .
" sad  but very curious when you come to look at it <unk> , " was her aunt 's less romantic reply .
" some of them have lost an arm in their country 's service , some a leg , some an ear , some an eye   " " and some , perhaps , all ! "
<name> murmured dreamily , as they passed the long rows of weather-beaten heroes basking in the sun .
" did you notice that very old one , with a red face , who was drawing a map in the dust with his wooden leg , and all the others watching ?
i think it was a plan of a battle   " " the battle of <unk> , no doubt , " her aunt interrupted , briskly .
" hardly that , i think , " <name> ventured to say .
" you see , in that case , he could n't well be alive   " " could n't well be alive ! "
the old <name> contemptuously repeated .
" he 's as lively as you and me put together !
why , if drawing a map in the dust  with one 's wooden leg  does n't prove one to be alive , perhaps you 'll kindly mention what does prove it ! "
<name> did not see her way out of it .
logic had never been her <unk> .
" to return to the arithmetic , " mad mathesis resumed  the eccentric old <name> never let slip an opportunity of driving her niece into a calculation  " what percentage do you suppose must have lost all four  a leg , an arm , an eye , and an ear ? "
" how can i tell ? "
gasped the terrified girl .
she knew well what was coming .
" you ca n't , of course , without data , " her aunt replied : " but i 'm just going to give you   " " give her a <name> bun , miss !
that 's what most young ladies likes best ! "
the voice was <name> and musical , and the speaker <unk> whipped back the snowy cloth that covered his basket , and disclosed a tempting array of the familiar square buns , joined together in rows , richly <unk> and browned , and glistening in the sun .
" no , sir !
i shall give her nothing so indigestible !
be off ! "
the old <name> waved her parasol threateningly : but nothing seemed to disturb the <unk> of the jolly old man , who marched on , chanting his melodious refrain :  [ music : <unk> buns !
<unk> buns hot !
<unk> buns !
<unk> hot !
<unk> buns hot !
<unk> buns ! ]
" far too indigestible , my love ! "
said the old <name> .
" <unk> <name> agree with you ever so much better ! "
<name> sighed , and there was a hungry look in her eyes as she watched the basket lessening in the distance : but she meekly listened to the relentless old <name> , who at once proceeded to count off the data on her fingers .
" say that 70 per cent .
have lost an eye  75 per cent .
an ear  80 per cent .
an arm  85 per cent .
a leg  that 'll do it beautifully .
now , my dear , what percentage , at least , must have lost all four ? "
no more conversation occurred  unless a smothered exclamation of " piping hot ! "
which escaped from <name> 's lips as the basket vanished round a corner could be counted as such  until they reached the old <name> mansion , where <name> 's father was then staying , with his three sons and their old tutor .
balbus , lambert , and <name> had entered the house only a few minutes before them .
they had been out walking , and <name> had been <unk> a difficulty which had reduced lambert to the depths of gloom , and had even puzzled balbus .
" it changes from wednesday to thursday at midnight , does n't it ? "
<name> had begun .
" sometimes , " said balbus , cautiously .
" always , " said lambert , <unk> .
" sometimes , " balbus gently insisted .
" six <unk> out of seven , it changes to some other name . "
" i meant , of course , " <name> corrected himself , " when it does change from wednesday to thursday , it does it at midnight  and only at midnight . "
" surely , " said balbus .
lambert was silent .
" well , now , suppose it 's midnight here in <name> .
then it 's wednesday west of <name> ( say in ireland or <name> ) where midnight hasn't arrived yet : and it 's thursday east of <name> ( say in germany or russia ) where midnight has just passed by ? "
" surely , " balbus said again .
even lambert nodded this time .
" but it is n't midnight , anywhere else ; so it ca n't be changing from one day to another anywhere else .
and yet , if ireland and <name> and so on call it wednesday , and germany and russia and so on call it thursday , there must be some place  not <name>  that has different days on the two sides of it .
and the worst of it is , the people there get their days in the wrong order : they 've got wednesday east of them , and thursday west  just as if their day had changed from thursday to wednesday ! "
" i 've heard that puzzle before ! "
cried lambert .
" and i 'll tell you the explanation .
when a ship goes round the world from east to west , we know that it loses a day in its reckoning : so that when it gets home , and calls its day wednesday , it finds people here calling it thursday , because we 've had one more midnight than the ship has had .
and when you go the other way round you gain a day . "
" i know all that , " said <name> , in reply to this not very lucid explanation : " but it does n't help me , because the ship has n't proper days .
one way round , you get more than twenty-four hours to the day , and the other way you get less : so of course the names get wrong : but people that live on in one place always get twenty-four hours to the day . "
" i suppose there is such a place , " balbus said , meditatively , " though i never heard of it .
and the people must find it very queer , as <name> says , to have the old day east of them , and the new one west : because , when midnight comes round to them , with the new day in front of it and the old one behind it , one does n't see exactly what happens .
i must think it over . "
so they had entered the house in the state i have described  balbus puzzled , and lambert buried in gloomy thought .
" yes , m 'm , master is at home , m 'm , " said the stately old butler .
( n.b.  it is only a butler of experience who can manage a series of three m 's together , without any <unk> <unk> . )
" and the ole party is <unk> for you in the <unk> . "
" i do n't like his calling your father an old party , " mad mathesis whispered to her niece , as they crossed the hall .
and <name> had only just time to whisper in reply " he meant the whole party , " before they were ushered into the library , and the sight of the five solemn faces there assembled chilled her into silence .
her father sat at the head of the table , and mutely signed to the ladies to take the two vacant chairs , one on each side of him .
his three sons and balbus completed the party .
writing materials had been arranged round the table , after the fashion of a ghostly banquet : the butler had evidently bestowed much thought on the grim device .
sheets of quarto paper , each flanked by a pen on one side and a pencil on the other , represented the plates  <unk> did duty for rolls of bread  while <unk> stood in the places usually occupied by <unk> .
the <unk> de resistance was a large green <unk> bag , which gave forth , as the old man restlessly lifted it from side to side , a charming jingle , as of innumerable golden guineas .
" sister , daughter , sons  and balbus  , " the old man began , so nervously , that balbus put in a gentle " hear , hear ! "
while <name> drummed on the table with his fists .
this disconcerted the <unk> orator .
" sister  " he began again , then paused a moment , moved the bag to the other side , and went on with a rush , " i mean  this being  a critical occasion  more or less  being the year when one of my sons comes of age  " he paused again in some confusion , having evidently got into the middle of his speech sooner than he intended : but it was too late to go back .
" hear , hear ! "
cried balbus .
" quite so , " said the old gentleman , recovering his self-possession a little : " when first i began this annual custom  my friend balbus <name> correct me if i am wrong  " ( <name> whispered " with a strap ! "
but nobody heard him except lambert , who only frowned and shook his head at him ) "  this annual custom of giving each of my sons as many guineas as would represent his age  it was a critical time  so balbus informed me  as the ages of two of you were together equal to that of the third  so on that occasion i made a speech   " he paused so long that balbus thought it well to come to the rescue with the words " it was a most   " but the old man checked him with a warning look : " yes , made a speech , " he repeated .
" a few years after that , balbus pointed out  i say pointed out  " ( " hear , hear " !
cried balbus .
" quite so , " said the grateful old man . )
"  that it was another critical occasion .
the ages of two of you were together double that of the third .
so i made another speech  another speech .
and now again it 's a critical occasion  so balbus says  and i am making   " ( here mad mathesis pointedly referred to her watch ) " all the haste i can ! "
the old man cried , with wonderful presence of mind .
" indeed , sister , i 'm coming to the point now !
the number of years that have passed since that first occasion is just two-thirds of the number of guineas i then gave you .
now , my boys , calculate your ages from the data , and you shall have the money ! "
" but we know our ages ! "
cried <name> .
" silence , sir ! "
thundered the old man , rising to his full height ( he was exactly <unk> five ) in his indignation .
" i say you must use the data only !
you must n't even assume which it is that comes of age ! "
he clutched the bag as he spoke , and with tottering steps ( it was about as much as he could do to <name> it ) he left the room .
" and you shall have a similar <unk> , " the old <name> whispered to her niece , " when you 've calculated that percentage ! "
and she followed her brother .
nothing could exceed the solemnity with which the old couple had risen from the table , and yet was it  was it a grin with which the father turned away from his unhappy sons ?
could it be  could it be a wink with which the aunt abandoned her despairing niece ?
and were those  were those sounds of suppressed chuckling which floated into the room , just before balbus ( who had followed them out ) closed the door ?
surely not : and yet the butler told the cook  but no , that was merely idle gossip , and i <name> not repeat it .
the shades of evening granted their <unk> petition , and " closed not o'er " them ( for the butler brought in the lamp ) : the same obliging shades left them a " lonely bark " ( the wail of a dog , in the <unk> , baying the moon ) for " awhile " : but neither " morn , alas , " ( nor any other epoch ) seemed likely to " restore " them  to that peace of mind which had once been theirs ere ever these problems had swooped upon them , and crushed them with a load of unfathomable mystery !
" it 's hardly fair , " muttered <name> , " to give us such a jumble as this to work out ! "
" fair ? "
<name> echoed , bitterly .
" well ! "
and to all my readers i can but repeat the last words of gentle <name>  <unk> !
appendix .
" a knot ! "
said <name> .
" oh , do let me help to undo it ! "
answers to knot i .
<unk>  " two travellers spend from 3 o'clock till 9 in walking along a level road , up a hill , and home again : their pace on the level being 4 miles an hour , up hill 3 , and down hill 6 .
find distance walked : also ( within half an hour ) time of reaching top of hill . "
answer.  " 24 miles : half-past 6 . "
* * * * * <unk>  a level mile takes 1/4 of an hour , up hill <unk> , down hill <unk> .
hence to go and return over the same mile , whether on the level or on the hill-side , takes 1/2 an hour .
hence in 6 hours they went 12 miles out and 12 back .
if the 12 miles out had been nearly all level , they would have taken a little over 3 hours ; if nearly all up hill , a little under 4 .
hence <unk> hours must be within 1/2 an hour of the time taken in reaching the peak ; thus , as they started at 3 , they got there within 1/2 an hour of 1/2 past 6 .
* * * * * twenty-seven answers have come in .
of these , 9 are right , 16 partially right , and 2 wrong .
the 16 give the distance correctly , but they have failed to grasp the fact that the top of the hill might have been reached at any moment between 6 o'clock and 7 .
the two wrong answers are from <unk> <name> and a <unk> .
the former makes the distance " 23 miles , " while her revolutionary companion puts it at " 27 . "
<unk> <name> says " they had to go 4 miles along the plain , and got to the foot of the hill at 4 o'clock . "
they might have done so , i <name> ; but you have no ground for saying they did so .
" it was <unk> miles to the top of the hill , and they reached that at 1/4 before 7 o'clock . "
here you go wrong in your arithmetic , and i must , however reluctantly , bid you farewell .
<unk> miles , at 3 miles an hour , would not require <unk> hours .
a <unk> says " let x denote the whole number of miles ; y the number of hours to <unk> ; [ ** therefore ] <unk> = number of miles to <unk> , and <unk> = number of miles on the other side . "
you bewilder me .
the other side of what ?
" of the hill , " you say .
but then , how did they get home again ?
however , to accommodate your views we <name> build a new hostelry at the foot of the hill on the opposite side , and also assume ( what i <name> you is possible , though it is not necessarily true ) that there was no level road at all .
even then you go wrong .
you say " y = 6  ( x  <unk> ) <unk> , ... .. ( i ) ; <unk> = 6 ... ..
( ii ) . "
i <name> you ( i ) , but i deny ( ii ) : it rests on the assumption that to go part of the time at 3 miles an hour , and the rest at 6 miles an hour , comes to the same result as going the whole time at <unk> miles an hour .
but this would only be true if the " part " were an exact half , i.e. , if they went up hill for 3 hours , and down hill for the other 3 : which they certainly did not do .
the sixteen , who are partially right , are <name> <name> , f. k. , <unk> , g. e. b. , h. p. , <name> , m. e. t. , <unk> , a mother 's son , <unk> , a <unk> , a socialist , spear maiden , t. b .
c , vis <unk> , and <unk> .
of these , f. k. , <unk> , t. b .
c , and vis <unk> do not attempt the second part at all .
f. k. and h. p. give no working .
the rest make particular assumptions , such as that there was no level road  that there were 6 miles of level road  and so on , all leading to particular times being fixed for reaching the <unk> .
the most curious assumption is that of <name> <name> , who says " let x = number of hours occupied in ascent ; then <unk> = hours occupied in descent ; and <unk> = hours occupied on the level . "
i suppose you were thinking of the relative rates , up hill and on the level ; which we might express by saying that , if they went x miles up hill in a certain time , they would go <unk> miles on the level in the same time .
you have , in fact , assumed that they took the same time on the level that they took in ascending the hill .
<unk> assumes that , when the aged knight said they had gone " four miles in the hour " on the level , he meant that four miles was the distance gone , not merely the rate .
this would have been  if <unk> <name> excuse the slang expression  a " sell , " <unk> to the dignity of the hero .
and now " descend , ye classic nine ! "
who have solved the whole problem , and let me sing your praises .
your names are blithe , e. w. , l. b. , a marlborough boy , o. v. l. , <unk> <name> , rose , sea breeze , simple <name> , and money <unk> .
( these last two i count as one , as they send a joint answer . )
rose and simple <name> and co. do not actually state that the <unk> was reached some time between 6 and 7 , but , as they have clearly grasped the fact that a mile , ascended and descended , took the same time as two level miles , i <name> them as " right . "
a marlborough boy and <unk> <name> deserve honourable mention for their <unk> solutions being the only two who have perceived that the question leads to an indeterminate equation .
e. w. brings a charge of <unk> against the aged knight  a serious charge , for he was the very pink of chivalry !
she says " according to the data given , the time at the summit affords no clue to the total distance .
it does not enable us to state precisely to an inch how much level and how much hill there was on the road . "
" fair damsel , " the aged knight replies , "  if , as i surmise , thy initials denote early womanhood  <unk> thee that the word <unk> ' is thine , not mine .
i did but ask the time of reaching the <unk> as my condition for further parley .
if now thou wilt not <name> that i am a <unk> man , then <name> i affirm that those same initials denote <unk> wickedness ! "

* * * * * " yet stay , " said the youth , as a gleam of inspiration lighted up the relaxing muscles of his quiescent features .
" stay .
methinks it matters little when we reached that summit , the crown of our toil .
for in the space of time wherein we clambered up one mile and bounded down the same on our return , we could have trudged the twain on the level .
we have <unk> , then , <unk> miles in these six mortal hours ; for never a moment did we stop for catching of fleeting breath or for gazing on the scene around ! "
" very good , " said the old man .
" twelve miles out and twelve miles in .
and we reached the top some time between six and seven of the clock .
now <name> me !
for every five minutes that had fled since six of the clock when we stood on yonder peak , so many miles had we toiled upwards on the dreary mountainside ! "
the youth moaned and rushed into the <unk> .

the elder and the younger knight , they sallied forth at three ; how far they went on level ground it matters not to me ; what time they reached the foot of hill , when they began to mount , are problems which i hold to be of very small account .
the moment that each waved his hat upon the topmost peak  to trivial query such as this no answer <name> i seek .
yet can i tell the distance well they must have travelled o'er : on hill and plain , 'twixt three and nine , the miles were twenty-four .
four miles an hour their steady pace along the level track , three when they climbed  but six when they came swiftly striding back <unk> the hill ; and little skill it needs , methinks , to show , up hill and down together told , four miles an hour they go .
for whether long or short the time upon the hill they spent , two thirds were passed in going up , one third in the descent .
two thirds at three , one third at six , if rightly reckoned o'er , <name> make one whole at four  the tale is tangled now no more .

the lodgings .
<unk>  " a square has 20 doors on each side , which contains 21 equal parts .
they are numbered all round , beginning at one corner .
from which of the four , nos .
9 , 25 , 52 , 73 , is the sum of the distances , to the other three , least ? "
answer.  " from no .
9 . "
* * * * * [ illustration ] let a be no .
9 , b no .
25 , c no .
52 , and d no .
73 .
then ab = [ ** sqrt ] ( <unk> { 2 } + <unk> { 2 } ) = [ ** sqrt ] 169 = 13 ; ac = 21 ; ad = [ ** sqrt ] ( <unk> { 2 } + <unk> { 2 } ) = [ ** sqrt ] 145 = 12 + ( n.b .
i.e. " between 12 and 13 . " )
bc = [ ** sqrt ] ( <unk> { 2 } + <unk> { 2 } ) = [ ** sqrt ] 400 = 20 ; bd = [ ** sqrt ] ( <unk> { 2 } + <unk> { 2 } ) = [ ** sqrt ] 450 = <unk> ; cd = [ ** sqrt ] ( <unk> { 2 } + <unk> { 2 } ) = [ ** sqrt ] 250 = <unk> ; hence sum of distances from a is between 46 and 47 ; from b , between 54 and 55 ; from c , between 56 and 57 ; from d , between 48 and 51 .
( why not " between 48 and 49 " ?
make this out for yourselves . )
hence the sum is least for a .
* * * * * twenty-five solutions have been received .
of these , 15 must be marked " 0 , " 5 are partly right , and 5 right .
of the 15 , i may dismiss <unk> phantom , <unk> , <name> mite , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <name> ( i fear the cold spring has blighted our <unk> ) , <name> , h.m.s .
<unk> , <name> , and <name> with the simple remark that they insist on the unfortunate lodgers keeping to the pavement .
( i used the words " crossed to number seventy-three " for the special purpose of showing that short cuts were possible . )
<unk> does the same , and adds that " the result would be the same " even if they crossed the square , but gives no proof of this .
m. m. draws a diagram , and says that no .
9 is the house , " as the diagram shows . "
i can not see how it does so .
old cat assumes that the house must be no .
9 or no .
73 .
she does not explain how she estimates the distances .
<name> 's arithmetic is <unk> : she makes [ ** sqrt ] 169 + [ ** sqrt ] 442 + [ ** sqrt ] 130 = <unk> .
( i suppose you mean [ ** sqrt ] <unk> , which would be a little nearer the truth .
but roots can not be added in this manner .
do you think [ ** sqrt ] 9 + [ ** sqrt ] 16 is 25 , or even [ ** sqrt ] 25 ? )
but <unk> 's state is more perilous still : she draws illogical conclusions with a frightful calmness .
after pointing out ( rightly ) that ac is less than bd she says , " therefore the nearest house to the other three must be a or c. " and again , after pointing out ( rightly ) that b and d are both within the <unk> containing a , she says " therefore " ab + ad must be less than bc + cd .
( there is no logical force in either " therefore . "

of the five <unk> solutions , rags and tatters and mad hatter ( who send one answer between them ) make no .
25 6 units from the corner instead of 5 .
<unk> , e. r. d. l. , and <unk> potts leave openings at the corners of the square , which are not in the data : moreover <unk> gives values for the distances without any hint that they are only <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> make the bold and <unk> assumption that there were really 21 houses on each side , instead of 20 as stated by balbus .
" we may assume , " they add , " that the doors of nos .
21 , 42 , 63 , 84 , are invisible from the centre of the square " !
what is there , i wonder , that <unk> and <unk> would not assume ?
of the five who are wholly right , i think bradshaw of the future , <unk> , <name> c. , and <unk> deserve special praise for their full analytical solutions .

" two questions , " he says , " are put .
to solve one there is no data : the other answers itself . "
as to the first point , <unk> is mistaken ; there are ( not " is " ) data sufficient to answer the question .
as to the other , it is interesting to know that the question " answers itself , " and i am sure it does the question great credit : still i fear i can not enter it on the list of winners , as this competition is only open to human beings .

<unk>  ( 1 ) " two travellers , starting at the same time , went opposite ways round a circular railway .
trains start each way every 15 minutes , the easterly ones going round in 3 hours , the westerly in 2 .
how many trains did each meet on the way , not counting trains met at the terminus itself ? "
( 2 ) " they went round , as before , each traveller counting as 'one ' the train containing the other traveller .
how many did each meet ? "
<unk>  ( 1 ) 19 .
( 2 ) the easterly traveller met 12 ; the other 8 .
* * * * * the trains one way took 180 minutes , the other way 120 .
let us take the l. c. m. , 360 , and divide the railway into 360 units .
then one set of trains went at the rate of 2 units a minute and at intervals of 30 units ; the other at the rate of 3 units a minute and at intervals of 45 units .
an easterly train starting has 45 units between it and the first train it <name> meet : it does <unk> of this while the other does <unk> , and thus meets it at the end of 18 units , and so all the way round .
a westerly train starting has 30 units between it and the first train it <name> meet : it does <unk> of this while the other does <unk> , and thus meets it at the end of 18 units , and so all the way round .
hence if the railway be divided , by 19 posts , into 20 parts , each containing 18 units , trains meet at every post , and , in ( 1 ) , each traveller passes 19 posts in going round , and so meets 19 trains .
but , in ( 2 ) , the easterly traveller only begins to count after traversing <unk> of the journey , i.e. , on reaching the 8th post , and so counts 12 posts : similarly the other counts 8 .
they meet at the end of <unk> of 3 hours , or <unk> of 2 hours , i.e. , 72 minutes .

the 10 wrong answers are from <unk> , financier , i. w. t. , <name> b. , m. a. h. , q. y .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and an <unk> one .
<unk> rightly says that the easterly traveller met all trains which started during the 3 hours of her trip , as well as all which started during the previous 2 hours , i.e. , all which started at the <unk> of 20 periods of 15 minutes each ; and she is right in striking out the one she met at the moment of starting ; but wrong in striking out the last train , for she did not meet this at the terminus , but 15 minutes before she got there .
she makes the same mistake in ( 2 ) .
financier thinks that any train , met for the second time , is not to be counted .
i. w. t. finds , by a process which is not stated , that the travellers met at the end of 71 minutes and <unk> seconds .
<name> b. thinks the trains which are met on starting and on arriving are never to be counted , even when met elsewhere .
q. y .
<unk> tries a rather complex <unk> solution , and succeeds in finding the time of meeting correctly : all else is wrong .
<unk> seems to think that , in ( 1 ) , the easterly train stood still for 3 hours ; and says that , in ( 2 ) , the travellers met at the end of 71 minutes 40 seconds .
<unk> nobly confesses to having tried no calculation , but merely having drawn a picture of the railway and counted the trains ; in ( 1 ) , she counts wrong ; in ( 2 ) she makes them meet in 75 minutes .
<unk> <unk> ( 1 ) : in ( 2 ) he makes <name> count the train she met on her arrival .
the <unk> one is also unintelligible ; it states that the travellers go " <unk> more than the total distance to be traversed " !
the " <name> " theory , already referred to , is adopted by 5 of these , viz. , <unk> , financier , <name> b. , <unk> , and the nameless writer .
the 11 <unk> answers are from <unk> , <name> , castor , cheshire cat , g. e. b. , <name> , <name> , m. a. h. , old maid , r. w. , and <unk> .
all these adopt the " <name> " theory .
castor <unk> ( 1 ) .
<unk> gets ( 1 ) right , but in ( 2 ) makes the same mistake as <unk> .
i notice in your solution a marvellous <unk> :  " 300 miles : 2 hours : : one mile : 24 seconds . "
may i venture to advise your acquiring , as soon as possible , an utter disbelief in the possibility of a ratio existing between miles and hours ?
do not be disheartened by your two <unk> sarcastic remarks on your " roundabout ways . "
their short method , of adding 12 and 8 , has the slight disadvantage of bringing the answer wrong : even a " roundabout " method is better than that !
m. a. h. , in ( 2 ) , makes the travellers count " one " after they met , not when they met .
cheshire cat and old maid get " 20 " as answer for ( 1 ) , by forgetting to strike out the train met on arrival .
the others all get " 18 " in various ways .
<unk> , <name> , and r. w. divide the trains which the westerly traveller has to meet into 2 sets , viz. , those already on the line , which they ( rightly ) make " 11 , " and those which started during her 2 hours ' journey ( exclusive of train met on arrival ) , which they ( wrongly ) make " 7 " ; and they make a similar mistake with the easterly train .
<name> ( rightly ) says that the westerly traveller met a train every 6 minutes for 2 hours , but ( wrongly ) makes the number " 20 " ; it should be " 21 . "
g. e. b. adopts <unk> 's method , but ( wrongly ) strikes out ( for the easterly traveller ) the train which started at the commencement of the previous 2 hours .
<name> thinks a train , met on arrival , must not be counted , even when met on a previous occasion .

* * * * * <unk> answers have been received .
of these , 15 are beyond the reach of discussion , as they give no working .
i can but enumerate their names , and i take this opportunity of saying that this is the last time i shall put on record the names of competitors who give no sort of clue to the process by which their answers were obtained .
in guessing a conundrum , or in catching a flea , we do not expect the breathless <name> to give us afterwards , in cold blood , a history of the mental or muscular efforts by which he achieved success ; but a mathematical calculation is another thing .
the names of this " mute <unk> " band are common sense , d. e. r. , <name> , e. l. , <name> , i. m. t. , j. m. c. , <name> , knot i , <name> , meek , m. f. c. , <unk> , shah , <unk> .
of the eighty-two answers with which the working , or some approach to it , is supplied , one is wrong : seventeen have given solutions which are ( from one cause or another ) practically valueless : the remaining sixty-four i shall try to arrange in a <unk> , according to the varying degrees of shortness and neatness to which they seem to have attained .
the solitary wrong answer is from <name> .
to be thus " alone in the crowd " is a distinction  a painful one , no doubt , but still a distinction .
i am sorry for you , my dear young <name> , and i seem to hear your tearful exclamation , when you read these lines , " ah !
this is the knell of all my hopes ! "
why , oh why , did you assume that the 4th and 5th bags weighed 4 lbs .
each ?
and why did you not test your answers ?
however , please try again : and please do n't change your <unk> : let us have <name> in the first class next time !
the seventeen whose solutions are practically valueless are <unk> , a ready <unk> , <name> , <unk> , <unk> , <name> , first attempt , j. l. c. , m. e. t. , rose , <name> , <unk> , <name> , <unk> , <unk> asleep , <unk> , and <name> .
<unk> tries it by a sort of " rule of false , " assuming experimentally that nos .
1 , 2 , weigh 6 lbs .
each , and having thus produced <unk> , instead of 16 , as the weight of 1 , 3 , and 5 , she removes " the superfluous pound and a half , " but does not explain how she knows from which to take it .
<unk> asleep says that ( when in that peculiar state ) " it seemed perfectly clear " to her that , " 3 out of the 5 sacks being weighed twice over , <unk> of 45 = 27 , must be the total weight of the 5 sacks . "
as to which i can only say , with the captain , " it beats me entirely ! "
<name> , on the plea that " one must have a <unk> , " assumes ( what i fear is a mere guess ) that no .
1 weighed <unk> lbs .
the rest all do it , wholly or partly , by <unk> .
the problem is of course ( as any <unk> sees at once ) a case of " simultaneous simple <unk> . "
it is , however , easily soluble by arithmetic only ; and , when this is the case , i hold that it is bad workmanship to use the more complex method .
i have not , this time , given more credit to arithmetical solutions ; but in future problems i shall ( other things being equal ) give the highest marks to those who use the simplest machinery .
i have put into class i. those whose answers seemed specially short and neat , and into class iii .
those that seemed specially long or clumsy .
of this last set , a. c. m. , <unk> , <name> , partridge , r. w. , and waiting for the train , have sent long wandering solutions , the <unk> having no definite method , but seeming to have been made to see what would come of it .

answers to knot v. <unk>  to <name> pictures , giving 3 x 's to 2 or 3 , 2 to 4 or 5 , and 1 to 9 or 10 ; also giving 3 o 's to 1 or 2 , 2 to 3 or 4 and 1 to 8 or 9 ; so as to <name> the smallest possible number of pictures , and to give them the largest possible number of marks .
answer.  10 pictures ; 29 marks ; arranged thus :  x x x x x x x x x o x x x x x o o o o x x o o o o o o o o <unk>  by giving all the x 's possible , putting into brackets the <unk> ones , we get 10 pictures marked thus :  x x x x x x x x x ( x ) x x x x ( x ) x x ( x ) by then assigning o 's in the same way , beginning at the other end , we get 9 pictures marked thus :  ( o ) o ( o ) o o o ( o ) o o o o o o o o all we have now to do is to run these two wedges as close together as they <name> go , so as to get the minimum number of pictures   <unk> <unk> marks where by so doing we can run them closer , but otherwise letting them stand .
there are 10 necessary marks in the 1st row , and in the 3rd ; but only 7 in the 2nd .
hence we <unk> all <unk> marks in the 1st and 3rd rows , but let them stand in the 2nd .
* * * * * twenty-two answers have been received .
of these 11 give no working ; so , in accordance with what i announced in my last review of answers , i leave them unnamed , merely mentioning that 5 are right and 6 wrong .
of the eleven answers with which some working is supplied , 3 are wrong .
c. h. begins with the rash assertion that under the given conditions " the sum is impossible .
for , " he or she adds ( these <unk> correspondents are dismally vague beings to deal with : perhaps " it " would be a better <unk> ) , " 10 is the least possible number of pictures " ( granted ) : " therefore we must either give 2 x 's to 6 , or 2 <unk> to 5 . "
why " must , " oh <unk> phantom ?
it is nowhere ordained that every picture " must " have 3 marks !
<unk> sends a folio <name> of solution , which deserved a better fate : she offers 3 answers , in each of which 10 pictures are marked , with 30 marks ; in one she gives 2 x 's to 6 pictures ; in another to 7 ; in the 3rd she gives 2 o 's to 5 ; thus in every case ignoring the conditions .
( i pause to remark that the condition " 2 x 's to 4 or 5 pictures " can only mean " either to 4 or else to 5 " : if , as one competitor holds , it might mean any number not less than 4 , the words " or 5 " would be superfluous . )
i. e. a .
( i am happy to say that none of these bloodless phantoms appear this time in the <unk> .
is it idea with the " d " left out ? )
gives 2 x 's to 6 pictures .
she then takes me to task for using the word " ought " instead of " nought . "
no doubt , to one who thus rebels against the rules laid down for her guidance , the word must be distasteful .
but does not i. e. a. remember the parallel case of " <unk> " ?
that creature was originally " a <unk> " : then the two words took to <unk> the poor " n " backwards and forwards like a <unk> , the final state of the game being " an <unk> . "
may not " a nought " have similarly become " an ought " ?
anyhow , " <unk> and crosses " is a very old game .
i do n't think i ever heard it called " <unk> and crosses . "
in the following <unk> , i <name> the solitary occupant of iii .
<name> <unk> her claws when she hears how narrow an escape she has had of not being named at all .
her account of the process by which she got the answer is so meagre that , like the nursery tale of " <unk> " ( i trust i. e. a. <name> be merciful to the spelling ) , it is scarcely to be distinguished from " zero . "

* * * * * problem 2.  l makes 5 <unk> , while m makes 2 : z makes 4 while l makes 3 .
five <unk> of z 's weigh one of l 's ; 5 of m 's weigh 3 of z 's .
one of m 's is as warm as 4 of z 's : and one of l 's as warm as 3 of m 's .
which is best , giving equal weight in the result to rapidity of work , lightness , and warmth ?
answer.  the order is m , l , z .
* * * * * <unk>  as to rapidity ( other things being constant ) l 's merit is to m 's in the ratio of 5 to 2 : z 's to l 's in the ratio of 4 to 3 .
in order to get one set of 3 <name> fulfilling these conditions , it is perhaps simplest to take the one that occurs twice as unity , and reduce the others to fractions : this gives , for l , m , and z , the marks 1 , <unk> , <unk> .
in estimating for lightness , we observe that the greater the weight , the less the merit , so that z 's merit is to <unk> as 5 to 1 .
thus the marks for lightness are <unk> , <unk> , 1 .
and similarly , the marks for warmth are 3 , 1 , 1/4 .
to get the total result , we must multiply l 's 3 marks together , and do the same for m and for z .
the final <name> are 1 <unk> <unk> <unk> 3 , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 1 , <unk> <unk> 1 <unk> 1/4 ; i.e. <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ; i.e. multiplying throughout by 15 ( which <name> not alter the proportion ) , 9 , 10 , 5 ; showing the order of merit to be m , l , z .
* * * * * twenty-nine answers have been received , of which five are right , and twenty-four wrong .
these hapless ones have all ( with three exceptions ) fallen into the error of adding the proportional <name> together , for each candidate , instead of multiplying .
why the latter is right , rather than the former , is fully proved in text-books , so i <name> not occupy space by stating it here : but it can be illustrated very easily by the case of length , breadth , and depth .
suppose a and b are rival <unk> of rectangular tanks : the amount of work done is evidently measured by the number of cubical feet dug out .
let a dig a tank 10 feet long , 10 wide , 2 deep : let b dig one 6 feet long , 5 wide , 10 deep .
the cubical contents are 200 , 300 ; i.e. b is best <unk> in the ratio of 3 to 2 .
now try marking for length , width , and depth , separately ; giving a maximum <name> of 10 to the best in each contest , and then adding the results !
of the twenty-four <unk> , one gives no working , and so has no real claim to be named ; but i break the rule for once , in deference to its success in problem 1 : he , she , or it , is <unk> .
the other twenty-three may be divided into five groups .
first and worst are , i take it , those who put the rightful winner last ; arranging them as " <unk> , <unk> , <name> . "
the names of these desperate <unk> are <unk> , bradshaw of the future , <unk> and <unk> ( who send a joint answer ) , <unk> , <name> , old hen , and simple <name> .
the latter was once best of all ; the old hen has taken advantage of her simplicity , and beguiled her with the chaff which was the <unk> of her own <unk> .
secondly , i point the finger of scorn at those who have put the worst candidate at the top ; arranging them as " <unk> , <name> , <unk> . "
they are <unk> , m. m. , old cat , and r. e. x .
" 't is greece , but   . "
the third set have avoided both these <unk> , and have even succeeded in putting the worst last , their answer being " <unk> , <name> , <unk> . "
their names are <unk> ( who also appears among the " quite too too " ) , <name> c. , f. b. , <unk> , <unk> , <name> , and mrs. <unk> gamp .
f. b. has not fallen into the common error ; she <unk> together the proportionate <name> she gets , but in getting them she goes wrong , by reckoning warmth as a <unk> .
possibly she is " freshly burnt , " or comes " from bombay . "
<name> and mrs. <unk> gamp have also avoided this error : the method they have adopted is shrouded in mystery  i scarcely feel competent to <unk> it .
mrs. gamp says " if <unk> makes 4 while <unk> makes 3 , <unk> makes 6 while <unk> makes 5 ( bad reasoning ) , while <name> makes 2 . "
from this she concludes " therefore <unk> <unk> in speed by 1 " ( i.e. when compared with <unk> ; but what about <name> ? ) .
she then compares the 3 kinds of excellence , measured on this mystic scale .
<name> takes the statement , that " <unk> makes 5 while <name> makes 2 , " to prove that " <unk> makes 3 while <name> makes 1 and <unk> 4 " ( worse reasoning than mrs. gamp 's ) , and thence concludes that " <unk> <unk> in speed by 1/8 " !
<name> should have been <name> , " mystery of mysteries ! "
the fourth set actually put <name> at the top , arranging them as " <name> , <unk> , <unk> . "
they are <name> and co. , <unk> , s. b .

these <unk> comrades , by dint of foot and fin , have scrambled into the right answer , but , as their method is wrong , of course it counts for nothing .
also an ancient fish has very ancient and <unk> ideas as to how <name> represent merit : she says " <unk> gains <unk> on <name> . "
two and a half what ?
fish , fish , <name> thou in thy duty ?
of the five winners i put balbus and the elder traveller slightly below the other three  balbus for defective reasoning , the other for scanty working .
balbus gives two reasons for saying that addition of marks is not the right method , and then adds " it follows that the decision must be made by multiplying the marks together . "
this is hardly more logical than to say " this is not spring : therefore it must be autumn . "

* * * * * with regard to knot v. , i beg to express to vis <unk> and to any others who , like her , understood the condition to be that every marked picture must have three marks , my sincere regret that the unfortunate phrase " fill the columns with <unk> and crosses " should have caused them to waste so much time and trouble .
i can only repeat that a literal interpretation of " fill " would seem to me to require that every picture in the gallery should be marked .
vis <unk> would have been in the first class if she had sent in the solution she now offers .
answers to knot vii .
<unk>  given that one glass of lemonade , 3 sandwiches , and 7 biscuits , cost 1_s. <unk> ; and that one glass of lemonade , 4 sandwiches , and 10 biscuits , cost 1_s. <unk> : find the cost of ( 1 ) a glass of lemonade , a sandwich , and a biscuit ; and ( 2 ) 2 glasses of lemonade , 3 sandwiches , and 5 biscuits .
answer.  ( 1 ) <unk> ; ( 2 ) 1_s. <unk> <unk>  this is best treated <unk> .
let x = the cost ( in pence ) of a glass of lemonade , y of a sandwich , and z of a biscuit .
then we have x + <unk> + <unk> = 14 , and x + <unk> + <unk> = 17 .
and we require the values of x + y + z , and of <unk> + <unk> + <unk> .
now , from two <unk> only , we can not find , separately , the values of three <unk> : certain combinations of them may , however , be found .
also we know that we can , by the help of the given <unk> , eliminate 2 of the 3 <unk> from the quantity whose value is required , which <name> then contain one only .
if , then , the required value is <unk> at all , it can only be by the 3rd unknown vanishing of itself : otherwise the problem is impossible .
let us then eliminate lemonade and sandwiches , and reduce everything to biscuits  a state of things even more depressing than " if all the world were <unk> "  by <unk> the 1st equation from the 2nd , which <unk> lemonade , and gives y + <unk> = 3 , or y = <unk> ; and then substituting this value of y in the 1st , which gives <unk> = 5 , i.e. x = 5 + <unk> .
now if we substitute these values of x , y , in the quantities whose values are required , the first becomes ( 5 + <unk> ) + ( <unk> ) + z , i.e. 8 : and the second becomes 2 ( 5 + <unk> ) + 3 ( <unk> ) + <unk> , i.e. 19 .
hence the answers are ( 1 ) <unk> , ( 2 ) 1_s. <unk> * * * * * the above is a universal method : that is , it is absolutely certain either to produce the answer , or to prove that no answer is possible .
the question may also be solved by combining the quantities whose values are given , so as to form those whose values are required .
this is merely a matter of ingenuity and good luck : and as it may fail , even when the thing is possible , and is of no use in proving it <unk> , i can not rank this method as equal in value with the other .
even when it succeeds , it may prove a very tedious process .
suppose the 26 competitors , who have sent in what i may call accidental solutions , had had a question to deal with where every number contained 8 or 10 digits !
i suspect it would have been a case of " silvered is the <name> hair " ( see " <name> " ) before any solution would have been hit on by the most ingenious of them .
forty-five answers have come in , of which 44 give , i am happy to say , some sort of working , and therefore deserve to be mentioned by name , and to have their virtues , or vices as the case may be , discussed .
thirteen have made assumptions to which they have no right , and so can not figure in the <unk> , even though , in 10 of the 13 cases , the answer is right .
of the remaining 28 , no less than 26 have sent in accidental solutions , and therefore fall short of the highest honours .
i <name> now discuss individual cases , taking the worst first , as my custom is .
froggy gives no working  at least this is all he gives : after stating the given <unk> , he says " therefore the difference , 1 sandwich + 3 biscuits , = 3_d. " : then follow the amounts of the unknown bills , with no further hint as to how he got them .
froggy has had a very narrow escape of not being named at all !
of those who are wrong , vis <unk> has sent in a piece of incorrect working .
peruse the horrid details , and shudder !
she takes x ( call it " y " ) as the cost of a sandwich , and concludes ( rightly enough ) that a biscuit <name> cost ( <unk> ) <unk> .
she then <unk> the second equation from the first , and <unk> <unk> + 7 <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> + 10 <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> = 3 .
by making two mistakes in this line , she brings out y = <unk> .
try it again , oh vis <unk> !
away with <unk> : <unk> a little more vis : and you <name> bring out the correct ( though uninteresting ) result , 0 = 0 !
this <name> show you that it is hopeless to try to coax any one of these 3 <unk> to reveal its separate value .
the other competitor , who is wrong throughout , is either j. m. c. or t. m. c. : but , whether he be a juvenile <unk> or a true mathematician confused , he makes the answers <unk> and 1_s. <unk> he assumes , with too much confidence , that biscuits were <unk> each , and that <name> paid for 8 , though she only ate 7 !
we <name> now consider the 13 whose working is wrong , though the answer is right : and , not to measure their <unk> too exactly , i <name> take them in <unk> order .
<name> finds ( rightly ) that " 1 sandwich and 3 biscuits cost 3_d. , " and proceeds " therefore 1 sandwich = <unk> , 3 biscuits = <unk> , 1 lemonade = 6_d. " <name> mite begins like <name> : and thence proves ( rightly ) that a biscuit costs less than a <unk> : whence she concludes ( wrongly ) that it must cost <unk> f. c. w. is so beautifully resigned to the certainty of a verdict of " guilty , " that i have hardly the heart to utter the word , without adding a " recommended to <name> owing to <unk> circumstances . "
but really , you know , where are the <unk> circumstances ?
she begins by assuming that lemonade is <unk> a glass , and sandwiches 3_d. each , ( making with the 2 given <unk> , four conditions to be fulfilled by three miserable <unk> ! ) .
and , having ( naturally ) developed this into a contradiction , she then tries <unk> and <unk> with a similar result .
( n.b .
this process might have been carried on through the whole of the tertiary period , without gratifying one single megatherium . )
she then , by a " happy thought , " tries <unk> biscuits , and so obtains a consistent result .
this may be a good solution , viewing the problem as a conundrum : but it is not scientific .
<name> <unk> sandwiches with biscuits !
" one sandwich + 3 biscuits " she makes equal to " 4 . "
four what ?
<unk> makes the astounding assertion that the equation , s + <unk> = 3 , " is evidently only satisfied by s = <unk> , b = 1/2 " !
old cat believes that the assumption that a sandwich costs <unk> is " the only way to avoid unmanageable fractions . "
but why avoid them ?
is there not a certain glow of triumph in taming such a fraction ?
" ladies and gentlemen , the fraction now before you is one that for years defied all efforts of a <unk> nature : it was , in a word , hopelessly vulgar .
treating it as a circulating <unk> ( the <unk> of fractions ) only made matters worse .
as a last resource , i reduced it to its lowest terms , and extracted its square root ! "
joking apart , let me thank old cat for some very kind words of sympathy , in reference to a correspondent ( whose name i am happy to say i have now forgotten ) who had found fault with me as a <unk> critic .

he takes the given <unk> as ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) : thence , by the process [ ( 2 )  ( 1 ) ] <unk> ( rightly ) equation ( 3 ) viz .
s + <unk> = 3 : and thence again , by the process [ <unk> ] ( a hopeless mystery ) , <unk> <unk> + <unk> = 4 .
i have nothing to say about it : i give it up .
<unk> says " it is immaterial to the answer " ( why ? )
" in what proportion 3_d. is divided between the sandwich and the 3 biscuits " : so she assumes s = <unk> , b = <unk> stanza is one of a very irregular metre .
at first she ( like <name> ) <unk> sandwiches with biscuits .
she then tries two assumptions ( s = 1 , b = <unk> , and s = 1/2 b = <unk> ) , and ( naturally ) ends in contradictions .
then she returns to the first assumption , and finds the 3 <unk> separately : <unk> est <unk> .
<unk> <unk> sandwiches and biscuits , as " articles . "
is the word ever used by <unk> ?
i fancied " what is the next article , ma'am ? "
was limited to <unk> .
two sisters first assume that biscuits are 4 a <name> , and then that they are 2 a <name> , adding that " the answer <name> of course be the same in both cases . "
it is a dreamy remark , making one feel something like <unk> grasping at the spectral dagger .
" is this a statement that i see before me ? "

and old crow , who send a joint answer , and y. y. , adopt the same method .
y. y. gets the equation s + <unk> = 3 : and then says " this sum must be <unk> in one of the three following ways . "
it may be , i <name> you : but y. y. do you say " must " ?
i fear it is possible for y. y. to be two y 's .
the other two conspirators are less positive : they say it " can " be so divided : but they add " either of the three prices being right " !

of those who win honours , the shetland snark must have the 3rd class all to himself .
he has only answered half the question , viz .
the amount of <name> 's luncheon : the two little old ladies he <unk> leaves in the midst of their " difficulty . "
i beg to assure him ( with thanks for his friendly remarks ) that <unk> and <unk> are things unknown in that most economical of clubs , " the <unk> . "
the authors of the 26 " accidental " solutions differ only in the number of steps they have taken between the data and the answers .
in order to do them full justice i have arranged the 2nd class in sections , according to the number of steps .
the two kings are fearfully deliberate !
i suppose walking quick , or taking short cuts , is inconsistent with kingly dignity : but really , in reading <unk> solution , one almost fancied he was " marking time , " and making no advance at all !
the other king <name> , i <name> , pardon me for having altered " coal " into " <name> . "
king <unk> , or coil , seems to have reigned soon after <name> 's time .
<name> of <unk> <unk> him with the king <unk> who first built walls round <unk> , which was named after him .
in the chronicle of <name> of gloucester we read :  " <unk> <unk> <unk> , of <unk> we <unk> y told , marius ys <unk> was <unk> , <unk> mon & bold .
and ys <unk> was <unk> <unk> , coil was ys name , <unk> it were <unk> men , & of <name> fame . "
balbus lays it down as a general principle that " in order to ascertain the cost of any one luncheon , it must come to the same amount upon two different assumptions . "
( <unk> should not " it " be " we " ?
otherwise the luncheon is represented as wishing to ascertain its own cost ! )
he then makes two assumptions  one , that sandwiches cost nothing ; the other , that biscuits cost nothing , ( either arrangement would lead to the shop being <unk> crowded ! )
 and brings out the unknown <unk> as <unk> and <unk> , on each assumption .
he then concludes that this agreement of results " shows that the answers are correct . "
now i propose to <unk> his general law by simply giving one instance of its failing .
one instance is quite enough .
in logical language , in order to <unk> a " universal affirmative , " it is enough to prove its contradictory , which is a " particular negative . "
( i must pause for a digression on logic , and especially on ladies ' logic .
the universal affirmative " everybody says he 's a duck " is crushed instantly by proving the particular negative " <name> says he 's a goose , " which is equivalent to " <name> does not say he 's a duck . "
and the universal negative " nobody calls on her " is well met by the particular affirmative " i called yesterday . "
in short , either of two <unk> <unk> the other : and the moral is that , since a particular proposition is much more easily proved than a universal one , it is the wisest course , in arguing with a <name> , to limit one 's own assertions to " particulars , " and leave her to prove the " universal " contradictory , if she can .
you <name> thus generally secure a logical victory : a practical victory is not to be hoped for , since she can always fall back upon the crushing remark " that has nothing to do with it ! "
 a move for which man has not yet discovered any satisfactory answer .
now let us return to balbus . )
here is my " particular negative , " on which to test his rule .
suppose the two recorded <unk> to have been " 2 buns , one <unk> , 2 <unk> , and a bottle of <unk> : total , <unk> , " and " one bun , 2 <unk> , a <unk> , and a bottle of <unk> : total , <unk> . "
and suppose <name> 's unknown luncheon to have been " 3 buns , one <unk> , one <unk> , and 2 bottles of <unk> : " while the two little sisters had been indulging in " 8 buns , 4 <unk> , 2 <unk> , and 6 bottles of <unk> . "
( poor souls , how thirsty they must have been ! )
if balbus <name> kindly try this by his principle of " two assumptions , " first assuming that a bun is <unk> and a <unk> <unk> , and then that a bun is 3_d. and a <unk> 3_d. , he <name> bring out the other two <unk> , on each assumption , as " <unk> " and " <unk> " respectively , which <name> of results , he <name> say , " shows that the answers are correct . "
and yet , as a matter of fact , the buns were <unk> each , the <unk> 3_d. , the <unk> 6_d. , and the <unk> <unk> a bottle : so that <name> 's third luncheon had cost <unk> , and her thirsty friends had spent <unk> !
another remark of balbus i <name> quote and discuss : for i think that it also may yield a moral for some of my readers .
he says " it is the same thing in substance whether in solving this problem we use words and call it arithmetic , or use letters and signs and call it algebra . "
now this does not appear to me a correct description of the two methods : the arithmetical method is that of " <unk> " only ; it goes from one known fact to another , till it reaches its goal : whereas the <unk> method is that of " analysis " : it begins with the goal , <unk> represented , and so goes backwards , dragging its veiled victim with it , till it has reached the full daylight of known facts , in which it can tear off the veil and say " i know you ! "
take an illustration .
your house has been broken into and robbed , and you appeal to the policeman who was on duty that night .
" well , mum , i did see a chap getting out over your <unk> : but i was a good bit off , so i did n't <name> him , like .
i just cut down the short way to the <unk> , and who should i meet but <name> <unk> , coming full split round the corner .
so i just ups and says 'my lad , you 're wanted . '
that 's all i says .
and he says 'i 'll go along quiet , <name> , ' he says , <unk> the <unk> , ' he says . "
there 's your arithmetical policeman .
now try the other method .
" i seed somebody a running , but he was well gone or ever i got nigh the place .
so i just took a look round in the garden .
and i noticed the <unk> , where the chap had come right across your flower-beds .
they was good big <unk> <unk> .
and i noticed as the left foot went down at the heel , ever so much deeper than the other .
and i says to myself 'the chap 's been a big <unk> chap : and he goes lame on his left foot . '
and i rubs my hand on the wall where he got over , and there was soot on it , and no mistake .
so i says to myself 'now where can i light on a big man , in the <unk> line , what 's lame of one foot ? '
and i flashes up <unk> : and i says 'it 's <name> <unk> ! '
says i . "
there is your <unk> policeman  a higher intellectual type , to my thinking , than the other .
little <name> 's solution calls for a word of praise , as he has written out what really is an <unk> proof in words , without representing any of his facts as <unk> .
if it is all his own , he <name> make a good <unk> in the time to come .
i beg to thank simple <name> for some kind words of sympathy , to the same effect as those received from old cat .
<unk> and <unk> are the only two who have used a method certain either to produce the answer , or else to prove it impossible : so they must share between them the highest honours .

answers to correspondents .
i have received several letters on the subjects of knots ii .
and vi. , which lead me to think some further explanation desirable .
in knot ii. , i had intended the numbering of the houses to begin at one corner of the square , and this was assumed by most , if not all , of the competitors .
<unk> however says " assuming , in default of any information , that the street enters the square in the middle of each side , it may be supposed that the numbering begins at a street . "
but surely the other is the more natural assumption ?
in knot vi. , the first problem was of course a mere <unk> de <unk> , whose presence i thought excusable in a series of problems whose aim is to entertain rather than to instruct : but it has not escaped the contemptuous criticisms of two of my correspondents , who seem to think that apollo is in duty bound to keep his bow always on the stretch .
neither of them has guessed it : and this is true human nature .
only the other day  the <unk> of <name> , to be quite exact  i met my old friend brown , and gave him a riddle i had just heard .
with one great effort of his colossal mind , brown guessed it .
" right ! "
said i .
" ah , " said he , " it 's very neat  very neat .
and it is n't an answer that would occur to everybody .
very neat indeed . "
a few yards further on , i fell in with smith and to him i propounded the same riddle .
he frowned over it for a minute , and then gave it up .
meekly i faltered out the answer .
" a poor thing , sir ! "
smith growled , as he turned away .
" a very poor thing !
i wonder you care to repeat such rubbish ! "
yet smith 's mind is , if possible , even more colossal than brown 's .
the second problem of knot <name> .
is an example in ordinary double rule of three , whose essential feature is that the result depends on the variation of several elements , which are so related to it that , if all but one be constant , it varies as that one : hence , if none be constant , it varies as their product .
thus , for example , the cubical contents of a rectangular tank vary as its length , if breadth and depth be constant , and so on ; hence , if none be constant , it varies as the product of the length , breadth , and depth .
when the result is not thus connected with the varying elements , the problem ceases to be double rule of three and often becomes one of great complexity .
to illustrate this , let us take two candidates for a prize , a and b , who are to compete in french , <name> , and italian : ( a ) let it be laid down that the result is to depend on their relative knowledge of each subject , so that , whether their marks , for french , be " 1 , 2 " or " 100 , 200 , " the result <name> be the same : and let it also be laid down that , if they get equal marks on 2 papers , the final marks are to have the same ratio as those of the 3rd paper .
this is a case of ordinary double rule of three .
we multiply a 's 3 marks together , and do the same for b .
note that , if a gets a single " 0 , " his final <name> is " 0 , " even if he gets full marks for 2 papers while b gets only one <name> for each paper .
this of course would be very unfair on a , though a correct solution under the given conditions .
( b ) the result is to depend , as before , on relative knowledge ; but french is to have twice as much weight as <name> or italian .
this is an unusual form of question .
i should be inclined to say " the resulting ratio is to be nearer to the french ratio than if we multiplied as in ( a ) , and so much nearer that it would be necessary to use the other <unk> twice to produce the same result as in ( a ) : " <unk> if the french ratio were <unk> , and the others <unk> , <unk> so that the ultimate ratio , by method ( a ) , would be <unk> , i should multiply instead by <unk> , <unk> , giving the result , <unk> which is nearer to <unk> than if he had used method ( a ) .
( c ) the result is to depend on actual amount of knowledge of the 3 subjects collectively .
here we have to ask two questions .
( 1 ) what is to be the " unit " ( i.e. " standard to measure by " ) in each subject ?
( 2 ) are these units to be of equal , or unequal value ?
the usual " unit " is the knowledge shown by answering the whole paper correctly ; calling this " 100 , " all lower amounts are represented by <name> between " 0 " and " 100 . "
then , if these units are to be of equal value , we simply add a 's 3 marks together , and do the same for b .
( d ) the conditions are the same as ( c ) , but french is to have double weight .
here we simply double the french marks , and add as before .
( e ) french is to have such weight , that , if other marks be equal , the ultimate ratio is to be that of the french paper , so that a " 0 " in this would swamp the candidate : but the other two subjects are only to affect the result collectively , by the amount of knowledge shown , the two being reckoned of equal value .
here i should add a 's <name> and italian marks together , and multiply by his french <name> .
but i need not go on : the problem may evidently be set with many varying conditions , each requiring its own method of solution .
the problem in knot <name> .
was meant to belong to variety ( a ) , and to make this clear , i inserted the following passage : " usually the competitors differ in one point only .
thus , last year , <unk> and <unk> made the same number of <unk> in the trial week , and they were equally light ; but <unk> 's were twice as warm as <unk> 's , and she was pronounced twice as good . "
what i have said <name> suffice , i <name> , as an answer to balbus , who holds that ( a ) and ( c ) are the only possible varieties of the problem , and that to say " we can not use addition , therefore we must be intended to use multiplication , " is " no more illogical than , from knowledge that one was not born in the night , to infer that he was born in the daytime " ; and also to <unk> , who says " i think a little more consideration <name> show you that our <unk> of adding the proportional <name> together for each candidate instead of multiplying ' is no error at all . "
why , even if addition had been the right method to use , not one of the writers ( i speak from memory ) showed any consciousness of the necessity of fixing a " unit " for each subject .
" no error at all ! "
they were positively steeped in error !
one correspondent ( i do not name him , as the communication is not quite friendly in tone ) writes thus :  " i wish to add , very respectfully , that i think it would be in better taste if you were to abstain from the very <unk> expressions which you are accustomed to indulge in when <unk> the answer .
that such a tone must not be " ( " be not " ? )
" agreeable to the persons concerned who have made mistakes may possibly have no great weight with you , but i <name> you <name> feel that it would be as well not to employ it , unless you are quite certain of being correct yourself . "
the only instances the writer gives of the " <unk> expressions " are " hapless " and " <unk> . "
i beg to assure him ( and any others who may need the assurance : i trust there are none ) that all such words have been used in jest , and with no idea that they could possibly annoy any one , and that i sincerely regret any annoyance i may have thus <unk> given .
may i <name> that in future they <name> recognise the distinction between severe language used in sober <name> , and the " words of <unk> bitterness , " which coleridge has alluded to in that lovely passage beginning " a little child , a limber <unk> " ?
if the writer <name> refer to that passage , or to the preface to " fire , famine , and slaughter , " he <name> find the distinction , for which i plead , far better drawn out than i could <name> to do in any words of mine .
the writer 's insinuation that i care not how much annoyance i give to my readers i think it best to pass over in silence ; but to his concluding remark i must entirely demur .
i hold that to use language likely to annoy any of my correspondents would not be in the least justified by the plea that i was " quite certain of being correct . "
i trust that the <unk> and i are not on such terms as those !
i beg to thank g .
b. for the offer of a puzzle  which , however , is too like the old one " make four 9 's into 100 . "

answer.  place 8 pigs in the first sty , 10 in the second , nothing in the third , and 6 in the fourth : 10 is nearer ten than 8 ; nothing is nearer ten than 10 ; 6 is nearer ten than nothing ; and 8 is nearer ten than 6 .

the <unk> .
<unk>  omnibuses start from a certain point , both ways , every 15 minutes .
a traveller , starting on foot along with one of them , meets one in <unk> minutes : when <name> he be overtaken by one ?
answer.  in <unk> minutes .
* * * * * <unk>  let " a " be the distance an omnibus goes in 15 minutes , and " x " the distance from the <unk> to where the traveller is overtaken .
since the omnibus met is due at the <unk> in <unk> minutes , it goes in that time as far as the traveller walks in <unk> ; i.e. it goes 5 times as fast .
now the overtaking omnibus is " a " behind the traveller when he starts , and therefore goes " a + x " while he goes " x . "
hence a + x = <unk> ; i.e. <unk> = a , and x = <unk> .
this distance would be traversed by an omnibus in <unk> minutes , and therefore by the traveller in 5 <unk> <unk> .
hence he is overtaken in <unk> minutes after starting , i.e. in <unk> minutes after meeting the omnibus .
* * * * * four answers have been received , of which two are wrong .
<name> mite rightly states that the overtaking omnibus reached the point where they met the other omnibus 5 minutes after they left , but wrongly concludes that , going 5 times as fast , it would overtake them in another minute .
the travellers are <unk> ahead of the omnibus , and must walk <unk> of this distance farther before the omnibus <unk> them , which <name> be <unk> of the distance traversed by the omnibus in the same time : this <name> require <unk> minutes more .
<unk> <unk> tries it by a process like " achilles and the tortoise . "
he rightly states that , when the overtaking omnibus leaves the gate , the travellers are <unk> of " a " ahead , and that it <name> take the omnibus 3 minutes to traverse this distance ; " during which time " the travellers , he tells us , go <unk> of " a " ( this should be <unk> ) .
the travellers being now <unk> of " a " ahead , he concludes that the work remaining to be done is for the travellers to go <unk> of " a , " while the omnibus goes <unk> .
the principle is correct , and might have been applied earlier .

§ 1 .
the buckets .
<unk>  <unk> states that a solid , immersed in a fluid , <unk> an amount equal to itself in bulk .
how can this be true of a small bucket floating in a larger one ?
<unk>  <unk> means , by " <unk> , " " occupies a space which might be filled with water without any change in the surroundings . "
if the portion of the floating bucket , which is above the water , could be annihilated , and the rest of it transformed into water , the surrounding water would not change its position : which agrees with <unk> statement .
* * * * * five answers have been received , none of which explains the difficulty arising from the well-known fact that a floating body is the same weight as the displaced fluid .
<unk> says that " only that portion of the smaller bucket which descends below the original level of the water can be properly said to be immersed , and only an equal bulk of water is displaced . "
hence , according to <unk> , a solid , whose weight was equal to that of an equal bulk of water , would not float till the whole of it was below " the original level " of the water : but , as a matter of fact , it would float as soon as it was all under water .
magpie says the fallacy is " the assumption that one body can <unk> another from a place where it is n't , " and that <unk> 's assertion is incorrect , except when the containing vessel " was originally full to the brim . "
but the question of floating depends on the present state of things , not on past history .
old king <name> takes the same view as <unk> .
<unk> and vindex assume that " displaced " means " raised above its original level , " and merely explain how it comes to pass that the water , so raised , is less in bulk than the immersed portion of bucket , and thus land themselves  or rather set themselves floating  in the same boat as <unk> .
i regret that there is no <unk> to publish for this problem .

is this true ?

the garden .
<unk>  an oblong garden , half a yard longer than wide , consists entirely of a <unk> , spirally arranged , a yard wide and <unk> yards long .
find the dimensions of the garden .
answer.  60 , <unk> .
<unk>  the number of yards and fractions of a yard traversed in walking along a straight piece of walk , is evidently the same as the number of <unk> and fractions of a <unk> , contained in that piece of walk : and the distance , traversed in passing through a <unk> at a corner , is evidently a yard .
hence the area of the garden is <unk> <unk> : i.e. , if x be the width , x ( x + 1/2 ) = <unk> .
solving this <unk> , we find x = 60 .
hence the dimensions are 60 , <unk> .
* * * * * twelve answers have been received  seven right and five wrong .
c. g. l. , <unk> , old crow , and <unk> assume that the number of yards in the length of the path is equal to the number of <unk> in the garden .
this is true , but should have been proved .
but each is guilty of darker deeds .
c. g. l. 's " working " consists of dividing <unk> by 60 .
whence came this <unk> , oh <unk> ?
<unk> ?
or was it a dream ?
i fear this solution is worth nothing .
old crow 's is shorter , and so ( if possible ) worth rather less .
he says the answer " is at once seen to be 60 <unk> <unk> " !
<unk> 's calculation is short , but " as <name> as a <unk> " in error .
he says that the square root of <unk> , multiplied by 2 , equals the length plus the breadth .
that is <unk> <unk> 2 = <unk> .
his first assertion is only true of a square garden .
his second is irrelevant , since <unk> is not the <unk> of <unk> !
nay , <name> , this <name> not do !
<unk> says that , by extracting the <unk> of <unk> , we get 60 yards with a remainder of <unk> , or <unk> , which we add so as to make the oblong 60 <unk> <unk> .
this is very terrible : but worse remains behind .
<unk> proceeds thus :  " but why should there be the <unk> at all ?
because without it there would be no space at all for flowers .
by means of it , we find reserved in the very centre a small plot of ground , two yards long by <unk> wide , the only space not occupied by walk . "
but balbus expressly said that the walk " used up the whole of the area . "
oh , <unk> !
my <unk> is exhausted : my <name> is <unk> !
i can say no more .
<unk> <unk> , again and again , in that most fatal of all habits in <unk>  the making two mistakes which <unk> each other .
she takes x as the width of the garden , in yards , and x + 1/2 as its length , and makes her first " coil " the sum of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , i.e. <unk> : but the fourth term should be <unk> , so that her first coil is 1/2 a yard too long .
her second coil is the sum of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> : here the first term should be <unk> and the last <unk> : these two mistakes <unk> , and this coil is therefore right .
and the same thing is true of every other coil but the last , which needs an extra <unk> to reach the end of the path : and this exactly balances the mistake in the first coil .
thus the sum total of the coils comes right though the working is all wrong .
of the seven who are right , <name> mite , <name> , magpie , and taffy make the same assumption as c. g. l. and co .
they then solve by a <unk> .
magpie also tries it by arithmetical progression , but fails to notice that the first and last " coils " have special values .
<unk> <unk> attempts to prove what c. g. l. assumes by a particular instance , taking a garden 6 by <unk> .
he ought to have proved it generally : what is true of one number is not always true of others .
old king <name> <unk> it by an arithmetical progression .
it is right , but too lengthy to be worth as much as a <unk> .
vindex proves it very neatly , by pointing out that a yard of walk measured along the middle represents a square yard of garden , " whether we consider the straight stretches of walk or the square yards at the angles , in which the middle line goes half a yard in one direction and then turns a right <name> and goes half a yard in another direction .

an arm , 85 per cent .
a leg : what percentage , at least , must have lost all four ?
answer.  ten .
<unk>  ( i adopt that of polar <name> , as being better than my own ) .
adding the wounds together , we get 70 + 75 + 80 + 85 = 310 , among 100 men ; which gives 3 to each , and 4 to 10 men .
therefore the least percentage is 10 .
* * * * * nineteen answers have been received .
one is " 5 , " but , as no working is given with it , it must , in accordance with the rule , remain " a deed without a name . "
<name> makes it " 35 and <unk> . "
i am sorry she has misunderstood the question , and has supposed that those who had lost an ear were 75 per cent .
of those who had lost an eye ; and so on .
of course , on this supposition , the <unk> must all be multiplied together .
this she has done correctly , but i can give her no honours , as i do not think the question <name> fairly bear her interpretation , three score and ten makes it " 19 and <unk> . "
her solution has given me  i <name> not say " many anxious days and sleepless nights , " for i wish to be strictly truthful , but  some trouble in making any sense at all of it .
she makes the number of " pensioners wounded once " to be 310 ( " per cent. , " i suppose !
) : dividing by 4 , she gets 77 and a half as " average percentage : " again dividing by 4 , she gets 19 and <unk> as " percentage wounded four times . "
does she suppose wounds of different kinds to " absorb " each other , so to speak ?
then , no doubt , the data are equivalent to 77 pensioners with one wound each , and a <unk> with a <unk> .
and does she then suppose these concentrated wounds to be transferable , so that <unk> of these unfortunates can obtain perfect health by handing over their wounds to the remaining <unk> ?
granting these <unk> , her answer is right ; or rather , if the question had been " a road is covered with one inch of gravel , along 77 and a half per cent .
of it .
how much of it could be covered 4 inches deep with the same material ? "
her answer would have been right .
but alas , that wasn't the question !
<name> makes some most amazing assumptions : " let every one who has not lost an eye have lost an ear , " " let every one who has not lost both eyes and ears have lost an arm . "
her ideas of a battle-field are grim indeed .
fancy a warrior who would continue fighting after losing both eyes , both ears , and both arms !
this is a case which she ( or " it ? " )
evidently considers possible .
next come eight writers who have made the <unk> assumption that , because 70 per cent .
have lost an eye , therefore 30 per cent .
have not lost one , so that they have both eyes .
this is illogical .
if you give me a bag containing 100 sovereigns , and if in an hour i come to you ( my face not beaming with gratitude nearly so much as when i received the bag ) to say " i am sorry to tell you that 70 of these sovereigns are bad , " do i thereby guarantee the other 30 to be good ?
perhaps i have not tested them yet .
the sides of this illogical <unk> are as follows , in <unk> order :  algernon bray , <name> mite , g. s. c. , <name> e. , j. d. w. , magpie ( who makes the delightful remark " therefore 90 per cent .
have two of something , " recalling to one 's memory that fortunate monarch , with whom xerxes was so much pleased that " he gave him ten of everything !
" ) , s. s. g. , and tokio .
bradshaw of the future and t. r. do the question in a <unk> fashion  on the principle that the 70 per cent .
and the 75 per cent. , though commenced at opposite ends of the 100 , must overlap by at least 45 per cent .
; and so on .
this is quite correct working , but not , i think , quite the best way of doing it .
the other five competitors <name> , i <name> , feel themselves sufficiently glorified by being placed in the first class , without my composing a triumphal ode for each !

§ 2 .
change of day .
i must postpone , <unk> die , the geographical problem  partly because i have not yet received the statistics i am hoping for , and partly because i am myself so entirely puzzled by it ; and when an <unk> is himself dimly hovering between a second class and a third how is he to decide the position of others ?
§ 3 .
the sons ' ages .
<unk>  " at first , two of the ages are together equal to the third .
a few years afterwards , two of them are together double of the third .
when the number of years since the first occasion is two-thirds of the sum of the ages on that occasion , one age is 21 .
what are the other two ?
answer.  " 15 and 18 . "
* * * * * <unk>  let the ages at first be x , y , ( x + y ) .
now , if a + b = <unk> , then ( <unk> ) + ( <unk> ) = 2 ( <unk> ) , whatever be the value of n .
hence the second relationship , if ever true , was always true .
hence it was true at first .
but it can not be true that x and y are together double of ( x + y ) .
hence it must be true of ( x + y ) , together with x or y ; and it does not matter which we take .
we assume , then , ( x + y ) + x = <unk> ; i.e. y = <unk> .
hence the three ages were , at first , x , <unk> , <unk> ; and the number of years , since that time is two-thirds of <unk> , i.e. is <unk> .
hence the present ages are <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
the ages are clearly <unk> , since this is only " the year when one of my sons comes of age . "
hence <unk> = 21 , x = 3 , and the other ages are 15 , 18 .
* * * * * eighteen answers have been received .
one of the writers merely asserts that the first occasion was 12 years ago , that the ages were then 9 , 6 , and 3 ; and that on the second occasion they were 14 , 11 , and 8 !
as a <name> father , i ought to withhold the name of the rash writer ; but respect for age makes me break the rule : it is three score and ten .
<name> e. also asserts that the ages at first were 9 , 6 , 3 : then she <unk> the present ages , leaving the second occasion unnoticed .
old hen is nearly as bad ; she " tried various <name> till i found one that fitted all the conditions " ; but merely scratching up the earth , and pecking about , is not the way to solve a problem , oh venerable bird !
and close after old hen <unk> , with hungry eyes , old cat , who calmly assumes , to begin with , that the son who comes of age is the eldest .
eat your bird , puss , for you <name> get nothing from me !
there are yet two <unk> to dispose of .
<name> assumes that , on every occasion , a son comes of age ; and that it is only such a son who is " tipped with gold . "
is it wise thus to interpret " now , my boys , calculate your ages , and you shall have the money " ?
bradshaw of the future says " let " the ages at first be 9 , 6 , 3 , then assumes that the second occasion was 6 years afterwards , and on these <unk> assumptions brings out the right answers .
guide future travellers , an thou wilt : thou <name> no bradshaw for this age !
of those who win honours , the merely " honourable " are two .
<name> mite <unk> ( rightly ) the relationship between the three ages at first , but then assumes one of them to be " 6 , " thus making the rest of her solution tentative .
m. f. c. does the algebra all right up to the conclusion that the present ages are <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ; it then assumes , without giving any reason , that <unk> = 21 .
of the more honourable , <name> attempts a novelty  to discover which son comes of age by elimination : it assumes , successively , that it is the middle one , and that it is the youngest ; and in each case it apparently brings out an absurdity .
still , as the proof contains the following bit of algebra , " 63 = <unk> + <unk> ; [ ** therefore ] 21 = x + 4 <unk> of y , " i trust it <name> admit that its proof is not quite conclusive .
the rest of its work is good .
magpie betrays the deplorable tendency of her tribe  to appropriate any stray conclusion she comes across , without having any strict logical right to it .
assuming a , b , c , as the ages at first , and d as the number of the years that have elapsed since then , she finds ( rightly ) the 3 <unk> , <unk> = b , c = b + a , d = <unk> .
she then says " supposing that a = 1 , then b = 2 , c = 3 , and d = 4 .
therefore for a , b , c , d , four <name> are wanted which shall be to each other as <unk> . "
it is in the " therefore " that i detect the <unk> of this bird .
the conclusion is true , but this is only because the <unk> are " homogeneous " ( i.e. having one " unknown " in each term ) , a fact which i strongly suspect had not been grasped  i beg pardon , clawed  by her .
were i to lay this little pitfall , " a + 1 = b , b + 1 = c ; supposing a = 1 , then b = 2 and c = 3 .
therefore for a , b , c , three <name> are wanted which shall be to one another as <unk> , " would you not flutter down into it , oh magpie , as <unk> as a dove ?
simple <name> is anything but simple to me .
after ascertaining that the 3 ages at first are as <unk> , she says " then , as two-thirds of their sum , added to one of them , = 21 , the sum can not exceed 30 , and consequently the highest can not exceed 15 . "
i suppose her ( mental ) argument is something like this :  " two-thirds of sum , + one age , = 21 ; [ ** therefore ] sum , + 3 halves of one age , = 31 and a half .
but 3 halves of one age can not be less than 1 <unk> ( here i perceive that simple <name> would on no account present a guinea to a new-born baby ! )
hence the sum can not exceed 30 . "
this is ingenious , but her proof , after that , is ( as she candidly admits ) " clumsy and roundabout . "
she finds that there are 5 possible sets of ages , and <unk> four of them .
suppose that , instead of 5 , there had been 5 million possible sets ?
would simple <name> have <unk> ordered in the necessary gallon of ink and <unk> of paper ?
the solution sent in by c. r. is , like that of simple <name> , partly tentative , and so does not rise higher than being clumsily right .
among those who have earned the highest honours , algernon bray <unk> the problem quite correctly , but adds that there is nothing to exclude the supposition that all the ages were <unk> .
this would make the number of answers infinite .
let me meekly protest that i never intended my readers to devote the rest of their lives to writing out answers !
e. m. <unk> points out that , if <unk> ages be admissible , any one of the three sons might be the one " come of age " ; but she rightly rejects this supposition on the ground that it would make the problem indeterminate .
white sugar is the only one who has detected an oversight of mine : i had forgotten the possibility ( which of course ought to be allowed for ) that the son , who came of age that year , need not have done so by that day , so that he might be only 20 .
this gives a second solution , viz. , 20 , 24 , 28 .

algernon bray states , as a parallel case , " suppose <name> 's father gives him 4 apples , and he eats one of them , how many has he left ? "
and says " i think we are justified in answering , 3 . "
i think so too .
there is no " must " here , and the data are evidently meant to fix the answer exactly : but , if the question were set me " how many must he have left ?
" , i should understand the data to be that his father gave him 4 at least , but may have given him more .
i take this opportunity of thanking those who have sent , along with their answers to the tenth knot , regrets that there are no more knots to come , or petitions that i should recall my resolution to bring them to an end .

<name> 's adventures in wonderland <name> <name> the <unk> <unk> edition <unk> chapter i .
down the <unk> <name> was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank , and of having nothing to do : once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading , but it had no pictures or conversations in it , 'and what is the use of a book , ' thought <name> <unk> pictures or conversation ? '
so she was considering in her own mind ( as well as she could , for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid ) , whether the pleasure of making a <unk> would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the <unk> , when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her .
there was nothing so very remarkable in that ; nor did <name> think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself , 'oh dear !
oh dear !
i shall be late ! '
( when she thought it over afterwards , it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this , but at the time it all seemed quite natural ) ; but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its <unk> , and looked at it , and then hurried on , <name> started to her feet , for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a <unk> , or a watch to take out of it , and burning with curiosity , she ran across the field after it , and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large <unk> under the hedge .
in another moment down went <name> after it , never once considering how in the world she was to get out again .
the <unk> went straight on like a tunnel for some way , and then dipped suddenly down , so suddenly that <name> had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well .
either the well was very deep , or she fell very slowly , for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next .
first , she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to , but it was too dark to see anything ; then she looked at the sides of the well , and noticed that they were filled with <unk> and <unk> ; here and there she saw maps and pictures <name> upon pegs .
she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed ; it was labelled <unk> <unk> ' , but to her great disappointment it was empty : she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody , so managed to put it into one of the <unk> as she fell past it .
'well ! '
thought <name> to herself , 'after such a fall as this , i shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs !
how brave they 'll all think me at home !
why , i would n't say anything about it , even if i fell off the top of the house ! '
( which was very likely true . )
down , down , down .
would the fall never come to an end !
'i wonder how many miles i 've fallen by this time ? '
she said aloud .
'i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth .
let me see : that would be four thousand miles down , i think  ' ( for , you see , <name> had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom , and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge , as there was no one to listen to her , still it was good practice to say it over ) '  yes , that 's about the right distance  but then i wonder what latitude or longitude i 've got to ? '
( <name> had no idea what latitude was , or longitude either , but thought they were nice grand words to say . )
presently she began again .
'i wonder if i shall fall right through the earth !
how funny it 'll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward !
the <unk> , i think  ' ( she was rather glad there was no one listening , this time , as it did n't sound at all the right word ) '  but i shall have to ask them what the name of the country is , you know .
please , ma'am , is this new zealand or australia ? '
( and she tried to curtsey as she spoke  fancy <unk> as you 're falling through the air !
do you think you could manage it ? )
'and what an ignorant little girl she 'll think me for asking !
no , it 'll never do to ask : perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere . '
down , down , down .
there was nothing else to do , so <name> soon began talking again .
<unk> 'll miss me very much to-night , i should think ! '
( <name> was the cat . )
'i <name> they 'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time .
<name> my dear !
i wish you were down here with me !
there are no mice in the air , i 'm afraid , but you might catch a bat , and that 's very like a mouse , you know .
but do cats eat bats , i wonder ? '
and here <name> began to get rather sleepy , and went on saying to herself , in a dreamy sort of way , 'do cats eat bats ?
do cats eat bats ? '
and sometimes , 'do bats eat cats ? '
for , you see , as she could n't answer either question , it did n't much matter which way she put it .
she felt that she was dozing off , and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with <name> , and saying to her very earnestly , 'now , <name> , tell me the truth : did you ever eat a bat ? '
when suddenly , thump !
thump !
down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves , and the fall was over .
<name> was not a bit hurt , and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment : she looked up , but it was all dark overhead ; before her was another long passage , and the white rabbit was still in sight , hurrying down it .
there was not a moment to be lost : away went <name> like the wind , and was just in time to hear it say , as it turned a corner , 'oh my ears and whiskers , how late it 's getting ! '
she was close behind it when she turned the corner , but the rabbit was no longer to be seen : she found herself in a long , low hall , which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof .
there were doors all round the hall , but they were all locked ; and when <name> had been all the way down one side and up the other , trying every door , she walked sadly down the middle , wondering how she was ever to get out again .
suddenly she came upon a little <unk> table , all made of solid glass ; there was nothing on it except a <name> golden key , and <unk> first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall ; but , alas !
either the locks were too large , or the key was too small , but at any rate it would not open any of them .
however , on the second time round , she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before , and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high : she tried the little golden key in the lock , and to her great delight it fitted !
<name> opened the door and found that it led into a small passage , not much larger than a <unk> : she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw .
how she longed to get out of that dark hall , and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains , but she could not even get her head through the doorway ; 'and even if my head would go through , ' thought poor <name> , 'it would be of very little use without my shoulders .
oh , how i wish i could shut up like a telescope !
i think i could , if i only know how to begin . '
for , you see , so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately , that <name> had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible .
there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door , so she went back to the table , half hoping she might find another key on it , or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes : this time she found a little bottle on it , ( 'which certainly was not here before , ' said <name> , ) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label , with the words <unk> me ' beautifully printed on it in large letters .
it was all very well to say <unk> me , ' but the wise little <name> was not going to do that in a hurry .
'no , i 'll look first , ' she said , 'and see whether it 's marked " poison " or not ' ; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt , and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things , all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them : such as , that a red-hot poker <name> burn you if you hold it too long ; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife , it usually <unk> ; and she had never forgotten that , if you drink much from a bottle marked <unk> , ' it is almost certain to disagree with you , sooner or later .
however , this bottle was not marked <unk> , ' so <name> ventured to taste it , and finding it very nice , ( it had , in fact , a sort of mixed flavour of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , roast turkey , <unk> , and hot buttered toast , ) she very soon finished it off .
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 'what a curious feeling ! '
said <name> ; 'i must be shutting up like a telescope . '
and so it was indeed : she was now only ten inches high , and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden .
first , however , she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further : she felt a little nervous about this ; 'for it might end , you know , ' said <name> to herself , 'in my going out altogether , like a candle .
i wonder what i should be like then ? '
and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out , for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing .
after a while , finding that nothing more happened , she decided on going into the garden at once ; but , alas for poor <name> !
when she got to the door , she found she had forgotten the little golden key , and when she went back to the table for it , she found she could not possibly reach it : she could see it quite plainly through the glass , and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table , but it was too slippery ; and when she had tired herself out with trying , the poor little thing sat down and cried .
'come , there 's no use in crying like that ! '
said <name> to herself , rather sharply ; 'i advise you to leave off this minute ! '
she generally gave herself very good advice , ( though she very seldom followed it ) , and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes ; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself , for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people .
'but it 's no use now , ' thought poor <name> , 'to pretend to be two people !
why , there 's hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person ! '
soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table : she opened it , and found in it a very small cake , on which the words <unk> me ' were beautifully marked in <unk> .
'well , i 'll eat it , ' said <name> , 'and if it makes me grow larger , i can reach the key ; and if it makes me grow smaller , i can creep under the door ; so either way i'll get into the garden , and i do n't care which happens ! '
she ate a little bit , and said anxiously to herself , 'which way ?
which way ?
' , holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing , and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size : to be sure , this generally happens when one eats cake , but <name> had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen , that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way .
so she set to work , and very soon finished off the cake .
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * chapter ii .
the pool of tears <unk> and <unk> ! '
cried <name> ( she was so much surprised , that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good english ) ; 'now i'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was !
good-bye , feet ! '
( for when she looked down at her feet , they seemed to be almost out of sight , they were getting so far off ) .
'oh , my poor little feet , i wonder who <name> put on your shoes and stockings for you now , dears ?
i 'm sure i <name> n't be able !
i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you : you must manage the best way you can ;  but i must be kind to them , ' thought <name> , 'or perhaps they wo n't walk the way i want to go !
let me see : i 'll give them a new pair of boots every christmas . '
and she went on planning to herself how she would manage it .
'they must go by the carrier , ' she thought ; 'and how funny it 'll seem , sending presents to one 's own feet !
and how odd the directions <name> look !
<name> 's right foot , esq .
<unk> , near the fender , ( with <name> 's love ) .
oh dear , what nonsense i 'm talking ! '
just then her head struck against the roof of the hall : in fact she was now more than nine feet high , and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door .
poor <name> !
it was as much as she could do , lying down on one side , to look through into the garden with one eye ; but to get through was more hopeless than ever : she sat down and began to cry again .
'you ought to be ashamed of yourself , ' said <name> , 'a great girl like you , ' ( she might well say this ) , 'to go on crying in this way !
stop this moment , i tell you ! '
but she went on all the same , shedding gallons of tears , until there was a large pool all round her , about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall .
after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance , and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming .
it was the white rabbit returning , splendidly dressed , with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other : he came trotting along in a great hurry , muttering to himself as he came , 'oh !
the duchess , the duchess !
oh !
wo n't she be savage if i 've kept her waiting ! '
<name> felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one ; so , when the rabbit came near her , she began , in a low , timid voice , 'if you please , sir  ' the rabbit started violently , dropped the white kid gloves and the fan , and <unk> away into the darkness as hard as he could go .
<name> took up the fan and gloves , and , as the hall was very hot , she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking : 'dear , dear !
how queer everything is to-day !
and yesterday things went on just as usual .
i wonder if i 've been changed in the night ?
let me think : was i the same when i got up this morning ?
i almost think i can remember feeling a little different .
but if i 'm not the same , the next question is , who in the world am i ?
ah , that 's the great puzzle ! '
and she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself , to see if she could have been changed for any of them .
'i 'm sure i 'm not <name> , ' she said , 'for her hair goes in such long ringlets , and mine does n't go in ringlets at all ; and i 'm sure i can't be <name> , for i know all sorts of things , and she , oh !
she knows such a very little !
besides , she 's she , and i 'm i , and  oh dear , how puzzling it all is !
i 'll try if i know all the things i used to know .
let me see : four times five is twelve , and four times six is thirteen , and four times seven is  oh dear !
i shall never get to twenty at that rate !
however , the multiplication table does n't signify : let 's try geography .
london is the capital of <name> , and <name> is the capital of rome , and rome  no , that 's all wrong , i 'm certain !
i must have been changed for <name> !
i 'll try and say " how doth the little  " ' and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons , and began to repeat it , but her voice sounded hoarse and strange , and the words did not come the same as they used to do :  'how doth the little crocodile improve his shining tail , and pour the waters of the nile on every golden scale !
'how cheerfully he seems to grin , how neatly spread his claws , and welcome little fishes in with gently smiling jaws ! '
'i 'm sure those are not the right words , ' said poor <name> , and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on , 'i must be <name> after all , and i shall have to go and live in that <unk> little house , and have next to no toys to play with , and oh !
ever so many lessons to learn !
no , i've made up my mind about it ; if i 'm <name> , i 'll stay down here !
it 'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying " come up again , dear ! "
i shall only look up and say " who am i then ?
tell me that first , and then , if i like being that person , i 'll come up : if not , i 'll stay down here till i 'm somebody else "  but , oh dear ! '
cried <name> , with a sudden burst of tears , 'i do wish they would put their heads down !
i am so very tired of being all alone here ! '
as she said this she looked down at her hands , and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbit 's little white kid gloves while she was talking .
'how can i have done that ? '
she thought .
'i must be growing small again . '
she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it , and found that , as nearly as she could guess , she was now about two feet high , and was going on shrinking rapidly : she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding , and she dropped it hastily , just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether .
'that was a narrow escape ! '
said <name> , a good deal frightened at the sudden change , but very glad to find herself still in existence ; 'and now for the garden ! '
and she ran with all speed back to the little door : but , alas !
the little door was shut again , and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before , 'and things are worse than ever , ' thought the poor child , 'for i never was so small as this before , never !
and i declare it 's too bad , that it is ! '
as she said these words her foot slipped , and in another moment , splash !
she was up to her <name> in salt water .
her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea , 'and in that case i can go back by railway , ' she said to herself .
( <name> had been to the seaside once in her life , and had come to the general conclusion , that wherever you go to on the english coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea , some children digging in the sand with wooden spades , then a row of lodging houses , and behind them a railway station . )
however , she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high .
'i wish i had n't cried so much ! '
said <name> , as she swam about , trying to find her way out .
'i shall be punished for it now , i suppose , by being drowned in my own tears !
that <name> be a queer thing , to be sure !
however , everything is queer to-day . '
just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off , and she swam nearer to make out what it was : at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus , but then she remembered how small she was now , and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself .
'would it be of any use , now , ' thought <name> , 'to speak to this mouse ?
everything is so out-of-the-way down here , that i should think very likely it can talk : at any rate , there 's no harm in trying . '
so she began : 'o mouse , do you know the way out of this pool ?
i am very tired of swimming about here , o mouse ! '
( <name> thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse : she had never done such a thing before , but she remembered having seen in her brother 's latin grammar , 'a mouse  of a mouse  to a mouse  a mouse  o mouse ! ' )
the mouse looked at her rather <unk> , and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes , but it said nothing .
'perhaps it does n't understand english , ' thought <name> ; 'i daresay it's a french mouse , come over with <name> the conqueror . '
( for , with all her knowledge of history , <name> had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened . )
so she began again : <unk> est <name> <unk> ? '
which was the first sentence in her french <unk> .
the mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water , and seemed to quiver all over with fright .
'oh , i beg your pardon ! '
cried <name> hastily , afraid that she had hurt the poor animal 's feelings .
'i quite forgot you did n't like cats . '
'not like cats ! '
cried the mouse , in a shrill , passionate voice .
'would you like cats if you were me ? '
'well , perhaps not , ' said <name> in a soothing tone : 'do n't be angry about it .
and yet i wish i could show you our cat <name> : i think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her .
she is such a dear quiet thing , ' <name> went on , half to herself , as she swam lazily about in the pool , 'and she sits purring so nicely by the fire , licking her paws and washing her face  and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse  and she's such a capital one for catching mice  oh , i beg your pardon ! '
cried <name> again , for this time the mouse was bristling all over , and she felt certain it must be really offended .
'we wo n't talk about her any more if you 'd rather not . '
'we indeed ! '
cried the mouse , who was trembling down to the end of his tail .
'as if i would talk on such a subject !
our family always hated cats : nasty , low , vulgar things !
do n't let me hear the name again ! '
'i wo n't indeed ! '
said <name> , in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation .
'are you  are you fond  of  of dogs ? '
the mouse did not answer , so <name> went on eagerly : 'there is such a nice little dog near our house i should like to show you !
a little <unk> terrier , you know , with oh , such long curly brown hair !
and it 'll fetch things when you throw them , and it 'll sit up and beg for its dinner , and all sorts of things  i ca n't remember half of them  and it belongs to a farmer , you know , and he says it 's so useful , it 's worth a hundred pounds !
he says it kills all the rats and  oh dear ! '
cried <name> in a sorrowful tone , 'i 'm afraid i 've offended it again ! '
for the mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go , and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went .
so she called softly after it , <unk> dear !
do come back again , and we wo n't talk about cats or dogs either , if you do n't like them ! '
when the mouse heard this , it turned round and swam slowly back to her : its face was quite pale ( with passion , <name> thought ) , and it said in a low trembling voice , 'let us get to the shore , and then i 'll tell you my history , and you 'll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs . '
it was high time to go , for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it : there were a duck and a dodo , a <name> and an eaglet , and several other curious creatures .
<name> led the way , and the whole party swam to the shore .
chapter iii .
a <unk> and a long tale they were indeed a <unk> party that assembled on the bank  the birds with draggled feathers , the animals with their fur clinging close to them , and all dripping wet , cross , and uncomfortable .
the first question of course was , how to get dry again : they had a consultation about this , and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to <name> to find herself talking familiarly with them , as if she had known them all her life .
indeed , she had quite a long argument with the <name> , who at last turned sulky , and would only say , 'i am older than you , and must know better ' ; and this <name> would not allow without knowing how old it was , and , as the <name> positively refused to tell its age , there was no more to be said .
at last the mouse , who seemed to be a person of authority among them , called out , 'sit down , all of you , and listen to me !
i 'll soon make you dry enough ! '
they all sat down at once , in a large ring , with the mouse in the middle .
<name> kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it , for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon .
<unk> ! '
said the mouse with an important air , 'are you all ready ?
this is the driest thing i know .
silence all round , if you please !
" <name> the conqueror , whose cause was favoured by the pope , was soon submitted to by the english , who wanted leaders , and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest .
<name> and <unk> , the earls of <unk> and <unk>  " ' <unk> ! '
said the <name> , with a shiver .
'i beg your pardon ! '
said the mouse , frowning , but very politely : 'did you speak ? '
'not i ! '
said the <name> hastily .
'i thought you did , ' said the <unk> '
 i proceed .
" <name> and <unk> , the earls of <unk> and <unk> , declared for him : and even <unk> , the patriotic archbishop of canterbury , found it advisable  " ' <unk> what ? '
said the duck .
<unk> it , ' the mouse replied rather <unk> : 'of course you know what " it " means . '
'i know what " it " means well enough , when i find a thing , ' said the duck : 'it 's generally a frog or a worm .
the question is , what did the archbishop find ? '
the mouse did not notice this question , but hurriedly went on , ' "  found it advisable to go with <name> <unk> to meet <name> and offer him the crown .
<name> 's conduct at first was moderate .
but the insolence of his normans  " how are you getting on now , my dear ? '
it continued , turning to <name> as it spoke .
'as wet as ever , ' said <name> in a melancholy tone : 'it does n't seem to dry me at all . '
'in that case , ' said the dodo solemnly , rising to its feet , 'i move that the meeting adjourn , for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies  ' 'speak english ! '
said the eaglet .
'i do n't know the meaning of half those long words , and , what 's more , i do n't believe you do either ! '
and the eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile : some of the other birds <unk> audibly .
'what i was going to say , ' said the dodo in an offended tone , 'was , that the best thing to get us dry would be a <unk> . '
'what is a <unk> ? '
said <name> ; not that she wanted much to know , but the dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak , and no one else seemed inclined to say anything .
'why , ' said the dodo , 'the best way to explain it is to do it . '
( and , as you might like to try the thing yourself , some <name> day , i <name> tell you how the dodo managed it . )
first it marked out a <unk> , in a sort of circle , ( 'the exact shape does n't matter , ' it said , ) and then all the party were placed along the course , here and there .
there was no 'one , two , three , and away , ' but they began running when they liked , and left off when they liked , so that it was not easy to know when the race was over .
however , when they had been running half an hour or so , and were quite dry again , the dodo suddenly called out 'the race is over ! '
and they all crowded round it , panting , and asking , 'but who has won ? '
this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought , and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead ( the position in which you usually see shakespeare , in the pictures of him ) , while the rest waited in silence .
at last the dodo said , <unk> has won , and all must have prizes . '
'but who is to give the prizes ? '
quite a chorus of voices asked .
'why , she , of course , ' said the dodo , pointing to <name> with one finger ; and the whole party at once crowded round her , calling out in a confused way , <unk> !
prizes ! '
<name> had no idea what to do , and in despair she put her hand in her pocket , and pulled out a box of <unk> , ( luckily the salt water had not got into it ) , and handed them round as prizes .
there was exactly one <unk> all round .
'but she must have a prize herself , you know , ' said the mouse .
'of course , ' the dodo replied very gravely .
'what else have you got in your pocket ? '
he went on , turning to <name> .
'only a thimble , ' said <name> sadly .
<unk> it over here , ' said the dodo .
then they all crowded round her once more , while the dodo solemnly presented the thimble , saying 'we beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble ' ; and , when it had finished this short speech , they all cheered .
<name> thought the whole thing very absurd , but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh ; and , as she could not think of anything to say , she simply bowed , and took the thimble , looking as solemn as she could .
the next thing was to eat the <unk> : this caused some noise and confusion , as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs , and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back .
however , it was over at last , and they sat down again in a ring , and begged the mouse to tell them something more .
'you promised to tell me your history , you know , ' said <name> , 'and why it is you hate  c and d , ' she added in a whisper , half afraid that it would be offended again .
<unk> is a long and a sad tale ! '
said the mouse , turning to <name> , and sighing .
'it is a long tail , certainly , ' said <name> , looking down with wonder at the mouse 's tail ; 'but why do you call it sad ? '
and she kept on puzzling about it while the mouse was speaking , so that her idea of the tale was something like this :  <unk> said to a mouse , that he met in the house , " let us both go to law : i <name> prosecute <unk>  come , i 'll take no denial ; we must have a trial : for really this morning i've nothing to do . "
said the mouse to the cur , " such a trial , dear sir , with no jury or judge , would be wasting our breath . "
" i 'll be judge , i'll be jury , " said cunning old fury : " i'll try the whole cause , and condemn you to death . " '
'you are not attending ! '
said the mouse to <name> severely .
'what are you thinking of ? '
'i beg your pardon , ' said <name> very humbly : 'you had got to the fifth bend , i think ? '
'i had not ! '
cried the mouse , sharply and very angrily .
'a knot ! '
said <name> , always ready to make herself useful , and looking anxiously about her .
'oh , do let me help to undo it ! '
'i shall do nothing of the sort , ' said the mouse , getting up and walking away .
'you insult me by talking such nonsense ! '
'i did n't mean it ! '
pleaded poor <name> .
'but you 're so easily offended , you know ! '
the mouse only growled in reply .
'please come back and finish your story ! '
<name> called after it ; and the others all joined in chorus , 'yes , please do ! '
but the mouse only shook its head impatiently , and walked a little quicker .
'what a pity it would n't stay ! '
sighed the <name> , as soon as it was quite out of sight ; and an old crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter 'ah , my dear !
let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper ! '
'hold your tongue , <name> ! '
said the young crab , a little <unk> .
'you 're enough to try the <name> of an oyster ! '
'i wish i had our <name> here , i know i do ! '
said <name> aloud , addressing nobody in particular .
'she 'd soon fetch it back ! '
'and who is <name> , if i might venture to ask the question ? '
said the <name> .
<name> replied eagerly , for she was always ready to talk about her pet : <unk> 's our cat .
and she 's such a capital one for catching mice you ca n't think !
and oh , i wish you could see her after the birds !
why , she 'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it ! '
this speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party .
some of the birds hurried off at once : one old magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully , remarking , 'i really must be getting home ; the <unk> does n't suit my throat ! '
and a canary called out in a trembling voice to its children , 'come away , my dears !
it 's high time you were all in bed ! '
on various pretexts they all moved off , and <name> was soon left alone .
'i wish i had n't mentioned <name> ! '
she said to herself in a melancholy tone .
<unk> seems to like her , down here , and i 'm sure she 's the best cat in the world !
oh , my dear <name> !
i wonder if i shall ever see you any more ! '
and here poor <name> began to cry again , for she felt very lonely and low-spirited .
in a little while , however , she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance , and she looked up eagerly , half hoping that the mouse had changed his mind , and was coming back to finish his story .
chapter iv .
the rabbit sends in a little <name> it was the white rabbit , trotting slowly back again , and looking anxiously about as it went , as if it had lost something ; and she heard it muttering to itself 'the duchess !
the duchess !
oh my dear paws !
oh my fur and whiskers !
she 'll get me executed , as sure as <unk> are <unk> !
where can i have dropped them , i wonder ? '
<name> guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves , and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them , but they were nowhere to be seen  everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool , and the great hall , with the glass table and the little door , had vanished completely .
very soon the rabbit noticed <name> , as she went hunting about , and called out to her in an angry tone , 'why , <name> <name> , what are you doing out here ?
run home this moment , and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan !
quick , now ! '
and <name> was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to , without trying to explain the mistake it had made .
'he took me for his housemaid , ' she said to herself as she ran .
'how surprised he 'll be when he finds out who i am !
but i 'd better take him his fan and gloves  that is , if i can find them . '
as she said this , she came upon a neat little house , on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name <unk> .
rabbit ' engraved upon it .
she went in without knocking , and hurried upstairs , in great fear lest she should meet the real <name> <name> , and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves .
'how queer it seems , ' <name> said to herself , 'to be going messages for a rabbit !
i suppose <name> 'll be sending me on messages next ! '
and she began <unk> the sort of thing that would happen : ' " miss <name> !
come here directly , and get ready for your walk ! "
" coming in a minute , nurse !
but i 've got to see that the mouse does n't get out . "
only i don't think , ' <name> went on , 'that they 'd let <name> stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that ! '
by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window , and on it ( as she had hoped ) a fan and two or three pairs of <name> white kid gloves : she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves , and was just going to leave the room , when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass .
there was no label this time with the words <unk> me , ' but nevertheless she <unk> it and put it to her lips .
'i know something interesting is sure to happen , ' she said to herself , <unk> i eat or drink anything ; so i 'll just see what this bottle does .
i do <name> it 'll make me grow large again , for really i 'm quite tired of being such a <name> little thing ! '
it did so indeed , and much sooner than she had expected : before she had drunk half the bottle , she found her head pressing against the ceiling , and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken .
she hastily put down the bottle , saying to herself 'that 's quite enough  i <name> i <unk> grow any more  as it is , i ca n't get out at the door  i do wish i hadn't drunk quite so much ! '
alas !
it was too late to wish that !
she went on growing , and growing , and very soon had to kneel down on the floor : in another minute there was not even room for this , and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door , and the other arm curled round her head .
still she went on growing , and , as a last resource , she put one arm out of the window , and one foot up the chimney , and said to herself 'now i can do no more , whatever happens .
what <name> become of me ? '
luckily for <name> , the little magic bottle had now had its full effect , and she grew no larger : still it was very uncomfortable , and , as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again , no wonder she felt unhappy .
'it was much pleasanter at home , ' thought poor <name> , 'when one wasn't always growing larger and smaller , and being ordered about by mice and rabbits .
i almost wish i had n't gone down that <unk>  and yet  and yet  it 's rather curious , you know , this sort of life !
i do wonder what can have happened to me !
when i used to read <unk> , i fancied that kind of thing never happened , and now here i am in the middle of one !
there ought to be a book written about me , that there ought !
and when i grow up , i 'll write one  but i 'm grown up now , ' she added in a sorrowful tone ; 'at least there 's no room to grow up any more here . '
'but then , ' thought <name> , 'shall i never get any older than i am now ?
that 'll be a comfort , one way  never to be an old woman  but then  always to have lessons to learn !
oh , i should n't like that ! '
'oh , you foolish <name> ! '
she answered herself .
'how can you learn lessons in here ?
why , there 's hardly room for you , and no room at all for any <unk> ! '
and so she went on , taking first one side and then the other , and making quite a conversation of it altogether ; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside , and stopped to listen .
<unk> <name> !
<name> <name> ! '
said the voice .
<unk> me my gloves this moment ! '
then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs .
<name> knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her , and she trembled till she shook the house , quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit , and had no reason to be afraid of it .
presently the rabbit came up to the door , and tried to open it ; but , as the door opened inwards , and <name> 's elbow was pressed hard against it , that attempt proved a failure .
<name> heard it say to itself 'then i'll go round and get in at the window . '
'that you wo n't ' thought <name> , and , after waiting till she fancied she heard the rabbit just under the window , she suddenly spread out her hand , and made a snatch in the air .
she did not get hold of anything , but she heard a little shriek and a fall , and a crash of broken glass , from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a <unk> , or something of the sort .
next came an angry voice  the rabbit 's  <unk> !
<name> !
where are you ? '
and then a voice she had never heard before , 'sure then i 'm here !
digging for apples , <name> honour ! '
<unk> for apples , indeed ! '
said the rabbit angrily .
'here !
come and help me out of this ! '
( sounds of more broken glass . )
'now tell me , <name> , what 's that in the window ? '
'sure , it 's an arm , <name> honour ! '
( he pronounced it <unk> . ' )
'an arm , you goose !
who ever saw one that size ?
why , it fills the whole window ! '
'sure , it does , <name> honour : but it 's an arm for all that . '
'well , it 's got no business there , at any rate : go and take it away ! '
there was a long silence after this , and <name> could only hear whispers now and then ; such as , 'sure , i do n't like it , <name> honour , at all , at all ! '
'do as i tell you , you coward ! '
and at last she spread out her hand again , and made another snatch in the air .
this time there were two little shrieks , and more sounds of broken glass .
'what a number of <unk> there must be ! '
thought <name> .
'i wonder what they 'll do next !
as for pulling me out of the window , i only wish they could !
i'm sure i do n't want to stay in here any longer ! '
she waited for some time without hearing anything more : at last came a rumbling of little <unk> , and the sound of a good many voices all talking together : she made out the words : 'where 's the other ladder ?  why , i had n't to bring but one ; <name> 's got the other  <name> !
fetch it here , lad !  here , put 'em up at this corner  no , tie 'em together first  they do n't reach half high enough yet  oh !
they'll do well enough ; do n't be particular  here , <name> !
catch hold of this rope  <name> the roof bear ?  mind that loose slate  oh , it 's coming down !
heads below ! '
( a loud crash )  'now , who did that ?  it was <name> , i fancy  who 's to go down the chimney ?  nay , i <name> n't !
you do it !  that i wo n't , then !  <name> 's to go down  here , <name> !
the master says you 're to go down the chimney ! '
'oh !
so <name> 's got to come down the chimney , has he ? '
said <name> to herself .
<unk> , they seem to put everything upon <name> !
i would n't be in <name> 's place for a good deal : this fireplace is narrow , to be sure ; but i think i can kick a little ! '
she <name> her foot as far down the chimney as she could , and waited till she heard a little animal ( she could n't guess of what sort it was ) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her : then , saying to herself 'this is <name> , ' she gave one sharp kick , and waited to see what would happen next .
the first thing she heard was a general chorus of 'there goes <name> ! '
then the rabbit 's voice along  <unk> him , you by the hedge ! '
then silence , and then another confusion of voices  'hold up his head  <name> now  do n't choke him  how was it , old fellow ?
what happened to you ?
tell us all about it ! '
last came a little feeble , squeaking voice , ( 'that 's <name> , ' thought <name> , ) 'well , i hardly know  no more , thank ye ; i 'm better now  but i'm a deal too <unk> to tell you  all i know is , something comes at me like a <unk> , and up i goes like a <unk> ! '
'so you did , old fellow ! '
said the others .
'we must burn the house down ! '
said the rabbit 's voice ; and <name> called out as loud as she could , 'if you do .
i 'll set <name> at you ! '
there was a dead silence instantly , and <name> thought to herself , 'i wonder what they <name> do next !
if they had any sense , they 'd take the roof off . '
after a minute or two , they began moving about again , and <name> heard the rabbit say , 'a <unk> <name> do , to begin with . '
'a <unk> of what ? '
thought <name> ; but she had not long to doubt , for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window , and some of them hit her in the face .
'i 'll put a stop to this , ' she said to herself , and shouted out , 'you 'd better not do that again ! '
which produced another dead silence .
<name> noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor , and a bright idea came into her head .
'if i eat one of these cakes , ' she thought , 'it 's sure to make some change in my size ; and as it ca n't possibly make me larger , it must make me smaller , i suppose . '
so she swallowed one of the cakes , and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly .
as soon as she was small enough to get through the door , she ran out of the house , and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside .
the poor little lizard , <name> , was in the middle , being held up by two guinea-pigs , who were giving it something out of a bottle .
they all made a rush at <name> the moment she appeared ; but she ran off as hard as she could , and soon found herself safe in a thick wood .
'the first thing i 've got to do , ' said <name> to herself , as she wandered about in the wood , 'is to grow to my right size again ; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden .
i think that <name> be the best plan . '
it sounded an excellent plan , no doubt , and very neatly and simply arranged ; the only difficulty was , that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it ; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees , a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry .
an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes , and feebly stretching out one paw , trying to touch her .
'poor little thing ! '
said <name> , in a coaxing tone , and she tried hard to whistle to it ; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry , in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing .
hardly knowing what she did , she picked up a little bit of stick , and held it out to the puppy ; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once , with a yelp of delight , and rushed at the stick , and made believe to worry it ; then <name> dodged behind a great thistle , to keep herself from being run over ; and the moment she appeared on the other side , the puppy made another rush at the stick , and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it ; then <name> , thinking it was very like having a game of play with a <unk> , and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet , ran round the thistle again ; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick , running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back , and barking hoarsely all the while , till at last it sat down a good way off , panting , with its tongue hanging out of its mouth , and its great eyes half shut .
this seemed to <name> a good opportunity for making her escape ; so she set off at once , and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath , and till the puppy 's bark sounded quite faint in the distance .
'and yet what a dear little puppy it was ! '
said <name> , as she <unk> against a <unk> to rest herself , and fanned herself with one of the leaves : 'i should have liked teaching it tricks very much , if  if i'd only been the right size to do it !
oh dear !
i 'd nearly forgotten that i 've got to grow up again !
let me see  how is it to be managed ?
i suppose i ought to eat or drink something or other ; but the great question is , what ? '
the great question certainly was , what ?
<name> looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass , but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances .
there was a large mushroom growing near her , about the same height as herself ; and when she had looked under it , and on both sides of it , and behind it , it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it .
she stretched herself up on tiptoe , and peeped over the edge of the mushroom , and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar , that was sitting on the top with its arms folded , quietly smoking a long hookah , and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else .
chapter v. advice from a caterpillar the caterpillar and <name> looked at each other for some time in silence : at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth , and addressed her in a languid , sleepy voice .
'who are you ? '
said the caterpillar .
this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation .
<name> replied , rather shyly , 'i  i hardly know , sir , just at present  at least i know who i was when i got up this morning , but i think i must have been changed several times since then . '
'what do you mean by that ? '
said the caterpillar sternly .
<unk> yourself ! '
'i ca n't explain myself , i 'm afraid , sir ' said <name> , 'because i 'm not myself , you see . '
'i do n't see , ' said the caterpillar .
'i 'm afraid i ca n't put it more clearly , ' <name> replied very politely , 'for i ca n't understand it myself to begin with ; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing . '
'it is n't , ' said the caterpillar .
'well , perhaps you have n't found it so yet , ' said <name> ; 'but when you have to turn into a chrysalis  you <name> some day , you know  and then after that into a butterfly , i should think you 'll feel it a little queer , wo n't you ? '
'not a bit , ' said the caterpillar .
'well , perhaps your feelings may be different , ' said <name> ; 'all i know is , it would feel very queer to me . '
'you ! '
said the caterpillar contemptuously .
'who are you ? '
which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation .
<name> felt a little irritated at the caterpillar 's making such very short remarks , and she <name> herself up and said , very gravely , 'i think , you ought to tell me who you are , first . '
'why ? '
said the caterpillar .
here was another puzzling question ; and as <name> could not think of any good reason , and as the caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind , she turned away .
'come back ! '
the caterpillar called after her .
'i 've something important to say ! '
this sounded promising , certainly : <name> turned and came back again .
'keep your temper , ' said the caterpillar .
'is that all ? '
said <name> , swallowing down her anger as well as she could .
'no , ' said the caterpillar .
<name> thought she might as well wait , as she had nothing else to do , and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing .
for some minutes it puffed away without speaking , but at last it unfolded its arms , took the hookah out of its mouth again , and said , 'so you think you 're changed , do you ? '
'i 'm afraid i am , sir , ' said <name> ; 'i ca n't remember things as i used  and i do n't keep the same size for ten minutes together ! '
'ca n't remember what things ? '
said the caterpillar .
'well , i 've tried to say " how doth the little busy <name> , " but it all came different ! '
<name> replied in a very melancholy voice .
<unk> , " you are old , father <name> , " ' said the caterpillar .
<name> folded her hands , and began :  'you are old , father <name> , ' the young man said , 'and your hair has become very white ; and yet you incessantly stand on your head  do you think , at your age , it is right ? '
'in my youth , ' father <name> replied to his son , 'i feared it might injure the <name> ; but , now that i 'm perfectly sure i have none , why , i do it again and again . '
'you are old , ' said the youth , 'as i mentioned before , and have grown most uncommonly fat ; yet you turned a <unk> in at the door  pray , what is the reason of that ? '
'in my youth , ' said the sage , as he shook his grey locks , 'i kept all my limbs very supple by the use of this <unk>  one shilling the box  allow me to sell you a couple ? '
'you are old , ' said the youth , 'and your jaws are too weak for anything <unk> than suet ; yet you finished the goose , with the bones and the beak  pray how did you manage to do it ? '
'in my youth , ' said his father , 'i took to the law , and argued each case with my wife ; and the muscular strength , which it gave to my jaw , has lasted the rest of my life . '
'you are old , ' said the youth , 'one would hardly suppose that your eye was as steady as ever ; yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose  what made you so awfully clever ? '
'i have answered three questions , and that is enough , ' said his father ; 'do n't give yourself airs !
do you think i can listen all day to such stuff ?
be off , or i 'll kick you down stairs ! '
'that is not said right , ' said the caterpillar .
'not quite right , i 'm afraid , ' said <name> , timidly ; 'some of the words have got altered . '
'it is wrong from beginning to end , ' said the caterpillar decidedly , and there was silence for some minutes .
the caterpillar was the first to speak .
'what size do you want to be ? '
it asked .
'oh , i 'm not particular as to size , ' <name> hastily replied ; 'only one does n't like changing so often , you know . '
'i do n't know , ' said the caterpillar .
<name> said nothing : she had never been so much contradicted in her life before , and she felt that she was losing her temper .
'are you content now ? '
said the caterpillar .
'well , i should like to be a little larger , sir , if you would n't mind , ' said <name> : 'three inches is such a wretched height to be . '
'it is a very good height indeed ! '
said the caterpillar angrily , rearing itself upright as it spoke ( it was exactly three inches high ) .
'but i 'm not used to it ! '
pleaded poor <name> in a piteous tone .
and she thought of herself , 'i wish the creatures would n't be so easily offended ! '
'you 'll get used to it in time , ' said the caterpillar ; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again .
this time <name> waited patiently until it chose to speak again .
in a minute or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice , and shook itself .
then it got down off the mushroom , and crawled away in the grass , merely remarking as it went , 'one side <name> make you grow taller , and the other side <name> make you grow shorter . '
'one side of what ?
the other side of what ? '
thought <name> to herself .
'of the mushroom , ' said the caterpillar , just as if she had asked it aloud ; and in another moment it was out of sight .
<name> remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute , trying to make out which were the two sides of it ; and as it was perfectly round , she found this a very difficult question .
however , at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go , and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand .
'and now which is which ? '
she said to herself , and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect : the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her <name> : it had struck her foot !
she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change , but she felt that there was no time to be lost , as she was shrinking rapidly ; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit .
her <name> was pressed so closely against her foot , that there was hardly room to open her mouth ; but she did it at last , and managed to swallow a morsel of the <unk> bit .
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 'come , my head 's free at last ! '
said <name> in a tone of delight , which changed into alarm in another moment , when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found : all she could see , when she looked down , was an immense length of neck , which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her .
'what can all that green stuff be ? '
said <name> .
'and where have my shoulders got to ?
and oh , my poor hands , how is it i ca n't see you ? '
she was moving them about as she spoke , but no result seemed to follow , except a little shaking among the distant green leaves .
as there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head , she tried to get her head down to them , and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction , like a serpent .
she had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag , and was going to dive in among the leaves , which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering , when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry : a large pigeon had flown into her face , and was beating her violently with its wings .
<unk> ! '
screamed the pigeon .
'i 'm not a serpent ! '
said <name> indignantly .
'let me alone ! '
<unk> , i say again ! '
repeated the pigeon , but in a more subdued tone , and added with a kind of sob , 'i 've tried every way , and nothing seems to suit them ! '
'i have n't the least idea what you 're talking about , ' said <name> .
'i 've tried the roots of trees , and i 've tried banks , and i 've tried hedges , ' the pigeon went on , without attending to her ; 'but those serpents !
there 's no pleasing them ! '
<name> was more and more puzzled , but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the pigeon had finished .
'as if it was n't trouble enough hatching the eggs , ' said the pigeon ; 'but i must be on the look-out for serpents night and day !
why , i have n't had a wink of sleep these three weeks ! '
'i 'm very sorry you 've been annoyed , ' said <name> , who was beginning to see its meaning .
'and just as i 'd taken the highest tree in the wood , ' continued the pigeon , raising its voice to a shriek , 'and just as i was thinking i should be free of them at last , they must needs come wriggling down from the sky !
ugh , serpent ! '
'but i 'm not a serpent , i tell you ! '
said <name> .
'i 'm a  i 'm a  ' 'well !
what are you ? '
said the pigeon .
'i can see you 're trying to invent something ! '
'i  i 'm a little girl , ' said <name> , rather doubtfully , as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day .
'a likely story indeed ! '
said the pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt .
'i 've seen a good many little girls in my time , but never one with such a neck as that !
no , no !
you 're a serpent ; and there 's no use denying it .
i suppose you 'll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg ! '
'i have tasted eggs , certainly , ' said <name> , who was a very truthful child ; 'but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do , you know . '
'i do n't believe it , ' said the pigeon ; 'but if they do , why then they're a kind of serpent , that 's all i can say . '
this was such a new idea to <name> , that she was quite silent for a minute or two , which gave the pigeon the opportunity of adding , <unk> looking for eggs , i know that well enough ; and what does it matter to me whether you 're a little girl or a serpent ? '
'it matters a good deal to me , ' said <name> hastily ; 'but i 'm not looking for eggs , as it happens ; and if i was , i should n't want yours : i don't like them raw . '
'well , be off , then ! '
said the pigeon in a sulky tone , as it settled down again into its nest .
<name> crouched down among the trees as well as she could , for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches , and every now and then she had to stop and <unk> it .
after a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands , and she set to work very carefully , nibbling first at one and then at the other , and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter , until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height .
it was so long since she had been anything near the right size , that it felt quite strange at first ; but she got used to it in a few minutes , and began talking to herself , as usual .
'come , there 's half my plan done now !
how puzzling all these changes are !
i 'm never sure what i 'm going to be , from one minute to another !
however , i 've got back to my right size : the next thing is , to get into that beautiful garden  how is that to be done , i wonder ? '
as she said this , she came suddenly upon an open place , with a little house in it about four feet high .
<unk> lives there , ' thought <name> , 'it 'll never do to come upon them this size : why , i should frighten them out of their wits ! '
so she began nibbling at the <unk> bit again , and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high .
chapter <name> .
pig and pepper for a minute or two she stood looking at the house , and wondering what to do next , when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood  ( she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery : otherwise , judging by his face only , she would have called him a fish )  and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles .
it was opened by another footman in livery , with a round face , and large eyes like a frog ; and both footmen , <name> noticed , had powdered hair that curled all over their heads .
she felt very curious to know what it was all about , and crept a little way out of the wood to listen .
the <unk> began by producing from under his arm a great letter , nearly as large as himself , and this he handed over to the other , saying , in a solemn tone , 'for the duchess .
an invitation from the <name> to play croquet . '
the <unk> repeated , in the same solemn tone , only changing the order of the words a little , 'from the <name> .
an invitation for the duchess to play croquet . '
then they both bowed low , and their curls got entangled together .
<name> laughed so much at this , that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her ; and when she next peeped out the <unk> was gone , and the other was sitting on the ground near the door , staring stupidly up into the sky .
<name> went timidly up to the door , and knocked .
'there 's no sort of use in knocking , ' said the footman , 'and that for two reasons .
first , because i 'm on the same side of the door as you are ; secondly , because they 're making such a noise inside , no one could possibly hear you . '
and certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within  a constant howling and sneezing , and every now and then a great crash , as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces .
'please , then , ' said <name> , 'how am i to get in ? '
'there might be some sense in your knocking , ' the footman went on without attending to her , 'if we had the door between us .
for instance , if you were inside , you might knock , and i could let you out , you know . '
he was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking , and this <name> thought decidedly <unk> .
'but perhaps he ca n't help it , ' she said to herself ; 'his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head .
but at any rate he might answer <unk>  how am i to get in ? '
she repeated , aloud .
'i shall sit here , ' the footman remarked , <unk> tomorrow  ' at this moment the door of the house opened , and a large plate came skimming out , straight at the footman 's head : it just grazed his nose , and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him. '
 or next day , maybe , ' the footman continued in the same tone , exactly as if nothing had happened .
'how am i to get in ? '
asked <name> again , in a louder tone .
'are you to get in at all ? '
said the footman .
'that 's the first question , you know . '
it was , no doubt : only <name> did not like to be told so .
'it 's really dreadful , ' she muttered to herself , 'the way all the creatures argue .
it 's enough to drive one crazy ! '
the footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark , with variations .
'i shall sit here , ' he said , 'on and off , for days and days . '
'but what am i to do ? '
said <name> .
<unk> you like , ' said the footman , and began whistling .
'oh , there 's no use in talking to him , ' said <name> desperately : <unk> perfectly idiotic ! '
and she opened the door and went in .
the door led right into a large kitchen , which was full of smoke from one end to the other : the duchess was sitting on a <unk> stool in the middle , nursing a baby ; the cook was leaning over the fire , stirring a large <unk> which seemed to be full of soup .
'there 's certainly too much pepper in that soup ! '
<name> said to herself , as well as she could for sneezing .
there was certainly too much of it in the air .
even the duchess sneezed occasionally ; and as for the baby , it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment 's pause .
the only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze , were the cook , and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear .
'please would you tell me , ' said <name> , a little timidly , for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first , 'why your cat grins like that ? '
'it 's a cheshire cat , ' said the duchess , 'and that 's why .
pig ! '
she said the last word with such sudden violence that <name> quite jumped ; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby , and not to her , so she took courage , and went on again :  'i did n't know that cheshire cats always grinned ; in fact , i did n't know that cats could grin . '
'they all can , ' said the duchess ; 'and most of 'em do . '
'i do n't know of any that do , ' <name> said very politely , feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation .
'you do n't know much , ' said the duchess ; 'and that 's a fact . '
<name> did not at all like the tone of this remark , and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation .
while she was trying to fix on one , the cook took the <unk> of soup off the fire , and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the duchess and the baby  the <unk> came first ; then followed a shower of <unk> , plates , and dishes .
the duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her ; and the baby was howling so much already , that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not .
'oh , please mind what you 're doing ! '
cried <name> , jumping up and down in an agony of terror .
'oh , there goes his precious nose ' ; as an unusually large <unk> flew close by it , and very nearly carried it off .
'if everybody minded their own business , ' the duchess said in a hoarse growl , 'the world would go round a deal faster than it does . '
'which would not be an advantage , ' said <name> , who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge .
'just think of what work it would make with the day and night !
you see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis  ' <unk> of axes , ' said the duchess , <unk> off her head ! '
<name> glanced rather anxiously at the cook , to see if she meant to take the hint ; but the cook was busily stirring the soup , and seemed not to be listening , so she went on again : <unk> hours , i think ; or is it twelve ?
i  ' 'oh , do n't bother me , ' said the duchess ; 'i never could abide figures ! '
and with that she began nursing her child again , singing a sort of <unk> to it as she did so , and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line : 'speak roughly to your little boy , and beat him when he <unk> : he only does it to annoy , because he knows it <unk> . '
chorus .
( in which the cook and the baby joined ) :  <unk> !
wow !
wow ! '
while the duchess sang the second verse of the song , she kept tossing the baby violently up and down , and the poor little thing howled so , that <name> could hardly hear the words :  'i speak severely to my boy , i beat him when he <unk> ; for he can thoroughly enjoy the pepper when he pleases ! '
chorus .
<unk> !
wow !
wow ! '
'here !
you may nurse it a bit , if you like ! '
the duchess said to <name> , flinging the baby at her as she spoke .
'i must go and get ready to play croquet with the <name> , ' and she hurried out of the room .
the cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out , but it just missed her .
<name> caught the baby with some difficulty , as it was a <unk> little creature , and held out its arms and legs in all directions , 'just like a <unk> , ' thought <name> .
the poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it , and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again , so that altogether , for the first minute or two , it was as much as she could do to hold it .
as soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it , ( which was to twist it up into a sort of knot , and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot , so as to prevent its <unk> itself , ) she carried it out into the open air .
'if i do n't take this child away with me , ' thought <name> , 'they 're sure to kill it in a day or two : would n't it be murder to leave it behind ? '
she said the last words out loud , and the little thing grunted in reply ( it had left off sneezing by this time ) .
'do n't grunt , ' said <name> ; 'that 's not at all a proper way of expressing yourself . '
the baby grunted again , and <name> looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it .
there could be no doubt that it had a very <unk> nose , much more like a snout than a real nose ; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby : altogether <name> did not like the look of the thing at all .
'but perhaps it was only sobbing , ' she thought , and looked into its eyes again , to see if there were any tears .
no , there were no tears .
'if you 're going to turn into a pig , my dear , ' said <name> , seriously , 'i 'll have nothing more to do with you .
mind now ! '
the poor little thing sobbed again ( or grunted , it was impossible to say which ) , and they went on for some while in silence .
<name> was just beginning to think to herself , 'now , what am i to do with this creature when i get it home ? '
when it grunted again , so violently , that she looked down into its face in some alarm .
this time there could be no mistake about it : it was neither more nor less than a pig , and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to <name> it further .
so she set the little creature down , and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood .
'if it had grown up , ' she said to herself , 'it would have made a dreadfully ugly child : but it makes rather a handsome pig , i think . '
and she began thinking over other children she knew , who might do very well as pigs , and was just saying to herself , 'if one only knew the right way to change them  ' when she was a little startled by seeing the cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off .
the cat only grinned when it saw <name> .
it looked good-natured , she thought : still it had very long claws and a great many teeth , so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect .
<unk> puss , ' she began , rather timidly , as she did not at all know whether it would like the name : however , it only grinned a little wider .
'come , it 's pleased so far , ' thought <name> , and she went on .
'would you tell me , please , which way i ought to go from here ? '
'that depends a good deal on where you want to get to , ' said the cat .
'i do n't much care where  ' said <name> .
'then it does n't matter which way you go , ' said the <unk> '
 so long as i get somewhere , ' <name> added as an explanation .
'oh , you 're sure to do that , ' said the cat , 'if you only walk long enough . '
<name> felt that this could not be denied , so she tried another question .
'what sort of people live about here ? '
'in that direction , ' the cat said , waving its right paw round , <unk> a hatter : and in that direction , ' waving the other paw , <unk> a march hare .
visit either you like : they 're both mad . '
'but i do n't want to go among mad people , ' <name> remarked .
'oh , you ca n't help that , ' said the cat : 'we 're all mad here .
i 'm mad .
you 're mad . '
'how do you know i 'm mad ? '
said <name> .
'you must be , ' said the cat , 'or you would n't have come here . '
<name> did n't think that proved it at all ; however , she went on 'and how do you know that you 're mad ? '
'to begin with , ' said the cat , 'a dog 's not mad .
you <name> that ? '
'i suppose so , ' said <name> .
'well , then , ' the cat went on , 'you see , a dog growls when it 's angry , and wags its tail when it 's pleased .
now i growl when i 'm pleased , and wag my tail when i 'm angry .
therefore i 'm mad . '
'i call it purring , not growling , ' said <name> .
'call it what you like , ' said the cat .
'do you play croquet with the <name> to-day ? '
'i should like it very much , ' said <name> , 'but i have n't been invited yet . '
'you 'll see me there , ' said the cat , and vanished .
<name> was not much surprised at this , she was getting so used to queer things happening .
while she was looking at the place where it had been , it suddenly appeared again .
<unk> , what became of the baby ? '
said the cat .
'i 'd nearly forgotten to ask . '
'it turned into a pig , ' <name> quietly said , just as if it had come back in a natural way .
'i thought it would , ' said the cat , and vanished again .
<name> waited a little , half expecting to see it again , but it did not appear , and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the march hare was said to live .
'i 've seen <unk> before , ' she said to herself ; 'the march hare <name> be much the most interesting , and perhaps as this is may it wo n't be raving mad  at least not so mad as it was in march . '
as she said this , she looked up , and there was the cat again , sitting on a branch of a tree .
'did you say pig , or fig ? '
said the cat .
'i said pig , ' replied <name> ; 'and i wish you would n't keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly : you make one quite giddy . '
'all right , ' said the cat ; and this time it vanished quite slowly , beginning with the end of the tail , and ending with the grin , which remained some time after the rest of it had gone .
'well !
i 've often seen a cat without a grin , ' thought <name> ; 'but a grin without a cat !
it 's the most curious thing i ever saw in my life ! '
she had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the march hare : she thought it must be the right house , because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur .
it was so large a house , that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the <unk> bit of mushroom , and raised herself to about two feet high : even then she walked up towards it rather timidly , saying to herself <unk> it should be raving mad after all !
i almost wish i 'd gone to see the hatter instead ! '
chapter vii .
a mad <unk> there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house , and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it : a dormouse was sitting between them , fast asleep , and the other two were using it as a cushion , resting their elbows on it , and talking over its head .
'very uncomfortable for the dormouse , ' thought <name> ; 'only , as it 's asleep , i suppose it does n't mind . '
the table was a large one , but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it : 'no room !
no room ! '
they cried out when they saw <name> coming .
'there 's plenty of room ! '
said <name> indignantly , and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table .
'have some wine , ' the march hare said in an encouraging tone .
<name> looked all round the table , but there was nothing on it but tea .
'i do n't see any wine , ' she remarked .
'there is n't any , ' said the march hare .
'then it was n't very civil of you to offer it , ' said <name> angrily .
'it was n't very civil of you to sit down without being invited , ' said the march hare .
'i did n't know it was your table , ' said <name> ; 'it 's laid for a great many more than three . '
'your hair wants cutting , ' said the hatter .
he had been looking at <name> for some time with great curiosity , and this was his first speech .
'you should learn not to make personal remarks , ' <name> said with some severity ; 'it 's very rude . '
the hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this ; but all he said was , 'why is a <name> like a <unk> ? '
'come , we shall have some fun now ! '
thought <name> .
'i 'm glad they've begun asking <unk>  i believe i can guess that , ' she added aloud .
'do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it ? '
said the march hare .
<unk> so , ' said <name> .
'then you should say what you mean , ' the march hare went on .
'i do , ' <name> hastily replied ; 'at least  at least i mean what i say  that 's the same thing , you know . '
'not the same thing a bit ! '
said the hatter .
'you might just as well say that " i see what i eat " is the same thing as " i eat what i see " ! '
'you might just as well say , ' added the march hare , 'that " i like what i get " is the same thing as " i get what i like " ! '
'you might just as well say , ' added the dormouse , who seemed to be talking in his sleep , 'that " i breathe when i sleep " is the same thing as " i sleep when i breathe " ! '
'it is the same thing with you , ' said the hatter , and here the conversation dropped , and the party sat silent for a minute , while <name> thought over all she could remember about ravens and <unk> , which was n't much .
the hatter was the first to break the silence .
'what day of the month is it ? '
he said , turning to <name> : he had taken his watch out of his pocket , and was looking at it uneasily , shaking it every now and then , and holding it to his ear .
<name> considered a little , and then said 'the fourth . '
'two days wrong ! '
sighed the hatter .
'i told you butter would n't suit the works ! '
he added looking angrily at the march hare .
'it was the best butter , ' the march hare meekly replied .
'yes , but some crumbs must have got in as well , ' the hatter grumbled : 'you should n't have put it in with the <unk> . '
the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily : then he dipped it into his cup of tea , and looked at it again : but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark , 'it was the best butter , you know . '
<name> had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity .
'what a funny watch ! '
she remarked .
'it tells the day of the month , and doesn't tell what o'clock it is ! '
'why should it ? '
muttered the hatter .
'does your watch tell you what year it is ? '
'of course not , ' <name> replied very readily : 'but that 's because it stays the same year for such a long time together . '
'which is just the case with mine , ' said the hatter .
<name> felt dreadfully puzzled .
the hatter 's remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it , and yet it was certainly english .
'i do n't quite understand you , ' she said , as politely as she could .
'the dormouse is asleep again , ' said the hatter , and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose .
the dormouse shook its head impatiently , and said , without opening its eyes , 'of course , of course ; just what i was going to remark myself . '
'have you guessed the riddle yet ? '
the hatter said , turning to <name> again .
'no , i give it up , ' <name> replied : 'what 's the answer ? '
'i have n't the slightest idea , ' said the hatter .
<unk> i , ' said the march hare .
<name> sighed wearily .
'i think you might do something better with the time , ' she said , <unk> waste it in asking riddles that have no answers . '
'if you knew time as well as i do , ' said the hatter , 'you would n't talk about wasting it .
it 's him . '
'i do n't know what you mean , ' said <name> .
'of course you do n't ! '
the hatter said , tossing his head contemptuously .
'i dare say you never even spoke to time ! '
'perhaps not , ' <name> cautiously replied : 'but i know i have to beat time when i learn music . '
'ah !
that accounts for it , ' said the hatter .
'he wo n't stand beating .
now , if you only kept on good terms with him , he 'd do almost anything you liked with the clock .
for instance , suppose it were nine o'clock in the morning , just time to begin lessons : you 'd only have to whisper a hint to time , and round goes the clock in a twinkling !
half-past one , time for dinner ! '
( 'i only wish it was , ' the march hare said to itself in a whisper . )
'that would be grand , certainly , ' said <name> thoughtfully : 'but then  i should n't be hungry for it , you know . '
'not at first , perhaps , ' said the hatter : 'but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked . '
'is that the way you manage ? '
<name> asked .
the hatter shook his head mournfully .
'not i ! '
he replied .
'we quarrelled last march  just before he went mad , you know  ' ( pointing with his tea spoon at the march hare , ) '  it was at the great concert given by the <name> of hearts , and i had to sing " twinkle , twinkle , little bat !
how i wonder what you 're at ! "
you know the song , perhaps ? '
'i 've heard something like it , ' said <name> .
'it goes on , you know , ' the hatter continued , 'in this way :  " up above the world you fly , like a <unk> in the sky .
twinkle , twinkle  " ' here the dormouse shook itself , and began singing in its sleep <unk> , twinkle , twinkle , twinkle  ' and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop .
'well , i 'd hardly finished the first verse , ' said the hatter , 'when the <name> jumped up and bawled out , " he 's murdering the time !
off with his head ! " '
'how dreadfully savage ! '
exclaimed <name> .
'and ever since that , ' the hatter went on in a mournful tone , 'he won't do a thing i ask !
it 's always six o'clock now . '
a bright idea came into <name> 's head .
'is that the reason so many <unk> are put out here ? '
she asked .
'yes , that 's it , ' said the hatter with a sigh : 'it 's always tea-time , and we 've no time to wash the things between whiles . '
'then you keep moving round , i suppose ? '
said <name> .
<unk> so , ' said the hatter : 'as the things get used up . '
'but what happens when you come to the beginning again ? '
<name> ventured to ask .
<unk> we change the subject , ' the march hare interrupted , yawning .
'i 'm getting tired of this .
i vote the young <name> tells us a story . '
'i 'm afraid i do n't know one , ' said <name> , rather alarmed at the proposal .
'then the dormouse shall ! '
they both cried .
<unk> up , dormouse ! '
and they pinched it on both sides at once .
the dormouse slowly opened his eyes .
'i was n't asleep , ' he said in a hoarse , feeble voice : 'i heard every word you fellows were saying . '
'tell us a story ! '
said the march hare .
'yes , please do ! '
pleaded <name> .
'and be quick about it , ' added the hatter , 'or you 'll be asleep again before it 's done . '
'once upon a time there were three little sisters , ' the dormouse began in a great hurry ; 'and their names were <name> , <name> , and <name> ; and they lived at the bottom of a well  ' 'what did they live on ? '
said <name> , who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking .
'they lived on <unk> , ' said the dormouse , after thinking a minute or two .
'they could n't have done that , you know , ' <name> gently remarked ; <unk> have been <unk> 'so they were , ' said the dormouse ; 'very <unk> <name> tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like , but it puzzled her too much , so she went on : 'but why did they live at the bottom of a well ? '
'take some more tea , ' the march hare said to <name> , very earnestly .
'i 've had nothing yet , ' <name> replied in an offended tone , 'so i can't take more . '
'you mean you ca n't take less , ' said the hatter : 'it 's very easy to take more than nothing . '
<unk> asked your opinion , ' said <name> .
'who 's making personal remarks now ? '
the hatter asked triumphantly .
<name> did not quite know what to say to this : so she helped herself to some tea and bread-and-butter , and then turned to the dormouse , and repeated her question .
'why did they live at the bottom of a well ? '
the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it , and then said , 'it was a <unk> . '
'there 's no such thing ! '
<name> was beginning very angrily , but the hatter and the march hare went <unk> !
sh ! '
and the dormouse sulkily remarked , 'if you ca n't be civil , you 'd better finish the story for yourself . '
'no , please go on ! '
<name> said very humbly ; 'i wo n't interrupt again .
i dare say there may be one . '
'one , indeed ! '
said the dormouse indignantly .
however , he consented to go on .
'and so these three little sisters  they were learning to draw , you know  ' 'what did they draw ? '
said <name> , quite forgetting her promise .
<unk> , ' said the dormouse , without considering at all this time .
'i want a clean cup , ' interrupted the hatter : 'let 's all move one place on . '
he moved on as he spoke , and the dormouse followed him : the march hare moved into the dormouse 's place , and <name> rather unwillingly took the place of the march hare .
the hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change : and <name> was a good deal worse off than before , as the march hare had just upset the <unk> into his plate .
<name> did not wish to offend the dormouse again , so she began very cautiously : 'but i do n't understand .
where did they draw the <unk> from ? '
'you can draw water out of a <unk> , ' said the hatter ; 'so i should think you could draw <unk> out of a <unk>  eh , stupid ? '
'but they were in the well , ' <name> said to the dormouse , not choosing to notice this last remark .
'of course they were ' , said the dormouse ; '  well in . '
this answer so confused poor <name> , that she let the dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it .
'they were learning to draw , ' the dormouse went on , yawning and rubbing its eyes , for it was getting very sleepy ; 'and they <name> all manner of things  everything that begins with an m  ' 'why with an m ? '
said <name> .
'why not ? '
said the march hare .
<name> was silent .
the dormouse had closed its eyes by this time , and was going off into a doze ; but , on being pinched by the hatter , it woke up again with a little shriek , and went on : '  that begins with an m , such as <unk> , and the moon , and memory , and <unk>  you know you say things are " much of a <unk> "  did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a <unk> ? '
<unk> , now you ask me , ' said <name> , very much confused , 'i don't think  ' 'then you should n't talk , ' said the hatter .
this piece of rudeness was more than <name> could bear : she got up in great disgust , and walked off ; the dormouse fell asleep instantly , and neither of the others took the least notice of her going , though she looked back once or twice , half hoping that they would call after her : the last time she saw them , they were trying to put the dormouse into the <unk> .
'at any rate i 'll never go there again ! '
said <name> as she picked her way through the wood .
'it 's the <unk> <unk> i ever was at in all my life ! '
just as she said this , she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it .
'that 's very curious ! '
she thought .
'but everything 's curious today .
i think i may as well go in at once . '
and in she went .
once more she found herself in the long hall , and close to the little glass table .
'now , i 'll manage better this time , ' she said to herself , and began by taking the little golden key , and <unk> the door that led into the garden .
then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom ( she had kept a piece of it in her pocket ) till she was about a foot high : then she walked down the little passage : and then  she found herself at last in the beautiful garden , among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains .
chapter viii .
the <name> 's <unk> a large <unk> stood near the entrance of the garden : the roses growing on it were white , but there were three gardeners at it , busily painting them red .
<name> thought this a very curious thing , and she went nearer to watch them , and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say , 'look out now , five !
do n't go splashing paint over me like that ! '
'i could n't help it , ' said five , in a sulky tone ; <unk> jogged my elbow . '
on which seven looked up and said , 'that 's right , five !
always lay the blame on others ! '
'you 'd better not talk ! '
said five .
'i heard the <name> say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded ! '
'what for ? '
said the one who had spoken first .
'that 's none of your business , two ! '
said seven .
'yes , it is his business ! '
said five , 'and i 'll tell him  it was for bringing the cook <unk> instead of onions . '
seven flung down his brush , and had just begun 'well , of all the unjust things  ' when his eye chanced to fall upon <name> , as she stood watching them , and he checked himself suddenly : the others looked round also , and all of them bowed low .
'would you tell me , ' said <name> , a little timidly , 'why you are painting those roses ? '
five and seven said nothing , but looked at two .
two began in a low voice , 'why the fact is , you see , miss , this here ought to have been a red <unk> , and we put a white one in by mistake ; and if the <name> was to find it out , we should all have our heads cut off , you know .
so you see , miss , we 're doing our best , afore she comes , to  ' at this moment five , who had been anxiously looking across the garden , called out 'the <name> !
the <name> ! '
and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces .
there was a sound of many footsteps , and <name> looked round , eager to see the <name> .
first came ten soldiers carrying clubs ; these were all shaped like the three gardeners , oblong and flat , with their hands and feet at the corners : next the ten courtiers ; these were ornamented all over with diamonds , and walked two and two , as the soldiers did .
after these came the <name> children ; there were ten of them , and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand , in couples : they were all ornamented with hearts .
next came the guests , mostly kings and queens , and among them <name> recognised the white rabbit : it was talking in a hurried nervous manner , smiling at everything that was said , and went by without noticing her .
then followed the knave of hearts , carrying the king's crown on a crimson <name> cushion ; and , last of all this grand procession , came the king and <name> of hearts .
<name> was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners , but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions ; 'and besides , what would be the use of a procession , ' thought she , 'if people had all to lie down upon their faces , so that they could n't see it ? '
so she stood still where she was , and waited .
when the procession came opposite to <name> , they all stopped and looked at her , and the <name> said severely 'who is this ? '
she said it to the knave of hearts , who only bowed and smiled in reply .
<unk> ! '
said the <name> , tossing her head impatiently ; and , turning to <name> , she went on , 'what 's your name , child ? '
'my name is <name> , so please your majesty , ' said <name> very politely ; but she added , to herself , 'why , they 're only a pack of cards , after all .
i need n't be afraid of them ! '
'and who are these ? '
said the <name> , pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the <unk> ; for , you see , as they were lying on their faces , and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack , she could not tell whether they were gardeners , or soldiers , or courtiers , or three of her own children .
'how should i know ? '
said <name> , surprised at her own courage .
'it 's no business of mine . '
the <name> turned crimson with fury , and , after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast , screamed <unk> with her head !
off  ' <unk> ! '
said <name> , very loudly and decidedly , and the <name> was silent .
the king laid his hand upon her arm , and timidly said <unk> , my dear : she is only a child ! '
the <name> turned angrily away from him , and said to the knave <unk> them over ! '
the knave did so , very carefully , with one foot .
'get up ! '
said the <name> , in a shrill , loud voice , and the three gardeners instantly jumped up , and began bowing to the king , the <name> , the <name> children , and everybody else .
<unk> off that ! '
screamed the <name> .
'you make me giddy . '
and then , turning to the <unk> , she went on , 'what have you been doing here ? '
'may it please your majesty , ' said two , in a very humble tone , going down on one knee as he spoke , 'we were trying  ' 'i see ! '
said the <name> , who had meanwhile been examining the roses .
<unk> with their heads ! '
and the procession moved on , three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners , who ran to <name> for protection .
'you <name> n't be beheaded ! '
said <name> , and she put them into a large flower-pot that stood near .
the three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two , looking for them , and then quietly marched off after the others .
'are their heads off ? '
shouted the <name> .
<unk> heads are gone , if it please your majesty ! '
the soldiers shouted in reply .
'that 's right ! '
shouted the <name> .
'can you play croquet ? '
the soldiers were silent , and looked at <name> , as the question was evidently meant for her .
'yes ! '
shouted <name> .
'come on , then ! '
roared the <name> , and <name> joined the procession , wondering very much what would happen next .
'it 's  it 's a very fine day ! '
said a timid voice at her side .
she was walking by the white rabbit , who was peeping anxiously into her face .
'very , ' said <name> : '  where 's the duchess ? '
<unk> !
hush ! '
said the rabbit in a low , hurried tone .
he looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke , and then raised himself upon tiptoe , put his mouth close to her ear , and whispered 'she 's under sentence of execution . '
'what for ? '
said <name> .
'did you say " what a pity ! " ? '
the rabbit asked .
'no , i did n't , ' said <name> : 'i do n't think it 's at all a pity .
i said " what for ? " '
'she boxed the <name> 's ears  ' the rabbit began .
<name> gave a little scream of laughter .
'oh , hush ! '
the rabbit whispered in a frightened tone .
'the <name> <name> hear you !
you see , she came rather late , and the <name> said  ' 'get to your places ! '
shouted the <name> in a voice of thunder , and people began running about in all directions , tumbling up against each other ; however , they got settled down in a minute or two , and the game began .
<name> thought she had never seen such a curious <unk> in her life ; it was all ridges and furrows ; the balls were live <unk> , the <unk> live <unk> , and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet , to make the arches .
the chief difficulty <name> found at first was in managing her <unk> : she succeeded in getting its body tucked away , comfortably enough , under her arm , with its legs hanging down , but generally , just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out , and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head , it would twist itself round and look up in her face , with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing : and when she had got its head down , and was going to begin again , it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself , and was in the act of crawling away : besides all this , there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to , and , as the <unk> soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground , <name> soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed .
the players all played at once without waiting for turns , quarrelling all the while , and fighting for the <unk> ; and in a very short time the <name> was in a furious passion , and went stamping about , and shouting <unk> with his head ! '
or <unk> with her head ! '
about once in a minute .
<name> began to feel very uneasy : to be sure , she had not as yet had any dispute with the <name> , but she knew that it might happen any minute , 'and then , ' thought she , 'what would become of me ?
they 're dreadfully fond of <unk> people here ; the great wonder is , that there 's any one left alive ! '
she was looking about for some way of escape , and wondering whether she could get away without being seen , when she noticed a curious appearance in the air : it puzzled her very much at first , but , after watching it a minute or two , she made it out to be a grin , and she said to herself 'it 's the cheshire cat : now i shall have somebody to talk to . '
'how are you getting on ? '
said the cat , as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with .
<name> waited till the eyes appeared , and then nodded .
'it 's no use speaking to it , ' she thought , <unk> its ears have come , or at least one of them . '
in another minute the whole head appeared , and then <name> put down her <unk> , and began an account of the game , feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her .
the cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight , and no more of it appeared .
'i do n't think they play at all fairly , ' <name> began , in rather a complaining tone , 'and they all quarrel so dreadfully one ca n't hear oneself speak  and they do n't seem to have any rules in particular ; at least , if there are , nobody attends to them  and you 've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive ; for instance , there 's the arch i 've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground  and i should have <unk> the <name> 's hedgehog just now , only it ran away when it saw mine coming ! '
'how do you like the <name> ? '
said the cat in a low voice .
'not at all , ' said <name> : 'she 's so extremely  ' just then she noticed that the <name> was close behind her , listening : so she went on , '  likely to win , that it 's hardly worth while finishing the game . '
the <name> smiled and passed on .
'who are you talking to ? '
said the king , going up to <name> , and looking at the cat 's head with great curiosity .
'it 's a friend of mine  a cheshire cat , ' said <name> : <unk> me to introduce it . '
'i do n't like the look of it at all , ' said the king : <unk> , it may kiss my hand if it likes . '
'i 'd rather not , ' the cat remarked .
'do n't be impertinent , ' said the king , 'and do n't look at me like that ! '
he got behind <name> as he spoke .
'a cat may look at a king , ' said <name> .
'i 've read that in some book , but i do n't remember where . '
'well , it must be removed , ' said the king very decidedly , and he called the <name> , who was passing at the moment , 'my dear !
i wish you would have this cat removed ! '
the <name> had only one way of settling all difficulties , great or small .
<unk> with his head ! '
she said , without even looking round .
'i 'll fetch the executioner myself , ' said the king eagerly , and he hurried off .
<name> thought she might as well go back , and see how the game was going on , as she heard the <name> 's voice in the distance , screaming with passion .
she had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns , and she did not like the look of things at all , as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not .
so she went in search of her hedgehog .
the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog , which seemed to <name> an excellent opportunity for <unk> one of them with the other : the only difficulty was , that her <unk> was gone across to the other side of the garden , where <name> could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree .
by the time she had caught the <unk> and brought it back , the fight was over , and both the <unk> were out of sight : 'but it doesn't matter much , ' thought <name> , 'as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground . '
so she tucked it away under her arm , that it might not escape again , and went back for a little more conversation with her friend .
when she got back to the cheshire cat , she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it : there was a dispute going on between the executioner , the king , and the <name> , who were all talking at once , while all the rest were quite silent , and looked very uncomfortable .
the moment <name> appeared , she was appealed to by all three to settle the question , and they repeated their arguments to her , though , as they all spoke at once , she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said .
the executioner 's argument was , that you could n't cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from : that he had never had to do such a thing before , and he was n't going to begin at his time of life .
the king 's argument was , that anything that had a head could be beheaded , and that you were n't to talk nonsense .
the <name> 's argument was , that if something was n't done about it in less than no time she 'd have everybody executed , all round .
( it was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious . )
<name> could think of nothing else to say but 'it belongs to the duchess : you 'd better ask her about it . '
'she 's in prison , ' the <name> said to the executioner : <unk> her here . '
and the executioner went off like an arrow .
the cat 's head began fading away the moment he was gone , and , by the time he had come back with the duchess , it had entirely disappeared ; so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it , while the rest of the party went back to the game .
chapter ix .
the mock turtle 's story 'you ca n't think how glad i am to see you again , you dear old thing ! '
said the duchess , as she tucked her arm affectionately into <name> 's , and they walked off together .
<name> was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper , and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen .
'when i 'm a duchess , ' she said to herself , ( not in a very hopeful tone though ) , 'i wo n't have any pepper in my kitchen at all .
soup does very well without  maybe it 's always pepper that makes people <unk> , ' she went on , very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule , 'and vinegar that makes them sour  and <unk> that makes them bitter  and  and <unk> and such things that make children <unk> .
i only wish people knew that : then they would n't be so stingy about it , you know  ' she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time , and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear .
'you 're thinking about something , my dear , and that makes you forget to talk .
i can't tell you just now what the moral of that is , but i shall remember it in a bit . '
'perhaps it has n't one , ' <name> ventured to remark .
<unk> , tut , child ! '
said the duchess .
<unk> 's got a moral , if only you can find it . '
and she squeezed herself up closer to <name> 's side as she spoke .
<name> did not much like keeping so close to her : first , because the duchess was very ugly ; and secondly , because she was exactly the right height to rest her <name> upon <name> 's shoulder , and it was an uncomfortably sharp <name> .
however , she did not like to be rude , so she bore it as well as she could .
'the game 's going on rather better now , ' she said , by way of keeping up the conversation a little .
"tis so , ' said the duchess : 'and the moral of that is  " oh , 't is love , 'tis love , that makes the world go round ! " '
<unk> said , ' <name> whispered , 'that it 's done by everybody minding their own business ! '
'ah , well !
it means much the same thing , ' said the duchess , digging her sharp little <name> into <name> 's shoulder as she added , 'and the moral of that is  " take care of the sense , and the sounds <name> take care of themselves . " '
'how fond she is of finding morals in things ! '
<name> thought to herself .
'i dare say you 're wondering why i do n't put my arm round your waist , ' the duchess said after a pause : 'the reason is , that i 'm doubtful about the temper of your <unk> .
shall i try the experiment ? '
'he might bite , ' <name> cautiously replied , not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried .
'very true , ' said the duchess : <unk> and mustard both bite .
and the moral of that is  " birds of a feather flock together . " '
'only mustard is n't a bird , ' <name> remarked .
<unk> , as usual , ' said the duchess : 'what a clear way you have of putting things ! '
'it 's a mineral , i think , ' said <name> .
'of course it is , ' said the duchess , who seemed ready to agree to everything that <name> said ; 'there 's a large <unk> near here .
and the moral of that is  " the more there is of mine , the less there is of yours . " '
'oh , i know ! '
exclaimed <name> , who had not attended to this last remark , 'it 's a vegetable .
it does n't look like one , but it is . '
'i quite agree with you , ' said the duchess ; 'and the moral of that is  " be what you would seem to be "  or if you 'd like it put more simply  " never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise . " '
'i think i should understand that better , ' <name> said very politely , 'if i had it written down : but i ca n't quite follow it as you say it . '
'that 's nothing to what i could say if i chose , ' the duchess replied , in a pleased tone .
<unk> do n't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that , ' said <name> .
'oh , do n't talk about trouble ! '
said the duchess .
'i make you a present of everything i 've said as yet . '
'a cheap sort of present ! '
thought <name> .
'i 'm glad they do n't give birthday presents like that ! '
but she did not venture to say it out loud .
<unk> again ? '
the duchess asked , with another dig of her sharp little <name> .
'i 've a right to think , ' said <name> sharply , for she was beginning to feel a little worried .
'just about as much right , ' said the duchess , 'as pigs have to fly ; and the m  ' but here , to <name> 's great surprise , the duchess 's voice died away , even in the middle of her favourite word <unk> , ' and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble .
<name> looked up , and there stood the <name> in front of them , with her arms folded , frowning like a thunderstorm .
'a fine day , your majesty ! '
the duchess began in a low , weak voice .
'now , i give you fair warning , ' shouted the <name> , stamping on the ground as she spoke ; <unk> you or your head must be off , and that in about half no time !
take your choice ! '
the duchess took her choice , and was gone in a moment .
'let 's go on with the game , ' the <name> said to <name> ; and <name> was too much frightened to say a word , but slowly followed her back to the <unk> .
the other guests had taken advantage of the <name> 's absence , and were resting in the shade : however , the moment they saw her , they hurried back to the game , the <name> merely remarking that a moment 's delay would cost them their lives .
all the time they were playing the <name> never left off quarrelling with the other players , and shouting <unk> with his head ! '
or <unk> with her head ! '
those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers , who of course had to leave off being arches to do this , so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left , and all the players , except the king , the <name> , and <name> , were in custody and under sentence of execution .
then the <name> left off , quite out of breath , and said to <name> , 'have you seen the mock turtle yet ? '
'no , ' said <name> .
'i do n't even know what a mock turtle is . '
'it 's the thing mock turtle soup is made from , ' said the <name> .
'i never saw one , or heard of one , ' said <name> .
'come on , then , ' said the <name> , 'and he shall tell you his history , ' as they walked off together , <name> heard the king say in a low voice , to the company generally , 'you are all pardoned . '
'come , that 's a good thing ! '
she said to herself , for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the <name> had ordered .
they very soon came upon a gryphon , lying fast asleep in the sun .
( if you do n't know what a gryphon is , look at the picture . )
'up , lazy thing ! '
said the <name> , 'and take this young <name> to see the mock turtle , and to hear his history .
i must go back and see after some executions i have ordered ' ; and she walked off , leaving <name> alone with the gryphon .
<name> did not quite like the look of the creature , but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage <name> : so she waited .
the gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes : then it watched the <name> till she was out of sight : then it chuckled .
'what fun ! '
said the gryphon , half to itself , half to <name> .
'what is the fun ? '
said <name> .
'why , she , ' said the gryphon .
'it 's all her fancy , that : they never <unk> nobody , you know .
come on ! '
<unk> says " come on ! "
here , ' thought <name> , as she went slowly after it : 'i never was so ordered about in all my life , never ! '
they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance , sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock , and , as they came nearer , <name> could hear him sighing as if his heart would break .
she pitied him deeply .
'what is his sorrow ? '
she asked the gryphon , and the gryphon answered , very nearly in the same words as before , 'it 's all his fancy , that : he has n't got no sorrow , you know .
come on ! '
so they went up to the mock turtle , who looked at them with large eyes full of tears , but said nothing .
'this here young <name> , ' said the gryphon , 'she wants for to know your history , she do . '
'i 'll tell it her , ' said the mock turtle in a deep , hollow tone : 'sit down , both of you , and do n't speak a word till i 've finished . '
so they sat down , and nobody spoke for some minutes .
<name> thought to herself , 'i do n't see how he can even finish , if he does n't begin . '
but she waited patiently .
'once , ' said the mock turtle at last , with a deep sigh , 'i was a real turtle . '
these words were followed by a very long silence , broken only by an occasional exclamation of <unk> ! '
from the gryphon , and the constant heavy sobbing of the mock turtle .
<name> was very nearly getting up and saying , 'thank you , sir , for your interesting story , ' but she could not help thinking there must be more to come , so she sat still and said nothing .
'when we were little , ' the mock turtle went on at last , more calmly , though still sobbing a little now and then , 'we went to school in the sea .
the master was an old turtle  we used to call him tortoise  ' 'why did you call him tortoise , if he was n't one ? '
<name> asked .
'we called him tortoise because he taught us , ' said the mock turtle angrily : <unk> you are very dull ! '
'you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question , ' added the gryphon ; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor <name> , who felt ready to sink into the earth .
at last the gryphon said to the mock turtle , <unk> on , old fellow !
do n't be all day about it ! '
and he went on in these words : 'yes , we went to school in the sea , though you may n't believe it  ' 'i never said i did n't ! '
interrupted <name> .
'you did , ' said the mock turtle .
'hold your tongue ! '
added the gryphon , before <name> could speak again .
the mock turtle went on .
'we had the best of <unk>  in fact , we went to school every day  ' 'i 've been to a <unk> , too , ' said <name> ; 'you need n't be so proud as all that . '
'with extras ? '
asked the mock turtle a little anxiously .
'yes , ' said <name> , 'we learned french and music . '
'and washing ? '
said the mock turtle .
'certainly not ! '
said <name> indignantly .
'ah !
then yours was n't a really good school , ' said the mock turtle in a tone of great relief .
'now at ours they had at the end of the <name> , " french , music , and washing  extra . " '
'you could n't have wanted it much , ' said <name> ; <unk> at the bottom of the sea . '
'i could n't afford to learn it . '
said the mock turtle with a sigh .
'i only took the regular course . '
'what was that ? '
inquired <name> .
<unk> and writhing , of course , to begin with , ' the mock turtle replied ; 'and then the different branches of arithmetic  ambition , distraction , <unk> , and derision . '
'i never heard of " <unk> , " ' <name> ventured to say .
'what is it ? '
the gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise .
'what !
never heard of <unk> ! '
it exclaimed .
'you know what to <unk> is , i suppose ? '
'yes , ' said <name> doubtfully : 'it means  to  make  anything  prettier . '
'well , then , ' the gryphon went on , 'if you do n't know what to <unk> is , you are a simpleton . '
<name> did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it , so she turned to the mock turtle , and said 'what else had you to learn ? '
'well , there was mystery , ' the mock turtle replied , counting off the subjects on his <unk> , '  mystery , ancient and modern , with <unk> : then drawling  the <unk> was an old <unk> , that used to come once a week : he taught us drawling , stretching , and fainting in coils . '
'what was that like ? '
said <name> .
'well , i ca n't show it you myself , ' the mock turtle said : 'i 'm too stiff .
and the gryphon never learnt it . '
'had n't time , ' said the gryphon : 'i went to the classics master , though .
he was an old crab , he was . '
'i never went to him , ' the mock turtle said with a sigh : 'he taught laughing and grief , they used to say . '
'so he did , so he did , ' said the gryphon , sighing in his turn ; and both creatures hid their faces in their paws .
'and how many hours a day did you do lessons ? '
said <name> , in a hurry to change the subject .
<unk> hours the first day , ' said the mock turtle : <unk> the next , and so on . '
'what a curious plan ! '
exclaimed <name> .
'that 's the reason they 're called lessons , ' the gryphon remarked : 'because they lessen from day to day . '
this was quite a new idea to <name> , and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark .
'then the eleventh day must have been a holiday ? '
'of course it was , ' said the mock turtle .
'and how did you manage on the twelfth ? '
<name> went on eagerly .
'that 's enough about lessons , ' the gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone : 'tell her something about the games now . '
chapter x .
the lobster <unk> the mock turtle sighed deeply , and <name> the back of one <unk> across his eyes .
he looked at <name> , and tried to speak , but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice .
<unk> as if he had a bone in his throat , ' said the gryphon : and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back .
at last the mock turtle recovered his voice , and , with tears running down his cheeks , he went on again :  'you may not have lived much under the sea  ' ( 'i have n't , ' said <name> )  'and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster  ' ( <name> began to say 'i once tasted  ' but checked herself hastily , and said 'no , never ' ) '  so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a lobster <unk> is ! '
'no , indeed , ' said <name> .
'what sort of a dance is it ? '
'why , ' said the gryphon , 'you first form into a line along the sea-shore  ' 'two lines ! '
cried the mock turtle .
<unk> , turtles , salmon , and so on ; then , when you 've cleared all the <unk> out of the way  ' 'that generally takes some time , ' interrupted the <unk> '
 you advance twice  ' <unk> with a lobster as a partner ! '
cried the gryphon .
'of course , ' the mock turtle said : <unk> twice , set to partners  ' '  change lobsters , and retire in same order , ' continued the gryphon .
'then , you know , ' the mock turtle went on , 'you throw the  ' 'the lobsters ! '
shouted the gryphon , with a bound into the <unk> '
 as far out to sea as you can  ' <unk> after them ! '
screamed the gryphon .
<unk> a <unk> in the sea ! '
cried the mock turtle , capering wildly about .
<unk> lobsters again ! '
yelled the gryphon at the top of its voice .
<unk> to land again , and that 's all the first figure , ' said the mock turtle , suddenly dropping his voice ; and the two creatures , who had been jumping about like mad things all this time , sat down again very sadly and quietly , and looked at <name> .
'it must be a very pretty dance , ' said <name> timidly .
'would you like to see a little of it ? '
said the mock turtle .
'very much indeed , ' said <name> .
'come , let 's try the first figure ! '
said the mock turtle to the gryphon .
'we can do without lobsters , you know .
which shall sing ? '
'oh , you sing , ' said the gryphon .
'i 've forgotten the words . '
so they began solemnly dancing round and round <name> , every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close , and waving their <unk> to <name> the time , while the mock turtle sang this , very slowly and sadly :  ' " <name> you walk a little faster ? "
said a whiting to a snail .
" there 's a porpoise close behind us , and he 's treading on my tail .
see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance !
they are waiting on the shingle  <name> you come and join the dance ?
<name> you , wo n't you , <name> you , wo n't you , <name> you join the dance ?
<name> you , wo n't you , <name> you , wo n't you , wo n't you join the dance ?
" you can really have no notion how delightful it <name> be when they take us up and throw us , with the lobsters , out to sea ! "
but the snail replied " too far , too far ! "
and gave a look askance  said he thanked the whiting kindly , but he would not join the dance .
would not , could not , would not , could not , would not join the dance .
would not , could not , would not , could not , could not join the dance .
' " what matters it how far we go ? "
his <unk> friend replied .
" there is another shore , you know , upon the other side .
the further off from england the nearer is to <name>  then turn not pale , beloved snail , but come and join the dance .
<name> you , wo n't you , <name> you , wo n't you , <name> you join the dance ?
<name> you , wo n't you , <name> you , wo n't you , wo n't you join the dance ? " '
'thank you , it 's a very interesting dance to watch , ' said <name> , feeling very glad that it was over at last : 'and i do so like that curious song about the whiting ! '
'oh , as to the whiting , ' said the mock turtle , 'they  you 've seen them , of course ? '
'yes , ' said <name> , 'i 've often seen them at <unk>  ' she checked herself hastily .
'i do n't know where <unk> may be , ' said the mock turtle , 'but if you've seen them so often , of course you know what they 're like . '
'i believe so , ' <name> replied thoughtfully .
'they have their tails in their mouths  and they 're all over crumbs . '
'you 're wrong about the crumbs , ' said the mock turtle : <unk> would all wash off in the sea .
but they have their tails in their mouths ; and the reason is  ' here the mock turtle yawned and shut his <unk>  'tell her about the reason and all that , ' he said to the gryphon .
'the reason is , ' said the gryphon , 'that they would go with the lobsters to the dance .
so they got thrown out to sea .
so they had to fall a long way .
so they got their tails fast in their mouths .
so they could n't get them out again .
that 's all . '
'thank you , ' said <name> , 'it 's very interesting .
i never knew so much about a whiting before . '
'i can tell you more than that , if you like , ' said the gryphon .
'do you know why it 's called a whiting ? '
'i never thought about it , ' said <name> .
'why ? '
'it does the boots and shoes . '
the gryphon replied very solemnly .
<name> was thoroughly puzzled .
'does the boots and shoes ! '
she repeated in a wondering tone .
'why , what are your shoes done with ? '
said the gryphon .
'i mean , what makes them so shiny ? '
<name> looked down at them , and considered a little before she gave her answer .
'they 're done with blacking , i believe . '
<unk> and shoes under the sea , ' the gryphon went on in a deep voice , 'are done with a whiting .
now you know . '
'and what are they made of ? '
<name> asked in a tone of great curiosity .
<unk> and eels , of course , ' the gryphon replied rather impatiently : 'any <unk> could have told you that . '
'if i 'd been the whiting , ' said <name> , whose thoughts were still running on the song , 'i 'd have said to the porpoise , " keep back , please : we do n't want you with us ! " '
'they were obliged to have him with them , ' the mock turtle said : 'no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise . '
'would n't it really ? '
said <name> in a tone of great surprise .
'of course not , ' said the mock turtle : 'why , if a fish came to me , and told me he was going a journey , i should say " with what porpoise ? " '
'do n't you mean " purpose " ? '
said <name> .
'i mean what i say , ' the mock turtle replied in an offended tone .
and the gryphon added 'come , let 's hear some of your adventures . '
'i could tell you my adventures  beginning from this morning , ' said <name> a little timidly : 'but it 's no use going back to yesterday , because i was a different person then . '
<unk> all that , ' said the mock turtle .
'no , no !
the adventures first , ' said the gryphon in an impatient tone : <unk> take such a dreadful time . '
so <name> began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the white rabbit .
she was a little nervous about it just at first , the two creatures got so close to her , one on each side , and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide , but she gained courage as she went on .
her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating 'you are old , father <name> , ' to the caterpillar , and the words all coming different , and then the mock turtle <name> a long breath , and said 'that 's very curious . '
'it 's all about as curious as it can be , ' said the gryphon .
'it all came different ! '
the mock turtle repeated thoughtfully .
'i should like to hear her try and repeat something now .
tell her to begin . '
he looked at the gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over <name> .
'stand up and repeat " 't is the voice of the <unk> , " ' said the gryphon .
'how the creatures order one about , and make one repeat lessons ! '
thought <name> ; 'i might as well be at school at once . '
however , she got up , and began to repeat it , but her head was so full of the lobster <unk> , that she hardly knew what she was saying , and the words came very queer indeed :  "tis the voice of the lobster ; i heard him declare , " you have baked me too brown , i must sugar my hair . "
as a duck with its eyelids , so he with his nose <unk> his belt and his buttons , and turns out his toes . '
[ later editions continued as follows when the sands are all dry , he is <name> as a lark , and <name> talk in contemptuous tones of the shark , but , when the tide rises and sharks are around , his voice has a timid and tremulous sound . ]
'that 's different from what i used to say when i was a child , ' said the gryphon .
'well , i never heard it before , ' said the mock turtle ; 'but it sounds uncommon nonsense . '
<name> said nothing ; she had sat down with her face in her hands , wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again .
'i should like to have it explained , ' said the mock turtle .
'she ca n't explain it , ' said the gryphon hastily .
'go on with the next verse . '
'but about his toes ? '
the mock turtle persisted .
'how could he turn them out with his nose , you know ? '
'it 's the first position in dancing . '
<name> said ; but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing , and longed to change the subject .
'go on with the next verse , ' the gryphon repeated impatiently : 'it begins " i passed by his garden . " '
<name> did not dare to disobey , though she felt sure it would all come wrong , and she went on in a trembling voice :  'i passed by his garden , and marked , with one eye , how the owl and the panther were sharing a pie  ' [ later editions continued as follows the panther took <unk> , and gravy , and meat , while the owl had the dish as its share of the treat .
when the pie was all finished , the owl , as a boon , was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon : while the panther received knife and fork with a growl , and concluded the banquet  ] 'what is the use of repeating all that stuff , ' the mock turtle interrupted , 'if you do n't explain it as you go on ?
it 's by far the most confusing thing i ever heard ! '
'yes , i think you 'd better leave off , ' said the gryphon : and <name> was only too glad to do so .
'shall we try another figure of the lobster <unk> ? '
the gryphon went on .
'or would you like the mock turtle to sing you a song ? '
'oh , a song , please , if the mock turtle would be so kind , ' <name> replied , so eagerly that the gryphon said , in a rather offended tone , <unk> !
no accounting for tastes !
sing her " turtle soup , " <name> you , old fellow ? '
the mock turtle sighed deeply , and began , in a voice sometimes choked with sobs , to sing this :  <unk> soup , so <name> and green , waiting in a hot <unk> !
who for such dainties would not stoop ?
soup of the evening , beautiful soup !
soup of the evening , beautiful soup !
<name>  <unk> <name>  oop !
<name>  <unk> <name>  oop !
<name>  oop of the e  e  evening , beautiful , beautiful soup !
<unk> soup !
who cares for fish , game , or any other dish ?
who would not give all else for two <unk> only of beautiful soup ?
<unk> only of beautiful soup ?
<name>  <unk> <name>  oop !
<name>  <unk> <name>  oop !
<name>  oop of the e  e  evening , beautiful , <unk>  <unk> soup ! '
<unk> again ! '
cried the gryphon , and the mock turtle had just begun to repeat it , when a cry of 'the trial 's beginning ! '
was heard in the distance .
'come on ! '
cried the gryphon , and , taking <name> by the hand , it hurried off , without waiting for the end of the song .
'what trial is it ? '
<name> panted as she ran ; but the gryphon only answered 'come on ! '
and ran the faster , while more and more faintly came , carried on the breeze that followed them , the melancholy words :  <unk>  oop of the e  e  evening , beautiful , beautiful soup ! '
chapter xi .
who stole the tarts ?
the king and <name> of hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived , with a great crowd assembled about them  all sorts of little birds and beasts , as well as the whole pack of cards : the knave was standing before them , in chains , with a soldier on each side to guard him ; and near the king was the white rabbit , with a trumpet in one hand , and a scroll of parchment in the other .
in the very middle of the court was a table , with a large dish of tarts upon it : they looked so good , that it made <name> quite hungry to look at them  'i wish they 'd get the trial done , ' she thought , 'and hand round the refreshments ! '
but there seemed to be no chance of this , so she began looking at everything about her , to pass away the time .
<name> had never been in a court of justice before , but she had read about them in books , and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there .
'that 's the judge , ' she said to herself , 'because of his great wig . '
the judge , by the way , was the king ; and as he wore his crown over the wig , ( look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it , ) he did not look at all comfortable , and it was certainly not becoming .
'and that 's the <unk> , ' thought <name> , 'and those twelve creatures , ' ( she was obliged to say <unk> , ' you see , because some of them were animals , and some were birds , ) 'i suppose they are the <unk> . '
she said this last word two or three times over to herself , being rather proud of it : for she thought , and rightly too , that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all .
however , <unk> ' would have done just as well .
the twelve <unk> were all writing very busily on slates .
'what are they doing ? '
<name> whispered to the gryphon .
'they ca n't have anything to put down yet , before the trial 's begun . '
'they 're putting down their names , ' the gryphon whispered in reply , 'for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial . '
<unk> things ! '
<name> began in a loud , indignant voice , but she stopped hastily , for the white rabbit cried out , <unk> in the court ! '
and the king put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round , to make out who was talking .
<name> could see , as well as if she were looking over their shoulders , that all the <unk> were writing down <unk> things ! '
on their slates , and she could even make out that one of them did n't know how to spell <unk> , ' and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him .
'a nice muddle their slates 'll be in before the trial 's over ! '
thought <name> .
one of the <unk> had a pencil that squeaked .
this of course , <name> could not stand , and she went round the court and got behind him , and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away .
she did it so quickly that the poor little <unk> ( it was <name> , the lizard ) could not make out at all what had become of it ; so , after hunting all about for it , he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day ; and this was of very little use , as it left no <name> on the slate .
<unk> , read the accusation ! '
said the king .
on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet , and then unrolled the parchment scroll , and read as follows :  'the <name> of hearts , she made some tarts , all on a summer day : the knave of hearts , he stole those tarts , and took them quite away ! '
<unk> your verdict , ' the king said to the jury .
'not yet , not yet ! '
the rabbit hastily interrupted .
'there 's a great deal to come before that ! '
'call the first witness , ' said the king ; and the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet , and called out , 'first witness ! '
the first witness was the hatter .
he came in with a <unk> in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other .
'i beg pardon , your majesty , ' he began , 'for bringing these in : but i had n't quite finished my tea when i was sent for . '
'you ought to have finished , ' said the king .
'when did you begin ? '
the hatter looked at the march hare , who had followed him into the court , <unk> with the dormouse .
<unk> of march , i think it was , ' he said .
<unk> , ' said the march hare .
<unk> , ' added the dormouse .
<unk> that down , ' the king said to the jury , and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates , and then added them up , and reduced the answer to shillings and pence .
'take off your hat , ' the king said to the hatter .
'it is n't mine , ' said the hatter .
<unk> ! '
the king exclaimed , turning to the jury , who instantly made a memorandum of the fact .
'i keep them to sell , ' the hatter added as an explanation ; 'i 've none of my own .
i 'm a hatter . '
here the <name> put on her spectacles , and began staring at the hatter , who turned pale and fidgeted .
'give your evidence , ' said the king ; 'and do n't be nervous , or i 'll have you executed on the spot . '
this did not seem to encourage the witness at all : he kept shifting from one foot to the other , looking uneasily at the <name> , and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his <unk> instead of the bread-and-butter .
just at this moment <name> felt a very curious sensation , which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was : she was beginning to grow larger again , and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court ; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her .
'i wish you would n't squeeze so . '
said the dormouse , who was sitting next to her .
'i can hardly breathe . '
'i ca n't help it , ' said <name> very meekly : 'i 'm growing . '
'you 've no right to grow here , ' said the dormouse .
'do n't talk nonsense , ' said <name> more boldly : 'you know you 're growing too . '
'yes , but i grow at a reasonable pace , ' said the dormouse : 'not in that ridiculous fashion . '
and he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court .
all this time the <name> had never left off staring at the hatter , and , just as the dormouse crossed the court , she said to one of the officers of the court , <unk> me the list of the singers in the last concert ! '
on which the wretched hatter trembled so , that he shook both his shoes off .
'give your evidence , ' the king repeated angrily , 'or i 'll have you executed , whether you 're nervous or not . '
'i 'm a poor man , your majesty , ' the hatter began , in a trembling voice , '  and i had n't begun my tea  not above a week or so  and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin  and the twinkling of the tea  ' 'the twinkling of the what ? '
said the king .
'it began with the tea , ' the hatter replied .
'of course twinkling begins with a t ! '
said the king sharply .
'do you take me for a dunce ?
go on ! '
'i 'm a poor man , ' the hatter went on , 'and most things twinkled after that  only the march hare said  ' 'i did n't ! '
the march hare interrupted in a great hurry .
'you did ! '
said the hatter .
'i deny it ! '
said the march hare .
'he denies it , ' said the king : <unk> out that part . '
'well , at any rate , the dormouse said  ' the hatter went on , looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too : but the dormouse denied nothing , being fast asleep .
'after that , ' continued the hatter , 'i cut some more bread-and-butter  ' 'but what did the dormouse say ? '
one of the jury asked .
'that i ca n't remember , ' said the hatter .
'you must remember , ' remarked the king , 'or i 'll have you executed . '
the miserable hatter dropped his <unk> and bread-and-butter , and went down on one knee .
'i 'm a poor man , your majesty , ' he began .
'you 're a very poor speaker , ' said the king .
here one of the guinea-pigs cheered , and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court .
( as that is rather a hard word , i <name> just explain to you how it was done .
they had a large canvas bag , which tied up at the mouth with strings : into this they slipped the guinea-pig , head first , and then sat upon it . )
'i 'm glad i 've seen that done , ' thought <name> .
'i 've so often read in the newspapers , at the end of trials , " there was some attempts at applause , which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court , " and i never understood what it meant till now . '
'if that 's all you know about it , you may stand down , ' continued the king .
'i ca n't go no lower , ' said the hatter : 'i 'm on the floor , as it is . '
'then you may sit down , ' the king replied .
here the other guinea-pig cheered , and was suppressed .
'come , that finished the guinea-pigs ! '
thought <name> .
'now we shall get on better . '
'i 'd rather finish my tea , ' said the hatter , with an anxious look at the <name> , who was reading the list of singers .
'you may go , ' said the king , and the hatter hurriedly left the court , without even waiting to put his shoes <unk> '
 and just take his head off outside , ' the <name> added to one of the officers : but the hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door .
'call the next witness ! '
said the king .
the next witness was the duchess 's cook .
she carried the <unk> in her hand , and <name> guessed who it was , even before she got into the court , by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once .
'give your evidence , ' said the king .
<unk> n't , ' said the cook .
the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit , who said in a low voice , 'your majesty must <unk> this witness . '
'well , if i must , i must , ' the king said , with a melancholy air , and , after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight , he said in a deep voice , 'what are tarts made of ? '
<unk> , mostly , ' said the cook .
<unk> , ' said a sleepy voice behind her .
<unk> that dormouse , ' the <name> shrieked out .
<unk> that dormouse !
turn that dormouse out of court !
suppress him !
pinch him !
off with his whiskers ! '
for some minutes the whole court was in confusion , getting the dormouse turned out , and , by the time they had settled down again , the cook had disappeared .
'never mind ! '
said the king , with an air of great relief .
'call the next witness . '
and he added in an undertone to the <name> , <unk> , my dear , you must <unk> the next witness .
it quite makes my forehead ache ! '
<name> watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list , feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like , '  for they haven't got much evidence yet , ' she said to herself .
imagine her surprise , when the white rabbit read out , at the top of his shrill little voice , the name <unk> ! '
chapter xii .
<name> 's evidence 'here ! '
cried <name> , quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes , and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the <unk> with the edge of her skirt , upsetting all the <unk> on to the heads of the crowd below , and there they lay sprawling about , reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before .
'oh , i beg your pardon ! '
she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay , and began picking them up again as quickly as she could , for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head , and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the <unk> , or they would die .
'the trial can not proceed , ' said the king in a very grave voice , <unk> all the <unk> are back in their proper places  all , ' he repeated with great emphasis , looking hard at <name> as he said do .
<name> looked at the <unk> , and saw that , in her haste , she had put the lizard in head downwards , and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way , being quite unable to move .
she soon got it out again , and put it right ; 'not that it signifies much , ' she said to herself ; 'i should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other . '
as soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset , and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them , they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident , all except the lizard , who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open , gazing up into the roof of the court .
'what do you know about this business ? '
the king said to <name> .
'nothing , ' said <name> .
'nothing whatever ? '
persisted the king .
'nothing whatever , ' said <name> .
'that 's very important , ' the king said , turning to the jury .
they were just beginning to write this down on their slates , when the white rabbit interrupted : <unk> , your majesty means , of course , ' he said in a very respectful tone , but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke .
<unk> , of course , i meant , ' the king hastily said , and went on to himself in an undertone , <unk>  unimportant  unimportant  important  ' as if he were trying which word sounded best .
some of the jury wrote it down <unk> , ' and some <unk> . '
<name> could see this , as she was near enough to look over their slates ; 'but it does n't matter a bit , ' she thought to herself .
at this moment the king , who had been for some time busily writing in his note-book , <unk> out <unk> ! '
and read out from his book , <unk> forty-two .
all persons more than a mile high to leave the court . '
everybody looked at <name> .
'i 'm not a mile high , ' said <name> .
'you are , ' said the king .
<unk> two miles high , ' added the <name> .
'well , i <name> n't go , at any rate , ' said <name> : <unk> , that 's not a regular rule : you invented it just now . '
'it 's the oldest rule in the book , ' said the king .
'then it ought to be number one , ' said <name> .
the king turned pale , and shut his note-book hastily .
<unk> your verdict , ' he said to the jury , in a low , trembling voice .
'there 's more evidence to come yet , please your majesty , ' said the white rabbit , jumping up in a great hurry ; 'this paper has just been picked up . '
'what 's in it ? '
said the <name> .
'i have n't opened it yet , ' said the white rabbit , 'but it seems to be a letter , written by the prisoner to  to somebody . '
'it must have been that , ' said the king , <unk> it was written to nobody , which is n't usual , you know . '
'who is it directed to ? '
said one of the <unk> .
'it is n't directed at all , ' said the white rabbit ; 'in fact , there's nothing written on the outside . '
he unfolded the paper as he spoke , and added 'it is n't a letter , after all : it 's a set of verses . '
'are they in the prisoner 's handwriting ? '
asked another of the <unk> .
'no , they 're not , ' said the white rabbit , 'and that 's the queerest thing about it . '
( the jury all looked puzzled . )
'he must have imitated somebody else 's hand , ' said the king .
( the jury all brightened up again . )
'please your majesty , ' said the knave , 'i did n't write it , and they ca n't prove i did : there 's no name signed at the end . '
'if you did n't sign it , ' said the king , 'that only makes the matter worse .
you must have meant some mischief , or else you 'd have signed your name like an honest man . '
there was a general clapping of hands at this : it was the first really clever thing the king had said that day .
'that proves his guilt , ' said the <name> .
'it proves nothing of the sort ! '
said <name> .
'why , you do n't even know what they 're about ! '
<unk> them , ' said the king .
the white rabbit put on his spectacles .
'where shall i begin , please your majesty ? '
he asked .
<unk> at the beginning , ' the king said gravely , 'and go on till you come to the end : then stop . '
these were the verses the white rabbit read :  'they told me you had been to her , and mentioned me to him : she gave me a good character , but said i could not swim .
he sent them word i had not gone ( we know it to be true ) : if she should push the matter on , what would become of you ?
i gave her one , they gave him two , you gave us three or more ; they all returned from him to you , though they were mine before .
if i or she should chance to be involved in this affair , he trusts to you to set them free , exactly as we were .
my notion was that you had been ( before she had this fit ) an obstacle that came between him , and ourselves , and it .
do n't let him know she liked them best , for this must ever be a secret , kept from all the rest , between yourself and me . '
'that 's the most important piece of evidence we 've heard yet , ' said the king , rubbing his hands ; 'so now let the jury  ' 'if any one of them can explain it , ' said <name> , ( she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she was n't a bit afraid of interrupting him , ) 'i 'll give him sixpence .
i do n't believe there 's an atom of meaning in it . '
the jury all wrote down on their slates , 'she does n't believe there 's an atom of meaning in it , ' but none of them attempted to explain the paper .
'if there 's no meaning in it , ' said the king , 'that saves a world of trouble , you know , as we need n't try to find any .
and yet i do n't know , ' he went on , spreading out the verses on his knee , and looking at them with one eye ; 'i seem to see some meaning in them , after <unk> "
 said i could not swim  " you ca n't swim , can you ? '
he added , turning to the knave .
the knave shook his head sadly .
'do i look like it ? '
he said .
( which he certainly did not , being made entirely of cardboard . )
'all right , so far , ' said the king , and he went on muttering over the verses to himself : ' " we know it to be true  " that 's the jury , of course  " i gave her one , they gave him two  " why , that must be what he did with the tarts , you know  ' 'but , it goes on " they all returned from him to you , " ' said <name> .
'why , there they are ! '
said the king triumphantly , pointing to the tarts on the table .
'nothing can be clearer than that .
then again  " before she had this fit  " you never had fits , my dear , i think ? '
he said to the <name> .
'never ! '
said the <name> furiously , throwing an inkstand at the lizard as she spoke .
( the unfortunate little <name> had left off writing on his slate with one finger , as he found it made no <name> ; but he now hastily began again , using the ink , that was trickling down his face , as long as it lasted . )
'then the words do n't fit you , ' said the king , looking round the court with a smile .
there was a dead silence .
'it 's a pun ! '
the king added in an offended tone , and everybody laughed , 'let the jury consider their verdict , ' the king said , for about the twentieth time that day .
'no , no ! '
said the <name> .
<unk> first  verdict afterwards . '
<unk> and nonsense ! '
said <name> loudly .
'the idea of having the sentence first ! '
'hold your tongue ! '
said the <name> , turning purple .
'i wo n't ! '
said <name> .
<unk> with her head ! '
the <name> shouted at the top of her voice .
nobody moved .
'who cares for you ? '
said <name> , ( she had grown to her full size by this time . )
'you 're nothing but a pack of cards ! '
at this the whole pack rose up into the air , and came flying down upon her : she gave a little scream , half of fright and half of anger , and tried to beat them off , and found herself lying on the bank , with her head in the lap of her sister , who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face .
<unk> up , <name> dear ! '
said her sister ; 'why , what a long sleep you've had ! '
'oh , i 've had such a curious dream ! '
said <name> , and she told her sister , as well as she could remember them , all these strange adventures of hers that you have just been reading about ; and when she had finished , her sister kissed her , and said , 'it was a curious dream , dear , certainly : but now run in to your tea ; it 's getting late . '
so <name> got up and ran off , thinking while she ran , as well she might , what a wonderful dream it had been .
but her sister sat still just as she left her , leaning her head on her hand , watching the setting sun , and thinking of little <name> and all her wonderful adventures , till she too began dreaming after a fashion , and this was her dream :  first , she dreamed of little <name> herself , and once again the <name> hands were clasped upon her knee , and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers  she could hear the very tones of her voice , and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes  and still as she listened , or seemed to listen , the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister 's dream .
the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried by  the frightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool  she could hear the rattle of the <unk> as the march hare and his friends shared their <unk> meal , and the shrill voice of the <name> ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution  once more the <unk> was sneezing on the duchess 's knee , while plates and dishes crashed around it  once more the shriek of the gryphon , the squeaking of the lizard 's <unk> , and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs , filled the air , mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable mock turtle .
so she sat on , with closed eyes , and half believed herself in wonderland , though she knew she had but to open them again , and all would change to dull reality  the grass would be only rustling in the wind , and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds  the rattling <unk> would change to tinkling <unk> , and the <name> 's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy  and the sneeze of the baby , the shriek of the gryphon , and all the other queer noises , would change ( she knew ) to the confused clamour of the busy <unk>  while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the mock <unk> heavy sobs .
lastly , she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would , in the <unk> , be herself a grown woman ; and how she would keep , through all her <unk> years , the simple and loving heart of her childhood : and how she would gather about her other little children , and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale , perhaps even with the dream of wonderland of long ago : and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows , and find a pleasure in all their simple joys , remembering her own <unk> , and the happy summer days .

who stole the tarts ?
* * * * * chapter 1 [ illustration ] <name> was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank , and of having nothing to do : once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading , but it had no pictures or conversations in it , and where is the use of a book , thought <name> , without pictures or conversations ?
so she was considering in her own mind , ( as well as she could , for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid , ) whether the pleasure of making a <unk> was worth the trouble of getting up and picking the <unk> , when a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her .
there was nothing very remarkable in that , nor did <name> think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself " dear , dear !
i shall be too late ! "
( when she thought it over afterwards , it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this , but at the time it all seemed quite natural ) ; but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its <unk> , looked at it , and then hurried on , <name> started to her feet , for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a <unk> or a watch to take out of it , and , full of curiosity , she hurried across the field after it , and was just in time to see it pop down a large <unk> under the hedge .
in a moment down went <name> after it , never once considering how in the world she was to get out again .
the <unk> went straight on like a tunnel for some way , and then dipped suddenly down , so suddenly , that <name> had not a moment to think about stopping herself , before she found herself falling down what seemed a deep well .
either the well was very deep , or she fell very slowly , for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her , and to wonder what would happen next .
first , she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to , but it was too dark to see anything : then , she looked at the sides of the well , and noticed that they were filled with <unk> and <unk> : here and there were maps and pictures <name> on pegs .
she took a jar down off one of the shelves as she passed : it was labelled " orange <unk> , " but to her great disappointment it was empty : she did not like to drop the jar , for fear of killing somebody underneath , so managed to put it into one of the <unk> as she fell past it .
" well ! "
thought <name> to herself , " after such a fall as this , i shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs !
how brave they'll all think me at home !
why , i would n't say anything about it , even if i fell off the top of the house ! "
( which was most likely true . )
down , down , down .
would the fall never come to an end ?
" i wonder how many miles i 've fallen by this time ? "
she said aloud , " i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth .
let me see : that would be four thousand miles down , i think  " ( for you see <name> had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom , and though this was not a very good opportunity of showing off her knowledge , as there was no one to hear her , still it was good practice to say it over , ) " yes that 's the right distance , but then what longitude or <unk> shall i be in ? "
( <name> had no idea what longitude was , or latitude either , but she thought they were nice grand words to say . )
presently she began again : " i wonder if i shall fall right through the earth !
how funny it 'll be to come out among the people that walk with their heads downwards !
but i shall have to ask them what the name of the country is , you know .
please , ma'am , is this new zealand or australia ? "
 and she tried to curtsey as she spoke ( fancy <unk> as you 're falling through the air !
do you think you could manage it ? )
" and what an ignorant little girl she 'll think me for asking !
no , it 'll never do to ask : perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere . "
down , down , down : there was nothing else to do , so <name> soon began talking again .
" <name> <name> miss me very much tonight , i should think ! "
( <name> was the cat . )
" i <name> they 'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time !
oh , dear <name> , i wish i had you here !
there are no mice in the air , i 'm afraid , but you might catch a bat , and that 's very like a mouse , you know , my dear .
but do cats eat bats , i wonder ? "
and here <name> began to get rather sleepy , and kept on saying to herself , in a dreamy sort of way " do cats eat bats ?
do cats eat bats ? "
and sometimes , " do bats eat cats ? "
for , as she could n't answer either question , it didn't much matter which way she put it .
she felt that she was dozing off , and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with <name> , and was saying to her very earnestly , " now , <name> , my dear , tell me the truth .
did you ever eat a bat ? "
when suddenly , bump !
bump !
down she came upon a heap of sticks and shavings , and the fall was over .
<name> was not a bit hurt , and jumped on to her feet directly : she looked up , but it was all dark overhead ; before her was another long passage , and the white rabbit was still in sight , hurrying down it .
there was not a moment to be lost : away went <name> like the wind , and just heard it say , as it turned a corner , " my ears and whiskers , how late it 's getting ! "
she turned the corner after it , and instantly found herself in a long , low hall , lit up by a row of lamps which <name> from the roof .
[ illustration ] there were doors all round the hall , but they were all locked , and when <name> had been all round it , and tried them all , she walked sadly down the middle , wondering how she was ever to get out again : suddenly she came upon a little <unk> table , all made of solid glass ; there was nothing lying upon it , but a <name> golden key , and <name> 's first idea was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall , but alas !
either the locks were too large , or the key too small , but at any rate it would open none of them .
however , on the second time round , she came to a low curtain , behind which was a door about eighteen inches high : she tried the little key in the keyhole , and it fitted !
<name> opened the door , and looked down a small passage , not larger than a <unk> , into the loveliest garden you ever saw .
how she longed to get out of that dark hall , and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains , but she could not even get her head through the doorway , " and even if my head would go through , " thought poor <name> , " it would be very little use without my shoulders .
oh , how i wish i could shut up like a telescope !
i think i could , if i only knew how to begin . "
for , you see , so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately , that <name> began to think very few things indeed were really impossible .
there was nothing else to do , so she went back to the table , half hoping she might find another key on it , or at any rate a book of rules for shutting up people like telescopes : this time there was a little bottle on it  " which certainly was not there before " said <name>  and tied round the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words drink me beautifully printed on it in large letters .
it was all very well to say " drink me , " " but i 'll look first , " said the wise little <name> , " and see whether the bottle 's marked " poison " or not , " for <name> had read several nice little stories about children that got burnt , and eaten up by wild beasts , and other unpleasant things , because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had given them , such as , that , if you get into the fire , it <name> burn you , and that , if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife , it generally <unk> , and she had never forgotten that , if you drink a bottle marked " poison , " it is almost certain to disagree with you , sooner or later .
however , this bottle was not marked poison , so <name> tasted it , and finding it very nice , ( it had , in fact , a sort of mixed flavour of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , roast turkey , <unk> , and hot buttered toast , ) she very soon finished it off .
* * * * * " what a curious feeling ! "
said <name> , " i must be shutting up like a telescope . "
it was so indeed : she was now only ten inches high , and her face brightened up as it occurred to her that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden .
first , however , she waited for a few minutes to see whether she was going to shrink any further : she felt a little nervous about this , " for it might end , you know , " said <name> to herself , " in my going out altogether , like a candle , and what should i be like then , i wonder ? "
and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out , for she could not remember having ever seen one .
however , nothing more happened so she decided on going into the garden at once , but , alas for poor <name> !
when she got to the door , she found she had forgotten the little golden key , and when she went back to the table for the key , she found she could not possibly reach it : she could see it plainly enough through the glass , and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table , but it was too slippery , and when she had tired herself out with trying , the poor little thing sat down and cried .
[ illustration ] " come !
there 's no use in crying ! "
said <name> to herself rather sharply , " i advise you to leave off this minute ! "
( she generally gave herself very good advice , and sometimes scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes , and once she remembered boxing her own ears for having been unkind to herself in a game of croquet she was playing with herself , for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people , ) " but it 's no use now , " thought poor <name> , " to pretend to be two people !
why , there 's hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person ! "
soon her eyes fell on a little <name> box lying under the table : she opened it , and found in it a very small cake , on which was lying a card with the words eat me beautifully printed on it in large letters .
" i 'll eat , " said <name> , " and if it makes me larger , i can reach the key , and if it makes me smaller , i can creep under the door , so either way i 'll get into the garden , and i do n't care which happens ! "
she ate a little bit , and said anxiously to herself " which way ?
which way ? "
and laid her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing , and was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size : to be sure this is what generally happens when one eats cake , but <name> had got into the way of expecting nothing but <unk> way things to happen , and it seemed quite dull and stupid for things to go on in the common way .
so she set to work , and very soon finished off the cake .
* * * * * " <unk> and <unk> ! "
cried <name> , ( she was so surprised that she quite forgot how to speak good english , ) " now i'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was !
goodbye , feet ! "
( for when she looked down at her feet , they seemed almost out of sight , they were getting so far off , ) " oh , my poor little feet , i wonder who <name> put on your shoes and stockings for you now , dears ?
i 'm sure i ca n't !
i shall be a great deal too far off to bother myself about you : you must manage the best way you can  but i must be kind to them , " thought <name> , " or perhaps they wo n't walk the way i want to go !
let me see : i 'll give them a new pair of boots every christmas . "
[ illustration ] and she went on planning to herself how she would manage it " they must go by the carrier , " she thought , " and how funny <unk> seem , sending presents to one 's own feet !
and how odd the directions <name> look !
<name> 's right foot , esq .
the carpet , with <name> 's love oh dear !
what nonsense i am talking ! "
just at this moment , her head struck against the roof of the hall : in fact , she was now rather more than nine feet high , and she at once took up the little golden key , and hurried off to the garden door .
poor <name> !
it was as much as she could do , lying down on one side , to look through into the garden with one eye , but to get through was more hopeless than ever : she sat down and cried again .
" you ought to be ashamed of yourself , " said <name> , " a great girl like you , " ( she might well say this , ) " to cry in this way !
stop this instant , i tell you ! "
but she cried on all the same , shedding gallons of tears , until there was a large pool , about four inches deep , all round her , and reaching half way across the hall .
after a time , she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance , and dried her eyes to see what was coming .
it was the white rabbit coming back again , splendidly dressed , with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand , and a <unk> in the other .
<name> was ready to ask help of any one , she felt so desperate , and as the rabbit passed her , she said , in a low , timid voice , " if you please , sir  " the rabbit started violently , looked up once into the roof of the hall , from which the voice seemed to come , and then dropped the <unk> and the white kid gloves , and <unk> away into the darkness , as hard as it could go .
[ illustration ] <name> took up the <unk> and gloves , and found the <unk> so delicious that she kept smelling at it all the time she went on talking to herself  " dear , dear !
how queer everything is today !
and yesterday everything happened just as usual : i wonder if i was changed in the night ?
let me think : was i the same when i got up this morning ?
i think i remember feeling rather different .
but if i 'm not the same , who in the world am i ?
ah , that 's the great puzzle ! "
and she began thinking over all the children she knew of the same age as herself , to see if she could have been changed for any of them .
" i 'm sure i 'm not <name> , " she said , " for her hair goes in such long ringlets , and mine does n't go in ringlets at all  and i'm sure i ca'n't be <name> , for i know all sorts of things , and she , oh !
she knows such a very little !
besides , she 's she , and i 'm i , and  oh dear !
how puzzling it all is !
i 'll try if i know all the things i used to know .
let me see : four times five is twelve , and four times six is thirteen , and four times seven is fourteen  oh dear !
i shall never get to twenty at this rate !
but the multiplication table do n't signify  let 's try geography .
london is the capital of <name> , and rome is the capital of yorkshire , and <name>  oh dear !
dear !
that 's all wrong , i'm certain !
i must have been changed for <name> !
i 'll try and say " how doth the little , " " and she crossed her hands on her lap , and began , but her voice sounded hoarse and strange , and the words did not sound the same as they used to do : " how doth the little crocodile improve its shining tail , and pour the waters of the nile on every golden scale !
" how cheerfully it seems to grin !
how neatly spreads its claws !
and <unk> little fishes in with <unk> jaws ! "
" i 'm sure those are not the right words , " said poor <name> , and her eyes filled with tears as she thought " i must be <name> after all , and i shall have to go and live in that <unk> little house , and have next to no toys to play with , and oh !
ever so many lessons to learn !
no !
i 've made up my mind about it : if i'm <name> , i 'll stay down here !
it 'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying 'come up , dear ! '
i shall only look up and say 'who am i then ?
answer me that first , and then , if i like being that person , i 'll come up : if not , i 'll stay down here till i 'm somebody else  but , oh dear ! "
cried <name> with a sudden burst of tears , " i do wish they would put their heads down !
i am so tired of being all alone here ! "
as she said this , she looked down at her hands , and was surprised to find she had put on one of the rabbit 's little gloves while she was talking .
" how can i have done that ? "
thought she , " i must be growing small again . "
she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it , and found that , as nearly as she could guess , she was now about two feet high , and was going on shrinking rapidly : soon she found out that the reason of it was the <unk> she held in her hand : she dropped it hastily , just in time to save herself from shrinking away altogether , and found that she was now only three inches high .
" now for the garden ! "
cried <name> , as she hurried back to the little door , but the little door was locked again , and the little gold key was lying on the glass table as before , and " things are worse than ever ! "
thought the poor little girl , " for i never was as small as this before , never !
and i declare it 's too bad , it is ! "
[ illustration ] at this moment her foot slipped , and splash !
she was up to her <name> in salt water .
her first idea was that she had fallen into the sea : then she remembered that she was under ground , and she soon made out that it was the pool of tears she had wept when she was nine feet high .
" i wish i had n't cried so much ! "
said <name> , as she swam about , trying to find her way out , " i shall be punished for it now , i suppose , by being drowned in my own tears !
well !
that 'll be a queer thing , to be sure !
however , every thing is queer today . "
very soon she saw something splashing about in the pool near her : at first she thought it must be a walrus or a hippopotamus , but then she remembered how small she was herself , and soon made out that it was only a mouse , that had slipped in like herself .
" would it be any use , now , " thought <name> , " to speak to this mouse ?
the rabbit is something quite out-of-the-way , no doubt , and so have i been , ever since i came down here , but that is no reason why the mouse should not be able to talk .
i think i may as well try . "
so she began : " oh mouse , do you know how to get out of this pool ?
i am very tired of swimming about here , oh mouse ! "
the mouse looked at her rather <unk> , and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes , but it said nothing .
[ illustration ] " perhaps it does n't understand english , " thought <name> ; " i daresay it 's a french mouse , come over with <name> the conqueror ! "
( for , with all her knowledge of history , <name> had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened , ) so she began again : " <unk> est <name> <unk> ? "
which was the first sentence out of her french <unk> .
the mouse gave a sudden jump in the pool , and seemed to quiver with fright : " oh , i beg your pardon ! "
cried <name> hastily , afraid that she had hurt the poor <unk> feelings , " i quite forgot you did n't like cats ! "
" not like cats ! "
cried the mouse , in a shrill , passionate voice , " would you like cats if you were me ? "
" well , perhaps not , " said <name> in a soothing tone , " do n't be angry about it .
and yet i wish i could show you our cat <name> : i think you 'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her .
she is such a dear quiet thing , " said <name> , half to herself , as she swam lazily about in the pool , " she sits purring so nicely by the fire , licking her paws and washing her face : and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse , and she 's such a capital one for catching mice  oh !
i beg your pardon ! "
cried poor <name> again , for this time the mouse was bristling all over , and she felt certain that it was really offended , " have i offended you ? "
" offended indeed ! "
cried the mouse , who seemed to be positively trembling with rage , " our family always hated cats !
nasty , low , vulgar things !
do n't talk to me about them any more ! "
" i wo n't indeed ! "
said <name> , in a great hurry to change the conversation , " are you  are you  fond of  dogs ? "
the mouse did not answer , so <name> went on eagerly : " there is such a nice little dog near our house i should like to show you !
a little <unk> terrier , you know , with oh !
such long curly brown hair !
and it 'll fetch things when you throw them , and it 'll sit up and beg for its dinner , and all sorts of things  i ca'n't remember half of them  and it belongs to a farmer , and he says it kills all the rats and  oh dear ! "
said <name> sadly , " i 'm afraid i 've offended it again ! "
for the mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go , and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went .
so she called softly after it : " mouse dear !
do come back again , and we wo n't talk about cats and dogs any more , if you do n't like them ! "
when the mouse heard this , it turned and swam slowly back to her : its face was quite pale , ( with passion , <name> thought , ) and it said in a trembling low voice " let 's get to the shore , and then i 'll tell you my history , and you 'll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs . "
it was high time to go , for the pool was getting quite full of birds and animals that had fallen into it .
there was a duck and a dodo , a <name> and an eaglet , and several other curious creatures .
<name> led the way , and the whole party swam to the shore .
[ illustration ] chapter ii [ illustration ] they were indeed a curious looking party that assembled on the bank  the birds with draggled feathers , the animals with their fur clinging close to them  all dripping wet , cross , and uncomfortable .
the first question of course was , how to get dry : they had a consultation about this , and <name> hardly felt at all surprised at finding herself talking familiarly with the birds , as if she had known them all her life .
indeed , she had quite a long argument with the <name> , who at last turned sulky , and would only say " i am older than you , and must know best , " and this <name> would not admit without knowing how old the <name> was , and as the <name> positively refused to tell its age , there was nothing more to be said .
at last the mouse , who seemed to have some authority among them , called out " sit down , all of you , and attend to me !
i 'll soon make you dry enough ! "
they all sat down at once , shivering , in a large ring , <name> in the middle , with her eyes anxiously fixed on the mouse , for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon .
" ahem ! "
said the mouse , with a <unk> air , " are you all ready ?
this is the driest thing i know .
silence all round , if you please !
" <name> the conqueror , whose cause was favoured by the pope , was soon submitted to by the english , who wanted leaders , and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest .
<name> and <unk> , the earls of <unk> and <unk>  " " ugh ! "
said the <name> with a shiver .
" i beg your pardon ? "
said the mouse , frowning , but very politely , " did you speak ? "
" not i ! "
said the <name> hastily .
" i thought you did , " said the mouse , " i proceed .
<name> and <unk> , the earls of <unk> and <unk> , declared for him ; and even <unk> , the patriotic archbishop of canterbury , found it advisable to go with <name> <unk> to meet <name> and offer him the crown .
<name> 's conduct was at first moderate  how are you getting on now , dear ? "
said the mouse , turning to <name> as it spoke .
" as wet as ever , " said poor <name> , " it does n't seem to dry me at all . "
" in that case , " said the dodo solemnly , rising to his feet , " i move that the meeting adjourn , for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies  " " speak english ! "
said the duck , " i do n't know the meaning of half those long words , and what 's more , i do n't believe you do either ! "
and the duck <unk> a comfortable laugh to itself .
some of the other birds <unk> audibly .
" i only meant to say , " said the dodo in a rather offended tone , " that i know of a house near here , where we could get the young <name> and the rest of the party dried , and then we could listen comfortably to the story which i think you were good enough to promise to tell us , " bowing gravely to the mouse .
the mouse made no objection to this , and the whole party moved along the river bank , ( for the pool had by this time began to flow out of the hall , and the edge of it was fringed with rushes and <unk> , ) in a slow procession , the dodo leading the way .
after a time the dodo became impatient , and , leaving the duck to bring up the rest of the party , moved on at a quicker pace with <name> , the <name> , and the eaglet , and soon brought them to a little cottage , and there they sat snugly by the fire , wrapped up in blankets , until the rest of the party had arrived , and they were all dry again .
then they all sat down again in a large ring on the bank , and begged the mouse to begin his story .
" mine is a long and a sad tale ! "
said the mouse , turning to <name> , and sighing .
" it is a long tail , certainly , " said <name> , looking down with wonder at the mouse 's tail , which was coiled nearly all round the party , " but why do you call it sad ? "
and she went on puzzling about this as the mouse went on speaking , so that her idea of the tale was something like this : we lived beneath the mat warm and snug and fat but one woe , & that was the cat !
to our joys a <unk> , in our eyes a fog , on our hearts a log was the dog !
when the cat 's away , then the mice <name> play , but , alas !
one day , ( so they say ) came the dog and cat , hunting for a rat , crushed the mice all flat ; each one as he sat .
u n d e r n e a t h t h e m a t , m r a w g u n s & t a f & t h i n k ?
o f t h a t !
" you are not attending ! "
said the mouse to <name> severely , " what are you thinking of ? "
" i beg your pardon , " said <name> very humbly , " you had got to the fifth bend , i think ? "
" i had not ! "
cried the mouse , sharply and very angrily .
" a knot ! "
said <name> , always ready to make herself useful , and looking anxiously about her , " oh , do let me help to undo it ! "
" i shall do nothing of the sort ! "
said the mouse , getting up and walking away from the party , " you insult me by talking such nonsense ! "
" i did n't mean it ! "
pleaded poor <name> , " but you 're so easily offended , you know . "
the mouse only growled in reply .
" please come back and finish your story ! "
<name> called after it , and the others all joined in chorus " yes , please do ! "
but the mouse only shook its ears , and walked quickly away , and was soon out of sight .
" what a pity it would n't stay ! "
sighed the <name> , and an old crab took the opportunity of saying to its daughter " ah , my dear !
let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper ! "
" hold your tongue , <name> ! "
said the young crab , a little <unk> , " you're enough to try the <name> of an oyster ! "
" i wish i had our <name> here , i know i do ! "
said <name> aloud , addressing no one in particular , " she 'd soon fetch it back ! "
" and who is <name> , if i might venture to ask the question ? "
said the <name> .
[ illustration ] <name> replied eagerly , for she was always ready to talk about her pet , " <name> 's our cat .
and she 's such a capital one for catching mice , you ca n't think !
and oh !
i wish you could see her after the birds !
why , she 'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it ! "
this answer caused a remarkable sensation among the party : some of the birds hurried off at once ; one old magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully , remarking " i really must be getting home : the night air does not suit my throat , " and a canary called out in a trembling voice to its children " come away from her , my dears , she 's no fit company for you ! "
on various pretexts , they all moved off , and <name> was soon left alone .
[ illustration ] she sat for some while sorrowful and silent , but she was not long before she recovered her spirits , and began talking to herself again as usual : " i do wish some of them had stayed a little longer !
and i was getting to be such friends with them  really the <name> and i were almost like sisters !
and so was that dear little eaglet !
and then the duck and the dodo !
how nicely the duck sang to us as we came along through the water : and if the dodo had n't known the way to that nice little cottage , i don't know when we should have got dry again  " and there is no knowing how long she might have <unk> on in this way , if she had not suddenly caught the sound of pattering feet .
it was the white rabbit , trotting slowly back again , and looking anxiously about it as it went , as if it had lost something , and she heard it muttering to itself " the <unk> !
the <unk> !
oh my dear paws !
oh my fur and whiskers !
she 'll have me executed , as sure as <unk> are <unk> !
where can i have dropped them , i wonder ? "
<name> guessed in a moment that it was looking for the <unk> and the pair of white kid gloves , and she began hunting for them , but they were now nowhere to be seen  everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool , and her walk along the river-bank with its fringe of rushes and <unk> , and the glass table and the little door had vanished .
soon the rabbit noticed <name> , as she stood looking curiously about her , and at once said in a quick angry tone , " why , <name> <name> !
what are you doing out here ?
go home this moment , and look on my <unk> for my gloves and <unk> , and fetch them here , as quick as you can run , do you hear ? "
and <name> was so much frightened that she ran off at once , without saying a word , in the direction which the rabbit had pointed out .
she soon found herself in front of a neat little house , on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name w. rabbit , esq .
she went in , and hurried upstairs , for fear she should meet the real <name> <name> and be turned out of the house before she had found the gloves : she knew that one pair had been lost in the hall , " but of course , " thought <name> , " it has plenty more of them in its house .
how queer it seems to be going messages for a rabbit !
i suppose <name> 'll be sending me messages next ! "
and she began <unk> the sort of things that would happen : " miss <name> !
come here directly and get ready for your walk ! "
" coming in a minute , nurse !
but i 've got to watch this <unk> till <name> comes back , and see that the mouse does n't get out  " " only i do n't think , " <name> went on , " that they 'd let <name> stop in the house , if it began ordering people about like that ! "
[ illustration ] by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room , with a table in the window on which was a looking-glass and , ( as <name> had hoped , ) two or three pairs of <name> white kid gloves : she took up a pair of gloves , and was just going to leave the room , when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass : there was no label on it this time with the words " drink me , " but <unk> she <unk> it and put it to her lips : " i know something interesting is sure to happen , " she said to herself , " whenever i eat or drink anything , so i 'll see what this bottle does .
i do <name> it 'll make me grow larger , for i 'm quite tired of being such a <name> little thing ! "
[ illustration ] it did so indeed , and much sooner than she expected : before she had drunk half the bottle , she found her head pressing against the ceiling , and she stooped to save her neck from being broken , and hastily put down the bottle , saying to herself " that 's quite enough  i <name> i sha'n't grow any more  i wish i had n't drunk so much ! "
[ illustration ] alas !
it was too late : she went on growing and growing , and very soon had to kneel down : in another minute there was not room even for this , and she tried the effect of lying down , with one elbow against the door , and the other arm curled round her head .
still she went on growing , and as a last resource she put one arm out of the window , and one foot up the chimney , and said to herself " now i can do no more  what <name> become of me ? "
luckily for <name> , the little magic bottle had now had its full effect , and she grew no larger ; still it was very uncomfortable , and as there seemed to be no sort of chance of ever getting out of the room again , no wonder she felt unhappy .
" it was much pleasanter at home , " thought poor <name> , " when one was n't always growing larger and smaller , and being ordered about by mice and rabbits  i almost wish i had n't gone down that <unk> , and yet , and yet  it 's rather curious , you know , this sort of life .
i do wonder what can have happened to me !
when i used to read <unk> , i fancied that sort of thing never happened , and now here i am in the middle of one !
there out to be a book written about me , that there ought !
and when i grow up i 'll write one  but i 'm grown up now " said she in a sorrowful tone , " at least there 's no room to grow up any more here . "
[ illustration ] " but then , " thought <name> , " shall i never get any older than i am now ?
that 'll be a comfort , one way  never to be an old woman  but then  always to have lessons to learn !
oh , i shouldn't like that ! "
" oh , you foolish <name> ! "
she said again , " how can you learn lessons in here ?
why , there 's hardly room for you , and no room at all for any <unk> ! "
and so she went on , taking first one side , and then the other , and making quite a conversation of it altogether , but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside , which made her stop to listen .
" <name> <name> !
<name> <name> ! "
said the voice , " fetch me my gloves this moment ! "
then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs : <name> knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her , and she trembled till she shook the house , quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit , and had no reason to be afraid of it .
presently the rabbit came to the door , and tried to open it , but as it opened inwards , and <name> 's elbow was against it , the attempt proved a failure .
<name> heard it say to itself " then i 'll go round and get in at the window . "
" that you <unk> ! "
thought <name> , and , after waiting till she fancied she heard the rabbit , just under the window , she suddenly spread out her hand , and made a snatch in the air .
she did not get hold of anything , but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of breaking glass , from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a <unk> , or something of the sort .
[ illustration ] next came an angry voice  the rabbit 's  " <name> , <name> !
where are you ? "
and then a voice she had never heard before , " <unk> then i 'm here !
digging for apples , anyway , <name> honour ! "
" digging for apples indeed ! "
said the rabbit angrily , " here , come and help me out of this ! "
 sound of more breaking glass .
" now , tell me , <name> , what is that coming out of the window ? "
" <unk> it 's an arm , <name> honour ! "
( he pronounced it " <unk> " . )
" an arm , you goose !
who ever saw an arm that size ?
why , it fills the whole window , do n't you see ? "
" <unk> , it does , <name> honour , but it 's an arm for all that . "
" well , it 's no business there : go and take it away ! "
there was a long silence after this , and <name> could only hear whispers now and then , such as " <unk> i do n't like it , <name> honour , at all at all ! "
" do as i tell you , you coward ! "
and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air .
this time there were two little shrieks , and more breaking glass  " what a number of <unk> there must be ! "
thought <name> , " i wonder what they 'll do next !
as for pulling me out of the window , i only wish they could !
i 'm sure i do n't want to stop in here any longer ! "
she waited for some time without hearing anything more : at last came a rumbling of little <unk> , and the sound of a good many voices all talking together : she made out the words " <unk> the other ladder ?  why , i had n't to bring but one , <name> 's got the other  here , put 'em up at this corner  no , tie 'em together first  they do n't reach high enough yet  oh , they 'll do well enough , do n't be particular  here , <name> !
catch hold of this rope  <name> the roof bear ?  mind that loose slate  oh , it 's coming down !
heads below !  " ( a loud crash ) " now , who did that ?  it was <name> , i fancy  who 's to go down the chimney ?  nay , i sha'n't !
you do it !  that i wo n't then  <name> 's got to go down  here , <name> !
the master says you 've to go down the chimney ! "
" oh , so <name> 's got to come down the chimney , has he ? "
said <name> to herself , " why , they seem to put everything upon <name> !
i would n't be in <name> 's place for a good deal : the fireplace is a pretty tight one , but i think i can kick a little ! "
she <name> her foot as far down the chimney as she could , and waited till she heard a little animal ( she could n't guess what sort it was ) scratching and scrambling in the chimney close above her : then , saying to herself " this is <name> , " she gave one sharp kick , and waited again to see what would happen next .
[ illustration ] the first thing was a general chorus of " there goes <name> ! "
then the rabbit 's voice alone " catch him , you by the hedge ! "
then silence , and then another confusion of voices , " how was it , old fellow ?
what happened to you ?
tell us all about it . "
last came a little feeble squeaking voice , ( " that 's <name> " thought <name> , ) which said " well , i hardly know  i 'm all of a <unk> myself  something comes at me like a <unk> , and the next minute up i goes like a rocket ! "
" and so you did , old fellow ! "
said the other voices .
" we must burn the house down ! "
said the voice of the rabbit , and <name> called out as loud as she could " if you do , i 'll set <name> at you ! "
this caused silence again , and while <name> was thinking " but how can i get <name> here ? "
she found to her great delight that she was getting smaller : very soon she was able to get up out of the uncomfortable position in which she had been lying , and in two or three minutes more she was once more three inches high .
she ran out of the house as quick as she could , and found quite a crowd of little animals waiting outside  guinea-pigs , white mice , squirrels , and " <name> " a little green lizard , that was being supported in the arms of one of the guinea-pigs , while another was giving it something out of a bottle .
they all made a rush at her the moment she appeared , but <name> ran her hardest , and soon found herself in a thick wood .
[ illustration ] chapter iii [ illustration ] " the first thing i 've got to do , " said <name> to herself , as she wandered about in the wood , " is to grow to my right size , and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden .
i think that <name> be the best plan . "
it sounded an excellent plan , no doubt , and very neatly and simply arranged : the only difficulty was , that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it , and while she was peering anxiously among the trees round her , a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry .
an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes , and feebly stretching out one paw , trying to reach her : " poor thing ! "
said <name> in a coaxing tone , and she tried hard to whistle to it , but she was terribly alarmed all the while at the thought that it might be hungry , in which case it would probably devour her in spite of all her coaxing .
hardly knowing what she did , she picked up a little bit of stick , and held it out to the puppy : whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once , and with a yelp of delight rushed at the stick , and made believe to worry it then <name> dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run over , and , the moment she appeared at the other side , the puppy made another dart at the stick , and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold : then <name> , thinking it was very like having a game of play with a <unk> , and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet , ran round the thistle again : then the puppy begin a series of short charges at the stick , running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back , and barking hoarsely all the while , till at last it sat down a good way off , panting , with its tongue hanging out of its mouth , and its great eyes half shut .
this seemed to <name> a good opportunity for making her escape .
she set off at once , and ran till the puppy 's bark sounded quite faint in the distance , and till she was quite tired and out of breath .
" and yet what a dear little puppy it was ! "
said <name> , as she <unk> against a <unk> to rest herself , and fanned herself with her hat .
" i should have liked teaching it tricks , if  if i'd only been the right size to do it !
oh !
i 'd nearly forgotten that i 've got to grow up again !
let me see ; how is it to be managed ?
i suppose i ought to eat or drink something or other , but the great question is what ? "
the great question certainly was , what ?
<name> looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass but could not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat under the circumstances .
there was a large mushroom near her , about the same height as herself , and when she had looked under it , and on both sides of it , and behind it , it occurred to her to look and see what was on the top of it .
she stretched herself up on tiptoe , and peeped over the edge of the mushroom , and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar , which was sitting with its arms folded , quietly smoking a long hookah , and taking not the least notice of her or of anything else .
[ illustration ] for some time they looked at each other in silence : at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth , and languidly addressed her .
" who are you ? "
said the caterpillar .
this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation : <name> replied rather shyly , " i  i hardly know , sir , just at present  at least i know who i was when i got up this morning , but i think i must have been changed several times since that . "
" what do you mean by that ? "
said the caterpillar , " explain yourself ! "
" i ca'n't explain myself , i 'm afraid , sir , " said <name> , " because i 'm not myself , you see . "
" i do n't see , " said the caterpillar .
" i 'm afraid i ca n't put it more clearly , " <name> replied very politely , " for i ca'n't understand it myself , and really to be so many different sizes in one day is very confusing . "
" it is n't , " said the caterpillar .
" well , perhaps you have n't found it so yet , " said <name> , " but when you have to turn into a chrysalis , you know , and then after that into a butterfly , i should think it 'll feel a little queer , do n't you think so ? "
" not a bit , " said the caterpillar .
" all i know is , " said <name> , " it would feel queer to me . "
" you ! "
said the caterpillar contemptuously , " who are you ? "
which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation : <name> felt a little irritated at the caterpillar making such very short remarks , and she <name> herself up and said very gravely " i think you ought to tell me who you are , first . "
" why ? "
said the caterpillar .
here was another puzzling question : and as <name> had no reason ready , and the caterpillar seemed to be in a very bad temper , she turned round and walked away .
" come back ! "
the caterpillar called after her , " i 've something important to say ! "
this sounded promising : <name> turned and came back again .
" keep your temper , " said the caterpillar .
" is that all ? "
said <name> , swallowing down her anger as well as she could .
" no , " said the caterpillar .
<name> thought she might as well wait , as she had nothing else to do , and perhaps after all the caterpillar might tell her something worth hearing .
for some minutes it puffed away at its hookah without speaking , but at last it unfolded its arms , took the hookah out of its mouth again , and said " so you think you're changed , do you ? "
" yes , sir , " said <name> , " i ca'n't remember the things i used to know  i 've tried to say " how doth the little busy <name> " and it came all different ! "
" try and repeat " you are old , father <name> " , " said the caterpillar .
<name> folded her hands , and began : [ illustration ] 1 .
" you are old , father <name> , " the young man said , " and your hair is exceedingly white : and yet you incessantly stand on your head  do you think , at your age , it is right ? "
2 .
" in my youth , " father <name> replied to his son , " i feared it might injure the <name> but now that i 'm perfectly sure i have none , why , i do it again and again . "
[ illustration ] 3 .
" you are old , " said the youth , " as i mentioned before , and have grown most uncommonly fat : yet you turned a <unk> in at the door  pray what is the reason of that ? "
4 .
" in my youth , " said the sage , as he shook his gray locks , " i kept all my limbs very supple , by the use of this <unk> , five shillings the box  allow me to sell you a couple . "
[ illustration ] 5 .
" you are old , " said the youth , " and your jaws are too weak for anything <unk> than suet : yet you eat all the goose , with the bones and the beak  pray , how did you manage to do it ? "
6 .
" in my youth , " said the old man , " i took to the law , and argued each case with my wife , and the muscular strength , which it gave to my jaw , has lasted the rest of my life . "
[ illustration ] 7 .
" you are old , " said the youth ; " one would hardly suppose that your eye was as steady as ever : yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose  what made you so awfully clever ? "
8 .
" i have answered three questions , and that is enough , " said his father , " do n't give yourself airs !
do you think i can listen all day to such stuff ?
be off , or i 'll kick you down stairs ! "
" that is not said right , " said the caterpillar .
" not quite right , i 'm afraid , " said <name> timidly , " some of the words have got altered . "
" it is wrong from beginning to end , " said the caterpillar decidedly , and there was silence for some minutes : the caterpillar was the first to speak .
" what size do you want to be ? "
it asked .
" oh , i 'm not particular as to size , " <name> hastily replied , " only one does n't like changing so often , you know . "
" are you content now ? "
said the caterpillar .
" well , i should like to be a little larger , sir , if you wouldn't mind , " said <name> , " three inches is such a wretched height to be . "
" it is a very good height indeed ! "
said the caterpillar loudly and angrily , rearing itself straight up as it spoke ( it was exactly three inches high ) .
" but i 'm not used to it ! "
pleaded poor <name> in a piteous tone , and she thought to herself " i wish the creatures would n't be so easily offended ! "
" you 'll get used to it in time , " said the caterpillar , and it put the hookah into its mouth , and began smoking again .
this time <name> waited quietly until it chose to speak again : in a few minutes the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth , and got down off the mushroom , and crawled away into the grass , merely remarking as it went ; " the top <name> make you grow taller , and the stalk <name> make you grow shorter . "
" the top of what ?
the stalk of what ? "
thought <name> .
" of the mushroom , " said the caterpillar , just as if she had asked it aloud , and in another moment was out of sight .
<name> remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute , and then picked it and carefully broke it in two , taking the stalk in one hand , and the top in the other .
[ illustration ] " which does the stalk do ? "
she said , and nibbled a little bit of it to try ; the next moment she felt a violent blow on her <name> : it had struck her foot !
she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change , but as she did not shrink any further , and had not dropped the top of the mushroom , she did not give up <name> yet .
there was hardly room to open her mouth , with her <name> pressing against her foot , but she did it at last , and managed to bite off a little bit of the top of the mushroom .
* * * * * " come !
my head 's free at last ! "
said <name> in a tone of delight , which changed into alarm in another moment , when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be seen : she looked down upon an immense length of neck , which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her .
[ illustration ] " what can all that green stuff be ? "
said <name> , " and where have my shoulders got to ?
and oh !
my poor hands !
how is it i ca'n't see you ? "
she was moving them about as she spoke , but no result seemed to follow , except a little rustling among the leaves .
then she tried to bring her head down to her hands , and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in every direction , like a serpent .
she had just succeeded in bending it down in a beautiful <unk> , and was going to dive in among the leaves , which she found to be the tops of the trees of the wood she had been wandering in , when a sharp hiss made her draw back : a large pigeon had flown into her face , and was violently beating her with its wings .
[ illustration ] " serpent ! "
screamed the pigeon .
" i 'm not a serpent ! "
said <name> indignantly , " let me alone ! "
" i 've tried every way ! "
the pigeon said desperately , with a kind of sob : " nothing seems to suit 'em ! "
" i have n't the least idea what you mean , " said <name> .
" i 've tried the roots of trees , and i 've tried banks , and i've tried hedges , " the pigeon went on without attending to her , " but them serpents !
there 's no pleasing 'em ! "
<name> was more and more puzzled , but she thought there was no use in saying anything till the pigeon had finished .
" as if it was n't trouble enough hatching the eggs ! "
said the pigeon , " without being on the look out for serpents , day and night !
why , i have n't had a wink of sleep these three weeks ! "
" i 'm very sorry you 've been annoyed , " said <name> , beginning to see its meaning .
" and just as i 'd taken the highest tree in the wood , " said the pigeon raising its voice to a shriek , " and was just thinking i was free of 'em at last , they must needs come down from the sky !
ugh !
serpent ! "
" but i 'm not a serpent , " said <name> , " i 'm a  i 'm a  " " well !
what are you ? "
said the pigeon , " i see you 're trying to invent something . "
" i  i 'm a little girl , " said <name> , rather doubtfully , as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through .
" a likely story indeed ! "
said the pigeon , " i 've seen a good many of them in my time , but never one with such a neck as yours !
no , you 're a serpent , i know that well enough !
i suppose you 'll tell me next that you never tasted an egg ! "
" i have tasted eggs , certainly , " said <name> , who was a very truthful child , " but indeed i <unk> want any of yours .
i <unk> like them raw . "
" well , be off , then ! "
said the pigeon , and settled down into its nest again .
<name> crouched down among the trees , as well as she could , as her neck kept getting entangled among the branches , and several times she had to stop and <unk> it .
soon she remembered the pieces of mushroom which she still held in her hands , and set to work very carefully , nibbling first at one and then at the other , and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter , until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual size .
it was so long since she had been of the right size that it felt quite strange at first , but she got quite used to it in a minute or two , and began talking to herself as usual : " well !
there's half my plan done now !
how puzzling all these changes are !
i'm never sure what i 'm going to be , from one minute to another !
however , i 've got to my right size again : the next thing is , to get into that beautiful garden  how is that to be done , i wonder ? "
just as she said this , she noticed that one of the trees had a doorway leading right into it .
" that 's very curious ! "
she thought , " but everything 's curious today : i may as well go in . "
and in she went .
once more she found herself in the long hall , and close to the little glass table : " now , i 'll manage better this time " she said to herself , and began by taking the little golden key , and <unk> the door that led into the garden .
then she set to work eating the pieces of mushroom till she was about fifteen inches high : then she walked down the little passage : and then  she found herself at last in the beautiful garden , among the bright <unk> and the cool fountains .
[ illustration ] chapter iv [ illustration ] a large rose tree stood near the entrance of the garden : the roses on it were white , but there were three gardeners at it , busily painting them red .
this <name> thought a very curious thing , and she went near to watch them , and just as she came up she heard one of them say " look out , five !
do n't go splashing paint over me like that ! "
" i could n't help it , " said five in a sulky tone , " seven jogged my elbow . "
on which seven lifted up his head and said " that 's right , five !
always lay the blame on others ! "
" you 'd better not talk ! "
said five , " i heard the <name> say only yesterday she thought of having you beheaded ! "
" what for ? "
said the one who had spoken first .
" that 's not your business , two ! "
said seven .
" yes , it is his business ! "
said five , " and i 'll tell him : it was for bringing in <unk> to the cook instead of potatoes . "
seven flung down his brush , and had just begun " well !
of all the unjust things  " when his eye fell upon <name> , and he stopped suddenly ; the others looked round , and all of them took off their hats and bowed low .
" would you tell me , please , " said <name> timidly , " why you are painting those roses ? "
five and seven looked at two , but said nothing : two began , in a low voice , " why , miss , the fact is , this ought to have been a red rose tree , and we put a white one in by mistake , and if the <name> was to find it out , we should all have our heads cut off .
so , you see , we 're doing our best , before she comes , to  " at this moment five , who had been looking anxiously across the garden called out " the <name> !
the <name> ! "
and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces .
there was a sound of many footsteps , and <name> looked round , eager to see the <name> .
first came ten soldiers carrying clubs ; these were all shaped like the three gardeners , flat and oblong , with their hands and feet at the corners : next the ten courtiers ; these were all ornamented with diamonds , and walked two and two , as the soldiers did .
after these came the <name> children : there were ten of them , and the little dears came jumping merrily along , hand in hand , in couples : they were all ornamented with hearts .
next came the guests , mostly kings and queens , among whom <name> recognised the white rabbit : it was talking in a hurried nervous manner , smiling at everything that was said , and went by without noticing her .
then followed the knave of hearts , carrying the king 's crown on a cushion , and , last of all this grand procession , came the king and <name> of hearts .
[ illustration ] when the procession came opposite to <name> , they all stopped and looked at her , and the <name> said severely " who is this ? "
she said it to the knave of hearts , who only bowed and smiled in reply .
" idiot ! "
said the <name> , turning up her nose , and asked <name> " what 's your name ? "
" my name is <name> , so please your majesty , " said <name> boldly , for she thought to herself " why , they 're only a pack of cards !
i need n't be afraid of them ! "
" who are these ? "
said the <name> , pointing to the three gardeners lying round the rose tree , for , as they were lying on their faces , and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack , she could not tell whether they were gardeners , or soldiers , or courtiers , or three of her own children .
" how should i know ? "
said <name> , surprised at her own courage , " it 's no business of mine . "
the <name> turned crimson with fury , and , after glaring at her for a minute , began in a voice of thunder " off with her  " " nonsense ! "
said <name> , very loudly and decidedly , and the <name> was silent .
the king laid his hand upon her arm , and said timidly " remember , my dear !
she is only a child ! "
the <name> turned angrily away from him , and said to the knave " turn them over ! "
the knave did so , very carefully , with one foot .
" get up ! "
said the <name> , in a shrill loud voice , and the three gardeners instantly jumped up , and began bowing to the king , the <name> , the <name> children , and everybody else .
" leave off that ! "
screamed the <name> , " you make me giddy . "
and then , turning to the rose tree , she went on " what have you been doing here ? "
" may it please your majesty , " said two very humbly , going down on one knee as he spoke , " we were trying  " " i see ! "
said the <name> , who had meantime been examining the roses , " off with their heads ! "
and the procession moved on , three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the three unfortunate gardeners , who ran to <name> for protection .
" you sha'n't be beheaded ! "
said <name> , and she put them into her pocket : the three soldiers marched once round her , looking for them , and then quietly marched off after the others .
" are their heads off ? "
shouted the <name> .
" their heads are gone , " the soldiers shouted in reply , " if it please your majesty ! "
" that 's right ! "
shouted the <name> , " can you play croquet ? "
the soldiers were silent , and looked at <name> , as the question was evidently meant for her .
" yes ! "
shouted <name> at the top of her voice .
" come on then ! "
roared the <name> , and <name> joined the procession , wondering very much what would happen next .
" it 's  it 's a very fine day ! "
said a timid little voice : she was walking by the white rabbit , who was peeping anxiously into her face .
" very , " said <name> , " where 's the <unk> ? "
" hush , hush ! "
said the rabbit in a low voice , " she 'll hear you .
the <name> 's the <unk> : did n't you know that ? "
" no , i did n't , " said <name> , " what of ? "
" <name> of hearts , " said the rabbit in a whisper , putting its mouth close to her ear , " and <unk> of mock turtles . "
" what are they ? "
said <name> , but there was no time for the answer , for they had reached the <unk> , and the game began instantly .
<name> thought she had never seen such a curious <unk> in all her life : it was all in ridges and furrows : the <unk> were live <unk> , the <unk> live ostriches , and the soldiers had to double themselves up , and stand on their feet and hands , to make the arches .
[ illustration ] [ illustration ] the chief difficulty which <name> found at first was to manage her ostrich : she got its body tucked away , comfortably enough , under her arm , with its legs hanging down , but generally , just as she had got its neck straightened out nicely , and was going to give a blow with its head , it would twist itself round , and look up into her face , with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing : and when she had got its head down , and was going to begin again , it was very confusing to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself , and was in the act of crawling away : besides all this , there was generally a ridge or a furrow in her way , wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to , and as the <unk> soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground , <name> soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed .
the players all played at once without waiting for turns , and quarrelled all the while at the tops of their voices , and in a very few minutes the <name> was in a furious passion , and went stamping about and shouting " off with his head ! "
of " off with her head ! "
about once in a minute .
all those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers , who of course had to leave off being arches to do this , so that , by the end of half an hour or so , there were no arches left , and all the players , except the king , the <name> , and <name> , were in custody , and under sentence of execution .
then the <name> left off , quite out of breath , and said to <name> " have you seen the mock turtle ? "
" no , " said <name> , " i do n't even know what a mock turtle is . "
" come on then , " said the <name> , " and it shall tell you its history . "
as they walked off together , <name> heard the king say in a low voice , to the company generally , " you are all pardoned . "
" come , that 's a good thing ! "
thought <name> , who had felt quite grieved at the number of executions which the <name> had ordered .
[ illustration ] they very soon came upon a gryphon , which lay fast asleep in the sun : ( if you do n't know what a gryphon is , look at the picture ) : " up , lazy thing ! "
said the <name> , " and take this young <name> to see the mock turtle , and to hear its history .
i must go back and see after some executions i ordered , " and she walked off , leaving <name> with the gryphon .
<name> did not quite like the look of the creature , but on the whole she thought it quite as safe to stay as to go after that savage <name> : so she waited .
the gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes : then it watched the <name> till she was out of sight : then it chuckled .
" what fun ! "
said the gryphon , half to itself , half to <name> .
" what is the fun ? "
said <name> .
" why , she , " said the gryphon ; " it 's all her fancy , that : they never <unk> nobody , you know : come on ! "
" everybody says 'come on ! '
here , " thought <name> as she walked slowly after the gryphon ; " i never was ordered about so before in all my life  never ! "
they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance , sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock , and , as they came nearer , <name> could here it sighing as if its heart would break .
she pitied it deeply : " what is its sorrow ? "
she asked the gryphon , and the gryphon answered , very nearly in the same words as before , " it 's all its fancy , that : it has n't got no sorrow , you know : come on ! "
[ illustration ] so they went up to the mock turtle , who looked at them with large eyes full of tears , but said nothing .
" this here young <name> " said the gryphon , " wants for to know your history , she do . "
" i 'll tell it , " said the mock turtle , in a deep hollow tone , " sit down , and do n't speak till i 've finished . "
so they sat down , and no one spoke for some minutes : <name> thought to herself " i do n't see how it can ever finish , if it does n't begin , " but she waited patiently .
" once , " said the mock turtle at last , with a deep sigh , " i was a real turtle . "
these words were followed by a very long silence , broken only by an occasional exclamation of " <unk> ! "
from the gryphon , and the constant heavy sobbing of the mock turtle .
<name> was very nearly getting up and saying , " thank you , sir , for your interesting story , " but she could not help thinking there must be more to come , so she sat still and said nothing .
" when we were little , " the mock turtle went on , more calmly , though still sobbing a little now and then , " we went to school in the sea .
the master was an old turtle  we used to call him tortoise  " " why did you call him tortoise , if he was n't one ? "
asked <name> .
" we called him tortoise because he taught us , " said the mock turtle angrily , " really you are very dull ! "
" you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question , " added the gryphon , and then they both sat silent and looked at poor <name> , who felt ready to sink into the earth : at last the gryphon said to the mock turtle , " get on , old fellow !
do n't be all day ! "
and the mock turtle went on in these words : " you may not have lived much under the sea  " ( " i have n't , " said <name> , ) " and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster  " ( <name> began to say " i once tasted  " but hastily checked herself , and said " no , never , " instead , ) " so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a lobster <unk> is ! "
" no , indeed , " said <name> , " what sort of a thing is it ? "
" why , " said the gryphon , " you form into a line along the sea shore  " " two lines ! "
cried the mock turtle , " seals , turtles , salmon , and so on  advance twice  " " each with a lobster as partner ! "
cried the gryphon .
[ illustration ] " of course , " the mock turtle said , " advance twice , set to partners  " " change lobsters , and retire in same order  " interrupted the gryphon .
" then , you know , " continued the mock turtle , " you throw the  " " the lobsters ! "
shouted the gryphon , with a bound into the air .
" as far out to sea as you can  " " swim after them ! "
screamed the gryphon .
" turn a <unk> in the sea ! "
cried the mock turtle , capering wildly about .
" change lobsters again ! "
yelled the gryphon at the top of its voice , " and then  " " that 's all , " said the mock turtle , suddenly dropping its voice , and the two creatures , who had been jumping about like mad things all this time , sat down again very sadly and quietly , and looked at <name> .
" it must be a very pretty dance , " said <name> timidly .
" would you like to see a little of it ? "
said the mock turtle .
" very much indeed , " said <name> .
" come , let 's try the first figure ! "
said the mock turtle to the gryphon , " we can do it without lobsters , you know .
which shall sing ? "
" oh !
you sing ! "
said the gryphon , " i 've forgotten the words . "
[ illustration ] so they began solemnly dancing round and round <name> , every now and then treading on her toes when they came too close , and waving their <unk> to <name> the time , while the mock turtle sang , slowly and sadly , these words : " beneath the waters of the sea are lobsters thick as thick can be  they love to dance with you and me , my own , my gentle salmon ! "
the gryphon joined in singing the chorus , which was : " salmon come up !
salmon go down !
salmon come twist your tail around !
of all the fishes of the sea there 's none so good as salmon ! "
" thank you , " said <name> , feeling very glad that the figure was over .
" shall we try the second figure ? "
said the gryphon , " or would you prefer a song ? "
" oh , a song , please ! "
<name> replied , so eagerly , that the gryphon said , in a rather offended tone , " <unk> !
no accounting for tastes !
sing her <unk> turtle soup ' , <name> you , old fellow ! "
the mock turtle sighed deeply , and began , in a voice sometimes choked with sobs , to sing this : " beautiful soup , so <name> and green , waiting in a hot <unk> !
who for such dainties would not stoop ?
soup of the evening , beautiful soup !
soup of the evening , beautiful soup !
<name>  <unk> <name>  oop !
<name>  <unk> <name>  oop !
<name>  oop of the e  e  evening , beautiful beautiful soup !
" chorus again ! "
cried the gryphon , and the mock turtle had just begun to repeat it , when a cry of " the trial 's beginning ! "
was heard in the distance .
" come on ! "
cried the gryphon , and , taking <name> by the hand , he hurried off , without waiting for the end of the song .
" what trial is it ? "
panted <name> as she ran , but the gryphon only answered " come on ! "
and ran the faster , and more and more faintly came , borne on the breeze that followed them , the melancholy words : " <name>  oop of the e  e  evening , beautiful beautiful soup ! "
the king and <name> were seated on their throne when they arrived , with a great crowd assembled around them : the knave was in custody : and before the king stood the white rabbit , with a trumpet in one hand , and a scroll of parchment in the other .
" herald !
read the accusation ! "
said the king .
on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet , and then unrolled the parchment scroll , and read as follows : [ illustration ] " the <name> of hearts she made some tarts all on a summer day : the knave of hearts he stole those tarts , and took them quite away ! "
[ illustration ] " now for the evidence , " said the king , " and then the sentence . "
" no ! "
said the <name> , " first the sentence , and then the evidence ! "
" nonsense ! "
cried <name> , so loudly that everybody jumped , " the idea of having the sentence first ! "
" hold your tongue ! "
said the <name> .
" i wo n't ! "
said <name> , " you 're nothing but a pack of cards !
who cares for you ? "
at this the whole pack rose up into the air , and came flying down upon her : she gave a little scream of fright , and tried to beat them off , and found herself lying on the bank , with her head in the lap of her sister , who was gently brushing away some leaves that had fluttered down from the trees on to her face .
" wake up !
<name> dear ! "
said her sister , " what a nice long sleep you 've had ! "
" oh , i 've had such a curious dream ! "
said <name> , and she told her sister all her adventures under ground , as you have read them , and when she had finished , her sister kissed her and said " it was a curious dream , dear , certainly !
but now run in to your tea : it 's getting late . "
so <name> ran off , thinking while she ran ( as well she might ) what a wonderful dream it had been .
* * * * * but her sister sat there some while longer , watching the setting sun , and thinking of little <name> and her adventures , till she too began dreaming after a fashion , and this was her dream : she saw an ancient city , and a quiet river winding near it along the plain , and up the stream went slowly gliding a boat with a <name> party of children on board  she could hear their voices and laughter like music over the water  and among them was another little <name> , who sat listening with bright eager eyes to a tale that was being told , and she listened for the words of the tale , and lo !
it was the dream of her own little sister .
so the boat wound slowly along , beneath the bright <unk> , with its <name> crew and its music of voices and laughter , till it passed round one of the many <unk> of the stream , and she saw it no more .
then she thought , ( in a dream within the dream , as it were , ) how this same little <name> would , in the <unk> , be herself a grown woman : and how she would keep , through her <unk> years , the simple and loving heart of her childhood : and how she would gather around her other little children , and make their eyes bright and eager with many a wonderful tale , perhaps even with these very adventures of the little <name> of <unk> : and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows , and find a pleasure in all their simple joys , remembering her own <unk> , and the happy summer days .
[ illustration ] happy summer days .
the end .
* * * * * <unk> the profits , if any , of this book <name> be given to children's hospitals and convalescent homes for sick children ; and the accounts , down to <name> 30 in each year , <name> be published in the st. <name> 's gazette , on the second tuesday of the following <unk> <unk>  the thought , so prettily expressed by the little boy , is also to be found in longfellow 's " hiawatha , " where he appeals to those who believe " that the feeble hands and helpless ,  groping blindly in the darkness , touch god 's right hand in that darkness , and are lifted up and strengthened . "
* * * * * " who <name> riddle me the how and the why ? "
so questions one of england 's sweetest singers .
the " how ? "
has already been told , after a fashion , in the verses <unk> to " <name> in wonderland " ; and some other memories of that happy summer day are set down , for those who care to see them , in this little book  the germ that was to grow into the published volume .
but the " why ? "
can not , and need not , be put into words .
those for whom a child 's mind is a sealed book , and who see no divinity in a child 's smile , would read such words in vain : while for any one that has ever loved one true child , no words are needed .
for he <name> have known the awe that falls on one in the presence of a spirit fresh from god 's hands , on whom no shadow of sin , and but the outermost fringe of the shadow of sorrow , has yet fallen : he <name> have felt the bitter contrast between the haunting selfishness that spoils his best deeds and the life that is but an overflowing love  for i think a child's first attitude to the world is a simple love for all living things : and he <name> have learned that the best work a man can do is when he works for love 's sake only , with no thought of name , or gain , or earthly reward .
no deed of ours , i suppose , on this side the grave , is really unselfish : yet if one can put forth all one 's powers in a task where nothing of reward is hoped for but a little child's whispered thanks , and the airy touch of a little child 's pure lips , one seems to come somewhere near to <unk> there was no idea of publication in my mind when i wrote this little book : that was wholly an afterthought , pressed on me by the " perhaps too partial friends " who always have to bear the blame when a writer rushes into print : and i can truly say that no praise of theirs has ever given me one hundredth part of the pleasure it has been to think of the sick children in hospitals ( where it has been a delight to me to send copies ) forgetting , for a few bright hours , their pain and weariness  perhaps thinking lovingly of the unknown writer of the tale  perhaps even putting up a childish prayer ( and oh , how much it needs ! )
for one who can but dimly <name> to stand , some day , not quite out of sight of those pure young faces , before the great white throne .
" i am very sure , " writes a <unk> at a home for sick children , " that there <name> be many loving <name> prayers for you on <name> morning from the children. " i would like to quote further from her letters , as <unk> a suggestion that may perhaps thus come to the notice of some one able and willing to <name> it <unk> " i want you to send me one of your <name> greetings for a very dear child who is dying at our home .
she is just fading away , and <unk> ' has brightened some of the weary hours in her illness , and i know that letter would be such a delight to her  especially if you would put <unk> ' at the top , and she could know you had sent it for her. she knows you , and would so value it ... . she suffers so much that i long for what i know would so please her . "
... " thank you very much for sending me the letter , and for writing <name> 's name ... .
i am quite sure that all these children <name> say a loving prayer for the <unk> ' on <name> day : and i am sure the letter <name> help the little ones to the real <name> <name> .
how i do wish that you , who have won the hearts and confidence of so many children , would do for them what is so very near my heart , and yet what no one <name> do , viz .
write a book for children about god and themselves , which is not <unk> , and which begins at the right end , about religion , to make them see what it really is .
i get quite miserable very often over the children i come across : hardly any of them have an idea of really knowing that god loves them , or of loving and confiding in him .
they <name> love and trust me , and be sure that i want them to be happy , and <name> not let them suffer more than is necessary : but as for going to him in the same way , they would never think of it .
they are dreadfully afraid of him , if they think of him at all , which they generally only do when they have been naughty , and they look on all connected with him as very grave and dull : and , when they are full of fun and thoroughly happy , i am sure they unconsciously <name> he is not looking .
i am sure i do n't wonder they think of him in this way , for people never talk of him in connection with what makes their little lives the brightest .
if they are naughty , people put on solemn faces , and say he is very angry or shocked , or something which <unk> them : and , for the rest , he is talked about only in a way that makes them think of church and having to be quiet .
as for being taught that all <name> and all gladness and brightness is his <name>  that he is wearying for them to be happy , and is not hard and stern , but always doing things to make their days brighter , and caring for them so tenderly , and wanting them to run to him with all their little joys and sorrows , they are not taught that .
i do so long to make them trust him as they trust us , to feel that he <name> 'take their part ' as they do with us in their little woes , and to go to him in their plays and enjoyments and not only when they say their prayers .
i was quite grateful to one little <name> , a short time ago , who said to his mother 'when i am in bed , i put out my hand to see if i can feel <name> and my <name> .
i thought perhaps in the dark they 'd touch me , but they never have yet . '
i do so want them to want to go to him , and to feel how , if he is there , it must be <unk> " let me add  for i feel i have drifted into far too serious a vein for a preface to a <unk>  the deliciously <unk> remark of a very dear <unk> , whom i asked , after an acquaintance of two or three days , if she had read <unk> ' and the <unk> . '
" oh yes , " she replied readily , " i 've read both of them !
and i think " ( this more slowly and thoughtfully ) " i think <unk> the looking-glass ' is more stupid than <unk> 's adventures . '
don't you think so ? "
but this was a question i felt it would be hardly discreet for me to enter <unk> <name> <unk> dec. 1886 .
* * * * * an <name> greeting to every child who loves " <name> . "
dear child , please to fancy , if you can , that you are reading a real letter , from a real friend whom you have seen , and whose voice you can seem to yourself to hear wishing you , as i do now with all my heart , a happy <unk> do you know that delicious dreamy feeling when one first wakes on a summer morning , with the <unk> of birds in the air , and the fresh breeze coming in at the open window  when , lying lazily with eyes half shut , one sees as in a dream green boughs waving , or waters rippling in a golden light ?
it is a pleasure very near to sadness , bringing tears to one 's eyes like a beautiful picture or poem .
and is not that a mother 's gentle hand that <unk> your curtains , and a mother 's sweet voice that summons you to rise ?
to rise and forget , in the bright sunlight , the ugly dreams that frightened you so when all was dark  to rise and enjoy another happy day , first kneeling to thank that unseen friend , who sends you the beautiful sun ?
are these strange words from a writer of such tales as " <name> " ?
and is this a strange letter to find in a book of nonsense ?
it may be so .
some perhaps may blame me for thus mixing together things grave and <name> ; others may smile and think it odd that any one should speak of solemn things at all , except in church and on a <name> : but i think  nay , i am sure  that some children <name> read this gently and lovingly , and in the spirit in which i have written it. for i do not believe god means us thus to divide life into two halves  to wear a grave face on <name> , and to think it <unk> to even so much as mention him on a week-day .
do you think he cares to see only kneeling figures , and to hear only tones of prayer  and that he does not also love to see the lambs leaping in the sunlight , and to hear the <name> voices of the children , as they roll among the hay ?
surely their innocent laughter is as sweet in his ears as the grandest anthem that ever rolled up from the " dim religious light " of some solemn cathedral ?  and if i have written anything to add to those stores of innocent and healthy amusement that are laid up in books for the children i love so well , it is surely something i may <name> to look back upon without shame and sorrow ( as how much of life must then be recalled ! )
when my turn comes to walk through the valley of <unk> this <name> sun <name> rise on you , dear child , feeling your " life in every limb , " and eager to rush out into the fresh morning air  and many an <unk> <name> come and go , before it finds you feeble and gray-headed , creeping wearily out to <unk> once more in the sunlight  but it is good , even now , to think sometimes of that great morning when the " sun of righteousness shall arise with healing in his wings .
"  surely your gladness need not be the less for the thought that you <name> one day see a brighter <name> than this  when lovelier sights <name> meet your eyes than any waving trees or rippling waters  when <unk> shall <unk> your curtains , and sweeter tones than ever loving mother breathed shall wake you to a new and glorious day  and when all the sadness , and the sin , that darkened life on this little earth , shall be forgotten like the dreams of a night that is past !  your affectionate friend , <name> <name> .

<name> dear , if fairies may for a moment lay aside cunning tricks and <unk> play , 't is at happy <unk> .
we have heard the children say  gentle children , whom we love  long ago , on christmas day , came a message from above .
still , as <unk> comes round , they remember it again  <name> still the joyful sound " peace on earth , good-will to men ! "
yet the hearts must childlike be where such heavenly guests abide : unto children , in their glee , all the year is <unk> !

contents .
<name> .
on <unk> 5 how to begin a letter 9 how to go on with a letter 12 how to end a letter 21 on <unk> correspondence 23 § 1 .
on <unk> some american writer has said " the snakes in this district may be divided into one species  the venomous . "
the same principle applies here .
<unk> may be divided into one species , the " wonderland . "
imitations of it <name> soon appear , no doubt : but they can not include the two pictorial surprises , which are copyright .
you do n't see why i call them <unk> ' ?
well , take the case in your left-hand , and regard it attentively .
you see <name> nursing the <unk> baby ?
( an entirely new combination , by the way : it does n't occur in the book . )
now , with your right thumb and forefinger , lay hold of the little book , and suddenly pull it out .
the baby has turned into a pig !  if that does n't surprise you , why , i suppose you would n't be surprised if your own mother-in-law suddenly turned into a <unk> !
this case is not intended to <name> about in your pocket .
far from it .
people seldom want any other stamps , on an emergency , than <unk> for letters , <unk> for telegrams , and a bit of <unk> for cut fingers ( it makes capital <unk> , and <name> stand three or four <unk> , cautiously conducted ) : and all these are easily carried in a purse or pocketbook .
no , this is meant to haunt your <unk> , or wherever you keep your <unk> .
what made me invent it was the constantly wanting stamps of other values , for foreign letters , parcel post , & c. , and finding it very <unk> to get at the kind i wanted in a hurry .
since i have possessed a " wonderland stamp case " , life has been bright and peaceful , and i have used no other .
i believe the queen's <unk> uses no other .
each of the pockets <name> hold 6 stamps , comfortably .
i would recommend you to arrange the 6 , before putting them in , something like a bouquet , making them <name> to the right and to the left alternately : thus there <name> always be a free corner to get hold of , so as to take them out , quickly and easily , one by one : otherwise you <name> find them apt to come out two or three at a time .
according to my experience , the <unk> , <unk> , and 1_s. stamps are hardly ever wanted , though i have constantly to <unk> all the other pockets .
if your experience agrees with mine , you may find it convenient to keep only a couple ( say ) of each of these 3 kinds , in the 1_s. pocket , and to fill the other 2 pockets with extra <unk> stamps .
§ 2 .
how to begin a letter. if the letter is to be in answer to another , begin by getting out that other letter and reading it through , in order to refresh your memory , as to what it is you have to answer , and as to your correspondent 's present address ( otherwise you <name> be sending your letter to his regular address in london , though he has been careful in writing to give you his <unk> address in full ) .
next , address and stamp the envelope .
" what !
before writing the letter ? "
most certainly .
and i 'll tell you what <name> happen if you do n't .
you <name> go on writing till the last moment , and just in the middle of the last sentence , you <name> become aware that <unk> 's up ! '
then comes the hurried <unk>  the <unk> signature  the <unk> envelope , which comes open in the post  the address , a mere <unk>  the horrible discovery that you 've forgotten to <unk> your <unk>  the frantic appeal , to every one in the house , to lend you a stamp  the headlong rush to the post office , arriving , hot and gasping , just after the box has closed  and finally , a week afterwards , the return of the letter , from the <unk> office , marked " address illegible " !
next , put your own address , in full , at the top of the <unk> .
it is an aggravating thing   i speak from bitter experience   when a friend , staying at some new address , heads his letter " dover , " simply , assuming that you can get the rest of the address from his previous letter , which perhaps you have destroyed .
next , put the date in full .
it is another aggravating thing , when you wish , years afterwards , to arrange a series of letters , to find them dated " feb. 17 " , " aug. 2 " , without any year to guide you as to which comes first .
and never , never , dear madam ( n.b .
this remark is addressed to ladies only : no man would ever do such a thing ) , put " wednesday " , simply , as the date !
" that way madness <unk> " § 3 .
how to go on with a letter. here is a golden rule to begin with .
write <unk> the average temper of the human race would be perceptibly sweetened , if everybody obeyed this rule !
a great deal of the bad writing in the world comes simply from writing too quickly .
of course you reply , " i do it to save time " .
a very good object , no doubt : but what right have you to do it at your friend 's expense ?
is n't his time as valuable as yours ?
years ago , i used to receive letters from a friend   and very interesting letters too   written in one of the most atrocious hands ever invented .
it generally took me about a week to read one of his letters !
i used to <name> it about in my pocket , and take it out at leisure times , to puzzle over the riddles which composed it   holding it in different positions , and at different distances , till at last the meaning of some hopeless scrawl would flash upon me , when i at once wrote down the english under it ; and , when several had been thus guessed , the <unk> would help one with the others , till at last the whole series of hieroglyphics was <unk> .
if all one 's friends wrote like that , life would be entirely spent in reading their letters !
this rule applies , specially , to names of people or places   and most specially to foreign names .
i got a letter once , containing some russian names , written in the same hasty scramble in which people often write " yours sincerely " .
the <unk> , of course , did n't help in the least : and one spelling was just as likely as another , so far as i knew : it was necessary to write and tell my friend that i could n't read any of them !
my second rule is , do n't fill more than a <name> and a half with apologies for not having written sooner !
the best subject , to begin with , is your friend 's last letter .
write with the letter open before you .
answer his questions , and make any remarks his letter suggests .
then go on to what you want to say yourself .
this arrangement is more courteous , and pleasanter for the reader , than to fill the letter with your own invaluable remarks , and then hastily answer your friend 's questions in a postscript .
your friend is much more likely to enjoy your wit , after his own anxiety for information has been satisfied .
in referring to anything your friend has said in his letter , it is best to quote the exact words , and not to give a summary of them in your words .
<unk> impression , of what b has said , expressed in <unk> words , <name> never convey to b the meaning of his own words .
this is specially necessary when some point has arisen as to which the two correspondents do not quite agree .
there ought to be no opening for such writing as " you are quite mistaken in thinking i said so-and-so .
it was not in the least my meaning , & c. , & c. " , which tends to make a correspondence last for a lifetime .
a few more rules may <unk> be given here , for correspondence that has unfortunately become <unk> .
one is , do n't repeat yourself .
when once you have said your say , fully and clearly , on a certain point , and have failed to convince your friend , drop that subject : to repeat your arguments , all over again , <name> simply lead to his doing the same ; and so you <name> go on , like a circulating <unk> .
did you ever know a circulating <unk> come to an end ?  another rule is , when you have written a letter that you feel may possibly irritate your friend , however necessary you may have felt it to so express yourself , put it aside till the next day .
then read it over again , and fancy it addressed to yourself .
this <name> often lead to your writing it all over again , taking out a lot of the vinegar and pepper , and putting in <name> instead , and thus making a much more <unk> dish of it !
if , when you have done your best to write <unk> , you still feel that it <name> probably lead to further controversy , keep a copy of it .
there is very little use , months afterwards , in pleading " i am almost sure i never expressed myself as you say : to the best of my recollection i said so-and-so " .
far better to be able to write " i did not express myself so : these are the words i used . "
my fifth rule is , if your friend makes a severe remark , either leave it unnoticed , or make your reply distinctly less severe : and if he makes a friendly remark , tending towards <unk> up ' the little difference that has arisen between you , let your reply be distinctly more friendly .
if , in picking a quarrel , each party declined to go more than <unk> of the way , and if , in making friends , each was ready to go <unk> of the way  why , there would be more <unk> than quarrels !
which is like the irishman 's remonstrance to his <unk> daughter  " <unk> , you 're always goin ' out !
you go out three times , for wanst that you come in ! "
my sixth rule ( and my last remark about <unk> correspondence ) is , do n't try to have the last word !
how many a controversy would be nipped in the <name> , if each was anxious to let the other have the last word !
never mind how telling a rejoinder you leave <unk> : never mind your friend 's supposing that you are silent from lack of anything to say : let the thing drop , as soon as it is possible without discourtesy : remember <unk> is <unk> , but silence is golden ' !
( n.b.  if you are a gentleman , and your friend a <name> , this rule is superfluous : you wo n't get the last word ! )
my seventh rule is , if it should ever occur to you to write , <unk> , in <unk> of your friend , be sure you exaggerate enough to make the jesting obvious : a word spoken in jest , but taken as <name> , may lead to very serious consequences .
i have known it to lead to the <unk> of a friendship .
suppose , for instance , you wish to remind your friend of a sovereign you have lent him , which he has forgotten to repay  you might quite mean the words " i mention it , as you seem to have a conveniently bad memory for debts " , in jest : yet there would be nothing to wonder at if he took offence at that way of putting it .
but , suppose you wrote " long observation of your career , as a pickpocket and a burglar , has convinced me that my one lingering <name> , for recovering that sovereign i lent you , is to say <unk> up , or i 'll summons <name> ! ' "
he would indeed be a matter-of-fact friend if he took that as seriously meant !
my eighth rule .
when you say , in your letter , " i enclose cheque for <unk> " , or " i enclose <name> 's letter for you to see " , leave off writing for a moment  go and get the document referred to  and put it into the envelope .
otherwise , you are pretty certain to find it lying about , after the post has gone !
my ninth rule .
when you get to the end of a <unk> , and find you have more to say , take another piece of paper  a whole sheet , or a scrap , as the case may demand : but , whatever you do , do n't cross !
remember the old proverb <unk> makes cross reading ' .
" the old proverb ? "
you say , <unk> .
" how old ? "
well , not so very ancient , i must confess .
in fact , i 'm afraid i invented it while writing this paragraph !
still , you know , 'old ' is a comparative term .
i think you would be quite justified in addressing a chicken , just out of the shell , as " old boy !
" , when compared with another chicken , that was only <unk> !
§ 4 .
how to end a letter. if doubtful whether to end with <unk> faithfully ' , or <unk> truly ' , or <unk> most truly ' , & c. ( there are at least a dozen varieties , before you reach <unk> affectionately ' ) , refer to your correspondent 's last letter , and make your <unk> at least as friendly as his ; in fact , even if a shade more friendly , it <name> do no harm !
a postscript is a very useful invention : but it is not meant ( as so many ladies suppose ) to contain the real gist of the letter : it serves rather to throw into the shade any little matter we do not wish to make a fuss about .
for example , your friend had promised to execute a commission for you in town , but forgot it , thereby putting you to great inconvenience : and he now writes to apologize for his negligence .
it would be cruel , and <unk> crushing , to make it the main subject of your reply .
how much more gracefully it comes in thus !
" p.s .
do n't distress yourself any more about having omitted that little matter in town .
i wo n't deny that it did put my plans out a little , at the time : but it 's all right now .
i often forget things , myself : and 'those who live in <unk> , mustn't throw stones ' , you know ! "
when you take your letters to the post , <name> them in your hand .
if you put them in your pocket you <name> take a long <unk> ( i speak from experience ) , passing the post-office twice , going and returning , and , when you get home , <name> find them still in your pocket .
§ 5 .
on <unk> <unk> let me recommend you to keep a record of letters received and sent .
i have kept one for many years , and have found it of the greatest possible service , in many ways : it secures my answering letters , however long they have to wait ; it enables me to refer , for my own guidance , to the details of previous correspondence , though the actual letters may have been destroyed long ago ; and , most valuable feature of all , if any difficulty arises , years afterwards , in connection with a <unk> correspondence , it enables me to say , with confidence , " i did not tell you that he was 'an invaluable servant in every way ' , and that you couldn't <unk> him too much ' .
i have a <unk> of my letter .
what i said was 'he is a valuable servant in many ways , but don't trust him too much ' .
so , if he 's cheated you , you really must not hold me responsible for it ! "
i <name> now give you a few simple rules for making , and keeping , a <unk> .
get a blank book , containing ( say ) 200 leaves , about 4 inches wide and 7 high .
it should be well fastened into its cover , as it <name> have to be opened and shut hundreds of times .
have a line ruled , in red ink , down each margin of every <name> , an inch off the edge ( the margin should be wide enough to contain a number of 5 digits , easily : i manage with a 3/4 inch margin : but , unless you write very small you <name> find an inch more comfortable ) .
write a <unk> of each letter , received or sent , in <unk> order .
let the entry of a <unk> ' letter reach from the left-hand edge to the right-hand marginal line ; and the entry of a <unk> ' letter from the left-hand marginal line to the right-hand edge .
thus the two kinds <name> be quite distinct , and you can easily hunt through the <unk> ' letters by themselves , without being bothered with the <unk> ' letters ; and vice <unk> .
use the right-hand pages only : and , when you come to the end of the book , turn it upside-down , and begin at the other end , still using right-hand pages .
you <name> find this much more comfortable than using left-hand pages .
you <name> find it convenient to write , at the top of every sheet of a <unk> ' letter , its <unk> in full .
i <name> now give a few ( ideal ) specimen pages of my <unk> , and make a few remarks on them : after which i think you <name> find it easy enough to manage one for yourself .

| ||    +                  +     | | | | i begin each <name> by putting , at the top left-hand corner , the next <unk> i am going to use , in full ( the last 3 digits of each <unk> are enough afterwards ) ; and i put the date of the year , at the top , in the centre .
i begin each entry with the last 3 digits of the <unk> , enclosed in an oval ( this is difficult to reproduce in print , so i have put <unk> here ) .
then , for the first entry in each <name> , i put the day of the month and the day of the week : afterwards , 'do . '
is enough for the <unk> , till it changes : i do not repeat the week-day .
next , if the entry is not a letter , i put a symbol for <unk> ' ( see nos .
243 , 245 ) or <unk> ' ( see nos .
230 , 231 ) as the case may be .
next , the name of the person , <unk> ( indicated here by italics ) .
if an entry needs special further attention , i put [  at the end : and , when it has been attended to , i fill in the appropriate symbol , <unk> .
in no .
218 , it showed that the <name> had to be paid ; in no .
222 , that an answer was really needed ( the <unk> ' means <unk> to ' ) ; in no .
234 , that i owed the old <name> a visit ; in no .
235 , that the item had to be entered in my account book ; in no .
236 , that i must not forget to write ; in no .
239 , that the address had to be entered in my <unk> ; in no .
245 , that the book had to be returned .
i give each entry the space of 2 lines , whether it fills them or not , in order to have room for references .
and , at the foot of each <name> i leave 2 or 3 lines blank ( often useful afterwards for entering omitted letters ) and miss one or 2 <name> before i begin the next <name> .
at any odd moments of leisure , i 'make up ' the <unk> , in various ways , as follows :  ( 1 ) i draw a second line , at the right-hand end of the <unk> entries , and at the left-hand end of the <unk> ' entries .
this i usually do pretty well 'up to date ' .
in my register the first line is red , the second blue : here i distinguish them by making the first thin , and the second thick .
( 2 ) beginning with the last entry , and going backwards , i read over the names till i recognise one as having occurred already : i then link the two entries together , by giving the one , that comes first in <unk> order , a <unk> ' ( see nos .
217 , 225 ) .
i do not keep this <unk> ' , but leave it till there are 4 or 5 pages to be done .
i work back till i come among entries that are all supplied with <unk> ' , when i once more glance through the last few pages , to see if there are any entries not yet supplied with <unk> : their predecessors may need a special search .
if an entry is connected , in subject , with another under a different name , i link them by <unk> , distinguished from the head and <unk> by being written further from the marginal line ( see no .
229 ) .
when 2 consecutive entries have the same name , and are both of the same kind ( i.e .
both <unk> ' or both <unk> ' ) i <unk> them ( see nos .
242 , 243 ) ; if of different kinds , i link them with the symbol used for nos .
219 , 220 .
( 3 ) beginning at the earliest entry not yet done with , and going forwards , i cross out every entry that has got a head and <unk> , and is done with , by continuing the extra line through it ( see nos .
221 , 223 , 225 ) .
thus , wherever a break occurs in this extra line , it shows there is some matter still needing attention .
i do not keep this anything like 'up to date ' , but leave it till there are 30 or 40 pages to look through at a time .
when the first <name> in the volume is thus completely crossed out , i put a <name> at the foot of the <name> to indicate this ; and so with pages 2 , 3 , & c. hence , whenever i do this part of the <unk> up ' , i need not begin at the beginning of the volume , but only at the earliest <name> that has not got this <name> .
all this looks very complicated , when stated at full length : but you <name> find it perfectly simple , when you have had a little practice , and <name> come to regard the <unk> ' as a pleasant occupation for a rainy day , or at any time that you feel disinclined for more severe mental work .
in the game of whist , <unk> gives us one golden rule , " when in doubt , win the trick "  i find that rule admirable for real life : when in doubt what to do , i <unk> ' my <unk> !

feeding the mind by <name> <name> with a <unk> note by <name> h. <unk> london <unk> & <unk> 1907 [ all rights reserved ] note the history of this little <name> from the pen of <name> <name> may soon be told .
it was in october of the year 1884 that he came on a visit to a certain <unk> in <unk> , where he had promised , on the score of friendship , to do what was for him a most unusual favour  to give a lecture before a public <unk> the writer well remembers his nervous , <unk> manner as he stood before the little room full of simple people , few of whom had any idea of the world-wide reputation of that shy , slight figure before them. when the lecture was over , he handed the manuscript to me , saying : 'do what you like with it .
' the one for whose sake he did this kindness was not long after called <unk> the silent land . '
so the <unk> ms. , in his customary <name> ink , has been treasured for more than twenty years , only now and then being read over at <unk> to a friend or two by the study fire , always to meet with the same welcome and glad acknowledgment that here was a genuine , though little flame that could not have belonged to any other source but that which all the world knew in <name> in wonderland and through the looking-glass .
there may be , perhaps , many others who , gathering round a <name> fire , <name> be glad to read words , however few , from that bright source , and whose memories <name> respond to the fresh touch of that cherished <unk> it remains to add but one or two more associations that cling to it and make the remembrance more vivid still .
while <name> <name> was staying in the house , there came to call a certain genial and by no means shy <name> , who , without realizing what he was doing , proceeded , in the presence of other callers , to make some remark identifying mr. <unk> as the author of his <unk> there followed an immense explosion immediately on the <unk> departure , with a pathetic and serious request that , if there were any risk of a repetition of the call , due warning might be given , and the retreat <unk> probably not many readers of the immortal <name> have ever seen the curious little whimsical paper called eight or nine wise words about letter-writing which their author had printed and used to send to his acquaintance , accompanied by a small case for <unk> it consists of forty pages , and is published by <unk> and son , oxford ; and these are the contents :  <name> on <unk> , 5 how to begin a letter , 8 how to go on with a letter , 11 how to end a letter , 20 on <unk> correspondence , 22 in this little <unk> , also , there are the same sparkles of wit which <unk> that nimble pen , as , for example , under 'how to begin a letter ' : ' " and never , never , dear madam " ( n.b.  this remark is addressed to ladies only .
no man would ever do such a thing ) , " put <unk> ' simply as the date !
" that way madness lies !  " ' from section 3 : 'how to go on with a letter . '
 'a great deal of the bad writing in the world comes simply from writing too quickly .
of course you reply , " i do it to save time . "
a very good object , no doubt , but what right have you to do it at your friend 's expense ?
is n't his time as valuable as yours ?
years ago i used to receive letters from a friend  and very interesting letters too  written in one of the most atrocious hands ever invented .
it generally took me about a week to read one of his letters !
i used to <name> it about in my pocket and take it out at leisure times , to puzzle over the riddles which composed it  holding it in different positions and at different distances , till at last the meaning of some hopeless scrawl would flash upon me , when i at once wrote down the english under it .
and when several had been thus guessed the <unk> would help one with the others , till at last the whole series of hieroglyphics was <unk> .
if all one 's friends wrote like that , life would be entirely spent in reading their letters ! '
rule for correspondence that has , unfortunately , become <unk> .
<unk> n't repeat <unk>  when once you have had your say fully and clearly on a certain point , and have failed to convince your friend , drop that subject .
to repeat your arguments all over again , <name> simply lead to his doing the same , and so you <name> go on like a circulating <unk> .
did you ever know a circulating <unk> come to an end ? ' * * * * * rule 5.  'if your friend makes a severe remark , either leave it unnoticed , or make your reply distinctly less severe ; and if he makes a friendly remark , tending towards making up the little difference that has arisen between you , let your reply be distinctly more friendly .
* * * * * 'if , in picking a quarrel , each party declined to go more than <unk> of the way , and if in making friends , each was ready to go <unk> of the way  why , there would be more <unk> than quarrels !
which is like the irishman 's remonstrance to his <unk> daughter : " <unk> , you 're always goin ' out !
you go out three times for wanst that you come in ! " '
* * * * * rule <unk>  'do n't try to get the last word ... .
( n.b.  if you are a gentleman and your friend a <name> , this rule is superfluous : you wo n't get the last word !  ) ' * * * * * let the last word to-day be part of another rule , which gives a glimpse into that gentle heart :  'when you have written a letter that you feel may possibly irritate your friend , however necessary you may have felt it to so express yourself , put it aside till the next day .
then read it over again , and fancy it addressed to yourself .
this <name> often lead to your writing it all over again , taking out a lot of the vinegar and pepper and putting in <name> instead , and thus making a much more <unk> dish of it ! '

w. h. d. november <unk> feeding the mind breakfast , dinner , tea ; in extreme cases , breakfast , luncheon , dinner , tea , supper , and a glass of something hot at bedtime .
what care we take about feeding the lucky body !
which of us does as much for his mind ?
and what causes the difference ?
is the body so much the more important of the two ?
by no means : but life depends on the body being fed , whereas we can continue to exist as animals ( scarcely as men ) though the mind be utterly starved and neglected .
therefore nature provides that , in case of serious neglect of the body , such terrible consequences of discomfort and pain shall ensue , as <name> soon bring us back to a sense of our duty : and some of the functions necessary to life she does for us altogether , leaving us no choice in the matter .
it would fare but ill with many of us if we were left to superintend our own digestion and circulation .
<unk> me ! '
one would cry , 'i forgot to wind up my heart this morning !
to think that it has been standing still for the last three hours ! '
'i ca n't walk with you this afternoon , ' a friend would say , 'as i have no less than eleven dinners to digest .
i had to let them stand over from last week , being so busy , and my doctor says he <name> not answer for the consequences if i wait any longer ! '
well , it is , i say , for us that the consequences of neglecting the body can be clearly seen and felt ; and it might be well for some if the mind were equally visible and tangible  if we could take it , say , to the doctor , and have its pulse felt .
'why , what have you been doing with this mind lately ?
how have you fed it ?
it looks pale , and the pulse is very slow . '
'well , doctor , it has not had much regular food lately .
i gave it a lot of <unk> yesterday . '
<unk> !
what kind ? '
'well , they were a parcel of <unk> , sir . '
'ah , i thought so .
now just mind this : if you go on playing tricks like that , you 'll spoil all its teeth , and get laid up with mental indigestion .
you must have nothing but the plainest reading for the next few days .
take care now !
no novels on any account ! '
* * * * * considering the amount of painful experience many of us have had in feeding and <unk> the body , it would , i think , be quite worth our while to try and translate some of the rules into corresponding ones for the mind .
first , then , we should set ourselves to provide for our mind its proper kind of food .
we very soon learn what <name> , and what <name> not , agree with the body , and find little difficulty in refusing a piece of the tempting pudding or pie which is associated in our memory with that terrible attack of indigestion , and whose very name irresistibly recalls <unk> and magnesia ; but it takes a great many lessons to convince us how indigestible some of our favourite lines of reading are , and again and again we make a meal of the unwholesome novel , sure to be followed by its usual train of low spirits , unwillingness to work , weariness of existence  in fact , by mental nightmare .
then we should be careful to provide this wholesome food in proper amount .
mental <unk> , or <unk> , is a dangerous propensity , tending to weakness of digestive power , and in some cases to loss of appetite : we know that bread is a good and wholesome food , but who would like to try the experiment of eating two or three loaves at a sitting ?
i have heard a physician telling his patient  whose complaint was merely <unk> and want of exercise  that 'the earliest symptom of <unk> is a deposition of <unk> tissue , ' and no doubt the fine long words greatly consoled the poor man under his increasing load of fat .
i wonder if there is such a thing in nature as a fat mind ?
i really think i have met with one or two : minds which could not keep up with the slowest trot in conversation ; could not jump over a logical fence , to save their lives ; always got stuck fast in a narrow argument ; and , in short , were fit for nothing but to <unk> helplessly through the world .
* * * * * then , again , though the food be wholesome and in proper amount , we know that we must not consume too many kinds at once .
take the thirsty a quart of beer , or a quart of cider , or even a quart of cold tea , and he <name> probably thank you ( though not so heartily in the last case ! ) .
but what think you his feelings would be if you offered him a tray containing a little mug of beer , a little mug of cider , another of cold tea , one of hot tea , one of coffee , one of cocoa , and corresponding vessels of milk , water , <unk> , and <unk> ?
the sum total might be a quart , but would it be the same thing to the <unk> ?
* * * * * having settled the proper kind , amount , and variety of our mental food , it remains that we should be careful to allow proper intervals between meal and meal , and not swallow the food hastily without <unk> , so that it may be thoroughly digested ; both which rules , for the body , are also applicable at once to the mind .
first , as to the intervals : these are as really necessary as they are for the body , with this difference only , that while the body requires three or four hours ' rest before it is ready for another meal , the mind <name> in many cases do with three or four minutes .
i believe that the interval required is much shorter than is generally supposed , and from personal experience , i would recommend anyone , who has to devote several hours together to one subject of thought , to try the effect of such a break , say once an hour , leaving off for five minutes only each time , but taking care to throw the mind absolutely <unk> of gear ' for those five minutes , and to turn it entirely to other subjects .
it is astonishing what an amount of impetus and elasticity the mind recovers during those short periods of rest .
and then , as to the <unk> of the food , the mental process answering to this is simply thinking over what we read .
this is a very much greater exertion of mind than the mere passive taking in the contents of our author .
so much greater an exertion is it , that , as coleridge says , the mind often <unk> refuses ' to put itself to such trouble  so much greater , that we are far too apt to neglect it altogether , and go on pouring in fresh food on the top of the <unk> masses already lying there , till the unfortunate mind is fairly swamped under the flood .
but the greater the exertion the more valuable , we may be sure , is the effect .
one hour of steady thinking over a subject ( a solitary walk is as good an opportunity for the process as any other ) is worth two or three of reading only .
and just consider another effect of this thorough digestion of the books we read ; i mean the arranging and <unk> , ' so to speak , of the subjects in our minds , so that we can readily refer to them when we want them .
<name> slick tells us that he has learnt several languages in his life , but somehow 'could n't keep the parcels sorted ' in his mind .
and many a mind that hurries through book after book , without waiting to digest or arrange anything , gets into that sort of condition , and the unfortunate owner finds himself far from fit really to support the character all his friends give him .
'a thoroughly <unk> man .
just you try him in any subject , now .
you ca n't puzzle him . '
you turn to the thoroughly <unk> man .
you ask him a question , say , in english history ( he is understood to have just finished reading macaulay ) .
he smiles good-naturedly , tries to look as if he knew all about it , and proceeds to dive into his mind for the answer .
up comes a handful of very promising facts , but on examination they turn out to belong to the wrong century , and are pitched in again .
a second haul brings up a fact much more like the real thing , but , unfortunately , along with it comes a tangle of other things  a fact in political economy , a rule in arithmetic , the ages of his brother 's children , and a stanza of gray 's <unk> , ' and among all these , the fact he wants has got hopelessly twisted up and entangled .
meanwhile , every one is waiting for his reply , and , as the silence is getting more and more awkward , our <unk> friend has to <unk> out some <unk> at last , not nearly so clear or so satisfactory as an ordinary schoolboy would have given .
and all this for want of making up his knowledge into proper bundles and <unk> them .
do you know the unfortunate victim of <unk> mental feeding when you see him ?
can you doubt him ?
look at him drearily wandering round a reading-room , tasting dish after dish  we beg his pardon , book after book  keeping to none .
first a mouthful of novel ; but no , <unk> !
he has had nothing but that to eat for the last week , and is quite tired of the taste .
then a slice of science ; but you know at once what the result of that <name> be  ah , of course , much too tough for his teeth .
and so on through the whole weary round , which he tried ( and failed in ) yesterday , and <name> probably try and fail in to-morrow .
mr. <name> <name> holmes , in his very amusing book , 'the professor at the breakfast table , ' gives the following rule for knowing whether a human being is young or old : 'the crucial experiment is this  offer a bulky bun to the suspected individual just ten minutes before dinner .
if this is easily accepted and devoured , the fact of youth is established . '
he tells us that a human being , 'if young , <name> eat anything at any hour of the day or night . '
to ascertain the <unk> of the mental appetite of a human animal , place in its hands a short , <unk> , but not exciting treatise on some popular subject  a mental bun , in fact .
if it is read with eager interest and perfect attention , and if the reader can answer questions on the subject afterwards , the mind is in first-rate working order .
if it be politely laid down again , or perhaps lounged over for a few minutes , and then , 'i ca n't read this stupid book !
would you hand me the second volume of " the mysterious murder " ? '
you may be equally sure that there is something wrong in the mental digestion .
if this paper has given you any useful hints on the important subject of reading , and made you see that it is one 's duty no less than one's interest to <unk> , <name> , learn , and inwardly digest ' the good books that fall in your way , its purpose <name> be fulfilled .
<unk> and sons , <unk> , printers , <unk>
<unk> and other poems <unk> canto i  the <unk> one <name> night , at half-past nine , cold , tired , and cross , and muddy , i had come home , too late to dine , and supper , with cigars and wine , was waiting in the study .
there was a strangeness in the room , and something white and wavy was standing near me in the gloom  i took it for the <unk> left by that careless <unk> .
but presently the thing began to shiver and to sneeze : on which i said " come , come , my man !
that 's a most inconsiderate plan .
less noise there , if you please ! "
" i 've caught a cold , " the thing replies , " out there upon the landing . "
i turned to look in some surprise , and there , before my very eyes , a little ghost was standing !
he trembled when he caught my eye , and got behind a chair .
" how came you here , " i said , " and why ?
i never saw a thing so shy .
come out !
do n't shiver there ! "
he said " i 'd gladly tell you how , and also tell you why ; but " ( here he gave a little bow ) " you 're in so bad a temper now , you 'd think it all a lie .
" and as to being in a fright , allow me to remark that ghosts have just as good a right in every way , to fear the light , as men to fear the dark . "
" no plea , " said i , " can well excuse such cowardice in you : for ghosts can visit when they choose , whereas we humans ca'n't refuse to <name> the interview . "
he said " a flutter of alarm is not unnatural , is it ?
i really feared you meant some harm : but , now i see that you are calm , let me explain my visit .
" houses are classed , i beg to state , according to the number of ghosts that they accommodate : ( the tenant merely counts as weight , with coals and other lumber ) .
" this is a <unk> ' house , and you when you arrived last summer , may have remarked a spectre who was doing all that ghosts can do to welcome the new-comer .
" in villas this is always done  however cheaply rented : for , though of course there 's less of fun when there is only room for one , ghosts have to be contented .
" that spectre left you on the third  since then you 've not been haunted : for , as he never sent us word , 'twas quite by accident we heard that any one was wanted .
" a spectre has first choice , by right , in filling up a vacancy ; then phantom , goblin , <unk> , and sprite  if all these fail them , they invite the nicest ghoul that they can see .
" the spectres said the place was low , and that you kept bad wine : so , as a phantom had to go , and i was first , of course , you know , i could n't well decline . "
" no doubt , " said i , " they settled who was fittest to be sent yet still to choose a brat like you , to haunt a man of forty-two , was no great compliment ! "
" i 'm not so young , sir , " he replied , " as you might think .
the fact is , in caverns by the water-side , and other places that i 've tried , i 've had a lot of practice : " but i have never taken yet a strict domestic part , and in my flurry i forget the five good rules of etiquette we have to know by heart . "
my sympathies were warming fast towards the little fellow : he was so utterly aghast at having found a man at last , and looked so scared and yellow .
" at least , " i said , " i 'm glad to find a ghost is not a dumb thing !
but pray sit down : you 'll feel inclined ( if , like myself , you have not dined ) to take a <unk> of something : " though , certainly , you do n't appear a thing to offer food to !
and then i shall be glad to hear  if you <name> say them loud and clear  the rules that you allude to . "
" thanks !
you shall hear them by and by .
this is a piece of luck ! "
" what may i offer you ? "
said i .
" well , since you are so kind , i 'll try a little bit of duck .
" one slice !
and may i ask you for another drop of gravy ? "
i sat and looked at him in awe , for certainly i never saw a thing so white and wavy .
and still he seemed to grow more white , more <unk> , and <unk>  seen in the dim and flickering light , as he proceeded to recite his " maxims of behaviour . "
canto ii  <unk> <unk> rules " my first  but do n't suppose , " he said , " i 'm setting you a riddle  is  if your victim be in bed , do n't touch the curtains at his head , but take them in the middle , " and wave them slowly in and out , while drawing them asunder ; and in a minute 's time , no doubt , he 'll raise his head and look about with eyes of wrath and wonder .
" and here you must on no pretence make the first observation .
wait for the victim to commence : no ghost of any common sense begins a conversation .
" if he should say 'how came you here ? '
( the way that you began , sir , ) in such a case your course is clear  'on the bat 's back , my little dear ! '
is the appropriate answer .
" if after this he says no more , you 'd best perhaps curtail your exertions  go and shake the door , and then , if he begins to snore , you 'll know the thing 's a failure .
" by day , if he should be alone  at home or on a walk  you merely give a hollow groan , to indicate the kind of tone in which you mean to talk .
" but if you find him with his friends , the thing is rather harder .
in such a case success depends on picking up some <unk> , or butter , in the larder .
" with this you make a kind of slide ( it answers best with suet ) , on which you must contrive to glide , and swing yourself from side to side  one soon learns how to do it .
" the second tells us what is right in ceremonious calls :  'first burn a blue or crimson <unk> ( a thing i quite forgot to-night ) , 'then scratch the door or walls . ' "
i said " you 'll visit here no more , if you attempt the <name> .
i 'll have no bonfires on my floor  and , as for scratching at the door , i 'd like to see you try ! "
" the third was written to protect the interests of the victim , and tells us , as i recollect , to treat him with a grave respect , and not to contradict him . "
" that 's plain , " said i , " as <unk> and <unk> , to any comprehension : i only wish some ghosts i 've met would not so constantly forget the maxim that you mention ! "
" perhaps , " he said , " you first <unk> the laws of hospitality : all ghosts instinctively detest the man that fails to treat his guest with proper cordiality .
" if you address a ghost as <unk> ! '
or strike him with a hatchet , he is permitted by the king to drop all formal <unk>  and then you 're sure to catch it !
" the fourth <unk> <unk> where other ghosts are quartered : and those convicted of the thing ( unless when pardoned by the king ) must instantly be slaughtered .
" that simply means 'be cut up small ' : ghosts soon unite anew .
the process scarcely hurts at all  not more than when you 're what you call <unk> up ' by a review .
" the fifth is one you may prefer that i should quote entire :  the king must be addressed as 'sir . '
this , from a simple courtier , is all the laws require : " but , should you wish to do the thing with out-and-out politeness , accost him as 'my goblin king !
and always use , in answering , the phrase 'your <name> whiteness ! '
" i 'm getting rather hoarse , i fear , after so much reciting : so , if you do n't object , my dear , we 'll try a glass of bitter beer  i think it looks inviting . "
canto iii  <unk> " and did you really walk , " said i , " on such a wretched night ?
i always fancied ghosts could fly  if not exactly in the sky , yet at a <unk> height . "
" it 's very well , " said he , " for kings to soar above the earth : but phantoms often find that wings  like many other pleasant things  cost more than they are worth .
" spectres of course are <name> , and so can buy them from the <unk> : but we prefer to keep below  they 're stupid company , you know , for any but themselves : " for , though they claim to be exempt from pride , they treat a phantom as something quite beneath contempt  just as no turkey ever dreamt of noticing a bantam . "
" they seem too proud , " said i , " to go to houses such as mine .
pray , how did they contrive to know so quickly that 'the place was low , ' and that i <unk> bad wine ' ? "
" inspector <unk> came to you  " the little ghost began .
here i broke in  " inspector who ?
inspecting ghosts is something new !
explain yourself , my man ! "
" his name is <unk> , " said my guest : " one of the spectre order : you 'll very often see him dressed in a yellow gown , a crimson vest , and a <unk> with a border .
" he tried the <unk> business first , but caught a sort of chill ; so came to england to be nursed , and here it took the form of thirst , which he complains of still .
" <unk> , he says , when <name> and sound , <unk> his old bones like nectar : and as the inns , where it is found , are his especial <unk> , we call him the <unk> . "
i bore it  bore it like a man  this agonizing <unk> !
and nothing could be sweeter than my temper , till the ghost began some most provoking criticism .
" cooks need not be indulged in waste ; yet still you 'd better teach them dishes should have some sort of taste .
pray , why are all the <unk> placed where nobody can reach them ?
" that man of yours <name> never earn his living as a waiter !
is that queer thing supposed to burn ?
( it 's far too dismal a concern to call a moderator ) .
" the duck was tender , but the peas were very much too old : and just remember , if you please , the next time you have toasted cheese , do n't let them send it cold .
" you 'd find the bread improved , i think , by getting better flour : and have you anything to drink that looks a little less like ink , and is n't quite so sour ? "
then , peering round with curious eyes , he muttered " goodness gracious ! "
and so went on to criticise  " your room 's an inconvenient size : it 's neither snug nor spacious .
" that narrow window , i expect , serves but to let the dusk in  " " but please , " said i , " to recollect 'twas fashioned by an architect who pinned his <name> on ruskin ! "
" i do n't care who he was , sir , or on whom he pinned his <name> !
constructed by whatever law , so poor a job i never saw , as i 'm a living <unk> !
" what a <unk> cigar !
how much are they a dozen ? "
i growled " no matter what they are !
you 're getting as familiar as if you were my cousin !
" now that 's a thing i <name> not stand , and so i tell you flat . "
" aha , " said he , " we 're getting grand ! "
( taking a bottle in his hand ) " i 'll soon arrange for that ! "
and here he took a careful aim , and gaily cried " here goes ! "
i tried to dodge it as it came , but somehow caught it , all the same , exactly on my nose .
and i remember nothing more that i can clearly fix , till i was sitting on the floor , repeating " two and five are four , but five and two are six . "
what really passed i never learned , nor guessed : i only know that , when at last my sense returned , the lamp , neglected , dimly burned  the fire was getting low  through driving mists i seemed to see a thing that <unk> and smiled : and found that he was giving me a lesson in biography , as if i were a child .
canto iv  <unk> <unk> " oh , when i was a little ghost , a <name> time had we !
each seated on his favourite post , we <unk> and <unk> the buttered toast they gave us for our tea . "
" that story is in print ! "
i cried .
" do n't say it 's not , because it 's known as well as bradshaw 's guide ! "
( the ghost uneasily replied he hardly thought it was ) .
" it 's not in nursery rhymes ?
and yet i almost think it is  'three little <unk> ' were set 'on <unk> , ' you know , and ate their <unk> <unk> . '
" i have the book ; so if you doubt it  " i turned to search the shelf .
" do n't stir ! "
he cried .
" we 'll do without it : i now remember all about it ; i wrote the thing myself .
" it came out in a <unk> , ' or at least my agent said it did : some literary swell , who saw it , thought it seemed adapted for the magazine he edited .
" my father was a <unk> , sir ; my mother was a <name> .
the notion had occurred to her , the children would be happier , if they were taught to vary .
" the notion soon became a craze ; and , when it once began , she brought us all out in different ways  one was a <unk> , two were <unk> , another was a <unk> ; " the fetch and <unk> went to school and gave a lot of trouble ; next came a <unk> and ghoul , and then two <unk> ( which broke the rule ) , a goblin , and a double  " ( if that 's a <unk> on the shelf , " he added with a yawn , " i 'll take a pinch )  next came an <unk> , and then a phantom ( that 's myself ) , and last , a <unk> .
" one day , some spectres chanced to call , dressed in the usual white : i stood and watched them in the hall , and could n't make them out at all , they seemed so strange a sight .
" i wondered what on earth they were , that looked all head and sack ; but mother told me not to stare , and then she twitched me by the hair , and punched me in the back .
" since then i 've often wished that i had been a spectre born .
but what 's the use ? "
( he heaved a sigh . )
" they are the <unk> , and look on us with scorn .
" my <unk> was soon begun : when i was barely six , i went out with an older one  and just at first i thought it fun , and learned a lot of tricks .
" i 've haunted dungeons , castles , towers  wherever i was sent : i 've often sat and howled for hours , drenched to the skin with driving showers , upon a <unk> .
" it 's quite old-fashioned now to groan when you begin to speak : this is the newest thing in tone  " and here ( it chilled me to the bone ) he gave an awful squeak .
" perhaps , " he added , " to your ear that sounds an easy thing ?
try it yourself , my little dear !
it took me something like a year , with constant practising .
" and when you 've learned to squeak , my man , and caught the double sob , you 're pretty much where you began : just try and <unk> if you can !
that 's something like a job !
" i 've tried it , and can only say i 'm sure you could n't do it , e ven if you practised night and day , unless you have a turn that way , and natural ingenuity .
" shakspeare i think it is who treats of ghosts , in days of old , who <unk> in the <name> streets , ' dressed , if you recollect , in sheets  they must have found it cold .
" i 've often spent ten pounds on stuff , in dressing as a double ; but , though it answers as a puff , it never has effect enough to make it worth the trouble .
" long bills soon quenched the little thirst i had for being funny .
the <unk> is always worst : such heaps of things you want at first , one must be made of money !
" for instance , take a haunted tower , with skull , <unk> , and sheet ; blue lights to burn ( say ) two an hour , condensing lens of extra power , and set of chains complete : " what with the things you have to hire  the fitting on the robe  and testing all the coloured fire  the outfit of itself would tire the <name> of a job !
" and then they 're so fastidious , the <unk> committee : i 've often known them make a fuss because a ghost was french , or <name> , or even from the city !
" some dialects are objected to  for one , the <name> <unk> is : and then , for all you have to do , one pound a week they offer you , and find yourself in <unk> !
canto v  <unk> " do n't they consult the <unk> , ' though ? "
i said .
" they should , by rights , give them a chance  because , you know , the tastes of people differ so , especially in <unk> . "
the phantom shook his head and smiled .
" consult them ?
not a bit !
'twould be a job to drive one wild , to satisfy one single child  there 'd be no end to it ! "
" of course you ca n't leave children free , " said i , " to pick and choose : but , in the case of men like me , i think <unk> host ' might fairly be allowed to state his views . "
he said " it really would n't pay  folk are so full of fancies .
we visit for a single day , and whether then we go , or stay , depends on circumstances .
" and , though we do n't consult <unk> <unk> before the thing 's arranged , still , if he often quits his post , or is not a <unk> ghost , then you can have him changed .
" but if the host 's a man like you  i mean a man of sense ; and if the house is not too new  " " why , what has that , " said i , " to do with ghost 's convenience ? "
" a new house does not suit , you know  it 's such a job to trim it : but , after twenty years or so , the <unk> begin to go , so twenty is the limit . "
" to trim " was not a phrase i could remember having heard : " perhaps , " i said , " you 'll be so good as tell me what is understood exactly by that word ? "
" it means the loosening all the doors , " the ghost replied , and laughed : " it means the drilling holes by scores in all the <unk> and floors , to make a thorough draught .
" you 'll sometimes find that one or two are all you really need to let the wind come whistling through  but here there 'll be a lot to do ! "
i faintly gasped " indeed !
" if i 'd been rather later , i'll be bound , " i added , trying ( most <unk> ) to smile , " you 'd have been busy all this while , trimming and <unk> ? "
" why , no , " said he ; " perhaps i should have stayed another minute  but still no ghost , that 's any good , without an introduction would have ventured to begin it .
" the proper thing , as you were late , was certainly to go : but , with the roads in such a state , i got the <unk> 's leave to wait for half an hour or so . "
" who 's the <unk> ? "
i cried .
instead of answering my question , " well , if you do n't know that , " he said , " either you never go to bed , or you 've a grand digestion !
" he goes about and sits on folk that eat too much at night : his duties are to pinch , and poke , and squeeze them till they nearly choke . "
( i said " it serves them right ! " )
" and folk who sup on things like these  " he muttered , " eggs and bacon  lobster  and duck  and toasted cheese  if they do n't get an awful squeeze , i 'm very much mistaken !
" he is immensely fat , and so well suits the occupation : in point of fact , if you must know , we used to call him years ago , the mayor and corporation !
" the day he was elected mayor i know that every sprite meant to vote for me , but did not dare  he was so frantic with despair and furious with excitement .
" when it was over , for a whim , he ran to tell the king ; and being the reverse of slim , a <unk> trot was not for him a very easy thing .
" so , to reward him for his run ( as it was baking hot , and he was over twenty stone ) , the king proceeded , half in fun , to knight him on the spot . "
" 't was a great <name> to take ! "
( i fired up like a rocket ) .
" he did it just for <unk> 's sake : 'the man , ' says <name> , 'that would make a pun , would pick a pocket ! ' "
" a man , " said he , " is not a king . "
i argued for a while , and did my best to prove the thing  the phantom merely listening with a contemptuous smile .
at last , when , breath and <name> spent , i had recourse to smoking  " your aim , " he said , " is excellent : but  when you call it argument  of course you 're only joking ? "
stung by his cold and <unk> eye , i roused myself at length to say " at least i do defy the veriest <unk> to deny that union is strength ! "
" that 's true enough , " said he , " yet stay  " i listened in all meekness  " union is strength , i 'm bound to say ; in fact , the thing 's as clear as day ; but onions are a weakness . "
canto <name>  <unk> as one who strives a hill to climb , who never climbed before : who finds it , in a little time , grow every moment less sublime , and votes the thing a bore : yet , having once begun to try , dares not desert his quest , but , climbing , ever keeps his eye on one small hut against the sky wherein he hopes to rest : who climbs till nerve and force are spent , with many a puff and pant : who still , as rises the ascent , in language grows more violent , although in breath more scant : who , climbing , gains at length the place that crowns the upward track .
and , entering with unsteady pace , receives a buffet in the face that lands him on his back : and feels himself , like one in sleep , glide swiftly down again , a helpless weight , from steep to steep , till , with a headlong giddy sweep , he drops upon the plain  so i , that had resolved to bring conviction to a ghost , and found it quite a different thing from any human arguing , yet dared not quit my post but , keeping still the end in view to which i hoped to come , i strove to prove the matter true by putting everything i knew into an axiom : commencing every single phrase with <unk> ' or 'because , ' i blindly reeled , a hundred ways , about the <unk> maze , unconscious where i was .
quoth he " that 's regular <unk> : do n't bluster any more .
now do be cool and take a nap !
such a ridiculous old chap was never seen before !
" you 're like a man i used to meet , who got one day so furious in arguing , the simple heat scorched both his slippers off his feet ! "
i said " that 's very curious ! "
" well , it is curious , i agree , and sounds perhaps like <unk> : but still it 's true as true can be  as sure as your name 's <unk> , " said he .
i said " my name 's not <unk> . "
" not <unk> ! "
he cried  his tone became a shade or two less hearty  " why , no , " said i .
" my proper name is <unk>  " " <unk> ? "
" aye , the same . "
" why , then you 're not the party ! "
with that he struck the board a blow that shivered half the glasses .
" why could n't you have told me so three quarters of an hour ago , you <name> of all the asses ?
" to walk four miles through mud and rain , to spend the night in smoking , and then to find that it 's in vain  and i 've to do it all again  it 's really too provoking !
" do n't talk ! "
he cried , as i began to mutter some excuse .
" who can have <name> with a man that 's got no more discretion than an idiotic goose ?
" to keep me waiting here , instead of telling me at once that this was not the house ! "
he said .
" there , that 'll do  be off to bed !
do n't gape like that , you dunce ! "
" it 's very fine to throw the blame on me in such a fashion !
why did n't you enquire my name the very minute that you came ? "
i answered in a passion .
" of course it worries you a bit to come so far on foot  but how was i to blame for it ? "
" well , well ! "
said he .
" i must admit that is n't badly put .
" and certainly you 've given me the best of wine and <unk>  excuse my violence , " said he , " but accidents like this , you see , they put one out a little .
" 't was my fault after all , i find  shake hands , old <unk> ! "
the name was hardly to my mind , but , as no doubt he meant it kind , i let the matter drop .
" good-night , old <unk> , good-night !
when i am gone , perhaps they 'll send you some inferior sprite , who 'll keep you in a constant fright and spoil your soundest <unk> .
" tell him you 'll stand no sort of trick ; then , if he <unk> and chuckles , you just be handy with a stick ( mind that it 's pretty hard and thick ) and rap him on the knuckles !
" then carelessly remark 'old coon !
perhaps you 're not aware that , if you do n't behave , you 'll soon be chuckling to another tune  and so you 'd best take care ! '
" that 's the right way to cure a sprite of such like <unk>  but gracious me !
it 's getting light !
good-night , old <unk> , good-night ! "
a nod , and he was gone .
canto vii  sad <unk> " what 's this ? "
i pondered .
" have i slept ?
or can i have been drinking ? "
but soon a gentler feeling crept upon me , and i sat and wept an hour or so , like winking .
" no need for bones to hurry so ! "
i sobbed .
" in fact , i doubt if it was worth his while to go  and who is <unk> , i 'd like to know , to make such work about ?
" if <unk> is anything like me , it 's possible , " i said , " he wo n't be <unk> to be dropped in upon at half-past three , after he 's snug in bed .
" and if bones plagues him anyhow  squeaking and all the rest of it , as he was doing here just now  i prophesy there 'll be a row , and <unk> <name> have the best of it ! "
then , as my tears could never bring the friendly phantom back , it seemed to me the proper thing to mix another glass , and sing the following <unk> .
'and <name> thou gone , beloved ghost ?
best of <unk> !
nay then , farewell , my <unk> roast , farewell , farewell , my tea and toast , my <unk> and cigars !
the hues of life are dull and gray , the sweets of life insipid , when thou , my <unk> , <name> away  old brick , or rather , let me say , old <unk> ! '
instead of singing verse the third , i ceased  abruptly , rather : but , after such a splendid word i felt that it would be absurd to try it any farther .
so with a yawn i went my way to seek the welcome downy , and slept , and dreamed till break of day of <unk> and fetch and <name> and <unk> and <unk> !
for year i 've not been visited by any kind of sprite ; yet still they <name> in my head , those parting words , so kindly said , " old <unk> , good-night ! "
echoes <name> <name> vere de vere was eight years old , she said : every <unk> , lightly shaken , ran itself in golden thread .
she took her little <unk> : of me she shall not win renown : for the baseness of its nature shall have strength to drag her down .
" sisters and brothers , little maid ?
there stands the inspector at thy door : like a dog , he hunts for boys who know not two and two are four . "
" kind words are more than <unk> , " she said , and wondering looked at me : " it is the dead unhappy night , and i must hurry home to tea . "
a sea dirge there are certain things  as , a spider , a ghost , the <unk> , gout , an umbrella for three  that i hate , but the thing that i hate the most is a thing they call the sea .
pour some salt water over the floor  ugly i 'm sure you 'll allow it to be : suppose it extended a mile or more , that 's very like the sea .
beat a dog till it howls outright  cruel , but all very well for a spree : suppose that he did so day and night , that would be like the sea .
i had a vision of <unk> ; tens of thousands passed by me  all leading children with wooden spades , and this was by the sea .
who invented those spades of wood ?
who was it cut them out of the tree ?
none , i think , but an idiot could  or one that loved the sea .
it is pleasant and dreamy , no doubt , to float with <unk> as boundless , and souls as free ' : but , suppose you are very unwell in the boat , how do you like the sea ?
there is an insect that people avoid ( whence is derived the verb 'to flee ' ) .
where have you been by it most annoyed ?
in lodgings by the sea .
if you like your coffee with sand for <unk> , a decided hint of salt in your tea , and a fishy taste in the very eggs  by all means choose the sea .
and if , with these dainties to drink and eat , you prefer not a vestige of grass or tree , and a chronic state of wet in your feet , then  i recommend the sea .
for i have friends who dwell by the coast  pleasant friends they are to me !
it is when i am with them i wonder most that anyone likes the sea .
they take me a walk : though tired and stiff , to climb the heights i madly agree ; and , after a tumble or so from the <name> , they kindly suggest the sea .
i try the rocks , and i think it cool that they laugh with such an excess of glee , as i heavily slip into every pool that skirts the cold cold sea .

hiawatha 's <unk> [ in an age of imitation , i can claim no special merit for this slight attempt at doing what is known to be so easy .
any fairly practised writer , with the slightest ear for rhythm , could compose , for hours together , in the easy running metre of 'the song of hiawatha . '
having , then , distinctly stated that i challenge no attention in the following little poem to its merely verbal jingle , i must beg the candid reader to confine his criticism to its treatment of the subject . ]
from his shoulder hiawatha took the camera of rosewood , made of sliding , folding rosewood ; neatly put it all together .
in its case it lay compactly , folded into nearly nothing ; but he opened out the hinges , pushed and pulled the joints and hinges , till it looked all squares and <unk> , like a complicated figure in the second book of euclid .
this he perched upon a tripod  crouched beneath its dusky cover  stretched his hand , enforcing silence  said , " be motionless , i beg you ! "
mystic , awful was the process .
all the family in order sat before him for their pictures : each in turn , as he was taken , volunteered his own suggestions , his ingenious suggestions .
first the governor , the father : he suggested <name> curtains looped about a massy pillar ; and the corner of a table , of a rosewood <unk> .
he would hold a scroll of something , hold it firmly in his left-hand ; he would keep his right-hand buried ( like <name> ) in his waistcoat ; he would contemplate the distance with a look of pensive meaning , as of ducks that die ill tempests .
grand , heroic was the notion : yet the picture failed entirely : failed , because he moved a little , moved , because he could n't help it .
next , his better half took courage ; she would have her picture taken .
she came dressed beyond description , dressed in jewels and in satin far too gorgeous for an empress .
gracefully she sat down sideways , with a <unk> scarcely human , holding in her hand a bouquet rather larger than a cabbage .
all the while that she was sitting , still the <name> chattered , chattered , like a monkey in the forest .
" am i sitting still ? "
she asked him .
" is my face enough in profile ?
shall i hold the bouquet higher ?
<name> it came into the picture ? "
and the picture failed completely .
next the son , the <unk> : he suggested curves of beauty , curves pervading all his figure , which the eye might follow onward , till they centered in the <unk> , centered in the golden <unk> .
he had learnt it all from ruskin ( author of 'the stones of <name> , ' <unk> lamps of architecture , ' 'modern painters , ' and some others ) ; and perhaps he had not fully understood his author 's meaning ; but , whatever was the reason , all was fruitless , as the picture ended in an utter failure .
next to him the eldest daughter : she suggested very little , only asked if he would take her with her look of <unk> beauty . '
her idea of passive beauty was a <unk> of the <unk> , was a drooping of the <unk> , was a smile that went up sideways to the corner of the nostrils .
hiawatha , when she asked him , took no notice of the question , looked as if he had n't heard it ; but , when pointedly appealed to , smiled in his peculiar manner , coughed and said it 'did n't matter , ' bit his lip and changed the subject .
nor in this was he mistaken , as the picture failed completely .
so in turn the other sisters .
last , the youngest son was taken : very rough and thick his hair was , very round and red his face was , very <name> was his jacket , very <unk> his manner .
and his overbearing sisters called him names he disapproved of : called him <name> , <unk> 's darling , ' called him <unk> , <unk> school-boy . '
and , so awful was the picture , in comparison the others seemed , to one 's bewildered fancy , to have partially succeeded .
finally my hiawatha tumbled all the tribe together , ( <unk> ' is not the right expression ) , and , as happy chance would have it did at last obtain a picture where the faces all succeeded : each came out a perfect likeness .
then they joined and all abused it , <unk> abused it , as the worst and <unk> picture they could possibly have dreamed of .
<unk> one such strange expressions  sullen , stupid , pert expressions .
really any one would take us ( any one that did not know us ) for the most unpleasant people ! '
( hiawatha seemed to think so , seemed to think it not unlikely ) .
all together rang their voices , angry , loud , discordant voices , as of dogs that howl in concert , as of cats that wail in chorus .
but my hiawatha 's <name> , his politeness and his <name> , unaccountably had vanished , and he left that happy party .
neither did he leave them slowly , with the calm deliberation , the intense deliberation of a <unk> artist : but he left them in a hurry , left them in a mighty hurry , stating that he would not stand it , stating in emphatic language what he 'd be before he 'd stand it .
hurriedly he packed his boxes : hurriedly the <name> trundled on a barrow all his boxes : hurriedly he took his ticket : hurriedly the train received him : thus departed hiawatha .
<unk> with saddest music all day long she soothed her secret sorrow : at night she sighed " i fear 't was wrong such cheerful words to borrow .
dearest , a sweeter , sadder song i 'll sing to thee to-morrow . "
i thanked her , but i could not say that i was glad to hear it : i left the house at break of day , and did not venture near it till time , i hoped , had worn away her grief , for nought could cheer it !
my dismal sister !
couldst thou know the wretched home thou <unk> !
thy brother , drowned in daily woe , is thankful when thou <unk> ; for if i laugh , however low , when <unk> awake , thou <unk> !
i took my sister t'other day ( excuse the slang expression ) to sadler 's wells to see the play in hopes the new impression might in her thoughts , from grave to <name> effect some slight digression .
i asked three <name> young dogs from town to join us in our folly , whose mirth , i thought , might serve to drown my sister 's melancholy : the lively jones , the <unk> brown , and robinson the jolly .
the maid announced the meal in tones that i myself had taught her , meant to allay my sister 's moans like oil on troubled water : i rushed to jones , the lively jones , and begged him to escort her .
vainly he strove , with ready wit , to joke about the weather  to <unk> the last 'on dit '  to quote the price of leather  she groaned " here i and sorrow sit : let us lament together ! "
i urged " you 're wasting time , you know : delay <name> spoil the venison . "
" my heart is wasted with my woe !
there is no rest  in <name> , on the bridge of sighs ! "
she quoted low from <name> and from tennyson .
i need not tell of soup and fish in solemn silence swallowed , the sobs that ushered in each dish , and its departure followed , nor yet my <unk> wish to be the cheese i hollowed .
some desperate attempts were made to start a conversation ; " madam , " the <unk> brown essayed , " which kind of recreation , hunting or fishing , have you made your special occupation ? "
her lips curved downwards instantly , as if of india-rubber .
" hounds in full cry i like , " said she : ( oh how i longed to snub her ! )
" of fish , a whale 's the one for me , it is so full of blubber ! "
the night 's performance was " king <name> . "
" it 's dull , " she wept , " and <unk> ! "
awhile i let her tears flow on , she said they soothed her woe so !
at length the curtain rose upon <unk> <unk> . '
in vain we roared ; in vain we tried to rouse her into laughter : her pensive glances wandered wide from orchestra to <unk>  " tier upon tier ! "
she said , and sighed ; and silence followed after .
a <name> [ sent to a friend who had complained that i was glad enough to see him when he came , but did n't seem to miss him if he stayed away . ]
and can not pleasures , while they last , be actual unless , when past , they leave us shuddering and aghast , with anguish <unk> ?
and can not friends be firm and fast , and yet bear parting ?
and must i then , at friendship 's call , calmly resign the little all ( trifling , i <name> , it is and small ) i have of gladness , and lend my being to the thrall of gloom and sadness ?
and think you that i should be dumb , and full <unk> <unk> , excepting when you choose to come and share my dinner ?
at other times be sour and glum and daily thinner ?
must he then only live to weep , who 'd prove his friendship true and deep by day a lonely shadow creep , at <unk> <unk> , oft raising in his broken sleep the moan of anguish ?
the lover , if for certain days his fair one be denied his gaze , sinks not in grief and wild <unk> , but , wiser <unk> , he spends the time in writing lays , and posts them to her .
and if the verse flow free and fast , till even the poet is aghast , a touching <name> at last the post shall <name> , when thirteen days are gone and past of february .
farewell , dear friend , and when we meet , in desert waste or crowded street , perhaps before this week shall fleet , perhaps to-morrow .
i trust to find your heart the seat of wasting sorrow .
the three voices the first voice he <unk> a <name> fresh and free , he laughed aloud for very glee : there came a breeze from off the sea : it passed athwart the <unk> flat  it fanned his forehead as he sat  it lightly bore away his hat , all to the feet of one who stood like maid enchanted in a wood , frowning as darkly as she could .
with huge umbrella , lank and brown , <unk> she pinned it down , right through the centre of the crown .
then , with an aspect cold and grim , regardless of its battered rim , she took it up and gave it him .
a while like one in dreams he stood , then faltered forth his gratitude in words just short of being rude : for it had lost its shape and shine , and it had cost him <unk> , and he was going out to dine .
" to dine ! "
she sneered in acid tone .
" to bend thy being to a bone clothed in a radiance not its own ! "
the <unk> trickled to his <name> : there was a meaning in her grin that made him feel on fire within .
" term it not <unk> , ' " said he : " 't is solid nutriment to me .
dinner is dinner : tea is tea . "
and she " yea so ?
yet wherefore cease ?
let thy scant knowledge find increase .
say 'men are men , and geese are geese . ' "
he moaned : he knew not what to say .
the thought " that i could get away ! "
strove with the thought " but i must stay .
" to dine ! "
she shrieked in <unk> .
" to swallow wines all foam and froth !
to <unk> at a table-cloth !
" say , can thy <name> spirit stoop to join the <unk> <unk> who find a solace in the soup ?
" canst thou <name> or pie or puff ?
thy well-bred manners were enough , without such gross material stuff . "
" yet well-bred men , " he faintly said , " are not willing to be fed : nor are they well without the bread . "
her visage scorched him ere she spoke : " there are , " she said , " a kind of folk who have no horror of a joke .
" such wretches live : they take their share of common earth and common air : we come across them here and there : " we <name> them  there is no escape  a sort of semi-human shape suggestive of the <unk> ape . "
" in all such theories , " said he , " one fixed exception there must be .
that is , the present company . "
baffled , she gave a <unk> bark : he , aiming blindly in the dark , with random shaft had pierced the <name> .
she felt that her defeat was plain , yet madly strove with might and main to get the upper hand again .
fixing her eyes upon the beach , as though unconscious of his speech , she said " each gives to more than each . "
he could not answer yea or nay : he faltered " gifts may pass away . "
yet knew not what he meant to say .
" if that be so , " she straight replied , " each heart with each doth coincide .
what boots it ?
for the world is wide . "
" the world is but a thought , " said he : " the vast unfathomable sea is but a notion  unto me . "
and darkly fell her answer dread upon his unresisting head , like half a <unk> of lead .
" the good and great must ever shun that reckless and abandoned one who stoops to perpetrate a pun .
" the man that smokes  that reads the times  that goes to christmas <unk>  is capable of any crimes ! "
he felt it was his turn to speak , and , with a shamed and crimson cheek , moaned " this is harder than <unk> ! "
but when she asked him " wherefore so ? "
he felt his very whiskers glow , and frankly owned " i do not know . "
while , like broad waves of golden grain , or sunlit hues on <unk> pane , his colour came and went again .
pitying his obvious distress , yet with a tinge of bitterness , she said " the more exceeds the less . "
" a truth of such undoubted weight , " he urged , " and so extreme in date , it were superfluous to state . "
roused into sudden passion , she in tone of cold malignity : " to others , yea : but not to thee . "
but when she saw him quail and quake , and when he urged " for pity 's sake ! "
once more in gentle tones she spake .
" thought in the mind doth still abide that is by intellect supplied , and within that idea doth hide : " and he , that <unk> the truth to know , still further inwardly may go , and find idea from notion flow : " and thus the chain , that sages sought , is to a glorious circle wrought , for notion hath its source in thought . "
so passed they on with even pace : yet gradually one might trace a shadow growing on his face .
the second voice they walked beside the <unk> beach ; her tongue was very apt to teach , and now and then he did beseech she would abate her <unk> tone , because the talk was all her own , and he was dull as any drone .
she urged " no cheese is made of chalk " : and ceaseless flowed her dreary talk , tuned to the footfall of a walk .
her voice was very full and <name> , and , when at length she asked him " which ? "
it mounted to its highest pitch .
he a bewildered answer gave , drowned in the sullen moaning wave , lost in the echoes of the cave .
he answered her he knew not what : like shaft from bow at random shot , he spoke , but she regarded not .
she waited not for his reply , but with a downward leaden eye went on as if he were not by sound argument and grave defence , strange questions raised on " why ? "
and " whence ? "
and wildly tangled evidence .
when he , with racked and whirling <name> , feebly implored her to explain , she simply said it all again .
wrenched with an agony intense , he spake , neglecting sound and sense , and careless of all consequence : " mind  i believe  is essence  ent  abstract  that is  an accident  which we  that is to say  i meant  " when , with quick breath and cheeks all flushed , at length his speech was somewhat hushed , she looked at him , and he was crushed .
it needed not her calm reply : she fixed him with a stony eye , and he could neither fight nor fly .
while she dissected , word by word , his speech , half guessed at and half heard , as might a cat a little bird .
then , having wholly overthrown his views , and stripped them to the bone , proceeded to unfold her own .
" shall man be man ?
and shall he miss of other thoughts no thought but this , harmonious dews of sober bliss ?
" what boots it ?
shall his fevered eye through towering nothingness <unk> the grisly phantom hurry by ?
" and hear dumb shrieks that fill the air ; see mouths that gape , and eyes that stare and redden in the dusky glare ?
" the meadows breathing <name> light , the darkness <unk> from the height , the feathery train of granite night ?
" shall he , grown gray among his peers , through the thick curtain of his tears catch glimpses of his earlier years , " and hear the sounds he knew of yore , old <unk> on the <unk> floor , old knuckles tapping at the door ?
" yet still before him as he flies one pallid form shall ever rise , and , <unk> forth in glassy eyes " the vision of a vanished good , low peering through the tangled wood , shall freeze the current of his blood . "
still from each fact , with skill uncouth and savage rapture , like a tooth she wrenched some slow reluctant truth .
till , like a silent <unk> , when summer suns have dried the rill , she reached a full stop , and was still .
dead calm succeeded to the fuss , as when the loaded omnibus has reached the railway terminus : when , for the tumult of the street , is heard the engine 's stifled beat , the <name> tread of porters ' feet .
with glance that ever sought the ground , she moved her lips without a sound , and every now and then she frowned .
he gazed upon the sleeping sea , and <unk> in its tranquillity , and in that silence dead , but she to muse a little space did seem , then , like the <name> of a dream , <unk> back upon her threadbare theme .
still an attentive ear he lent but could not fathom what she meant : she was not deep , nor eloquent .
he marked the ripple on the sand : the even swaying of her hand was all that he could understand .
he saw in dreams a drawing-room , where thirteen wretches sat in gloom , waiting  he thought he knew for whom : he saw them drooping here and there , each feebly huddled on a chair , in attitudes of blank despair : oysters were not more mute than they , for all their brains were pumped away , and they had nothing more to say  save one , who groaned " three hours are gone ! "
who shrieked " we 'll wait no longer , <name> !
tell them to set the dinner on ! "
the vision passed : the ghosts were fled : he saw once more that woman dread : he heard once more the words she said .
he left her , and he turned aside : he sat and watched the coming tide across the shores so newly dried .
he wondered at the waters clear , the breeze that whispered in his ear , the billows heaving far and near , and why he had so long preferred to <name> upon her every word : " in truth , " he said , " it was absurd . "
the third voice not long this transport held its place : within a little moment 's space quick tears were raining down his face his heart stood still , aghast with fear ; a <unk> voice , nor far nor near , he seemed to hear and not to hear .
" tears kindle not the doubtful spark .
if so , why not ?
of this remark the bearings are profoundly dark . "
" her speech , " he said , " hath caused this pain .
easier i count it to explain the <unk> of the howling main , " or , stretched beside some babbling <name> , to con , with <unk> look , an unintelligible book . "
low spake the voice within his head , in words imagined more than said , <unk> as ghost 's intended tread : " if thou <name> duller than before , why <unk> thou the voice of <name> ?
why not endure , expecting more ? "
" rather than that , " he groaned aghast , " i 'd writhe in depths of cavern vast , some <unk> <unk> 's <name> repast . "
" 'twere hard , " it answered , " themes immense to coop within the narrow fence that rings thy scant intelligence . "
" not so , " he urged , " nor once alone : but there was something in her tone that chilled me to the very bone .
" her style was anything but clear , and most unpleasantly severe ; her epithets were very queer .
" and yet , so grand were her replies , i could not choose but deem her wise ; i did not dare to criticise ; " nor did i leave her , till she went so deep in tangled argument that all my powers of thought were spent . "
a little whisper <unk> slid , " yet truth is truth : you know you did . "
a little wink beneath the lid .
and , sickened with excess of dread , prone to the dust he bent his head , and lay like one three-quarters dead the whisper left him  like a breeze lost in the depths of leafy trees  left him by no means at his ease .
once more he <unk> in despair , with hands , through <unk> hair , more tightly clenched than then they were .
when , bathed in <name> of living red , majestic frowned the mountain head , " tell me my fault , " was all he said .
when , at high noon , the blazing sky scorched in his head each haggard eye , then keenest rose his weary cry .
and when at <name> the <unk> sun smiled grimly on the solemn fun , " alack , " he sighed , " what have i done ? "
but saddest , darkest was the sight , when the cold grasp of leaden night dashed him to earth , and held him tight .
tortured , unaided , and alone , thunders were silence to his groan , <unk> sweet music to its tone : " what ?
ever thus , in dismal round , shall pain and mystery profound pursue me like a sleepless hound , " with <unk> and eager jaws , me , still in ignorance of the cause , <unk> what i broke of laws ? "
the whisper to his ear did seem like echoed flow of silent stream , or shadow of forgotten dream , the whisper trembling in the wind : " her fate with thine was <unk> , " so spake it in his inner mind : " each <unk> on each a <unk> <name> : each proved the other 's blight and bar : each unto each were best , most far : " yea , each to each was worse than foe : thou , a scared <unk> , <unk> low , and she , an avalanche of woe ! "
<unk> con <unk> [ why is it that poetry has never yet been subjected to that process of <unk> which has proved so advantageous to her <unk> music ?
the <unk> gives us first a few notes of some well-known air , then a dozen bars of his own , then a few more notes of the air , and so on alternately : thus saving the listener , if not from all risk of recognising the <name> at all , at least from the too exciting transports which it might produce in a more concentrated form .
the process is termed " setting " by <unk> , and any one , that has ever experienced the emotion of being unexpectedly set down in a heap of mortar , <name> recognise the truthfulness of this happy phrase .
for truly , just as the genuine <unk> lingers lovingly over a morsel of supreme venison  whose every fibre seems to murmur " excelsior ! "
 yet swallows , ere returning to the <unk> dainty , great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> : and just as the perfect <unk> in claret permits himself but one delicate sip , and then <unk> off a pint or more of boarding-school beer : so also  i never loved a dear <unk>  nor anything that cost me much : high prices profit those who sell , but why should i be fond of such ?
to glad me with his soft black eye my son comes trotting home from school ; he 's had a fight but ca n't tell why  he always was a little fool !
but , when he came to know me well , he kicked me out , her <unk> sire : and when i stained my hair , that <name> might note the change , and thus admire and love me , it was sure to dye a muddy green or staring blue : whilst one might trace , with half an eye , the still triumphant carrot through .
a game of <unk> five little girls , of five , four , three , two , one : rolling on the <unk> , full of tricks and fun .
five <name> girls , in years from ten to six : sitting down to lessons  no more time for tricks .
five growing girls , from fifteen to eleven : music , drawing , languages , and food enough for seven !
five <unk> girls , from twenty to sixteen : each young man that calls , i say " now tell me which you mean ! "
five dashing girls , the youngest twenty-one : but , if nobody proposes , what is there to be done ?
five showy girls  but thirty is an age when girls may be engaging , but they somehow do n't engage .
five <unk> girls , of thirty-one or more : so gracious to the shy young men they snubbed so much before !
* * * * five <unk> girls  their age ?
well , never mind !
we jog along together , like the rest of human kind : but the <unk> " careless bachelor " begins to think he knows the answer to that ancient problem " how the money goes " !
<unk> fit , non <unk> " how shall i be a poet ?
how shall i write in rhyme ?
you told me once 'the very wish partook of the sublime . '
then tell me how !
do n't put me off with your <unk> time ' ! "
the old man smiled to see him , to hear his sudden <name> ; he liked the lad to speak his mind enthusiastically ; and thought " there 's no <unk> in him , nor any <unk> . "
" and would you be a poet before you 've been to school ?
ah , well !
i hardly thought you so absolute a fool .
first learn to be spasmodic  a very simple rule .
" for first you write a sentence , and then you chop it small ; then mix the bits , and sort them out just as they chance to fall : the order of the phrases makes no difference at all .
'then , if you 'd be impressive , remember what i say , that abstract qualities begin with capitals alway : the true , the good , the beautiful  those are the things that pay !
" next , when you are describing a shape , or sound , or tint ; do n't state the matter plainly , but put it in a hint ; and learn to look at all things with a sort of mental <unk> . "
" for instance , if i wished , sir , of <unk> to tell , should i say <unk> of fleecy flocks pent in a <unk> cell ' ? "
" why , yes , " the old man said : " that phrase would answer very well .
" then fourthly , there are epithets that suit with any word  as well as <name> 's reading sauce with fish , or flesh , or bird  of these , <unk> , ' <unk> , ' <unk> , ' <unk> , ' are much to be preferred . "
" and <name> it do , o <name> it do to take them in a lump  as 'the wild man went his weary way to a strange and lonely pump ' ? "
" nay , nay !
you must not hastily to such conclusions jump .
" such epithets , like pepper , give zest to what you write ; and , if you <unk> them <unk> , they <unk> the appetite : but if you lay them on too thick , you spoil the matter quite !
" last , as to the arrangement : your reader , you should show him , must take what information he can get , and look for no im mature disclosure of the drift and purpose of your poem .
" therefore , to test his <name>  how much he can endure  mention no places , names , or dates , and evermore be sure throughout the poem to be found consistently obscure .
" first fix upon the limit to which it shall extend : then fill it up with <unk> ( beg some of any friend ) : your great <unk> you place towards the end . "
" and what is a sensation , grandfather , tell me , pray ?
i think i never heard the word so used before to-day : be kind enough to mention one <unk> <unk> . ' "
and the old man , looking sadly across the <unk> , where here and there a <unk> yet glittered in the <name> , said " go to the <unk> , and see the <unk> <unk> . '
'the word is due to <unk>  the theory is his , where life becomes a spasm , and history a whiz : if that is not sensation , i do n't know what it is .
" now try your hand , ere fancy have lost its present glow  " " and then , " his grandson added , " we 'll publish it , you know : green cloth  <unk> at the back  in <unk> ! "
then proudly smiled that old man to see the eager lad rush madly for his pen and ink and for his <unk>  but , when he thought of publishing , his face grew stern and sad .
size and tears when on the <name> shore i sit , beside the salt <unk> , and fall into a weeping fit because i dare not shave  a little whisper at my ear <unk> the reason of my fear .
i answer " if that ruffian jones should recognise me here , he 'd bellow out my name in tones offensive to the ear : he <unk> me so on being stout ( a thing that always puts me out ) . "
ah me !
i see him on the <name> !
farewell , farewell to <name> , if he should look this way , and if he 's got his telescope !
to whatsoever place i flee , my odious rival follows me !
for every night , and everywhere , i meet him out at dinner ; and when i 've found some charming fair , and vowed to die or win her , the wretch ( he 's thin and i am stout ) is sure to come and cut me out !
the girls ( just like them ! )
all agree to praise j. jones , <unk> : i ask them what on earth they see about him to admire ?
they cry " he is so sleek and slim , it 's quite a treat to look at him ! "
they vanish in tobacco smoke , those visionary maids  i feel a sharp and sudden poke between the shoulder-blades  " why , brown , my boy !
your growing stout ! "
( i told you he would find me out ! )
" my growth is not your business , sir ! "
" no more it is , my boy !
but if it 's yours , as i infer , why , brown , i give you <name> !
a man , whose business <unk> so , is just the sort of man to know !
" it 's hardly safe , though , talking here  i 'd best get out of reach : for such a weight as yours , i fear , must shortly sink the beach ! "
 insult me thus because i 'm stout !
i vow i 'll go and call him out !
<unk> in <unk> ay , 't was here , on this spot , in that summer of yore , <unk> did not vote my presence a bore , nor reply to my tenderest talk " she had heard all that nonsense before . "
she 'd the brooch i had bought and the necklace and sash on , and her heart , as i thought , was alive to my passion ; and she 'd done up her hair in the style that the empress had brought into fashion .
i had been to the play with my <name> of a <unk>  but , for all i could say , she declared she was weary , that " the place was so crowded and hot , and she could n't abide that <unk> . "
then i thought " lucky boy !
't is for you that she <unk> ! "
and i noted with <name> those sensational <unk> : and i said " this is <unk> ! "
 a phrase i had learned from the devonshire <unk> .
and i vowed " 'twill be said i 'm a fortunate fellow , when the breakfast is spread , when the <unk> are mellow , when the foam of the <unk> is white , and the fierce <unk> are yellow ! "
o that languishing yawn !
o those eloquent eyes !
i was drunk with the <name> of a splendid surmise  i was stung by a look , i was slain by a tear , by a tempest of sighs .
then i whispered " i see the sweet secret thou <unk> .
and the yearning for me that thou wistfully <unk> !
and the question is <unk> or <unk> ?
' , though undoubtedly <unk> are the cheapest . "
" be my hero , " said i , " and let me be <unk> ! "
but i lost her reply  something ending with " gander "  for the omnibus rattled so loud that no mortal could quite understand her .
the <name> <unk> the ladye she stood at her lattice high , wi ' her doggie at her feet ; thorough the lattice she can spy the <unk> in the street , " there 's one that standeth at the door , and <unk> at the pin : now speak and say , my popinjay , if i <unk> let him in . "
then up and spake the popinjay that flew <unk> her head : " <unk> let him in that <unk> the pin : he cometh thee to <unk> " o when he cam ' the parlour in , a <unk> man was he !
" and <unk> ye <name> your lover <unk> , sae well that <unk> thee ? "
" and how wad i <name> ye loved me , sir , that have been sae <name> away ?
and how wad i <name> ye loved me , sir ?
ye never <unk> me sae . "
said  " ladye dear , " and the salt , salt tear cam ' <unk> ' doon his cheek , " i have sent the tokens of my love this many and many a week .
" o <unk> ye get the rings , ladye , the rings o ' the <unk> sae fine ?
i wot that i have sent to thee four score , four score and nine . "
" they cam ' to me , " said that fair ladye .
" wow , they were <unk> things ! "
said  " that chain o ' <unk> , my doggie to <unk> , it is made o ' <unk> self-same rings . "
" and <unk> ye get the locks , the locks , the locks o ' my ain black hair , <unk> i sent by post , <unk> i sent by box , <unk> i sent by the carrier ? "
" they cam ' to me , " said that fair ladye ; " and i prithee send <unk> <unk> ! "
said  " that cushion sae red , for my doggie 's head , it is stuffed wi ' <unk> locks o ' hair . "
" and <unk> ye get the letter , ladye , tied wi ' a silken string , <unk> i sent to thee <unk> the far <unk> , a message of love to bring ? "
" it cam ' to me <unk> the far <unk> wi ' its silken string and a ' ; but it <unk> <unk> , " said that <unk> maid , " sae i <unk> 'd them tak ' it awa ' . "
" o ever alack that ye sent it back , it was written sae <unk> and well !
now the message it brought , and the boon that it sought , i must even say it <unk> ' . "
then up and spake the popinjay , sae wisely <unk> he .
" now say it in the proper way : <unk> doon upon thy knee ! "
the lover he turned <unk> red and pale , went doon upon his knee : " o ladye , hear the <unk> tale that must be told to thee !
" for five <name> years , and five <name> years , i <unk> thee by looks ; by nods and winks , by smiles and tears , as i had read in books .
" for ten <name> years , o weary hours !
i <unk> thee by signs ; by sending game , by sending flowers , by sending <unk> .
" for five <name> years , and five <name> years , i have dwelt in the far <unk> , till that thy mind should be inclined <unk> tenderly to me .
" now thirty years are <unk> and past , i am come <unk> a foreign land : i am come to tell thee my love at last  o ladye , <unk> me thy hand ! "
the ladye she turned not pale nor red , but she smiled a pitiful smile : " sic ' a <unk> ' as yours , my man , " she said " takes a <name> and a weary while ! "
and out and laughed the popinjay , a laugh of bitter scorn : " a <unk> ' done in sic ' a way , it ought not to be borne ! "
wi ' that the doggie barked aloud , and up and doon he ran , and tugged and strained his chain o ' <unk> , all for to bite the man .
" o hush thee , gentle popinjay !
o hush thee , doggie dear !
there is a word i fain wad say , it <unk> he should hear ! "
aye louder screamed that ladye fair to drown her doggie 's bark : ever the lover shouted <unk> to make that ladye hark : shrill and more shrill the popinjay upraised his angry squall : i trow the doggie 's voice that day was louder than them all !
the <unk> and <unk> sat by the kitchen fire : they heard sic ' a din the parlour within as made them much admire .
out spake the boy in buttons ( i <unk> he <unk> thin ) , " now wha <name> <unk> the parlour <unk> , and stay this <unk> din ? "
and they have <unk> a <unk> , <unk> their <unk> in , for wha <name> <unk> the parlour <unk> , and stay that <unk> din .
when on that boy the <unk> fell to stay the <unk> noise , " <unk> in , " they cried , " <unk> betide , thou <name> of <unk> ! "
syne , he has <unk> a supple cane to <unk> that dog sae fat : the doggie <unk> , the doggie howled the louder aye for that .
syne , he has <unk> a <unk>  the doggie ceased his noise , and followed doon the kitchen stair that <name> of <unk> !
then sadly spake that ladye fair , wi ' a frown upon her brow : " o dearer to me is my <unk> ' doggie than a dozen sic ' as thou !
" <unk> use , <unk> use for sighs and tears : <unk> use at all to fret : sin ' ye 've <unk> sae well for thirty years , ye may bide a wee <unk> yet ! "
sadly , sadly he crossed the floor and <unk> at the pin : sadly went he through the door where sadly he cam ' in .
" o gin i had a popinjay to fly <unk> my head , to tell me what i ought to say , i had by this been <unk> " o gin i find <unk> ladye , " he said wi ' sighs and tears , " i wot my <unk> ' <unk> not be <unk> thirty years " for gin i find a ladye <name> , exactly to my taste , i 'll pop the question , aye or nay , in twenty years at <unk> . "
four riddles [ these consist of two double <unk> and two <unk> .
no .
i. was written at the request of some young friends , who had gone to a ball at an oxford commemoration  and also as a specimen of what might be done by making the double <unk> a connected poem instead of what it has hitherto been , a string of disjointed stanzas , on every conceivable subject , and about as interesting to read straight through as a <name> of a <unk> .
the first two stanzas describe the two main words , and each subsequent stanza one of the cross " lights . "
no .
ii .
was written after seeing miss <name> <name> perform in the play of " hamlet . "
in this case the first stanza describes the two main words .
no .
iii .
was written after seeing miss <name> <name> perform in mr. <name> 's play of " <unk> and <unk> . "
the three stanzas respectively describe " my first , " " my second , " and " my whole . " ]
i there was an ancient city , stricken down with a strange frenzy , and for many a day they paced from morn to <name> the crowded town , and danced the night away .
i asked the cause : the aged man grew sad : they pointed to a building gray and tall , and hoarsely answered " step inside , my lad , and then you 'll see it all . "
* * * * yet what are all such <unk> to me whose thoughts are full of <unk> and <unk> ?
<unk> + <unk> + 53 = <unk> but something whispered " it <name> soon be done : bands can not always play , nor ladies smile : endure with <name> the distasteful fun for just a little while ! "
a change came o'er my vision  it was night : we <unk> a pathway through a frantic throng : the steeds , <unk> , filled us with affright : the chariots whirled along .
within a marble hall a river ran  a living tide , half muslin and half cloth : and here one mourned a broken wreath or fan , yet swallowed down her wrath ; and here one offered to a thirsty fair ( his words <unk> amid those thunders <unk> ) some frozen <unk> ( there were many there ) , a <unk> in each spoonful .
there comes a happy pause , for human strength <name> not endure to dance without cessation ; and every one must reach the point at length of absolute prostration .
at such a moment ladies learn to give , to partners who would urge them <unk> , a flat and yet decided negative  <unk> love such .
there comes a welcome summons  <name> <unk> , and fading eyes grow bright , and pulses <unk> : incessant pop the corks , and busy knives dispense the tongue and chicken .
flushed with new life , the crowd flows back again : and all is tangled talk and <unk> motion  much like a waving field of golden grain , or a tempestuous ocean .
and thus they give the time , that nature meant for peaceful sleep and meditative snores , to ceaseless din and <unk> merriment and waste of shoes and floors .
and one ( we name him not ) that flies the flowers , that dreads the dances , and that shuns the <unk> , they doom to pass in solitude the hours , writing <unk> .
how late it grows !
the hour is surely past that should have warned us with its double knock ?
the twilight <unk> , and morning comes at last  " oh , uncle , what 's o'clock ? "
the uncle gravely nods , and wisely winks .
it may mean much , but how is one to know ?
he opens his mouth  yet out of it , methinks , no words of wisdom flow .
ii empress of <name> , for thee i twine this wreath with all too slender skill .
forgive my muse each halting line , and for the deed accept the <name> !
* * * * o day of tears !
whence comes this spectre grim , parting , like death 's cold river , souls that love ?
is not he bound to thee , as thou to him , by vows , <unk> here , yet heard above ?
and still it lives , that keen and heavenward flame , lives in his eye , and trembles in his tone : and these wild words of fury but proclaim a heart that beats for thee , for thee alone !
but all is lost : that mighty mind <unk> , like sweet bells <unk> , piteous sight to see !
" doubt that the stars are fire , " so runs his moan , " doubt truth herself , but not my love for thee ! "
a sadder vision yet : thine aged sire <unk> his hoary locks with treacherous <unk> !
and dost thou now doubt truth to be a liar ?
and wilt thou die , that hast forgot to smile ?
nay , get thee hence !
leave all thy <unk> ways and the faint fragrance of thy scattered flowers : in holy silence wait the appointed days , and weep away the <unk> hours .
iii .
the air is bright with hues of light and <name> with laughter and with singing : young hearts beat high in ecstasy , and banners wave , and bells are ringing : but silence falls with fading day , and there 's an end to mirth and play .
ah , <unk> rest your old bones , ye wrinkled <unk> !
the kettle sings , the firelight dances .
deep be it <unk> , the magic draught that fills the soul with golden fancies !
for youth and <unk> <name> not stay , and ye are withered , worn , and gray .
ah , <unk> !
o fair cold face !
o form of <name> , for human passion madly yearning !
o weary air of dumb despair , from marble won , to marble turning !
" leave us not thus ! "
we fondly pray .
" we can not let thee pass away ! "
ah , <unk> !
iv .
my first is singular at best : more plural is my second : my third is far the <unk>  so <unk> , i protest it scarcely can be reckoned !
my first is followed by a bird : my second by believers in magic <name> : my simple third follows , too often , hopes absurd and plausible <unk> .
my first to get at wisdom tries  a failure melancholy !
my second men revered as wise : my third from heights of wisdom flies to depths of frantic folly .
my first is <unk> day by day : my second 's age is ended : my third enjoys an age , they say , that never seems to fade away , through centuries extended .
my whole ?
i need a poet 's pen to paint her myriad phases : the monarch , and the slave , of men  a <unk> , and a den of dark and deadly mazes  a flashing light  a fleeting shade  beginning , end , and middle of all that human <name> hath made or wit devised !
go , seek her aid , if you would read my riddle !
fame 's <unk> [ affectionately dedicated to all " original <unk> " who pant for " endowment . " ]
blow , blow your trumpets till they crack , ye little men of little souls !
and bid them huddle at your back  <unk> <unk> , shoals on shoals !
fill all the air with hungry wails  " reward us , ere we think or write !
without your gold mere knowledge fails to sate the <unk> appetite ! "
and , where great plato paced serene , or <name> paused with wistful eye , rush to the <unk> with hoofs unclean and <unk> of the sty be yours the pay : be theirs the praise : we <name> not <name> them of their due , nor vex the ghosts of other days by naming them along with you .
they sought and found undying fame : they toiled not for reward nor thanks : their cheeks are hot with honest shame for you , the modern <unk> !
who preach of justice  plead with tears that love and <name> should abound  while marking with complacent ears the moaning of some tortured hound : who prate of wisdom  nay , forbear , lest wisdom turn on you in wrath , trampling , with heel that <name> not spare , the vermin that beset her path !
go , throng each other 's drawing-rooms , ye idols of a petty <unk> : strut your brief hour in borrowed plumes , and make your <unk> squeak .
deck your dull talk with <unk> shreds of learning from a nobler time , and oil each other 's little heads with mutual flattery 's golden slime : and when the topmost height ye gain , and stand in <name> 's ether clear , and grasp the prize of all your pain  so many hundred pounds a year  then let fame 's banner be <unk> !
sing <unk> for a victory won !
ye tapers , that would light the world , and cast a shadow on the sun  who still shall pour his rays sublime , one <name> flood , from east to west , when ye have burned your little time and feebly flickered into rest !

the <unk> .
one <name> night , at half-past nine , cold , tired , and cross , and muddy , i had come home , too late to dine , and supper , with cigars and wine , was waiting in the study .
there was a strangeness in the room , and something white and wavy was standing near me in the gloom  i took it for the <unk> left by that careless <unk> .
[ illustration ] but presently the thing began to shiver and to sneeze : on which i said " come , come , my man !
that 's a most inconsiderate plan .
less noise there , if you please ! "
" i 've caught a cold , " the thing replies , " out there upon the landing . "
i turned to look in some surprise , and there , before my very eyes , a little ghost was standing !
he trembled when he caught my eye , and got behind a chair .
" how came you here , " i said , " and why ?
i never saw a thing so shy .
come out !
do n't shiver there ! "
he said " i 'd gladly tell you how , and also tell you why ; but " ( here he gave a little bow ) " you 're in so bad a temper now , you 'd think it all a lie .
" and as to being in a fright , allow me to remark that ghosts have just as good a right , in every way , to fear the light , as men to fear the dark . "
" no plea , " said i , " can well excuse such cowardice in you : for ghosts can visit when they choose , whereas we humans ca'n't refuse to <name> the interview . "
he said " a flutter of alarm is not unnatural , is it ?
i really feared you meant some harm : but , now i see that you are calm , let me explain my visit .
" houses are classed , i beg to state , according to the number of ghosts that they accommodate : ( the tenant merely counts as weight , with coals and other lumber ) .
" this is a <unk> ' house , and you when you arrived last summer , may have remarked a spectre who was doing all that ghosts can do to welcome the new-comer .
" in villas this is always done  however cheaply rented : for , though of course there 's less of fun when there is only room for one , ghosts have to be contented .
" that spectre left you on the third  since then you 've not been haunted : for , as he never sent us word , 't was quite by accident we heard that any one was wanted .
" a spectre has first choice , by right , in filling up a vacancy ; then phantom , goblin , <unk> , and sprite  if all these fail them , they invite the nicest ghoul that they can see .
" the spectres said the place was low , and that you kept bad wine : so , as a phantom had to go , and i was first , of course , you know , i could n't well decline . "
" no doubt , " said i , " they settled who was fittest to be sent : yet still to choose a brat like you , to haunt a man of forty-two , was no great compliment ! "
" i 'm not so young , sir , " he replied , " as you might think .
the fact is , in caverns by the water-side , and other places that i 've tried , i 've had a lot of practice : " but i have never taken yet a strict domestic part , and in my flurry i forget the five good rules of etiquette we have to know by heart . "
my sympathies were warming fast towards the little fellow : he was so utterly aghast at having found a man at last , and looked so scared and yellow .
[ illustration : " in caverns by the water-side " ] " at least , " i said , " i 'm glad to find a ghost is not a dumb thing !
but pray sit down : you 'll feel inclined ( if , like myself , you have not dined ) to take a <unk> of something : " though , certainly , you do n't appear a thing to offer food to !
and then i shall be glad to hear  if you <name> say them loud and clear  the rules that you allude to . "
" thanks !
you shall hear them by and by this is a piece of luck ! "
" what may i offer you ? "
said i .
" well , since you are so kind , i 'll try a little bit of duck .
" one slice !
and may i ask you for another drop of gravy ? "
i sat and looked at him in awe , for certainly i never saw a thing so white and wavy .
[ illustration ] and still he seemed to grow more white , more <unk> , and <unk>  seen in the dim and flickering light , as he proceeded to recite his " maxims of behaviour . "
canto ii .
<unk> <unk> rules .
" my first  but do n't suppose , " he said , " i 'm setting you a riddle  is  if your victim be in bed , do n't touch the curtains at his head , but take them in the middle , " and wave them slowly in and out , while drawing them asunder ; and in a minute 's time , no doubt , he 'll raise his head and look about with eyes of wrath and wonder .
" and here you must on no pretence make the first observation .
wait for the victim to commence : no ghost of any common sense begins a conversation .
[ illustration ] " if he should say <unk> came you here ? ' ( the way that you began , sir , ) in such a case your course is clear  <unk> the bat 's back , my little dear ! ' is the appropriate answer .
" if after this he says no more , you 'd best perhaps curtail your exertions  go and shake the door , and then , if he begins to snore , you 'll know the thing 's a failure .
" by day , if he should be alone  at home or on a walk  you merely give a hollow groan , to indicate the kind of tone in which you mean to talk .
" but if you find him with his friends , the thing is rather harder .
in such a case success depends on picking up some <unk> , or butter , in the larder .
" with this you make a kind of slide ( it answers best with suet ) , on which you must contrive to glide , and swing yourself from side to side  one soon learns how to do it .
" the second tells us what is right in ceremonious calls :  <unk> burn a blue or crimson <unk> ( a thing i quite forgot to-night ) , <unk> scratch the door or <unk> ' " [ illustration : " and swing yourself from side to side " ] i said " you 'll visit here no more , if you attempt the <name> .
i 'll have no bonfires on my floor  and , as for scratching at the door , i 'd like to see you try ! "
" the third was written to protect the interests of the victim , and tells us , as i recollect , to treat him with a grave respect , and not to contradict him . "
" that 's plain , " said i , " as <unk> and <unk> , to any comprehension : i only wish some ghosts i 've met would not so constantly forget the maxim that you mention ! "
" perhaps , " he said , " you first <unk> the laws of hospitality : all ghosts instinctively detest the man that fails to treat his guest with proper cordiality .
[ illustration ] " if you address a ghost as <unk> ! '
or strike him with a hatchet , he is permitted by the king to drop all formal <unk>  and then you 're sure to catch it !
" the fourth <unk> <unk> where other ghosts are quartered : and those convicted of the thing ( unless when pardoned by the king ) must instantly be slaughtered .
" that simply means 'be cut up small ' : ghosts soon unite anew : the process scarcely hurts at all  not more than when you're what you call <unk> up ' by a review .
" the fifth is one you may prefer that i should quote entire :  the king must be addressed as 'sir . '
this , from a simple courtier , is all the laws require : " but , should you wish to do the thing with out-and-out politeness , accost him as 'my goblin king ! '
and always use , in answering , the phrase 'your <name> whiteness !
' " i 'm getting rather hoarse , i fear , after so much reciting : so , if you do n't object , my dear , we 'll try a glass of bitter beer  i think it looks inviting . "
[ illustration ] canto iii .
<unk> .
" and did you really walk , " said i , " on such a wretched night ?
i always fancied ghosts could fly  if not exactly in the sky , yet at a <unk> height . "
" it 's very well , " said he , " for kings to soar above the earth : but phantoms often find that wings  like many other pleasant things  cost more than they are worth .
" spectres of course are <name> , and so can buy them from the <unk> : but we prefer to keep below  they 're stupid company , you know .
for any but themselves : [ illustration ] " for , though they claim to be exempt from pride , they treat a phantom as something quite beneath contempt  just as no turkey ever dreamt of noticing a bantam . "
" they seem too proud , " said i , " to go to houses such as mine .
pray , how did they contrive to know so quickly that 'the place was low , ' and that i <unk> bad wine ' ? "
" inspector <unk> came to you  " the little ghost began .
here i broke in  " inspector who ?
inspecting ghosts is something new !
explain yourself my man ! "
" his name is <unk> , " said my guest : " one of the spectre order : you 'll very often see him dressed in a yellow gown , a crimson vest , and a <unk> with a border .
" he tried the <unk> business first , but caught a sort of chill ; so came to england to be nursed , and here it took the form of thirst , which he complains of still .
[ illustration : " and here it took the form of thirst " ] " <unk> , he says , when <name> and sound , <unk> his old bones like nectar : and as the inns , where it is found , are his especial <unk> , we call him the <unk> . "
i bore it  bore it like a man  this agonizing <unk> !
and nothing could be sweeter than my temper , till the ghost began some most provoking criticism .
" cooks need not be indulged in waste ; yet still you 'd better teach them dishes should have some sort of taste .
pray , why are all the <unk> placed where nobody can reach them ?
" that man of yours <name> never earn his living as a waiter !
is that queer thing supposed to burn ?
( it 's far too dismal a concern to call a moderator ) .
" the duck was tender , but the peas were very much too old : and just remember , if you please , the next time you have toasted cheese , do n't let them send it cold .
" you 'd find the bread improved , i think , by getting better flour : and have you anything to drink that looks a little less like ink , and is n't quite so sour ? "
then , peering round with curious eyes , he muttered " goodness gracious ! "
and so went on to criticise  " your room 's an inconvenient size : it 's neither snug nor spacious .
" that narrow window , i expect , serves but to let the dusk in  " " but please , " said i , " to recollect 't was fashioned by an architect who pinned his <name> on ruskin ! "
" i do n't care who he was , sir , or on whom he pinned his <name> !
constructed by whatever law , so poor a job i never saw , as i 'm a living <unk> !
" what a <unk> cigar !
how much are they a dozen ? "
i growled " no matter what they are !
you 're getting as familiar as if you were my cousin !
" now that 's a thing i <name> not stand , and so i tell you flat . "
" aha , " said he , " we 're getting grand ! "
( taking a bottle in his hand ) " i 'll soon arrange for that ! "
and here he took a careful aim , and gaily cried " here goes ! "
i tried to dodge it as it came , but somehow caught it , all the same , exactly on my nose .
and i remember nothing more that i can clearly fix , till i was sitting on the floor , repeating " two and five are four , but five and two are six . "
what really passed i never learned , nor guessed : i only know that , when at last my sense returned , the lamp , neglected , dimly burned  the fire was getting low  through driving mists i seemed to see a thing that <unk> and smiled : and found that he was giving me a lesson in biography , as if i were a child .
[ illustration ] canto iv .
<unk> <unk> .
" oh , when i was a little ghost , a <name> time had we !
each seated on his favourite post , we <unk> and <unk> the buttered toast they gave us for our tea . "
" that story is in print ! "
i cried .
" do n't say it 's not , because it 's known as well as bradshaw 's guide ! "
( the ghost uneasily replied he hardly thought it was ) .
" it 's not in nursery rhymes ?
and yet i almost think it is  'three little <unk> ' were set 'on <unk> , ' you know , and ate their <unk> <unk> . '
" i have the book ; so , if you doubt it  " i turned to search the shelf .
" do n't stir ! "
he cried .
" we 'll do without it ; i now remember all about it ; i wrote the thing myself .
" it came out in a <unk> , ' or at least my agent said it did : some literary swell , who saw it , thought it seemed adapted for the magazine he edited .
" my father was a <unk> , sir ; my mother was a <name> .
the notion had occurred to her , the children would be happier , if they were taught to vary .
" the notion soon became a craze ; and , when it once began , she brought us all out in different ways  one was a <unk> , two were <unk> , another was a <unk> ; " the fetch and <unk> went to school , and gave a lot of trouble ; next came a <unk> and ghoul , and then two <unk> ( which broke the rule ) , a goblin , and a double  " ( if that 's a <unk> on the shelf , " he added with a yawn , " i 'll take a pinch )  next came an <unk> , and then a phantom ( that 's myself ) , and last , a <unk> .
" one day , some spectres chanced to call , dressed in the usual white : i stood and watched them in the hall , and could n't make them out at all , they seemed so strange a sight .
[ illustration ] " i wondered what on earth they were , that looked all head and sack ; but mother told me not to stare , and then she twitched me by the hair , and punched me in the back .
" since then i 've often wished that i had been a spectre born .
but what 's the use ? "
( he heaved a sigh ) .
" they are the <unk> , and look on us with scorn .
" my <unk> was soon begun : when i was barely six , i went out with an older one  and just at first i thought it fun , and learned a lot of tricks .
" i 've haunted dungeons , castles , towers  wherever i was sent : i 've often sat and howled for hours , drenched to the skin with driving showers , upon a <unk> .
" it 's quite old-fashioned now to groan when you begin to speak : this is the newest thing in tone  " and here ( it chilled me to the bone ) he gave an awful squeak .
" perhaps , " he added , " to your ear that sounds an easy thing ?
try it yourself , my little dear !
it took me something like a year , with constant practising .
" and when you 've learned to squeak , my man and caught the double sob , you 're pretty much where you began : just try and <unk> if you can !
that 's something like a job !
" i've tried it , and can only say i 'm sure you could n't do it , e ven if you practised night and day , unless you have a turn that way , and natural ingenuity .
" shakspeare i think it is who treats of ghosts , in days of old , who <unk> in the <name> streets , ' dressed , if you recollect , in sheets  they must have found it cold .
" i 've often spent ten pounds on stuff , in dressing as a double ; but , though it answers as a puff , it never has effect enough to make it worth the trouble .
" long bills soon quenched the little thirst i had for being funny .
the <unk> is always worst : such heaps of things you want at first , one must be made of money !
[ illustration ] " for instance , take a haunted tower , with skull , <unk> , and sheet ; blue lights to burn ( say ) two an hour , condensing lens of extra power , and set of chains complete : " what with the things you have to hire  the fitting on the robe  and testing all the coloured fire  the outfit of itself would tire the <name> of a job !
" and then they 're so fastidious , the <unk> committee : i 've often known them make a fuss because a ghost was french , or <name> , or even from the city !
" some dialects are objected to  for one , the <name> <unk> is : and then , for all you have to do , one pound a week they offer you , and find yourself in <unk> ! "
canto v. <unk> .
" do n't they consult the <unk> , ' though ? "
i said .
" they should , by rights , give them a chance  because , you know , the tastes of people differ so , especially in <unk> . "
the phantom shook his head and smiled .
" consult them ?
not a bit !
'twould be a job to drive one wild , to satisfy one single child  there 'd be no end to it ! "
" of course you ca n't leave children free , " said i , " to pick and choose : but , in the case of men like me , i think <unk> host ' might fairly be allowed to state his views . "
he said " it really would n't pay  folk are so full of fancies .
we visit for a single day , and whether then we go , or stay , depends on circumstances .
" and , though we do n't consult <unk> <unk> before the thing 's arranged , still , if he often quits his post , or is not a <unk> ghost , then you can have him changed .
" but if the host 's a man like you  i mean a man of sense ; and if the house is not too new  " " why , what has that , " said i , " to do with ghost 's convenience ? "
" a new house does not suit , you know  it 's such a job to trim it : but , after twenty years or so , the <unk> begin to go , so twenty is the limit . "
" to trim " was not a phrase i could remember having heard : " perhaps , " i said , " you 'll be so good as tell me what is understood exactly by that word ? "
[ illustration ] " it means the loosening all the doors , " the ghost replied , and laughed : " it means the drilling holes by scores in all the <unk> and floors , to make a thorough draught .
" you 'll sometimes find that one or two are all you really need to let the wind come whistling through  but here there 'll be a lot to do ! "
i faintly gasped " indeed !
" if i 'd been rather later , i'll be bound , " i added , trying ( most <unk> ) to smile , " you 'd have been busy all this while , trimming and <unk> ? "
" why , no , " said he ; " perhaps i should have stayed another minute  but still no ghost , that 's any good , without an introduction would have ventured to begin it .
" the proper thing , as you were late , was certainly to go : but , with the roads in such a state , i got the <unk> 's leave to wait for half an hour or so . "
" who 's the <unk> ? "
i cried .
instead of answering my question , " well !
if you do n't know that , " he said , " either you never go to bed , or you 've a grand digestion !
" he goes about and sits on folk that eat too much at night : his duties are to pinch , and poke , and squeeze them till they nearly choke . "
( i said " it serves them right ! " )
" and folk that sup on things like these  " he muttered , " eggs and bacon  lobster  and duck  and toasted cheese  if they do n't get an awful squeeze , i 'm very much mistaken !
" he is immensely fat , and so well suits the occupation : in point of fact , if you must know , we used to call him , years ago , the mayor and corporation !
[ illustration : " he goes about and sits on folk " ] " the day he was elected mayor i know that every sprite meant to vote for me , but did not dare  he was so frantic with despair and furious with excitement .
[ illustration ] " when it was over , for a whim , he ran to tell the king ; and being the reverse of slim , a <unk> trot was not for him a very easy thing .
" so , to reward him for his run ( as it was baking hot , and he was over twenty stone ) , the king proceeded , half in fun , to knight him on the spot . "
" 't was a great <name> to take ! "
( i fired up like a rocket ) .
" he did it just for <unk> 's sake : 'the man , ' says <name> , 'that would make a pun , would pick a pocket ! ' "
" a man , " said he , " is not a king . "
i argued for a while , and did my best to prove the thing  the phantom merely listening with a contemptuous smile .
at last , when , breath and <name> spent , i had recourse to smoking  " your aim , " he said , " is excellent : but  when you call it argument  of course you 're only joking ? "
[ illustration ] stung by his cold and <unk> eye , i roused myself at length to say " at least i do defy the veriest <unk> to deny that union is strength ! "
" that 's true enough , " said he , " yet stay  " i listened in all meekness  " union is strength , i 'm bound to say ; in fact , the thing 's as clear as day ; but onions  are a weakness . "
canto <name> .
<unk> .
as one who strives a hill to climb , who never climbed before : who finds it , in a little time , grow every moment less sublime , and votes the thing a bore : yet , having once begun to try , dares not desert his quest , but , climbing , ever keeps his eye on one small hut against the sky , wherein he hopes to rest : who climbs till nerve and force are spent , with many a puff and pant : who still , as rises the ascent , in language grows more violent , although in breath more scant : [ illustration ] who , climbing , gains at length the place that crowns the upward track ; and , entering with unsteady pace , receives a buffet in the face that lands him on his back : and feels himself , like one in sleep , glide swiftly down again , a helpless weight , from steep to steep , till , with a headlong giddy sweep , he drops upon the plain  so i , that had resolved to bring conviction to a ghost , and found it quite a different thing from any human arguing , yet dared not quit my post but , keeping still the end in view to which i hoped to come , i strove to prove the matter true by putting everything i knew into an axiom : commencing every single phrase with <unk> ' or 'because , ' i blindly reeled , a hundred ways , about the <unk> maze , unconscious where i was .
quoth he " that 's regular <unk> : do n't bluster any more .
now do be cool and take a nap !
such a ridiculous old chap was never seen before !
" you 're like a man i used to meet , who got one day so furious in arguing , the simple heat scorched both his slippers off his feet ! "
i said " that 's very curious !  " [ illustration : " scorched both his slippers off his feet " ] " well , it is curious , i agree , and sounds perhaps like <unk> : but still it 's true as true can be  as sure as your name 's <unk> , " said he .
i said " my name 's not <unk> . "
" not <unk> ! "
he cried  his tone became a shade or two less hearty  " why , no , " said i .
" my proper name is <unk>  " " <unk> ? "
" aye , the same . "
" why , then you 're not the party ! "
with that he struck the board a blow that shivered half the glasses .
" why could n't you have told me so three quarters of an hour ago , you <name> of all the asses ?
" to walk four miles through mud and rain , to spend the night in smoking , and then to find that it 's in vain  and i 've to do it all again  it 's really too provoking !
[ illustration ] " do n't talk ! "
he cried , as i began to mutter some excuse .
" who can have <name> with a man that 's got no more discretion than an idiotic goose ?
" to keep me waiting here , instead of telling me at once that this was not the house ! "
he said .
" there , that 'll do  be off to bed !
do n't gape like that , you dunce ! "
" it 's very fine to throw the blame on me in such a fashion !
why did n't you enquire my name the very minute that you came ? "
i answered in a passion .
" of course it worries you a bit to come so far on foot  but how was i to blame for it ? "
" well , well ! "
said he .
" i must admit that is n't badly put .
" and certainly you 've given me the best of wine and <unk>  excuse my violence , " said he , " but accidents like this , you see , they put one out a little .
" 't was my fault after all , i find  shake hands , old <unk> ! "
the name was hardly to my mind , but , as no doubt he meant it kind , i let the matter drop .
" good-night , old <unk> , good-night !
when i am gone , perhaps they 'll send you some inferior sprite , who 'll keep you in a constant fright and spoil your soundest <unk> .
" tell him you 'll stand no sort of trick ; then , if he <unk> and chuckles , you just be handy with a stick ( mind that it 's pretty hard and thick ) and rap him on the knuckles !
" then carelessly remark 'old coon !
perhaps you 're not aware that , if you do n't behave , you 'll soon be chuckling to another tune  and so you 'd best take care ! '
" that 's the right way to cure a sprite of <unk> <unk>  but gracious me !
it 's getting light !
good-night , old <unk> , good-night ! "
a nod , and he was gone .
[ illustration ] canto vii .
sad <unk> .
[ illustration ] " what 's this ? "
i pondered .
" have i slept ?
or can i have been drinking ? "
but soon a gentler feeling crept upon me , and i sat and wept an hour or so , like winking .
" no need for bones to hurry so ! "
i sobbed .
" in fact , i doubt if it was worth his while to go  and who is <unk> , i 'd like to know , to make such work about ?
" if <unk> is anything like me , it 's possible , " i said , " he wo n't be <unk> to be dropped in upon at half-past three , after he 's snug in bed .
" and if bones plagues him anyhow  squeaking and all the rest of it , as he was doing here just now  i prophesy there 'll be a row , and <unk> <name> have the best of it ! "
then , as my tears could never bring the friendly phantom back , it seemed to me the proper thing to mix another glass , and sing the following <unk> .
[ illustration : " and <unk> <name> have the best of it " ] <unk> <name> thou gone , beloved ghost ?
best of <unk> !
nay then , farewell , my <unk> roast , farewell , farewell , my tea and toast , my <unk> and cigars !  <unk> hues of life are dull and gray , the sweets of life insipid , when thou , my <unk> , <name> away  old brick , or rather , let me say , old <unk> ! ' instead of singing verse the third , i ceased  abruptly , rather : but , after such a splendid word , i felt that it would be absurd to try it any farther .
so with a yawn i went my way to seek the welcome downy , and slept , and dreamed till break of day of <unk> and fetch and <name> and <unk> and <unk> !
for years i 've not been visited by any kind of sprite ; yet still they <name> in my head , those parting words , so kindly said , " old <unk> , good-night ! "
[ illustration ] echoes .
<name> <name> vere de vere was eight years old , she said : every <unk> , lightly shaken , ran itself in golden thread .
she took her little <unk> : of me she shall not win renown : for the baseness of its nature shall have strength to drag her down .
" sisters and brothers , little maid ?
there stands the inspector at thy door : like a dog , he hunts for boys who know not two and two are four . "
" kind words are more than <unk> , " she said , and wondering looked at me : " it is the dead unhappy night , and i must hurry home to tea . "
a sea dirge .
[ illustration ] there are certain things  as , a spider , a ghost , the <unk> , gout , an umbrella for three  that i hate , but the thing that i hate the most is a thing they call the sea .
pour some salt water over the floor  ugly i 'm sure you 'll allow it to be : suppose it extended a mile or more , that's very like the sea .
beat a dog till it howls outright  cruel , but all very well for a spree : suppose that he did so day and night , that would be like the sea .
i had a vision of <unk> ; tens of thousands passed by me  all leading children with wooden spades , and this was by the sea .
who invented those spades of wood ?
who was it cut them out of the tree ?
none , i think , but an idiot could  or one that loved the sea .
it is pleasant and dreamy , no doubt , to float with <unk> as boundless , and souls as free ' : but , suppose you are very unwell in the boat , how do you like the sea ?
[ illustration : " and this was by the sea " ] there is an insect that people avoid ( whence is derived the verb 'to flee ' ) .
where have you been by it most annoyed ?
in lodgings by the sea .
if you like your coffee with sand for <unk> , a decided hint of salt in your tea , and a fishy taste in the very eggs  by all means choose the sea .
and if , with these dainties to drink and eat , you prefer not a vestige of grass or tree , and a chronic state of wet in your feet , then  i recommend the sea .
for i have friends who dwell by the coast  pleasant friends they are to me !
it is when i am with them i wonder most that any one likes the sea .
they take me a walk : though tired and stiff , to climb the heights i madly agree ; and , after a tumble or so from the <name> , they kindly suggest the sea .
i try the rocks , and i think it cool that they laugh with such an excess of glee , as i heavily slip into every pool that skirts the cold cold sea .

[ illustration : " i have a horse " ] hiawatha 's <unk> .
[ in an age of imitation , i can claim no special merit for this slight attempt at doing what is known to be so easy .
any fairly practised writer , with the slightest ear for rhythm , could compose , for hours together , in the easy running metre of 'the song of hiawatha . '
having , then , distinctly stated that i challenge no attention in the following little poem to its merely verbal jingle , i must beg the candid reader to confine his criticism to its treatment of the subject . ]
from his shoulder hiawatha took the camera of rosewood , made of sliding , folding rosewood ; neatly put it all together .
in its case it lay compactly , folded into nearly nothing ; but he opened out the hinges , pushed and pulled the joints and hinges , till it looked all squares and <unk> , like a complicated figure in the second book of euclid .
[ illustration ] this he perched upon a tripod  crouched beneath its dusky cover  stretched his hand , enforcing silence  said " be motionless , i beg you ! "
mystic , awful was the process .
all the family in order sat before him for their pictures : each in turn , as he was taken , volunteered his own suggestions , his ingenious suggestions .
first the governor , the father : he suggested <name> curtains looped about a massy pillar ; and the corner of a table , of a rosewood <unk> .
he would hold a scroll of something , hold it firmly in his left-hand ; he would keep his right-hand buried ( like <name> ) in his waistcoat ; he would contemplate the distance with a look of pensive meaning , as of ducks that die in tempests .
grand , heroic was the notion : yet the picture failed entirely : failed , because he moved a little , moved , because he could n't help it .
next , his better half took courage ; she would have her picture taken .
she came dressed beyond description , dressed in jewels and in satin far too gorgeous for an empress .
[ illustration : " first the governor , the father " ] gracefully she sat down sideways , with a <unk> scarcely human , holding in her hand a bouquet rather larger than a cabbage .
all the while that she was sitting , still the <name> chattered , chattered , like a monkey in the forest .
" am i sitting still ? "
she asked him .
" is my face enough in profile ?
shall i hold the bouquet higher ?
<name> it come into the picture ? "
and the picture failed completely .
next the son , the <unk> : he suggested curves of beauty , curves pervading all his figure , which the eye might follow onward , till they centered in the <unk> , centered in the golden <unk> .
he had learnt it all from ruskin ( author of 'the stones of <name> , ' <unk> lamps of architecture , ' 'modern painters , ' and some others ) ; and perhaps he had not fully understood his author 's meaning ; but , whatever was the reason , all was fruitless , as the picture ended in an utter failure .
[ illustration : " next the son , the <unk> " ] next to him the eldest daughter : she suggested very little , only asked if he would take her with her look of <unk> beauty . '
her idea of passive beauty was a <unk> of the <unk> , was a drooping of the <unk> , was a smile that went up sideways to the corner of the nostrils .
hiawatha , when she asked him , took no notice of the question , looked as if he had n't heard it ; but , when pointedly appealed to , smiled in his peculiar manner , coughed and said it 'did n't matter , ' bit his lip and changed the subject .
nor in this was he mistaken , as the picture failed completely .
so in turn the other sisters .
[ illustration : " next to him the eldest daughter " ] last , the youngest son was taken : very rough and thick his hair was , very round and red his face was , very <name> was his jacket , very <unk> his manner .
and his overbearing sisters called him names he disapproved of : called him <name> , <unk> 's darling , ' called him <unk> , <unk> school-boy . '
and , so awful was the picture , in comparison the others seemed , to one 's bewildered fancy , to have partially succeeded .
finally my hiawatha tumbled all the tribe together , ( <unk> ' is not the right expression ) , and , as happy chance would have it , did at last obtain a picture where the faces all succeeded : each came out a perfect likeness .
[ illustration : " last , the youngest son was taken " ] then they joined and all abused it , <unk> abused it , as the worst and <unk> picture they could possibly have dreamed of .
giving one such strange expressions  sullen , stupid , pert expressions .
really any one would take us ( any one that did not know us ) for the most unpleasant people ! '
( hiawatha seemed to think so , seemed to think it not unlikely ) .
all together rang their voices , angry , loud , discordant voices , as of dogs that howl in concert , as of cats that wail in chorus .
but my hiawatha 's <name> , his politeness and his <name> , unaccountably had vanished , and he left that happy party .
neither did he leave them slowly , with the calm deliberation , the intense deliberation of a <unk> artist : but he left them in a hurry , left them in a mighty hurry , stating that he would not stand it , stating in emphatic language what he 'd be before he 'd stand it .
hurriedly he packed his boxes : hurriedly the <name> trundled on a barrow all his boxes : hurriedly he took his ticket : hurriedly the train received him : thus departed hiawatha .
[ illustration ] <unk> .
with saddest music all day long she soothed her secret sorrow : at night she sighed " i fear 't was wrong such cheerful words to borrow .
dearest , a sweeter , sadder song i 'll sing to thee to-morrow . "
i thanked her , but i could not say that i was glad to hear it : i left the house at break of day , and did not venture near it till time , i hoped , had worn away her grief , for nought could cheer it !
[ illustration : " at night she sighed " ] my dismal sister !
couldst thou know the wretched home thou <unk> !
thy brother , drowned in daily woe , is thankful when thou <unk> ; for if i laugh , however low , when <unk> awake , thou <unk> !
i took my sister t'other day ( excuse the slang expression ) to sadler 's wells to see the play , in hopes the new impression might in her thoughts , from grave to <name> effect some slight digression .
i asked three <name> young dogs from town to join us in our folly , whose mirth , i thought , might serve to drown my sister 's melancholy : the lively jones , the <unk> brown , and robinson the jolly .
the maid announced the meal in tones that i myself had taught her , meant to allay my sister 's moans like oil on troubled water : i rushed to jones , the lively jones , and begged him to escort her .
vainly he strove , with ready wit , to joke about the weather  to <unk> the last <unk> dit '  to quote the price of leather  she groaned " here i and sorrow sit : let us lament together ! "
i urged " you 're wasting time , you know : delay <name> spoil the venison . "
" my heart is wasted with my woe !
there is no rest  in <name> , on the bridge of sighs ! "
she quoted low from <name> and from tennyson .
i need not tell of soup and fish in solemn silence swallowed , the sobs that ushered in each dish , and its departure followed , nor yet my <unk> wish to be the cheese i hollowed .
some desperate attempts were made to start a conversation ; " madam , " the <unk> brown essayed , " which kind of recreation , hunting or fishing , have you made your special occupation ? "
her lips curved downwards instantly , as if of india-rubber .
" hounds in full cry i like , " said she : ( oh how i longed to snub her ! )
" of fish , a whale 's the one for me , it is so full of blubber ! "
the night 's performance was " king <name> . "
" it 's dull , " she wept , " and <unk> ! "
a while i let her tears flow on , she said they soothed her woe so !
at length the curtain rose upon <unk> <unk> . '
in vain we roared ; in vain we tried to rouse her into laughter : her pensive glances wandered wide from orchestra to <unk>  " tier upon tier !  " she said , and sighed ; and silence followed after .
[ illustration ] a <name> .
[ sent to a friend who had complained that i was glad enough to see him when he came , but did n't seem to miss him if he stayed away . ]
and can not pleasures , while they last , be actual unless , when past , they leave us shuddering and aghast , with anguish <unk> ?
and can not friends be firm and fast , and yet bear parting ?
and must i then , at friendship 's call , calmly resign the little all ( trifling , i <name> , it is and small ) i have of gladness , and lend my being to the thrall of gloom and sadness ?
and think you that i should be dumb , and full <unk> <unk> , excepting when you choose to come and share my dinner ?
at other times be sour and glum and daily thinner ?
must he then only live to weep , who 'd prove his friendship true and deep ?
by day a lonely shadow creep , at <unk> <unk> , oft raising in his broken sleep the moan of anguish ?
the lover , if for certain days his fair one be denied his gaze , sinks not in grief and wild <unk> , but , wiser <unk> , he spends the time in writing lays , and posts them to her .
and if the verse flow free and fast , till even the poet is aghast , a touching <name> at last the post shall <name> , when thirteen days are gone and past of february .
farewell , dear friend , and when we meet , in desert waste or crowded street , perhaps before this week shall fleet , perhaps to-morrow , i trust to find your heart the seat of wasting sorrow .
the three voices .
the first voice .
[ illustration ] he <unk> a <name> fresh and free : he laughed aloud for very glee : there came a breeze from off the sea : it passed athwart the <unk> flat  it fanned his forehead as he sat  it lightly bore away his hat , all to the feet of one who stood like maid enchanted in a wood , frowning as darkly as she could .
with huge umbrella , lank and brown , <unk> she pinned it down , right through the centre of the crown .
then , with an aspect cold and grim , regardless of its battered rim , she took it up and gave it him .
a while like one in dreams he stood , then faltered forth his gratitude in words just short of being rude : for it had lost its shape and shine , and it had cost him <unk> , and he was going out to dine .
[ illustration : " <unk> she pinned it down . " ]
" to dine ! "
she sneered in acid tone .
" to bend thy being to a bone clothed in a radiance not its own ! "
the <unk> trickled to his <name> : there was a meaning in her grin that made him feel on fire within .
" term it not <unk> , ' " said he : " 't is solid nutriment to me .
dinner is dinner : tea is tea . "
and she " yea so ?
yet wherefore cease ?
let thy scant knowledge find increase .
say 'men are men , and geese are geese . ' "
he moaned : he knew not what to say .
the thought " that i could get away ! "
strove with the thought " but i must stay . "
" to dine ! "
she shrieked in <unk> .
" to swallow wines all foam and froth !
to <unk> at a table-cloth !
" say , can thy <name> spirit stoop to join the <unk> troop who find a solace in the soup ?
" canst thou <name> or pie or puff ?
thy well-bred manners were enough , without such gross material stuff . "
" yet well-bred men , " he faintly said , " are not unwilling to be fed : nor are they well without the bread . "
her visage scorched him ere she spoke : " there are , " she said , " a kind of folk who have no horror of a joke .
" such wretches live : they take their share of common earth and common air : we come across them here and there : " we <name> them  there is no escape  a sort of semi-human shape suggestive of the <unk> ape . "
" in all such theories , " said he , " one fixed exception there must be .
that is , the present company . "
baffled , she gave a <unk> bark : he , aiming blindly in the dark , with random shaft had pierced the <name> .
she felt that her defeat was plain , yet madly strove with might and main to get the upper hand again .
fixing her eyes upon the beach , as though unconscious of his speech , she said " each gives to more than each . "
he could not answer yea or nay : he faltered " gifts may pass away . "
yet knew not what he meant to say .
" if that be so , " she straight replied , " each heart with each doth coincide .
what boots it ?
for the world is wide . "
[ illustration : " he faltered <unk> may pass away . ' " ]
" the world is but a thought , " said he : " the vast unfathomable sea is but a notion  unto me . "
and darkly fell her answer dread upon his unresisting head , like half a <unk> of lead .
" the good and great must ever shun that reckless and abandoned one who stoops to perpetrate a pun .
" the man that smokes  that reads the times  that goes to christmas <unk>  is capable of any crimes ! "
he felt it was his turn to speak , and , with a shamed and crimson cheek , moaned " this is harder than <unk> ! "
but when she asked him " wherefore so ? "
he felt his very whiskers glow , and frankly owned " i do not know . "
[ illustration : " this is harder than <unk> ! " ]
while , like broad waves of golden grain , or sunlit hues on <unk> pane , his colour came and went again .
pitying his obvious distress , yet with a tinge of bitterness , she said " the more exceeds the less . "
" a truth of such undoubted weight , " he urged , " and so extreme in date , it were superfluous to state . "
roused into sudden passion , she in tone of cold malignity : " to others , yea : but not to thee . "
but when she saw him quail and quake , and when he urged " for pity 's sake ! "
once more in gentle tone she spake .
" thought in the mind doth still abide : that is by intellect supplied , and within that idea doth hide : " and he , that <unk> the truth to know , still further inwardly may go , and find idea from notion flow : " and thus the chain , that sages sought , is to a glorious circle wrought , for notion hath its source in thought . "
so passed they on with even pace : yet gradually one might trace a shadow growing on his face .
[ illustration ] the second voice .
[ illustration ] they walked beside the <unk> beach ; her tongue was very apt to teach , and now and then he did beseech she would abate her <unk> tone , because the talk was all her own , and he was dull as any drone .
she urged " no cheese is made of chalk " : and ceaseless flowed her dreary talk , tuned to the footfall of a walk .
her voice was very full and <name> , and , when at length she asked him " which ? "
it mounted to its highest pitch .
he a bewildered answer gave , drowned in the sullen moaning wave , lost in the echoes of the cave .
he answered her he knew not what : like shaft from bow at random shot , he spoke , but she regarded not .
she waited not for his reply , but with a downward leaden eye went on as if he were not by : sound argument and grave defence , strange questions raised on " why ? "
and " whence ? "
and wildly tangled evidence .
when he , with racked and whirling <name> , feebly implored her to explain , she simply said it all again .
wrenched with an agony intense , he spake , neglecting sound and sense , and careless of all consequence : " mind  i believe  is essence  ent  abstract  that is  an accident  which we  that is to say  i meant  " when , with quick breath and cheeks all flushed , at length his speech was somewhat hushed , she looked at him , and he was crushed .
it needed not her calm reply : she fixed him with a stony eye , and he could neither fight nor fly , while she dissected , word by word , his speech , half guessed at and half heard , as might a cat a little bird .
[ illustration : " he spake , neglecting sound and sense . " ]
then , having wholly overthrown his views , and stripped them to the bone , proceeded to unfold her own .
" shall man be man ?
and shall he miss of other thoughts no thought but this , harmonious dews of sober bliss ?
" what boots it ?
shall his fevered eye through towering nothingness <unk> the grisly phantom hurry by ?
" and hear dumb shrieks that fill the air ; see mouths that gape , and eyes that stare and redden in the dusky glare ?
" the meadows breathing <name> light , the darkness <unk> from the height , the feathery train of granite night ?
" shall he , grown gray among his peers , through the thick curtain of his tears catch glimpses of his earlier years , [ illustration : " shall man be man ? " ]
" and hear the sounds he knew of yore , old <unk> on the <unk> floor , old knuckles tapping at the door ?
" yet still before him as he flies one pallid form shall ever rise , and , <unk> forth in glassy eyes " the vision of a vanished good , low peering through the tangled wood , shall freeze the current of his blood . "
still from each fact , with skill uncouth and savage rapture , like a tooth she wrenched some slow reluctant truth .
till , like a silent <unk> , when summer suns have dried the rill , she reached a full stop , and was still .
dead calm succeeded to the fuss , as when the loaded omnibus has reached the railway terminus : when , for the tumult of the street , is heard the engine 's stifled beat , the <name> tread of porters ' feet .
with glance that ever sought the ground , she moved her lips without a sound , and every now and then she frowned .
he gazed upon the sleeping sea , and <unk> in its tranquillity , and in that silence dead , but she to muse a little space did seem , then , like the <name> of a dream , <unk> back upon her threadbare theme .
still an attentive ear he lent but could not fathom what she meant : she was not deep , nor eloquent .
he marked the ripple on the sand : the even swaying of her hand was all that he could understand .
he saw in dreams a drawing-room , where thirteen wretches sat in gloom , waiting  he thought he knew for whom : he saw them drooping here and there , each feebly huddled on a chair , in attitudes of blank despair : oysters were not more mute than they , for all their brains were pumped away , and they had nothing more to say  save one , who groaned " three hours are gone ! "
who shrieked " we 'll wait no longer , <name> !
tell them to set the dinner on ! "
the vision passed : the ghosts were fled : he saw once more that woman dread : he heard once more the words she said .
he left her , and he turned aside : he sat and watched the coming tide across the shores so newly dried .
[ illustration : " he sat and watched the coming tide " ] he wondered at the waters clear , the breeze that whispered in his ear , the billows heaving far and near , and why he had so long preferred to <name> upon her every word : " in truth , " he said , " it was absurd . "
[ illustration ] the third voice .
[ illustration ] not long this transport held its place : within a little moment 's space quick tears were raining down his face .
his heart stood still , aghast with fear ; a <unk> voice , nor far nor near , he seemed to hear and not to hear .
" tears kindle not the doubtful spark .
if so , why not ?
of this remark the bearings are profoundly dark . "
" her speech , " he said , " hath caused this pain .
easier i count it to explain the <unk> of the howling main , " or , stretched beside some babbling <name> , to con , with <unk> look , an unintelligible book . "
low spake the voice within his head , in words imagined more than said , <unk> as ghost 's intended tread : " if thou <name> duller than before , why <unk> thou the voice of <name> ?
why not endure , expecting more ? "
" rather than that , " he groaned aghast , " i 'd writhe in depths of cavern vast , some <unk> <unk> 's <name> repast . "
[ illustration : " he groaned aghast " ] " 'twere hard , " it answered , " themes immense to coop within the narrow fence that rings thy scant intelligence . "
" not so , " he urged , " nor once alone : but there was something in her tone that chilled me to the very bone .
" her style was anything but clear , and most unpleasantly severe ; her epithets were very queer .
" and yet , so grand were her replies , i could not choose but deem her wise ; i did not dare to criticise ; " nor did i leave her , till she went so deep in tangled argument that all my powers of thought were spent . "
a little whisper <unk> slid , " yet truth is truth : you know you did . "
a little wink beneath the lid .
and , sickened with excess of dread , prone to the dust he bent his head , and lay like one three-quarters dead .
the whisper left him  like a breeze lost in the depths of leafy trees  left him by no means at his ease .
once more he <unk> in despair , with hands , through <unk> hair , more tightly clenched than then they were .
when , bathed in <name> of living red , majestic frowned the mountain head , " tell me my fault , " was all he said .
when , at high noon , the blazing sky scorched in his head each haggard eye , then keenest rose his weary cry .
and when at <name> the <unk> sun smiled grimly on the solemn fun , " alack , " he sighed , " what have i done ? "
[ illustration : " tortured , unaided , and alone " ] but saddest , darkest was the sight , when the cold grasp of leaden night dashed him to earth , and held him tight .
tortured , unaided , and alone , thunders were silence to his groan , <unk> sweet music to its tone : " what ?
ever thus , in dismal round , shall pain and mystery profound pursue me like a sleepless hound , " with <unk> and eager jaws , me , still in ignorance of the cause , <unk> what i broke of laws ? "
the whisper to his ear did seem like echoed flow of silent stream , or shadow of forgotten dream , the whisper trembling in the wind : " her fate with thine was <unk> , " so spake it in his inner mind : [ illustration : " a scared <unk> , <unk> low " ] " each <unk> on each a <unk> <name> : each proved the other 's blight and bar : each unto each were best , most far : " yea , each to each was worse than foe : thou , a scared <unk> , <unk> low , and she , an avalanche of woe ! "
<unk> con <unk> .
[ why is it that poetry has never yet been subjected to that process of <unk> which has proved so advantageous to her <unk> music ?
the <unk> gives us first a few notes of some well-known air , then a dozen bars of his own , then a few more notes of the air , and so on alternately : thus saving the listener , if not from all risk of recognising the <name> at all , at least from the <unk> transports which it might produce in a more concentrated form .
the process is termed " setting " by <unk> , and any one , that has ever experienced the emotion of being unexpectedly set down in a heap of mortar , <name> recognise the truthfulness of this happy phrase .
for truly , just as the genuine <unk> lingers lovingly over a morsel of supreme venison  whose every fibre seems to murmur " excelsior ! "
 yet swallows , ere returning to the <unk> dainty , great <unk> of <unk> and <unk> : and just as the perfect <unk> in claret permits himself but one delicate sip , and then <unk> off a pint or more of boarding-school beer : so also   i never loved a dear <unk>  nor anything that cost me much : high prices profit those who sell , but why should i be fond of such ?  to glad me with his soft black eye my son comes trotting home from school ; he 's had a fight , but ca n't tell why  he always was a little fool !  but , when he came to know me well , he kicked me out , her <unk> sire : and when i stained my hair , that <name> , might note the change , and thus admire and love me , it was sure to dye a muddy green or staring blue : whilst one might trace , with half an eye , the still triumphant carrot through .
a game of <unk> .
[ illustration ] five little girls , of five , four , three , two , one : rolling on the <unk> , full of tricks and fun .
five <name> girls , in years from ten to six : sitting down to lessons  no more time for tricks .
five growing girls , from fifteen to eleven : music , drawing , languages , and food enough for seven !
five <unk> girls , from twenty to sixteen : each young man that calls , i say " now tell me which you mean ! "
[ illustration : " now tell me which you mean ! " ]
five dashing girls , the youngest twenty-one : but , if nobody proposes , what is there to be done ?
five showy girls  but thirty is an age when girls may be engaging , but they somehow do n't engage .
five <unk> girls , of thirty-one or more : so gracious to the shy young men they snubbed so much before !
* * * * * five <unk> girls  their age ?

we jog along together , like the rest of human kind : but the <unk> " careless bachelor " begins to think he knows the answer to that ancient problem " how the money goes " !

how shall i write in rhyme ?

then tell me how !

the old man smiled to see him , to hear his sudden <name> ; he liked the lad to speak his mind enthusiastically ; and thought " there 's no <unk> in him , nor any <unk> . "
" and would you be a poet before you 've been to school ?
ah , well !
i hardly thought you so absolute a fool .
first learn to be spasmodic  a very simple rule .
" for first you write a sentence , and then you chop it small ; then mix the bits , and sort them out just as they chance to fall : the order of the phrases makes no difference at all .
" then , if you 'd be impressive , remember what i say , that abstract qualities begin with capitals alway : the true , the good , the beautiful  those are the things that pay !
" next , when you are describing a shape , or sound , or tint ; do n't state the matter plainly , but put it in a hint ; and learn to look at all things with a sort of mental <unk> . "
" for instance , if i wished , sir , of <unk> to tell , should i say <unk> of fleecy flocks pent in a <unk> cell ' ? "
" why , yes , " the old man said : " that phrase would answer very well .
" then fourthly , there are epithets that suit with any word  as well as <name> 's reading sauce with fish , or flesh , or bird  of these , <unk> , ' <unk> , ' <unk> , ' <unk> , ' are much to be preferred . "
" and <name> it do , o <name> it do to take them in a lump  as 'the wild man went his weary way to a strange and lonely pump ' ? "
" nay , nay !
you must not hastily to such conclusions jump .
" such epithets , like pepper , give zest to what you write ; and , if you <unk> them <unk> , they <unk> the appetite : but if you lay them on too thick , you spoil the matter quite !
[ illustration : " the wild man went his weary way " ] " last , as to the arrangement : your reader , you should show him , must take what information he can get , and look for no im mature disclosure of the drift and purpose of your poem .
" therefore , to test his <name>  how much he can endure  mention no places , names , or dates , and evermore be sure throughout the poem to be found consistently obscure .
" first fix upon the limit to which it shall extend : then fill it up with <unk> ( beg some of any friend ) : your great <unk> you place towards the end . "
" and what is a sensation , grandfather , tell me , pray ?
i think i never heard the word so used before to-day : be kind enough to mention one <unk> <unk> . ' "
and the old man , looking sadly across the <unk> , where here and there a <unk> yet glittered in the <name> , said " go to the <unk> , and see the <unk> <unk> . '
" the word is due to <unk>  the theory is his , where life becomes a spasm , and history a whiz : if that is not sensation , i do n't know what it is .
" now try your hand , ere fancy have lost its present glow  " " and then , " his grandson added , " we 'll publish it , you know : green cloth  <unk> at the back  in <unk> ! "
then proudly smiled that old man to see the eager lad rush madly for his pen and ink and for his <unk>  but , when he thought of publishing , his face grew stern and sad .
[ illustration ] the hunting of the snark , an agony in eight fits .
preface .
if  and the thing is wildly possible  the charge of writing nonsense were ever brought against the author of this brief but instructive poem , it would be based , i feel convinced , on the line ( in p. 144 ) " then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes : " in view of this painful possibility , i <name> not ( as i might ) appeal indignantly to my other writings as a proof that i am incapable of such a deed : i <name> not ( as i might ) point to the strong moral purpose of this poem itself , to the arithmetical principles so cautiously inculcated in it , or to its <name> teachings in natural history  i <name> take the more <unk> course of simply explaining how it happened .
the bellman , who was almost <unk> sensitive about appearances , used to have the bowsprit <unk> once or twice a week to be <unk> ; and it more than once happened , when the time came for replacing it , that no one on board could remember which end of the ship it belonged to .
they knew it was not of the slightest use to appeal to the bellman about it  he would only refer to his naval code , and read out in pathetic tones admiralty instructions which none of them had ever been able to understand  so it generally ended in its being fastened on , anyhow , across the rudder .
the helmsman [ 1 ] used to stand by with tears in his eyes : he knew it was all wrong , but alas !
rule 42 of the code , " no one shall speak to the man at the helm , " had been completed by the bellman himself with the words " and the man at the helm shall speak to no one . "
so remonstrance was impossible , and no steering could be done till the next <unk> day .
during these bewildering intervals the ship usually sailed backwards .
as this poem is to some extent connected with the lay of the <unk> , let me take this opportunity of answering a question that has often been asked me , how to pronounce " <unk> <unk> . "
the " i " in " <unk> " is long , as in " writhe " ; and " <unk> " is pronounced so as to rhyme with " groves . "
again , the first " o " in " <unk> " is pronounced like the " o " in " borrow . "
i have heard people try to give it the sound of the " o " in " worry . "
such is human perversity .
[ 1 ] this office was usually undertaken by the boots , who found in it a refuge from the baker 's constant complaints about the insufficient blacking of his three pair of boots .
this also seems a fitting occasion to notice the other hard words in that poem .
<unk> 's theory , of two meanings packed into one word like a <unk> , seems to me the right explanation for all .
for instance , take the two words " fuming " and " furious . "
make up your mind that you <name> say both words , but leave it unsettled which you <name> say first .
now open your mouth and speak .
if your thoughts incline ever so little towards " fuming , " you <name> say " <unk> " ; if they turn , by even a hair 's breadth towards " furious , " you <name> say " <unk> " ; but if you have that rarest of gifts , a perfectly balanced mind , you <name> say " <unk> . "
supposing that , when pistol uttered the well-known words  " under which king , <unk> ?
speak or die ! "
justice shallow had felt certain that it was either <name> or <name> , but had not been able to settle which , so that he could not possibly say either name before the other , can it be doubted that , rather than die , he would have gasped out " <unk> ! "
fit the first .
the <unk> " just the place for a snark ! "
the bellman cried , as he landed his crew with care ; supporting each man on the top of the tide by a finger <unk> in his hair .
" just the place for a snark !
i have said it twice : that alone should encourage the crew .
just the place for a snark !
i have said it thrice : what i tell you three times is true . "
the crew was complete : it included a boots  a maker of bonnets and <unk>  a barrister , brought to arrange their disputes  and a broker , to value their goods .
[ illustration : " supporting each man on the top of the tide " ] a <unk> , whose skill was immense , might perhaps have won more than his share  but a banker , engaged at enormous expense , had the whole of their cash in his care .
there was also a beaver , that paced on the deck , or would sit making lace in the bow : and had often ( the bellman said ) saved them from wreck , though none of the sailors knew how .
there was one who was famed for the number of things he forgot when he entered the ship : his umbrella , his watch , all his jewels and rings , and the clothes he had bought for the trip .
he had forty-two boxes , all carefully packed , with his name painted clearly on each : but since he omitted to mention the fact , they were all left behind on the beach .
the loss of his clothes hardly mattered , because he had seven coats on when he came , with three pair of boots  but the worst of it was he had wholly forgotten his name .
[ illustration : " he had wholly forgotten his name " ] he would answer to " hi ! "
or to any loud cry , such as " fry me ! "
or " <unk> my wig ! "
to " <unk> ! "
or " <unk> ! "
but especially " <unk> jig ! "
while , for those who preferred a more forcible word , he had different names from these : his intimate friends called him " <unk> , " and his enemies " <unk> . "
" his form is ungainly  his intellect small  " ( so the bellman would often remark )  " but his courage is perfect !
and that , after all , is the thing that one needs with a snark . "
he would joke with <unk> , returning their stare with an impudent wag of the head : and he once went a walk , <unk> , with a bear , " just to keep up its spirits , " he said .
he came as a baker : but owned , when too late  and it drove the poor bellman <unk>  he could only bake <unk>  for which , i may state , no materials were to be had .
the last of the crew needs especial remark , though he looked an incredible dunce : he had just one idea  but , that one being " snark , " the good bellman engaged him at once .
he came as a butcher : but gravely declared , when the ship had been sailing a week , he could only kill beavers .
the bellman looked scared , and was almost too frightened to speak : but at length he explained , in a tremulous tone , there was only one beaver on board ; and that was a tame one he had of his own , whose death would be deeply deplored .
the beaver , who happened to hear the remark , protested , with tears in its eyes , that not even the rapture of hunting the snark could atone for that dismal surprise !
it strongly advised that the butcher should be conveyed in a separate ship : but the bellman declared that would never agree with the plans he had made for the trip : [ illustration : " the beaver kept looking the opposite way " ] navigation was always a difficult <name> , though with only one ship and one <name> : and he feared he must really decline , for his part , undertaking another as well .
the beaver 's best course was , no doubt , to procure a second-hand <unk> coat  so the baker advised it  and next , to insure its life in some office of note : this the banker suggested , and offered for hire ( on moderate terms ) , or for sale , two excellent policies , one against fire , and one against damage from hail .
yet still , ever after that sorrowful day , whenever the butcher was by , the beaver kept looking the opposite way , and appeared unaccountably shy .
fit the second .
the bellman 's speech. the bellman himself they all praised to the skies  such a carriage , such ease and such <name> !
such solemnity , too !
one could see he was wise , the moment one looked in his face !
he had bought a large map representing the sea , without the least vestige of land : and the crew were much pleased when they found it to be a map they could all understand .
" what 's the good of <unk> 's north poles and <unk> , tropics , zones , and meridian lines ? "
so the bellman would cry : and the crew would reply " they are merely conventional signs !
[ illustration : <unk> . ]
" other maps are such shapes , with their islands and capes !
but we 've got our brave captain to thank " ( so the crew would protest ) " that he 's bought us the best  a perfect and absolute blank ! "
this was charming , no doubt : but they shortly found out that the captain they trusted so well had only one notion for crossing the ocean , and that was to tingle his <name> .
he was thoughtful and grave  but the orders he gave were enough to bewilder a crew .
when he cried " steer to starboard , but keep her head larboard ! "
what on earth was the helmsman to do ?
then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes : a thing , as the bellman remarked , that frequently happens in tropical climes , when a vessel is , so to speak , " <unk> . "
but the principal failing occurred in the sailing , and the bellman , perplexed and distressed , said he had hoped , at least , when the wind blew due east , that the ship would not travel due west !
but the danger was past  they had landed at last , with their boxes , <unk> , and bags : yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view which consisted of chasms and crags .
the bellman perceived that their spirits were low , and repeated in musical tone some jokes he had kept for a season of woe  but the crew would do nothing but groan .
he served out some <unk> with a liberal hand , and bade them sit down on the beach : and they could not but own that their captain looked grand , as he stood and delivered his speech .
" friends , romans , and countrymen , lend me your ears !
( they were all of them fond of quotations : so they drank to his health , and they gave him three cheers while he served out additional rations ) .
" we have sailed many months , we have sailed many weeks , ( four weeks to the month you may <name> ) , but never as yet ( 't is your captain who speaks ) have we caught the least glimpse of a snark !
" we have sailed many weeks , we have sailed many days , ( seven days to the week i allow ) , but a snark , on the which we might lovingly gaze , we have never beheld till now !
" come , listen , my men , while i tell you again the five unmistakable marks by which you may know , <unk> you go , the warranted genuine <unk> .
" let us take them in order .
the first is the taste , which is meagre and hollow , but crisp : like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist , with a flavour of <unk> wisp .
" its habit of getting up late you 'll agree that it carries too far , when i say that it frequently breakfasts at five o'clock tea , and <unk> on the following day .
" the third is its slowness in taking a jest .
should you happen to venture on one , it <name> sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed : and it always looks grave at a pun .
" the fourth is its fondness for <unk> , which it constantly carries about , and believes that they add to the beauty of scenes  a sentiment open to doubt .
" the fifth is ambition .
it next <name> be right to describe each particular batch : distinguishing those that have feathers , and bite , from those that have whiskers , and scratch .
" for , although common <unk> do no manner of harm , yet i feel it my duty to say some are <unk>  " the bellman broke off in alarm , for the baker had fainted away .
fit the third .
the baker 's <unk> they roused him with muffins  they roused him with ice  they roused him with mustard and <unk>  they roused him with jam and judicious advice  they set him <unk> to guess .
when at length he sat up and was able to speak , his sad story he offered to tell ; and the bellman cried " silence !
not even a shriek ! "
and excitedly tingled his <name> .
there was silence supreme !
not a shriek , not a scream ; scarcely even a howl or a groan , as the man they called " ho ! "
told his story of woe in an <unk> tone .
" my father and mother were honest , though poor  " " skip all that ! "
cried the bellman in haste .
" if it once becomes dark , there 's no chance of a snark  we have hardly a minute to waste ! "
" i skip forty years , " said the baker , in tears , " and proceed without further remark to the day when you took me aboard of your ship to help you in hunting the snark .
" a dear uncle of mine ( after whom i was named ) remarked , when i bade him farewell  " " oh , skip your dear uncle ! "
the bellman exclaimed , as he angrily tingled his <name> .
" he remarked to me then , " said that <unk> of men , " 'if your snark be a snark , that is right : fetch it home by all means  you may serve it with greens and it 's handy for striking a light .
" 'you may seek it with <unk>  and seek it with care ; you may hunt it with forks and <name> ; you may threaten its life with a <unk> ; you may charm it with smiles and soap  ' " ( " that 's exactly the method , " the bellman bold in a hasty parenthesis cried , " that 's exactly the way i have always been told that the capture of <unk> should be tried ! " )
" 'but oh , <unk> nephew , beware of the day , if your snark be a <unk> !
for then you <name> softly and suddenly vanish away , and never be met with again ! '
" it is this , it is this that <unk> my soul , when i think of my uncle 's last words : and my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl brimming over with quivering <unk> !
" it is this , it is this  " " we have had that before ! "
the bellman indignantly said .
and the baker replied " let me say it once more .
it is this , it is this that i dread !
" i engage with the snark  every night after dark  in a dreamy delirious fight : i serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes , and i use it for striking a light : [ illustration : " but oh , <unk> nephew , beware of the day " ] " but if ever i meet with a <unk> , that day , in a moment ( of this i am sure ) , i shall softly and suddenly vanish away  and the notion i can not endure ! "
fit the fourth .
the <unk> the bellman looked <unk> , and wrinkled his brow .
" if only you 'd spoken before !
it 's excessively awkward to mention it now , with the snark , so to speak , at the door !
" we should all of us grieve , as you well may believe , if you never were met with again  but surely , my man , when the voyage began , you might have suggested it then ?
" it 's excessively awkward to mention it now  as i think i 've already remarked . "
and the man they called " hi ! "
replied , with a sigh , " i informed you the day we embarked .
" you may charge me with murder  or want of sense  ( we are all of us weak at times ) : but the slightest approach to a false pretence was never among my crimes !
" i said it in hebrew  i said it in dutch  i said it in <name> and greek : but i wholly forgot ( and it <unk> me much ) that english is what you speak ! "
" 't is a pitiful tale , " said the bellman , whose face had grown longer at every word : " but , now that you 've stated the whole of your case , more debate would be simply absurd .
" the rest of my speech " ( he explained to his men ) " you shall hear when i 've leisure to speak it .
but the snark is at hand , let me tell you again !
't is your glorious duty to seek it !
" to seek it with <unk> , to seek it with care ; to pursue it with forks and <name> ; to threaten its life with a <unk> ; to charm it with smiles and soap !
[ illustration : " to pursue it with forks and <name> . " ]
" for the snark 's a peculiar creature , that won't be caught in a commonplace way .
do all that you know , and try all that you do n't : not a chance must be wasted to-day !
" for england expects  i forbear to proceed : 't is a maxim tremendous , but <unk> : and you 'd best be <unk> the things that you need to rig yourselves out for the fight . "
then the banker <unk> a blank cheque ( which he crossed ) , and changed his loose silver for notes : the baker with care combed his whiskers and hair , and shook the dust out of his coats : the boots and the broker were sharpening a spade  each working the grindstone in turn : but the beaver went on making lace , and displayed no interest in the concern : though the barrister tried to appeal to its pride , and vainly proceeded to cite a number of cases , in which making laces had been proved an <unk> of right .
the maker of bonnets ferociously planned a novel arrangement of bows : while the <unk> with quivering hand was <unk> the tip of his nose .
but the butcher turned nervous , and dressed himself fine , with yellow kid gloves and a ruff  said he felt it exactly like going to dine , which the bellman declared was all " stuff . "
" introduce me , now there 's a good fellow , " he said , " if we happen to meet it together ! "
and the bellman , sagaciously nodding his head , said " that must depend on the weather . "
the beaver went simply <unk> about , at seeing the butcher so shy : and even the baker , though stupid and stout , made an effort to wink with one eye .
" be a man ! "
cried the bellman in wrath , as he heard the butcher beginning to sob .
" should we meet with a <unk> , that desperate bird , we shall need all our strength for the job ! "
fit the fifth .
the beaver 's <unk> they sought it with <unk> , they sought it with care they pursued it with forks and <name> ; they threatened its life with a <unk> ; they charmed it with smiles and soap .
then the butcher contrived an ingenious plan for making a separate <name> ; and had fixed on a spot unfrequented by man , a dismal and desolate valley .
but the very same plan to the beaver occurred : it had chosen the very same place : yet neither betrayed , by a sign or a word , the disgust that appeared in his face .
each thought he was thinking of nothing but " snark " and the glorious work of the day ; and each tried to pretend that he did not remark that the other was going that way .
but the valley grew narrow and narrower still , and the evening got darker and colder , till ( merely from nervousness , not from good <name> ) they marched along shoulder to shoulder .
then a scream , shrill and high , rent the shuddering sky , and they knew that some danger was near : the beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail , and even the butcher felt queer .
he thought of his childhood , left far far behind  that blissful and innocent state  the sound so exactly recalled to his mind a pencil that <unk> on a slate !
" 't is the voice of the <unk> ! "
he suddenly cried .
( this man , that they used to call " dunce . " )
" as the bellman would tell you , " he added with pride , " i have uttered that sentiment once . "
" 't is the note of the <unk> !
keep count , i entreat ; you <name> find i have told it you twice .
't is the song of the <unk> !
the proof is complete , if only i 've stated it thrice . "
the beaver had counted with scrupulous care , attending to every word : but it fairly lost heart , and <unk> in despair , when the third repetition occurred .
it felt that , in spite of all possible pains , it had somehow contrived to lose count , and the only thing now was to rack its poor brains by reckoning up the amount .
" two added to one  if that could but be done , " it said , " with one 's fingers and thumbs ! "
<unk> with tears how , in earlier years , it had taken no pains with its sums .
" the thing can be done , " said the butcher , " i think .
the thing must be done , i am sure .
the thing shall be done !
bring me paper and ink , the best there is time to procure . "
the beaver brought paper , portfolio , pens , and ink in unfailing supplies : while strange creepy creatures came out of their dens , and watched them with wondering eyes .
so engrossed was the butcher , he heeded them not , as he wrote with a pen in each hand , and explained all the while in a popular style which the beaver could well understand .
" taking three as the subject to reason about  a convenient number to state  we add seven , and ten , and then multiply out by one thousand diminished by eight .
" the result we proceed to divide , as you see , by <unk> : then <unk> seventeen , and the answer must be exactly and perfectly true .
" the method employed i would gladly explain , while i have it so clear in my head , if i had but the time and you had but the <name>  but much yet remains to be said .
[ illustration : " the beaver brought paper , portfolio , pens " ] " in one moment i 've seen what has hitherto been enveloped in absolute mystery , and without extra charge i <name> give you at large a lesson in natural history . "
in his genial way he proceeded to say ( forgetting all laws of propriety , and that giving instruction , without introduction , would have caused quite a thrill in society ) , " as to temper the <unk> 's a desperate bird , since it lives in perpetual passion : its taste in costume is entirely absurd  it is ages ahead of the fashion : " but it knows any friend it has met once before : it never <name> look at a bribe : and in <unk> it stands at the door , and collects  though it does not subscribe .
" its flavour when cooked is more exquisite far than mutton , or oysters , or eggs : ( some think it keeps best in an <name> jar , and some , in mahogany <unk> : ) " you boil it in sawdust : you salt it in glue : you condense it with locusts and tape : still keeping one principal object in view  to preserve its symmetrical shape . "
the butcher would gladly have talked till next day , but he felt that the lesson must end , and he wept with delight in attempting to say he considered the beaver his friend : while the beaver confessed , with affectionate looks more eloquent even than tears , it had learned in ten minutes far more than all books would have taught it in seventy years .
they returned <unk> , and the bellman , <unk> ( for a moment ) with <name> emotion , said " this amply <unk> all the wearisome days we have spent on the billowy ocean ! "
such friends , as the beaver and butcher became , have seldom if ever been known ; in <name> or summer , 't was always the same  you could never meet either alone .
and when quarrels arose  as one frequently finds quarrels <name> , spite of every endeavour  the song of the <unk> recurred to their minds , and cemented their friendship for ever !
fit the sixth .
the barrister 's <unk> they sought it with <unk> , they sought it with care ; they pursued it with forks and <name> ; they threatened its life with a <unk> ; they charmed it with smiles and soap .
but the barrister , weary of proving in vain that the beaver 's <unk> was wrong , fell asleep , and in dreams saw the creature quite plain that his fancy had dwelt on so long .
he dreamed that he stood in a shadowy court , where the snark , with a glass in its eye , dressed in gown , bands , and wig , was defending a pig on the charge of deserting its sty .
[ illustration : " 'you must know  ' said the judge : but the snark exclaimed <unk> ! ' " ]
the witnesses proved , without error or flaw , that the sty was deserted when found : and the judge kept explaining the state of the law in a soft <unk> of sound .
the indictment had never been clearly expressed , and it seemed that the snark had begun , and had spoken three hours , before any one guessed what the pig was supposed to have done .
the jury had each formed a different view ( long before the indictment was read ) , and they all spoke at once , so that none of them knew one word that the others had said .
" you must know  " said the judge : but the snark exclaimed " <unk> !
that statute is obsolete quite !
let me tell you , my friends , the whole question depends on an ancient <unk> right .
" in the matter of treason the pig would appear to have aided , but scarcely <unk> : while the charge of <unk> fails , it is clear , if you <name> the plea 'never indebted . '
" the fact of desertion i <name> not dispute : but its guilt , as i trust , is removed ( so far as relates to the costs of this suit ) by the <unk> which has been proved .
" my poor client 's fate now depends on your votes . "
here the speaker sat down in his place , and directed the judge to refer to his notes and briefly to sum up the case .
but the judge said he never had summed up before ; so the snark undertook it instead , and summed it so well that it came to far more than the witnesses ever had said !
when the verdict was called for , the jury declined , as the word was so puzzling to spell ; but they ventured to <name> that the snark would n't mind undertaking that duty as well .
so the snark found the verdict , although , as it owned , it was spent with the toils of the day : when it said the word " guilty ! "
the jury all groaned and some of them fainted away .
then the snark pronounced sentence , the judge being quite too nervous to utter a word : when it rose to its feet , there was silence like night , and the fall of a pin might be heard .
" transportation for life " was the sentence it gave , " and then to be fined forty pound . "
the jury all cheered , though the judge said he feared that the phrase was not legally sound .
but their wild exultation was suddenly checked when the jailer informed them , with tears , such a sentence would have not the slightest effect , as the pig had been dead for some years .
the judge left the court , looking deeply disgusted : but the snark , though a little aghast , as the lawyer to whom the defence was intrusted , went bellowing on to the last .
thus the barrister dreamed , while the bellowing seemed to grow every moment more clear : till he woke to the knell of a furious <name> , which the bellman rang close at his ear .
fit the seventh .
the banker 's <unk> they sought it with <unk> , they sought it with care ; they pursued it with forks and <name> ; they threatened its life with a <unk> ; they charmed it with smiles and soap .
and the banker , inspired with a courage so new it was matter for general remark , rushed madly ahead and was lost to their view in his zeal to discover the snark .
but while he was seeking with <unk> and care , a <unk> swiftly <name> nigh and grabbed at the banker , who shrieked in despair , for he knew it was useless to fly .
he offered large discount  he offered a cheque ( drawn " to bearer " ) for <unk> : but the <unk> merely extended its neck and grabbed at the banker again .
without rest or pause  while those <unk> jaws went savagely snapping around  he skipped and he hopped , and he floundered and flopped , till fainting he fell to the ground .
the <unk> fled as the others appeared led on by that <unk> yell : and the bellman remarked " it is just as i feared ! "
and solemnly <unk> on his <name> .
he was black in the face , and they scarcely could trace the least likeness to what he had been : while so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white  a wonderful thing to be seen !
[ illustration : " so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white . " ]
to the horror of all who were present that day , he <unk> in full evening dress , and with senseless grimaces endeavoured to say what his tongue could no longer express .
down he sank in a chair  ran his hands through his hair  and chanted in <unk> tones words whose utter <unk> proved his insanity , while he rattled a couple of bones .
" leave him here to his fate  it is getting so late ! "
the bellman exclaimed in a fright .
" we have lost half the day .
any further delay , and we sha'n't catch a snark before night ! "
fit the eighth .
the <unk> they sought it with <unk> , they sought it with care ; they pursued it with forks and <name> ; they threatened its life with a <unk> ; they charmed it with smiles and soap .
they shuddered to think that the <name> might fail , and the beaver , excited at last , went bounding along on the tip of its tail , for the daylight was nearly past .
" there is <unk> shouting ! "
the bellman said .
" he is shouting like mad , only hark !
he is waving his hands , he is wagging his head , he has certainly found a snark ! "
they gazed in delight , while the butcher exclaimed " he was always a desperate wag ! "
they beheld him  their baker  their hero unnamed  on the top of a neighbouring crag , erect and sublime , for one moment of time .
in the next , that wild figure they saw ( as if stung by a spasm ) plunge into a chasm , while they waited and listened in awe .
" it 's a snark ! "
was the sound that first came to their ears , and seemed almost too good to be true .
then followed a torrent of laughter and cheers : then the ominous words " it 's a <unk>  " then , silence .
some fancied they heard in the air a weary and wandering sigh that sounded like "  <unk> ! "
but the others declare it was only a breeze that went by .
[ illustration : " then , silence " ] they hunted till darkness came on , but they found not a button , or feather , or <name> , by which they could tell that they stood on the ground where the baker had met with the snark .
in the midst of the word he was trying to say , in the midst of his laughter and glee , he had softly and suddenly vanished away  for the snark was a <unk> , you see .
size and tears .
[ illustration ] when on the <name> shore i sit , beside the salt <unk> , and fall into a weeping fit because i dare not shave  a little whisper at my ear <unk> the reason of my fear .
i answer " if that ruffian jones should recognise me here , he 'd bellow out my name in tones offensive to the ear : he <unk> me so on being stout ( a thing that always puts me out ) . "
ah me !
i see him on the <name> !
farewell , farewell to <name> , if he should look this way , and if he 's got his telescope !
to whatsoever place i flee , my odious rival follows me !
for every night , and everywhere , i meet him out at dinner ; and when i 've found some charming fair , and vowed to die or win her , the wretch ( he 's thin and i am stout ) is sure to come and cut me out !
[ illustration : " he 's thin and i am stout " ] the girls ( just like them ! )
all agree to praise j. jones , <unk> : i ask them what on earth they see about him to admire ?
they cry " he is so sleek and slim , it 's quite a treat to look at him ! "
they vanish in tobacco smoke , those visionary maids  i feel a sharp and sudden poke between the shoulder-blades  " why , brown , my boy !
you 're growing stout ! "
( i told you he would find me out ! )
" my growth is not your business , sir ! "
" no more it is , my boy !
but if it 's yours , as i infer , why , brown , i give you <name> !
a man , whose business <unk> so , is just the sort of man to know !
" it 's hardly safe , though , talking here  i 'd best get out of reach : for such a weight as yours , i fear , must shortly sink the beach ! "
 insult me thus because i 'm stout !
i vow i 'll go and call him out !
[ illustration ] <unk> in <unk> .
ay , 't was here , on this spot , in that summer of yore , <unk> did not vote my presence a bore , nor reply to my tenderest talk " she had heard all that nonsense before . "
she 'd the brooch i had bought and the necklace and sash on , and her heart , as i thought , was alive to my passion ; and she 'd done up her hair in the style that the empress had brought into fashion .
[ illustration ] i had been to the play with my <name> of a <unk>  but , for all i could say , she declared she was weary , that " the place was so crowded and hot , and she could n't abide that <unk> . "
then i thought " 't is for me that she <unk> and she <unk> ! "
and it soothed me to see those sensational <unk> , and i said " this is <unk> ! "
 a phrase i had learned from the devonshire <unk> .
and i vowed " 'twill be said i 'm a fortunate fellow , when the breakfast is spread , when the <unk> are mellow , when the foam of the <unk> is white , and the fierce <unk> are yellow ! "
o that languishing yawn !
o those eloquent eyes !
i was drunk with the <name> of a splendid surmise  i was stung by a look , i was slain by a tear , by a tempest of sighs .
and i whispered " 't is time !
is not love at its deepest ?
shall we squander life 's prime , while thou <unk> and <unk> ?
let us settle it , license or <unk> ?  though undoubtedly <unk> are the cheapest . "
" ah , my hero , " said i , " let me be thy <unk> ! "
but i lost her reply  something ending with " gander "  for the omnibus rattled so loud that no mortal could quite understand her .
the <name> <unk> ' .
the ladye she stood at her lattice high , wi ' her doggie at her feet ; thorough the lattice she can spy the <unk> in the street .
" there 's one that standeth at the door , and <unk> at the pin : now speak and say , my popinjay , if i <unk> let him in . "
then up and spake the popinjay that flew <unk> her head : " <unk> let him in that <unk> the pin : he cometh thee to <unk> " o when he cam ' the parlour in , a <unk> man was he !
" and <unk> ye <name> your lover <unk> , sae well that <unk> thee ? "
[ illustration ] " and how wad i <name> ye loved me , sir , that have been sae <name> away ?
and how wad i <name> ye loved me , sir ?
ye never <unk> me sae . "
said  " ladye dear , " and the salt , salt tear cam ' <unk> ' doon his cheek , " i have sent thee tokens of my love this many and many a week .
" o <unk> ye get the rings , ladye , the rings o ' the <unk> sae fine ?
i wot that i have sent to thee four score , four score and nine . "
" they cam ' to me , " said that fair ladye .
" wow , they were <unk> things ! "
said  " that chain o ' <unk> , my doggie to <unk> , it is made o ' <unk> self-same rings . "
" and <unk> ye get the locks , the locks , the locks o ' my ain black hair , <unk> i sent by post , <unk> i sent by box , <unk> i sent by the carrier ? "
" they cam ' to me , " said that fair ladye ; " and i prithee send <unk> <unk> ! "
said  " that cushion sae red , for my doggie 's head , it is stuffed wi ' <unk> locks o ' hair . "
" and <unk> ye get the letter , ladye , tied wi ' a silken string , <unk> i sent to thee <unk> the far <unk> , a message of love to bring ? "
" it cam ' to me <unk> the far <unk> wi ' its silken string and a ' ; but it <unk> <unk> , " said that <unk> maid , " sae i <unk> 'd them tak ' it awa ' . "
" o ever alack that ye sent it back , it was written sae <unk> and well !
now the message it brought , and the boon that it sought , i must even say it <unk> ' . "
then up and spake the popinjay , sae wisely <unk> he .
" now say it in the proper way : <unk> doon upon thy knee ! "
the lover he turned <unk> red and pale , went doon upon his knee : " o ladye , hear the <unk> tale that must be told to thee !
" for five <name> years , and five <name> years , i <unk> thee by looks ; by nods and winks , by smiles and tears , as i had read in books .
" for ten <name> years , o weary hours !
i <unk> thee by signs ; by sending game , by sending flowers , by sending <unk> .
" for five <name> years , and five <name> years , i have dwelt in the far <unk> , till that thy mind should be inclined <unk> tenderly to me .
" now thirty years are <unk> and past , i am come <unk> a foreign land : i am come to tell thee my love at last  o ladye , <unk> me thy hand ! "
the ladye she turned not pale nor red , but she smiled a pitiful smile : " sic ' a <unk> ' as yours , my man , " she said " takes a <name> and a weary while ! "
and out and laughed the popinjay , a laugh of bitter scorn : " a <unk> ' done in sic ' a way , it ought not to be borne ! "
[ illustration : " and out and laughed the popinjay " ] wi ' that the doggie barked aloud , and up and doon he ran , and tugged and strained his chain o ' <unk> , all for to bite the man .
" o hush thee , gentle popinjay !
o hush thee , doggie dear !
there is a word i fain wad say , it <unk> he should hear ! "
aye louder screamed that ladye fair to drown her doggie 's bark : ever the lover shouted <unk> to make that ladye hark : shrill and more shrill the popinjay upraised his angry squall : i trow the doggie 's voice that day was louder than them all !
the <unk> and <unk> sat by the kitchen fire : they heard sic ' a din the parlour within as made them much admire .
[ illustration : " o hush thee , gentle popinjay ! " ]
out spake the boy in buttons ( i <unk> he <unk> thin ) , " now wha <name> <unk> the parlour <unk> , and stay this <unk> din ? "
and they have <unk> a <unk> , <unk> their <unk> in , for wha should <unk> the parlour <unk> , and stay that <unk> din .
when on that boy the <unk> fell to stay the <unk> noise , " <unk> in , " they cried , " <unk> betide , thou <name> of <unk> ! "
syne , he has <unk> a supple cane to <unk> that dog sae fat : the doggie <unk> , the doggie howled the louder aye for that .
syne , he has <unk> a <unk>  the doggie ceased his noise , and followed doon the kitchen stair that <name> of <unk> !
[ illustration : " the doggie ceased his noise " ] then sadly spake that ladye fair , wi ' a frown upon her brow : " o dearer to me is my <unk> ' doggie than a dozen sic ' as thou !
" <unk> use , <unk> use for sighs and tears : <unk> use at all to fret : sin ' ye 've <unk> sae well for thirty years , ye may bide a wee <unk> yet ! "
sadly , sadly he crossed the floor and <unk> at the pin : sadly went he through the door where sadly he cam ' in .
" o gin i had a popinjay to fly <unk> my head , to tell me what i ought to say , i had by this been <unk> " o gin i find <unk> ladye , " he said wi ' sighs and tears , " i wot my <unk> ' <unk> not be <unk> thirty years : " for gin i find a ladye <name> , exactly to my taste , i 'll pop the question , aye or nay , in twenty years at <unk> . "
[ illustration ] four riddles .
[ these consist of two double <unk> and two <unk> .
no .
i. was written at the request of some young friends , who had gone to a ball at an oxford commemoration  and also as a specimen of what might be done by making the double <unk> a connected poem instead of what it has hitherto been , a string of disjointed stanzas , on every conceivable subject , and about as interesting to read straight through as a <name> of a <unk> .
the first two stanzas describe the two main words , and each subsequent stanza one of the cross " lights . "
no .
ii .
was written after seeing miss <name> <name> perform in the play of " hamlet . "
in this case the first stanza describes the two main words .
no .
iii .
was written after seeing miss <name> <name> perform in mr. <name> 's play of " <unk> and <unk> . "
the three stanzas respectively describe " my first , " " my second , " and " my whole . " ]
i .
there was an ancient city , stricken down with a strange frenzy , and for many a day they paced from morn to <name> the crowded town , and danced the night away .
i asked the cause : the aged man grew sad : they pointed to a building gray and tall , and hoarsely answered " step inside , my lad , and then you 'll see it all . "
* * * * * yet what are all such <unk> to me whose thoughts are full of <unk> and <unk> ?
x { 2 } + <unk> + 53 = <unk> .
but something whispered " it <name> soon be done : bands can not always play , nor ladies smile : endure with <name> the distasteful fun for just a little while ! "
a change came o'er my vision  it was night : we <unk> a pathway through a frantic throng : the steeds , <unk> , filled us with affright : the chariots whirled along .
within a marble hall a river ran  a living tide , half muslin and half cloth : and here one mourned a broken wreath or fan , yet swallowed down her wrath ; and here one offered to a thirsty fair ( his words <unk> amid those thunders <unk> ) some frozen <unk> ( there were many there ) , a <unk> in each spoonful .
there comes a happy pause , for human strength <name> not endure to dance without cessation ; and every one must reach the point at length of absolute prostration .
at such a moment ladies learn to give , to partners who would urge them <unk> , a flat and yet decided negative  <unk> love such .
there comes a welcome summons  <name> <unk> , and fading eyes grow bright , and pulses <unk> : incessant pop the corks , and busy knives dispense the tongue and chicken .
flushed with new life , the crowd flows back again : and all is tangled talk and <unk> motion  much like a waving field of golden grain , or a tempestuous ocean .
and thus they give the time , that nature meant for peaceful sleep and meditative snores , to ceaseless din and <unk> merriment and waste of shoes and floors .
and one ( we name him not ) that flies the flowers , that dreads the dances , and that shuns the <unk> , they doom to pass in solitude the hours , writing <unk> .
how late it grows !
the hour is surely past that should have warned us with its <unk> ?
the twilight <unk> , and morning comes at last  " oh , uncle , what 's o'clock ? "
the uncle gravely nods , and wisely winks .
it may mean much , but how is one to know ?
he <unk> his mouth  yet out of it , methinks , no words of wisdom flow .
ii .
empress of <name> , for thee i twine this wreath with all too slender skill .
forgive my muse each halting line , and for the deed accept the <name> !
* * * * * o day of tears !
whence comes this spectre grim , parting , like death 's cold river , souls that love ?
is not he bound to thee , as thou to him , by vows , <unk> here , yet heard above ?
and still it lives , that keen and heavenward flame , lives in his eye , and trembles in his tone : and these wild words of fury but proclaim a heart that beats for thee , for thee alone !
but all is lost : that mighty mind <unk> , like sweet bells <unk> , piteous sight to see !
" doubt that the stars are fire , " so runs his moan , " doubt truth herself , but not my love for thee ! "
a sadder vision yet : thine aged sire <unk> his hoary locks with treacherous <unk> !
and dost thou now doubt truth to be a liar ?
and wilt thou die , that hast forgot to smile ?
nay , get thee hence !
leave all thy <unk> ways and the faint fragrance of thy scattered flowers : in holy silence wait the appointed days , and weep away the <unk> hours .
iii .
the air is bright with hues of light and <name> with laughter and with singing : young hearts beat high in ecstasy , and banners wave , and bells are ringing : but silence falls with fading day , and there 's an end to mirth and play .
ah , <unk> !
rest your old bones , ye wrinkled <unk> !
the kettle sings , the firelight dances .
deep be it <unk> , the magic draught that fills the soul with golden fancies !
for youth and <unk> <name> not stay , and ye are withered , worn , and gray .
ah , <unk> !
o fair cold face !
o form of <name> , for human passion madly yearning !
o weary air of dumb despair , from marble won , to marble turning !
" leave us not thus ! "
we fondly pray .
" we can not let thee pass away ! "
ah , <unk> !
iv .
my first is singular at best : more plural is my second : my third is far the <unk>  so <unk> , i protest it scarcely can be reckoned !
my first is followed by a bird : my second by believers in magic <name> : my simple third follows , too often , hopes absurd and plausible <unk> .
my first to get at wisdom tries  a failure melancholy !
my second men revered as wise : my third from heights of wisdom flies to depths of frantic folly .
my first is <unk> day by day : my second 's age is ended : my third enjoys an age , they say , that never seems to fade away , through centuries extended .
my whole ?
i need a poet 's pen to paint her myriad phases : the monarch , and the slave , of men  a <unk> , and a den of dark and deadly mazes  a flashing light  a fleeting shade  beginning , end , and middle of all that human <name> hath made or wit devised !
go , seek her aid , if you would read my riddle !
fame 's <unk> .
[ affectionately dedicated to all " original <unk> " who pant for " endowment . " ]
blow , blow your trumpets till they crack , ye little men of little souls !
and bid them huddle at your back  <unk> <unk> , shoals on shoals !
fill all the air with hungry wails  " reward us , ere we think or write !
without your gold mere knowledge fails to sate the <unk> appetite ! "
and , where great plato paced serene , or <name> paused with wistful eye , rush to the <unk> with hoofs unclean and <unk> of the sty !
be yours the pay : be theirs the praise : we <name> not <name> them of their due , nor vex the ghosts of other days by naming them along with you .
they sought and found undying fame : they toiled not for reward nor thanks : their cheeks are hot with honest shame for you , the modern <unk> !
who preach of justice  plead with tears that love and <name> should abound  while marking with complacent ears the moaning of some tortured hound : who prate of wisdom  nay , forbear , lest wisdom turn on you in wrath , trampling , with heel that <name> not spare , the vermin that beset her path !
go , throng each other 's drawing-rooms , ye idols of a petty <unk> : strut your brief hour in borrowed plumes , and make your <unk> squeak : [ illustration : " go , throng each other 's drawing-rooms " ] deck your dull talk with <unk> shreds of learning from a nobler time , and oil each other 's little heads with mutual flattery 's golden slime : and when the topmost height ye gain , and stand in <name> 's ether clear , and grasp the prize of all your pain  so many hundred pounds a year  then let fame 's banner be <unk> !
sing <unk> for a victory won !
ye tapers , that would light the world , and cast a shadow on the sun  who still shall pour his rays sublime , one <name> flood , from east to west , when ye have burned your little time and feebly flickered into rest !

" in my youth , " father <name> replied to his son , " i feared it might injure the <name> ; but , now that i 'm perfectly sure i have none , why i do it again and again . " ]
[ illustration ] " you are old , " said the youth , " as i mentioned before , and have grown most uncommonly fat ; yet you turned a <unk> in at the door  pray , what is the reason of that ? "
" in my youth , " said the sage , as he shook his grey locks , " i kept all my limbs very supple by the use of this <unk>  one shilling the box  allow me to sell you a couple . "
" you are old , " said the youth , " and your jaws are too weak for anything <unk> than suet ; yet you finished the goose , with the bones and the beak  pray , how did you manage to do it ? "
" in my youth , " said his father , " i took to the law , and argued each case with my wife ; and the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw , has lasted the rest of my life . "
" you are old , " said the youth ; " one would hardly suppose that your eye was as steady as ever ; yet you balance an eel on the end of your nose  what made you so awfully clever ? "
" i have answered three questions , and that is enough , " said his father ; " do n't give yourself airs !
do you think i can listen all day to such stuff ?
be off , or i 'll kick you down stairs ! "

said a whiting to a snail , " there 's a porpoise close behind us , and he 's treading on my tail .
see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance !
they are waiting on the shingle  <name> you come and join the dance ?

[ illustration ] " you can really have no notion how delightful it <name> be when they take us up and throw us , with the lobsters , out to sea ! "
but the snail replied , " too far , too far ! "
and gave a look askance  said he thanked the whiting kindly , but he would not join the dance .
would not , could not , would not , could not , would not join the dance .
would not , could not , would not , could not , could not join the dance .
" what matters it how far we go ? "
his <unk> friend replied ; " there is another shore , you know , upon the other side .
the further off from england the nearer is to <name>  then turn not pale , <unk> snail , but come and join the dance .

[ illustration ] [ <unk> 's note : the <unk> at the end of the third line of the second verse is deliberate in the original , so that " two p " pronounced as one syllable rhymes with " soup . " ]
[ illustration : the <name> of hearts ] [ music : the <name> of hearts , she made some tarts , all on a summer day : the knave of hearts , he stole those tarts , and took them quite away ! ]
[ illustration ] [ illustration : who stole the tarts ] [ music : they told me you had been to her , and mentioned me to him : she gave me a good character , but said i could not swim .
he sent them word i had not gone ( we know it to be true ) : if she should push the matter on , what would become of you ? ]
i gave her one , they gave him two , you gave us three or more ; they all returned from him to you , though they were mine before .
if i or she should chance to be involved in this affair , he trusts to you to set them free , exactly as we were .
my notion was that you had been ( before she had this fit ) an obstacle that came between him , and ourselves , and it .
do n't let him know she liked them best , for this must ever be a secret , kept from all the rest , between yourself and me .
[ illustration ] [ illustration ] [ illustration : songs from through the looking-glass ] [ illustration ] [ illustration : <unk> ] [ music : 't was <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> did <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> ; all <unk> were the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
" beware the <unk> , my son !
the jaws that bite , the claws that catch !
beware the <unk> bird , and shun the <unk> <unk> ! " ]
[ illustration ] he took his <unk> sword in hand : long time the <unk> foe he sought  so rested he by the <unk> tree , and stood awhile in thought .
and as in <unk> thought he stood , the <unk> , with eyes of flame , came <unk> through the <unk> wood , and <unk> as it came .
one , two !
one , two !
and through and through the <unk> blade went <unk> !
he left it dead , and with its head he went <unk> back .
" and hast thou slain the <unk> ?  come to my arms , my <unk> boy !
o <unk> day !

he <unk> in his <name> .
't was <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> did <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> ; all <unk> were the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
[ illustration ] [ illustration : tweedledum and tweedledee ] [ music : tweedledum and tweedledee agreed to have a battle ; for tweedledum said tweedledee had spoiled his nice new rattle .
just then flew down a monstrous crow , as black as a tar barrel ; which frightened both the heroes so , they quite forgot their quarrel . ]
[ illustration ] [ illustration ] [ illustration : the walrus and the carpenter ] [ music : the sun was shining on the sea , shining with all his might : he did his very best to make the billows smooth and bright  and this was odd , because it was the middle of the night . ]
the moon was shining sulkily , because she thought the sun had got no <unk> to be there after the day was done  " it 's very rude of him , " she said , " to come and spoil the fun ! "
the sea was wet as wet could be , the sands were dry as dry .
you could not see a cloud , because no cloud was in the sky : no birds were flying overhead  there were no birds to fly .
the walrus and the carpenter were walking close at hand ; they wept like anything to see such quantities of sand : " if this were only cleared away , " they said , " it would be grand ! "
" if seven maids with seven <unk> swept it for half a year , do you suppose , " the walrus said , " that they could get it clear ? "
" i doubt it , " said the carpenter , and shed a bitter tear .
" o , oysters , come and walk with us ! "
the walrus did beseech , " a pleasant walk , a pleasant talk , along the <unk> beach : we can not do with more than four , to give a hand to each . "
the eldest oyster looked at him , but never a word he said : the eldest oyster winked his eye , and shook his heavy head  meaning to say he did not choose to leave the <unk> .
but four young oysters hurried up , all eager for the treat : their coats were brushed , their faces washed , their shoes were clean and neat  and this was odd , because , you know , they had n't any feet !
four other oysters followed them , and yet another four ; and thick and fast they came at last , and more , and more , and more  all hopping through the <unk> waves , and scrambling to the shore .
[ illustration ] the walrus and the carpenter walked on a mile or so , and then they rested on a rock conveniently low ; and all the little oysters stood and waited in a row .
" the time has come , " the walrus said , " to talk of many things : of shoes  and ships  and <unk>  of cabbages  and kings  and why the sea is boiling hot  and whether pigs have wings . "
" but wait a bit , " the oysters cried , " before we have our chat ; for some of us are out of breath , and all of us are fat ! "
" no hurry , " said the carpenter : they thanked him much for that .
" a loaf of bread , " the walrus said , " is chiefly what we need : pepper and vinegar , besides , are very good indeed  now , if you 're ready , oysters dear , we can begin to feed . "
" but not on us ! "
the oysters cried , turning a little blue .
" after such kindness , that would be a dismal thing to do ! "
" the night is fine , " the walrus said .
" do you admire the view ? "
" it was so kind of you to come !
and you are very nice ! "
the carpenter said nothing , but " cut us another slice : i wish you were not quite so deaf  i 've had to ask you twice ! "
" it seems a shame , " the walrus said , " to play them such a trick , after we 've brought them out so far , and made them trot so quick ! "
the carpenter said nothing , but " the butter 's spread too thick ! "
" i weep for you , " the walrus said : " i deeply sympathize . "
with sobs and tears he sorted out those of the largest size , holding his pocket-handkerchief before his streaming eyes .

[ illustration ] i sent a message to the fish : i told them " this is what i wish . "
the little fishes of the sea they sent an answer back to me .
the little fishes ' answer was " we can not do it , sir , because  " i sent to them again to say " it <name> be better to obey . "
the fishes answered , with a grin , " why , what a temper you are in ! "
i told them once , i told them twice : they would not listen to advice .
i took a kettle large and new , fit for the deed i had to do .
my heart went hop , my heart went thump ; i filled the kettle at the pump .
then some one came to me , and said , " the little fishes are in bed . "
i said to him , i said it plain , " then you must wake them up again . "
i said it very loud and clear ; i went and shouted in his ear .
but he was very stiff and proud ; he said , " you need n't shout so loud ! "
and he was very proud and stiff ; he said , " i 'd go and wake them , if  " i took a corkscrew from the shelf : i went to wake them up myself .
and when i found the door was locked , i pulled and pushed , and kicked and knocked .

" who are you , aged man ? "
i said .
" and how is it you live ? "
and his answer trickled through my head like water through a <unk> . ]
he said , " i look for butterflies that sleep among the wheat : i make them into mutton pies , and sell them in the street .
i sell them unto men , " he said , " who sail on <name> seas ; and that 's the way i get my bread  a trifle , if you please . "
but i was thinking of a plan to dye one 's whiskers green , and always use so large a fan that they should not be seen .
so , having no reply to give to what the old man said , i cried , " come , tell me how you live ! "
and thumped him on the head .
his accents mild took up the tale : he said " i go my ways , and when i find a mountain rill , i set it in a blaze ; and thence they make a stuff they call <unk> ' <unk> oil  yet <unk> is all they give me for my toil ! "
but i was thinking of a way to feed oneself on batter , and so go on from day to day getting a little fatter .
i shook him well from side to side , until his face was blue : " come , tell me how you live , " i cried , " and what it is you do ! "
[ illustration ] he said , " i hunt for <unk> ' eyes among the <name> bright , and work them into <unk> in the silent night .
and these i do not sell for gold or coin of <unk> shine , but for a copper <unk> , and that <name> purchase nine . "
" i sometimes dig for buttered rolls , or set <unk> twigs for crabs ; i sometimes search the grassy knolls for wheels of <unk> !
and that 's the way " ( he gave a wink ) " by which i get my wealth  and very gladly <name> i drink your honour 's <name> health . "
i heard him then , for i had just completed my design to keep the <unk> bridge from rust by boiling it in wine .
i thanked him much for telling me the way he got his wealth , but chiefly for his wish that he might drink my <name> health .

less bread !
more taxes !
 and then all the people cheered again , and one man , who was more excited than the rest , flung his hat high into the air , and shouted ( as well as i could make out ) " who roar for the sub-warden ? "
everybody roared , but whether it was for the sub-warden , or not , did not clearly appear : some were shouting " bread ! "
and some " taxes !
" , but no one seemed to know what it was they really wanted .
all this i saw from the open window of the warden 's <unk> , looking across the shoulder of the lord chancellor , who had sprung to his feet the moment the shouting began , almost as if he had been expecting it , and had rushed to the window which commanded the best view of the market-place .
" what can it all mean ? "
he kept repeating to himself , as , with his hands clasped behind him , and his gown floating in the air , he paced rapidly up and down the room .
" i never heard such shouting before  and at this time of the morning , too !
and with such unanimity !
does n't it strike you as very remarkable ? "
i represented , modestly , that to my ears it appeared that they were shouting for different things , but the chancellor would not listen to my suggestion for a moment .
" they all shout the same words , i assure you ! "
he said : then , leaning well out of the window , he whispered to a man who was standing close underneath , " <unk> together , ca'n't you ?
the warden <name> be here directly .
<unk> the signal for the march up ! "
all this was evidently not meant for my ears , but i could scarcely help hearing it , considering that my <name> was almost on the <unk> shoulder .
the <unk> up ' was a very curious sight : [ image ... the <unk> ] a straggling procession of men , marching two and two , began from the other side of the market-place , and advanced in an irregular <unk> fashion towards the palace , wildly <unk> from side to side , like a sailing vessel making way against an unfavourable wind so that the head of the procession was often further from us at the end of one tack than it had been at the end of the previous one .
yet it was evident that all was being done under orders , for i noticed that all eyes were fixed on the man who stood just under the window , and to whom the chancellor was continually whispering .
this man held his hat in one hand and a little green flag in the other : whenever he waved the flag the procession advanced a little nearer , when he dipped it they sidled a little farther off , and whenever he waved his hat they all raised a hoarse cheer .
" <unk> ! "
they cried , carefully keeping time with the hat as it bobbed up and down .
" <unk> !
noo !
<unk> !
<unk> !
less !
bread !
more !
taxes ! "
" that 'll do , that 'll do ! "
the chancellor whispered .
" let 'em rest a bit till i give you the word .
he 's not here yet ! "
but at this moment the great <unk> of the saloon were flung open , and he turned with a guilty start to receive his high excellency .
however it was only <name> , and the chancellor gave a little gasp of relieved anxiety .
" morning ! "
said the little fellow , addressing the remark , in a general sort of way , to the chancellor and the waiters .
" <unk> oo know where <name> is ?
i 's looking for <name> ! "
" she 's with the warden , i believe , <unk> ! "
the chancellor replied with a low bow .
there was , no doubt , a certain amount of absurdity in applying this title ( which , as of course you see without my telling you , was nothing but 'your <name> highness ' condensed into one syllable ) to a small creature whose father was merely the warden of outland : still , large excuse must be made for a man who had passed several years at the court of fairyland , and had there acquired the almost impossible <name> of pronouncing five syllables as one .
but the bow was lost upon <name> , who had run out of the room , even while the great feat of the <unk> <unk> was being triumphantly performed .
just then , a single voice in the distance was understood to shout " a speech from the chancellor ! "
" certainly , my friends ! "
the chancellor replied with extraordinary <unk> .
" you shall have a speech ! "
here one of the waiters , who had been for some minutes busy making a <unk> mixture of egg and <name> , respectfully presented it on a large silver <unk> .
the chancellor took it haughtily , drank it off thoughtfully , smiled <unk> on the happy waiter as he set down the empty glass , and began .
to the best of my recollection this is what he said .
" ahem !
ahem !
ahem !
<unk> , or rather suffering fellows  " ( " do n't call 'em names ! "
muttered the man under the window .
" i did n't say <unk> ! "
the chancellor explained . )
" you may be sure that i always <unk>  " ( " 'ear , 'ear ! "
shouted the crowd , so loudly as quite to drown the orator 's thin <unk> voice ) "  that i always <unk>  " he repeated .
( " do n't <unk> quite so much ! "
said the man under the window .
" it makes <name> look a <unk> ! "
and , all this time , " 'ear , 'ear ! "
went rumbling round the market-place , like a peal of thunder . )
" that i always sympathise ! "
yelled the chancellor , the first moment there was silence .
" but your true friend is the sub-warden !
day and night he is brooding on your wrongs  i should say your rights  that is to say your wrongs  no , i mean your rights  " ( " do n't talk no more ! "
growled the man under the window .
" you 're making a mess of it ! " )
at this moment the sub-warden entered the saloon .
he was a thin man , with a mean and crafty face , and a <unk> complexion ; and he crossed the room very slowly , looking suspiciously about him as if be thought there might be a savage dog hidden somewhere .
" bravo ! "
he cried , patting the chancellor on the back .
" you did that speech very well indeed .
why , you 're a born orator , man ! "
" oh , that 's nothing !
the chancellor replied , modestly , with downcast eyes .
" most orators are born , you know . "
the sub-warden thoughtfully rubbed his <name> .
" why , so they are ! "
he admitted .
" i never considered it in that light .
still , you did it very well .
a word in your ear ! "
the rest of their conversation was all in whispers : so , as i could hear no more , i thought i would go and find <name> .
i found the little fellow standing in the passage , and being addressed by one of the men in livery , who stood before him , nearly bent double from extreme <unk> , with his hands hanging in front of him like the fins of a fish .
" his high excellency , " this respectful man was saying , " is in his study , <unk> ! "
( he did n't pronounce this quite so well as the chancellor . )
thither <name> trotted , and i thought it well to follow him .
the warden , a tall dignified man with a grave but very pleasant face , was seated before a writing-table , which was covered with papers , and holding on his knee one of the sweetest and loveliest little maidens it has ever been my lot to see .
she looked four or five years older than <name> , but she had the same <name> cheeks and sparkling eyes , and the same wealth of curly brown hair .
her eager smiling face was turned upwards towards her father 's , and it was a pretty sight to see the mutual love with which the two faces  one in the spring of life , the other in its late autumn  were gazing on each other .
" no , you 've never seen him , " the old man was saying : " you could n't , you know , he 's been away so long  traveling from land to land , and seeking for health , more years than you 've been alive , little <name> ! "
here <name> climbed upon his other knee , and a good deal of kissing , on a rather complicated system , was the result .
" he only came back last night , " said the warden , when the kissing was over : " he 's been traveling <unk> , for the last thousand miles or so , in order to be here on <name> 's birthday .
but he 's a very early <unk> , and i dare say he 's in the library already .
come with me and see him .
he 's always kind to children .
you 'll be sure to like him . "
" has the other professor come too ? "
<name> asked in an <unk> voice .
" yes , they arrived together .
the other professor is  well , you won't like him quite so much , perhaps .
he 's a little more dreamy , you know . "
" i wiss <name> was a little more dreamy , " said <name> .
" what do you mean , <name> ? "
said <name> .
<name> went on addressing his father .
" she says she ca'n't , oo know .
but i thinks it is n't ca'n't , it 's <unk> . "
" says she ca'n't dream ! "
the puzzled warden repeated .
" she do say it , " <name> persisted .
" when i says to her 'let 's stop lessons !
' , she says 'oh , i ca'n't dream of letting oo stop yet ! ' "
" he always wants to stop lessons , " <name> explained , " five minutes after we begin ! "
" five minutes ' lessons a day ! "
said the warden .
" you wo n't learn much at that rate , little man ! "
" that 's just what <name> says , " <name> rejoined .
" she says i <unk> learn my lessons .
and i tells her , over and over , i ca'n't learn 'em .
and what <unk> oo think she says ?
she says 'it is n't ca'n't , it's <unk> ! ' "
" let 's go and see the professor , " the warden said , wisely avoiding further discussion .
the children got down off his knees , each secured a hand , and the happy trio set off for the library  followed by me .
i had come to the conclusion by this time that none of the party ( except , for a few moments , the lord chancellor ) was in the least able to see me .
" what 's the matter with him ? "
<name> asked , walking with a little extra <unk> , by way of example to <name> at the other side , who never ceased jumping up and down .
[ image ... visiting the <unk> ] " what was the matter  but i <name> he 's all right now  was <unk> , and rheumatism , and that kind of thing .
he 's been curing himself , you know : he 's a very learned doctor .
why , he 's actually invented three new diseases , besides a new way of breaking your collar-bone ! "
" is it a nice way ? "
said <name> .
" well , hum , not very , " the warden said , as we entered the library .
" and here is the professor .
good morning , professor !
<name> you 're quite rested after your journey ! "
a <unk> , fat little man , in a flowery dressing-gown , with a large book under each arm , came trotting in at the other end of the room , and was going straight across without taking any notice of the children .
" i 'm looking for vol .
three , " he said .
" do you happen to have seen it ? "
" you do n't see my children , professor ! "
the warden exclaimed , taking him by the shoulders and turning him round to face them .
the professor laughed violently : then he gazed at them through his great spectacles , for a minute or two , without speaking .
at last he addressed <name> .
" i <name> you have had a good night , my child ? "
<name> looked puzzled .
" i 's had the same night oo 've had , " he replied .
" there 's only been one night since yesterday ! "
it was the professor 's turn to look puzzled now .
he took off his spectacles , and rubbed them with his handkerchief .
then he gazed at them again .
then he turned to the warden .
" are they bound ? "
he enquired .
" no , we are n't , " said <name> , who thought himself quite able to answer this question .
the professor shook his head sadly .
" not even <unk> ? "
" why would we be <unk> ? "
said <name> .
" we 're not prisoners ! "
but the professor had forgotten all about them by this time , and was speaking to the warden again .
" you 'll be glad to hear , " he was saying , " that the barometer 's beginning to move  " " well , which way ? "
said the warden  adding , to the children , " not that i care , you know .
only he thinks it affects the weather .
he 's a wonderfully clever man , you know .
sometimes he says things that only the other professor can understand .
sometimes he says things that nobody can understand !
which way is it , professor ?
up or down ? "
" neither ! "
said the professor , gently clapping his hands .
" it 's going sideways  if i may so express myself . "
" and what kind of weather does that produce ? "
said the warden .
" listen , children !
now you 'll hear something worth knowing ! "
" horizontal weather , " said the professor , and made straight for the door , very nearly trampling on <name> , who had only just time to get out of his way .
" is n't he learned ? "
the warden said , looking after him with admiring eyes .
" positively he runs over with learning ! "
" but he need n't run over me ! "
said <name> .
the professor was back in a moment : he had changed his dressing-gown for a frock-coat , and had put on a pair of very <unk> boots , the tops of which were open umbrellas .
" i thought you 'd like to see them , " he said .
" these are the boots for horizontal weather ! "
[ image ... boots for horizontal weather ] " but what 's the use of wearing umbrellas round one 's knees ? "
" in ordinary rain , " the professor admitted , " they would not be of much use .
but if ever it rained horizontally , you know , they would be invaluable  simply invaluable ! "
" take the professor to the <unk> , children , " said the warden .
" and tell them not to wait for me .
i had breakfast early , as i 've some business to attend to . "
the children seized the <unk> hands , as familiarly as if they had known him for years , and hurried him away .
i followed respectfully behind .
chapter 2 .
<unk> <unk> .
as we entered the <unk> , the professor was saying "  and he had breakfast by himself , early : so he begged you would n't wait for him , my <name> .
this way , my <name> , " he added , " this way ! "
and then , with ( as it seemed to me ) most superfluous politeness , he flung open the door of my compartment , and ushered in "  a young and lovely <name> ! "
i muttered to myself with some bitterness .
" and this is , of course , the opening scene of vol .
i .
she is the heroine .
and i am one of those subordinate characters that only turn up when needed for the development of her <name> , and whose final appearance is outside the church , waiting to greet the happy pair ! "
" yes , my <name> , change at <unk> , " were the next words i heard ( oh that too obsequious guard !
) , " next station but one . "
and the door closed , and the <name> settled down into her corner , and the monotonous throb of the engine ( making one feel as if the train were some gigantic monster , whose very circulation we could feel ) proclaimed that we were once more speeding on our way .
" the <name> had a perfectly formed nose , " i caught myself saying to myself , " <name> eyes , and lips  " and here it occurred to me that to see , for myself , what " the <name> " was really like , would be more satisfactory than much speculation .
i looked round cautiously , and  was entirely disappointed of my <name> .
the veil , which shrouded her whole face , was too thick for me to see more than the glitter of bright eyes and the hazy outline of what might be a lovely oval face , but might also , unfortunately , be an equally unlovely one .
i closed my eyes again , saying to myself "  could n't have a better chance for an experiment in <unk> !
i 'll think out her face , and afterwards test the portrait with the original . "
at first , no result at all crowned my efforts , though i <unk> my swift mind , ' now hither , now thither , in a way that i felt sure would have made <unk> green with envy : but the <unk> oval remained as <unk> blank as ever  a mere ellipse , as if in some mathematical diagram , without even the <unk> that might be made to do duty as a nose and a mouth .
gradually , however , the conviction came upon me that i could , by a certain concentration of thought , think the veil away , and so get a glimpse of the mysterious face  as to which the two questions , " is she pretty ? "
and " is she plain ?
" , still <name> suspended , in my mind , in beautiful <unk> .
success was partial  and fitful  still there was a result : ever and anon , the veil seemed to vanish , in a sudden flash of light : but , before i could fully realise the face , all was dark again .
in each such glimpse , the face seemed to grow more childish and more innocent : and , when i had at last thought the veil entirely away , it was , <unk> , the sweet face of little <name> !
" so , either i 've been dreaming about <name> , " i said to myself , " and this is the reality .
or else i 've really been with <name> , and this is a dream !
is life itself a dream , i wonder ? "
to occupy the time , i got out the letter , which had caused me to take this sudden <unk> from my london home down to a strange <unk> on the north coast , and read it over again :  " dear old friend , " i 'm sure it <name> be as great a pleasure to me , as it can possibly be to you , to meet once more after so many years : and of course i shall be ready to give you all the benefit of such medical skill as i have : only , you know , one must n't violate professional etiquette !
and you are already in the hands of a first-rate london doctor , with whom it would be utter affectation for me to pretend to compete .
( i make no doubt he is right in saying the heart is affected : all your symptoms point that way . )
one thing , at any rate , i have already done in my <unk> capacity  secured you a bedroom on the <unk> , so that you <name> not need to ascend the stairs at all .
" i shalt expect you by last train on friday , in accordance with your letter : and , till then , i shalt say , in the words of the old song , 'oh for friday nicht !
friday 's <name> a-coming ! '
" yours always , " <name> forester .
" p.s .
do you believe in fate ? "
this postscript puzzled me sorely .
" he is far too sensible a man , " i thought , " to have become a <unk> .
and yet what else can he mean by it ? "
and , as i folded up the letter and put it away , i <unk> repeated the words aloud .
" do you believe in fate ? "
the fair <unk> ' turned her head quickly at the sudden question .
" no , i do n't ! "
she said with a smile .
" do you ? "
" i  i did n't mean to ask the question ! "
i stammered , a little taken aback at having begun a conversation in so <unk> a fashion .
the <name> 's smile became a laugh  not a mocking laugh , but the laugh of a happy child who is perfectly at her ease .
" did n't you ? "
she said .
" then it was a case of what you doctors call <unk> <unk> ' ? "
" i am no doctor , " i replied .
" do i look so like one ?
or what makes you think it ? "
she pointed to the book i had been reading , which was so lying that its title , " diseases of the heart , " was plainly visible .
" one need n't be a doctor , " i said , " to take an interest in medical books .
there 's another class of readers , who are yet more deeply interested  " " you mean the patients ? "
she interrupted , while a look of tender pity gave new sweetness to her face .
" but , " with an evident wish to avoid a possibly painful topic , " one need n't be either , to take an interest in books of science .
which contain the greatest amount of science , do you think , the books , or the minds ? "
" rather a profound question for a <name> ! "
i said to myself , holding , with the conceit so natural to man , that woman 's intellect is essentially shallow .
and i considered a minute before replying .
" if you mean living minds , i do n't think it 's possible to decide .
there is so much written science that no living person has ever read : and there is so much <unk> science that has n't yet been written .
but , if you mean the whole human race , then i think the minds have it : everything , recorded in books , must have once been in some mind , you know . "
" is n't that rather like one of the rules in algebra ? "
my <name> enquired .
( " algebra too ! "
i thought with increasing wonder . )
" i mean , if we consider thoughts as factors , may we not say that the least common multiple of all the minds contains that of all the books ; but not the other way ? "
" certainly we may ! "
i replied , delighted with the illustration .
" and what a grand thing it would be , " i went on dreamily , thinking aloud rather than talking , " if we could only apply that rule to books !
you know , in finding the least common multiple , we strike out a quantity wherever it occurs , except in the term where it is raised to its highest power .
so we should have to <unk> every recorded thought , except in the sentence where it is expressed with the greatest intensity . "
my <name> laughed merrily .
" some books would be reduced to blank paper , i 'm afraid ! "
she said .
" they would .
most libraries would be terribly diminished in bulk .
but just think what they would gain in quality ! "
" when <name> it be done ? "
she eagerly asked .
" if there 's any chance of it in my time , i think i 'll leave off reading , and wait for it ! "
" well , perhaps in another thousand years or so  " " then there 's no use waiting !
" , said my <name> .
" let 's sit down .
uggug , my pet , come and sit by me ! "
" anywhere but by me ! "
growled the sub-warden .
" the little wretch always manages to upset his coffee ! "
i guessed at once ( as perhaps the reader <name> also have guessed , if , like myself , he is very clever at drawing conclusions ) that my <name> was the sub-warden 's wife , and that uggug ( a hideous fat boy , about the same age as <name> , with the expression of a <unk> ) was their son .
<name> and <name> , with the lord chancellor , made up a party of seven .
[ image ... a portable <unk> ] " and you actually got a <unk> every morning ? "
said the sub-warden , seemingly in continuation of a conversation with the professor .
" even at the little <unk> ? "
" oh , certainly , certainly ! "
the professor replied with a smile on his jolly face .
" allow me to explain .
it is , in fact , a very simple problem in <unk> .
( that means a combination of water and strength . )
if we take a <unk> , and a man of great strength ( such as myself ) about to plunge into it , we have a perfect example of this science .
i am bound to admit , " the professor continued , in a lower tone and with downcast eyes , " that we need a man of remarkable strength .
he must be able to spring from the floor to about twice his own height , gradually turning over as he rises , so as to come down again head first . "
" why , you need a flea , not a man ! "
exclaimed the sub-warden .
" pardon me , " said the professor .
" this particular kind of bath is not adapted for a flea .
let us suppose , " he continued , folding his <unk> into a graceful <unk> , " that this represents what is perhaps the necessity of this age  the active tourist 's portable bath .
you may describe it briefly , if you like , " looking at the chancellor , " by the letters <unk> . "
the chancellor , much disconcerted at finding everybody looking at him , could only murmur , in a shy whisper , " precisely so ! "
" one great advantage of this <unk> , " continued the professor , " is that it requires only <unk> of water  " " i do n't call it a <unk> , " his <unk> remarked , " unless your active tourist goes right under ! "
" but he does go right under , " the old man gently replied .
" the <unk> hangs up the p. b. on a nail  thus .
he then empties the <unk> into it  places the empty jug below the bag  leaps into the air  descends <unk> into the bag  the water rises round him to the top of the bag  and there you are ! "
he triumphantly concluded .
" the <unk> is as much under water as if he 'd gone a mile or two down into the atlantic ! "
" and he 's drowned , let us say , in about four minutes  " " by no means ! "
the professor answered with a proud smile .
" after about a minute , he quietly turns a tap at the lower end of the p .
b.  all the water runs back into the jug and there you are again ! "
" but how in the world is he to get out of the bag again ? "
" that , i take it , " said the professor , " is the most beautiful part of the whole invention .
all the way up the <unk> , inside , are loops for the thumbs ; so it 's something like going up-stairs , only perhaps less comfortable ; and , by the time the a. t. has risen out of the bag , all but his head , he 's sure to <unk> over , one way or the other  the law of gravity secures that .
and there he is on the floor again ! "
" a little bruised , perhaps ? "
" well , yes , a little bruised ; but having had his <unk> : that's the great thing . "
" wonderful !
it 's almost beyond belief ! "
murmured the sub-warden .
the professor took it as a compliment , and bowed with a gratified smile .
" quite beyond belief ! "
my <name> added  meaning , no doubt , to be more complimentary still .
the professor bowed , but he did n't smile this time .
" i can assure you , " he said earnestly , " that , provided the bath was made , i used it every morning .
i certainly ordered it  that i am clear about  my only doubt is , whether the man ever finished making it .
it 's difficult to remember , after so many years  " at this moment the door , very slowly and <unk> , began to open , and <name> and <name> jumped up , and ran to meet the well-known footstep .
chapter 3 .
<unk> .
" it 's my brother ! "
the sub-warden exclaimed , in a warning whisper .
" speak out , and be quick about it ! "
the appeal was evidently addressed to the lord chancellor , who instantly replied , in a shrill monotone , like a little boy repeating the alphabet , " as i was remarking , your <unk> , this portentous movement  " " you began too soon ! "
the other interrupted , scarcely able to restrain himself to a whisper , so great was his excitement .
" he could n't have heard you .
begin again ! "
" as i was remarking , " chanted the obedient lord chancellor , " this portentous movement has already assumed the dimensions of a revolution ! "
" and what are the dimensions of a revolution ? "
the voice was genial and mellow , and the face of the tall dignified old man , who had just entered the room , leading <name> by the hand , and with <name> riding triumphantly on his shoulder , was too <name> and gentle to have scared a less guilty man : but the lord chancellor turned pale instantly , and could hardly articulate the words " the dimensions your  your high excellency ?
i  i  scarcely comprehend ! "
" well , the length , breadth , and thickness , if you like it better ! "
and the old man smiled , <unk> .
the lord chancellor recovered himself with a great effort , and pointed to the open window .
" if your high excellency <name> listen for a moment to the shouts of the exasperated populace  " ( " of the exasperated populace ! "
the sub-warden repeated in a louder tone , as the lord chancellor , being in a state of abject terror , had dropped almost into a whisper ) "  you <name> understand what it is they <unk> "
and at that moment there surged into the room a hoarse confused cry , in which the only clearly audible words were " less  bread  more  taxes ! "
the old man laughed heartily .
" what in the world  " he was beginning : but the chancellor heard him not .
" some mistake ! "
he muttered , hurrying to the window , from which he shortly returned with an air of relief .
" now listen ! "
he exclaimed , holding up his hand impressively .
and now the words came quite distinctly , and with the regularity of the ticking of a clock , " more  bread  less taxes ! ' "
" more bread ! "
the warden repeated in astonishment .
" why , the new government <unk> was opened only last week , and i gave orders to sell the bread at <unk> during the present scarcity !
what can they expect more ? "
" the <unk> 's closed , <unk> ! "
the chancellor said , more loudly and clearly than he had spoken yet .
he was emboldened by the consciousness that here , at least , he had evidence to produce : and he placed in the warden 's hands a few printed notices , that were lying ready , with some open <unk> , on a <unk> .
" yes , yes , i see ! "
the warden muttered , glancing carelessly through them .
" order <unk> by my brother , and supposed to be my doing !
rather sharp practice !
it 's all right ! "
he added in a louder tone .
" my name is signed to it : so i take it on myself .
but what do they mean by 'less taxes ' ?
how can they be less ?
i abolished the last of them a month ago ! "
" it 's been put on again , <unk> , and by <unk> 's own orders !
" , and other printed notices were submitted for inspection .
the warden , whilst looking them over , glanced once or twice at the sub-warden , who had seated himself before one of the open <unk> , and was quite absorbed in adding it up ; but he merely repeated " it 's all right .
i accept it as my doing . "
" and they do say , " the chancellor went on sheepishly  looking much more like a convicted thief than an officer of state , " that a change of government , by the abolition of the sub-warden  i mean , " he hastily added , on seeing the warden 's look of astonishment , " the abolition of the office of sub-warden , and giving the present holder the right to act as vice-warden whenever the warden is absent  would appease all this seedling discontent i mean , " he added , glancing at a paper he held in his hand , " all this seething discontent ! "
" for fifteen years , " put in a deep but very harsh voice , " my husband has been acting as sub-warden .
it is too long !
it is much too long ! "
my <name> was a vast creature at all times : but , when she frowned and folded her arms , as now , she looked more gigantic than ever , and made one try to fancy what a haystack would look like , if out of temper .
" he would distinguish himself as a vice ! "
my <name> proceeded , being far too stupid to see the double meaning of her words .
" there has been no such vice in outland for many a long year , as he would be ! "
" what course would you suggest , sister ? "
the warden mildly enquired .
my <name> stamped , which was undignified : and snorted , which was <unk> .
" this is no jesting matter ! "
she bellowed .
" i <name> consult my brother , said the warden .
" brother ! "
"  and seven makes a hundred and ninety-four , which is sixteen and <unk> , " the sub-warden replied .
" put down two and <name> sixteen . "
the chancellor raised his hands and eyebrows , lost in admiration .
" such a man of business ! "
he murmured .
" brother , could i have a word with you in my study ? "
the warden said in a louder tone .
the sub-warden rose with alacrity , and the two left the room together .
my <name> turned to the professor , who had uncovered the urn , and was taking its temperature with his <unk> .
" professor ! "
she began , so loudly and suddenly that even uggug , who had gone to sleep in his chair , left off snoring and opened one eye .
the professor pocketed his thermometer in a moment , clasped his hands , and put his head on one side with a meek smile " you were teaching my son before breakfast , i believe ? "
my <name> loftily remarked .
" i <name> he strikes you as having talent ? "
" oh , very much so indeed , my <name> ! "
the professor hastily replied , unconsciously rubbing his ear , while some painful recollection seemed to cross his mind .
" i was very forcibly struck by his magnificence , i assure you ! "
" he is a charming boy ! "
my <name> exclaimed .
" even his snores are more musical than those of other boys ! "
if that were so , the professor seemed to think , the snores of other boys must be something too awful to be endured : but he was a cautious man , and he said nothing .
" and he 's so clever ! "
my <name> continued .
" no one <name> enjoy your lecture more by the way , have you fixed the time for it yet ?
you 've never given one , you know : and it was promised years ago , before you  " yes , yes , my <name> , i know !
perhaps next tuesday or tuesday week  " " that <name> do very well , " said my <name> , graciously .
" of course you <name> let the other professor lecture as well ? "
" i think not , my <name> ?
the professor said with some hesitation .
" you see , he always stands with his back to the audience .
it does very well for reciting ; but for lecturing  " " you are quite right , " said my <name> .
" and , now i come to think of it , there would hardly be time for more than one lecture .
and it <name> go off all the better , if we begin with a banquet , and a <unk> ball  " " it <name> indeed ! "
the professor cried , with enthusiasm .
" i shall come as a <unk> , " my <name> calmly proceeded .
" what shall you come as , professor ? "
the professor smiled feebly .
" i shall come as  as early as i can , my <name> ! "
" you must n't come in before the doors are opened , " said my <name> .
" i ca'n't , " said the professor .
" excuse me a moment .
as this is <name> <name> 's birthday , i would like to  " and he rushed away .
<name> began feeling in his pockets , looking more and more melancholy as he did so : then he put his thumb in his mouth , and considered for a minute : then he quietly left the room .
he had hardly done so before the professor was back again , quite out of breath .
" wishing you many happy returns of the day , my dear child ! "
he went on , addressing the smiling little girl , who had run to meet him .
" allow me to give you a <unk> .
it 's a second-hand <unk> , my dear .
and it only cost <unk> ! "
" thank you , it 's very pretty ! "
and <name> rewarded the old man with a hearty kiss .
" and the pins they gave me for nothing ! "
the professor added in high glee .
" fifteen of 'em , and only one bent ! "
" i 'll make the bent one into a hook ! "
said <name> .
" to catch <name> with , when he runs away from his lessons ! "
" you ca'n't guess what my present is ! "
said uggug , who had taken the <unk> from the table , and was standing behind her , with a wicked leer on his face .
" no , i ca'n't guess , " <name> said without looking up .
she was still examining the professor 's <unk> .
" it 's this ! "
cried the bad boy , <unk> , as he emptied the dish over her , and then , with a grin of delight at his own cleverness , looked round for applause .
<name> coloured crimson , as she shook off the butter from her frock : but she kept her lips tight shut , and walked away to the window , where she stood looking out and trying to recover her temper .
uggug 's triumph was a very short one : the sub-warden had returned , just in time to be a witness of his dear child 's <unk> , and in another moment a <unk> box on the ear had changed the grin of delight into a howl of pain .
" my darling ! "
cried his mother , <unk> him in her fat arms .
" did they box his ears for nothing ?
a precious pet ! "
" it 's not for nothing ! "
growled the angry father .
" are you aware , madam , that i pay the <unk> , out of a fixed annual sum ?
the loss of all that wasted butter falls on me !
do you hear , madam ! "
" hold your tongue , sir ! "
my <name> spoke very quietly  almost in a whisper .
but there was something in her look which silenced him .
" do n't you see it was only a joke ?
and a very clever one , too !
he only meant that he loved nobody but her !
and , instead of being pleased with the compliment , the spiteful little thing has gone away in a <unk> ! "
the sub-warden was a very good hand at changing a subject .
he walked across to the window .
" my dear , " he said , " is that a pig that i see down below , <unk> about among your flower-beds ? "
" a pig ! "
shrieked my <name> , rushing madly to the window , and almost pushing her husband out , in her anxiety to see for herself .
" whose pig is it ?
how did it get in ?
where 's that crazy gardener gone ? "
at this moment <name> re-entered the room , and passing uggug ( who was <unk> his loudest , in the <name> of attracting notice ) as if he was quite used to that sort of thing , he ran up to <name> and threw his arms round her .
" i went to my <unk> , " he said with a very sorrowful face , " to see if there were <unk> fit for a present for oo !
and there is n't nuffin !
they 's all broken , every one !
and i have n't got no money left , to buy oo a <unk> !
and i ca'n't give oo nuffin but this ! "
( " this " was a very <name> hug and a kiss . )
" oh , thank you , darling ! "
cried <name> .
" i like your present best of all ! "
( but if so , why did she give it back so quickly ? )
his <unk> turned and patted the two children on the head with his long <name> hands .
" go away , dears ! "
he said .
" there 's business to talk <unk> "
<name> and <name> went away hand in hand : but , on reaching the door , <name> came back again and went up to uggug timidly .
" i do n't mind about the butter , " she said , " and i  i 'm sorry he hurt you ! "
and she tried to shake hands with the little ruffian : but uggug only <unk> louder , and would n't make friends .
<name> left the room with a sigh .
the sub-warden glared angrily at his weeping son .
" leave the room , <unk> ! "
he said , as loud as he dared .
his wife was still leaning out of the window , and kept repeating " i ca'n't see that pig !
where is it ? "
" it 's moved to the right now it 's gone a little to the left , " said the sub-warden : but he had his back to the window , and was making signals to the lord chancellor , pointing to uggug and the door , with many a cunning nod and wink .
[ image ... removal of uggug ] the chancellor caught his meaning at last , and , crossing the room , took that interesting child by the ear the next moment he and uggug were out of the room , and the door shut behind them : but not before one piercing yell had rung through the room , and reached the ears of the fond mother .
" what is that hideous noise ? "
she fiercely asked , turning upon her startled husband .
" it 's some <unk>  or other , " replied the sub-warden , looking vaguely up to the ceiling , as if that was where they usually were to be found .
" let us to business , my dear .
here comes the warden . "
and he picked up from the floor a wandering scrap of manuscript , on which i just caught the words 'after which election duly holden the said <unk> and <unk> his wife may at their pleasure assume imperial  ' before , with a guilty look , he crumpled it up in his hand .
chapter 4 .
a cunning conspiracy .
the warden entered at this moment : and close behind him came the lord chancellor , a little flushed and out of breath , and adjusting his wig , which appeared to have been dragged partly off his head .
" but where is my precious child ? "
my <name> enquired , as the four took their seats at the small <unk> devoted to <unk> and bundles and bills .
" he left the room a few minutes ago with the lord chancellor , " the sub-warden briefly explained .
" ah ! "
said my <name> , graciously smiling on that high official .
" your lordship has a very taking way with children !
i doubt if any one could gain the ear of my darling uggug so quickly as you can ! "
for an entirely stupid woman , my <name> 's remarks were curiously full of meaning , of which she herself was wholly unconscious .
the chancellor bowed , but with a very uneasy air .
" i think the warden was about to speak , " he remarked , evidently anxious to change the subject .
but my <name> would not be checked .
" he is a clever boy , " she continued with enthusiasm , " but he needs a man like your lordship to draw him out ! "
the chancellor bit his lip , and was silent .
he evidently feared that , stupid as she looked , she understood what she said this time , and was having a joke at his expense .
he might have spared himself all anxiety : whatever accidental meaning her words might have , she herself never meant anything at all .
" it is all settled ! "
the warden announced , wasting no time over preliminaries .
" the <unk> is abolished , and my brother is appointed to act as vice-warden whenever i am absent .
so , as i am going abroad for a while , he <name> enter on his new duties at once . "
" and there <name> really be a vice after all ? "
my <name> enquired .
" i <name> so ! "
the warden smilingly replied .
my <name> looked much pleased , and tried to clap her hands : but you might as well have knocked two <unk> together , for any noise it made .
" when my husband is vice , " she said , " it <name> be the same as if we had a hundred vices ! "
" hear , hear ! "
cried the sub-warden .
" you seem to think it very remarkable , " my <name> remarked with some severity , " that your wife should speak the truth ! "
" no , not remarkable at all ! "
her husband anxiously explained .
" nothing is remarkable that you say , sweet one ! "
my <name> smiled approval of the sentiment , and went on .
" and am i <unk> ? "
" if you choose to use that title , " said the warden : " but 'your excellency ' <name> be the proper style of address .
and i trust that both 'his excellency ' and 'her excellency ' <name> observe the agreement i have drawn up .
the provision i am most anxious about is this . "
he unrolled a large parchment scroll , and read aloud the words " <unk> , that we <name> be kind to the poor . '
the chancellor worded it for me , " he added , glancing at that great <unk> .
" i suppose , now , that word <unk> ' has some deep legal meaning ? "
" undoubtedly ! "
replied the chancellor , as <unk> as he could with a pen between his lips .
he was nervously rolling and <unk> several other <unk> , and making room among them for the one the warden had just handed to him .
" these are merely the rough copies , " he explained : " and , as soon as i have put in the final corrections  " making a great commotion among the different <unk> , "  a <unk> or two that i have accidentally omitted  " here he darted about , pen in hand , from one part of the scroll to another , spreading sheets of <unk> over his corrections , " all <name> be ready for signing . "
" should it not be read out , first ? "
my <name> enquired .
" no need , no need ! "
the sub-warden and the chancellor exclaimed at the same moment , with feverish eagerness .
" no need at all , " the warden gently assented .
" your husband and i have gone through it together .
it provides that he shall exercise the full authority of warden , and shall have the disposal of the annual revenue attached to the office , until my return , or , failing that , until <name> comes of age : and that he shall then hand over , to myself or to <name> as the case may be , the <unk> , the <unk> revenue , and the contents of the treasury , which are to be preserved , intact , under his guardianship . "
all this time the sub-warden was busy , with the chancellor 's help , shifting the papers from side to side , and pointing out to the warden the place whew he was to sign .
he then signed it himself , and my <name> and the chancellor added their names as witnesses .
" short <unk> are best , " said the warden .
" all is ready for my journey .
my children are waiting below to see me off " he gravely kissed my <name> , shook hands with his brother and the chancellor , and left the room .
[ image ... 'what a game ! ' ]
the three waited in silence till the sound of wheels announced that the warden was out of hearing : then , to my surprise , they broke into peals of uncontrollable laughter .
" what a game , oh , what a game ! "
cried the chancellor .
and he and the vice-warden joined hands , and skipped wildly about the room .
my <name> was too dignified to skip , but she laughed like the neighing of a horse , and waved her handkerchief above her head : it was clear to her very limited understanding that something very clever had been done , but what it was she had yet to learn .
" you said i should hear all about it when the warden had gone , " she remarked , as soon as she could make herself heard .
" and so you shall , <unk> ! "
her husband graciously replied , as he removed the <unk> , and showed the two <unk> lying side by side .
" this is the one he read but did n't sign : and this is the one he signed but did n't read !
you see it was all covered up , except the place for signing the names  " " yes , yes ! "
my <name> interrupted eagerly , and began comparing the two agreements .
" <unk> , that he shall exercise the authority of warden , in the <unk> absence . '
why , that 's been changed into 'shall be absolute governor for life , with the title of emperor , if elected to that office by the people . '
what !
are you emperor , darling ? "
" not yet , dear , " the vice-warden replied .
" it wo n't do to let this paper be seen , just at present .
all in good time . "
my <name> nodded , and read on .
" <unk> , that we <name> be kind to the poor . '
why , that 's omitted altogether ! "
" course it is ! "
said her husband .
" we 're not going to bother about the wretches ! "
" good , " said my <name> , with emphasis , and read on again .
" <unk> , that the contents of the treasury be preserved intact . '
why , that 's altered into 'shall be at the absolute disposal of the vice-warden ' !
" well , <unk> , that was a clever trick !
all the jewels , only think !
may i go and put them on directly ? "
" well , not just yet , <unk> , " her husband uneasily replied .
" you see the public mind is n't quite ripe for it yet .
we must feel our way .
of course we 'll have the <unk> out , at once .
and i 'll take the title of emperor , as soon as we can safely hold an election .
but they 'll hardly stand our using the jewels , as long as they know the warden 's alive .
we must spread a report of his death .
a little conspiracy  " " a conspiracy ! "
cried the delighted <name> , clapping her hands .
" of all things , i do like a conspiracy !
it 's so interesting ! "
the vice-warden and the chancellor <unk> a wink or two .
" let her conspire to her heart 's content ! "
the cunning chancellor whispered .
" it 'll do no harm ! "
" and when <name> the conspiracy  " " hist !
' , her husband hastily interrupted her , as the door opened , and <name> and <name> came in , with their arms twined lovingly round each other  <name> sobbing convulsively , with his face hidden on his sister 's shoulder , and <name> more grave and quiet , but with tears streaming down her cheeks .
" must n't cry like that ! "
the vice-warden said sharply , but without any effect on the weeping children .
" cheer 'em up a bit ! "
he hinted to my <name> .
" cake ! "
my <name> muttered to herself with great decision , crossing the room and opening a cupboard , from which she presently returned with two slices of <unk> .
" eat , and do n't cry ! "
were her short and simple orders : and the poor children sat down side by side , but seemed in no mood for eating .
for the second time the door opened  or rather was burst open , this time , as uggug rushed violently into the room , shouting " that old beggars come again ! "
" he 's not to have any food  " the vice-warden was beginning , but the chancellor interrupted him .
" it 's all right , " he said , in a low voice : " the servants have their orders . "
" he 's just under here , " said uggug , who had gone to the window , and was looking down into the court-yard .
" where , my darling ? "
said his fond mother , flinging her arms round the neck of the little monster .
all of us ( except <name> and <name> , who took no notice of what was going on ) followed her to the window .
the old beggar looked up at us with hungry eyes .
" only a crust of bread , your highness ! "
he pleaded .
[ image ... <unk> this ! ' ]
he was a fine old man , but looked sadly ill and worn .
" a crust of bread is what i crave ! "
he repeated .
" a single crust , and a little water ! "
" here 's some water , drink this ! "
uggug bellowed , emptying a jug of water over his head .
" well done , my boy ! "
cried the vice-warden .
" that 's the way to settle such folk ! "
" clever boy !
" , the <unk> chimed in .
" has n't he good spirits ? "
" take a stick to him ! "
shouted the vice-warden , as the old beggar shook the water from his ragged cloak , and again gazed meekly upwards .
" take a red-hot poker to him ! "
my <name> again chimed in .
possibly there was no red-hot poker handy : but some sticks were forthcoming in a moment , and threatening faces surrounded the poor old wanderer , who waved them back with quiet dignity .
" no need to break my old bones , " he said .
" i am going .
not even a crust ! "
" poor , poor old man ! "
exclaimed a little voice at my side , half choked with sobs .
<name> was at the window , trying to throw out his slice of <unk> , but <name> held him back .
" he shalt have my cake ! "
<name> cried , passionately struggling out of <name> 's arms .
" yes , yes , darling ! "
<name> gently pleaded .
" but do n't throw it out !
he 's gone away , do n't you see ?
let 's go after him . "
and she led him out of the room , unnoticed by the rest of the party , who were wholly absorbed in watching the old beggar .
the conspirators returned to their seats , and continued their conversation in an undertone , so as not to be heard by uggug , who was still standing at the window .
" by the way , there was something about <name> succeeding to the <unk> , " said my <name> .
" how does that stand in the new agreement ? "
the chancellor chuckled .
" just the same , word for word , " he said , " with one exception , my <name> .
instead of <unk> , ' i 've taken the <name> to put in  " he dropped his voice to a whisper , " to put in <unk> , ' you know ! "
" uggug , indeed ! "
i exclaimed , in a burst of indignation i could no longer control .
to bring out even that one word seemed a gigantic effort : but , the cry once uttered , all effort ceased at once : a sudden gust swept away the whole scene , and i found myself sitting up , staring at the young <name> in the opposite corner of the carriage , who had now thrown back her veil , and was looking at me with an expression of amused surprise .
chapter 5 .
a beggar 's palace .
that i had said something , in the act of waking , i felt sure : the hoarse stifled cry was still ringing in my ears , even if the startled look of my <unk> had not been evidence enough : but what could i possibly say by way of apology ?
" i <name> i did n't frighten you ? "
i stammered out at last .
" i have no idea what i said .
i was dreaming . "
" you said <unk> indeed ! ' "
the young <name> replied , with quivering lips that would curve themselves into a smile , in spite of all her efforts to look grave .
" at least  you did n't say it  you shouted it ! "
" i 'm very sorry , " was all i could say , feeling very penitent and helpless .
" she has <name> 's eyes ! "
i thought to myself , <unk> whether , even now , i were fairly awake .
" and that sweet look of innocent wonder is all <name> 's too .
but <name> has n't got that calm resolute mouth nor that far-away look of dreamy sadness , like one that has had some deep sorrow , very long ago  " and the <unk> fancies almost prevented my hearing the <name> 's next words .
" if you had had a <unk> dreadful ' in your hand , " she proceeded , " something about ghosts or dynamite or midnight murder  one could understand it : those things are n't worth the shilling , unless they give one a nightmare .
but really  with only a medical treatise , you know  " and she glanced , with a pretty shrug of contempt , at the book over which i had fallen asleep .
her friendliness , and utter <unk> , took me aback for a moment ; yet there was no touch of <unk> , or boldness , about the child for child , almost , she seemed to be : i guessed her at scarcely over twenty  all was the innocent frankness of some <name> <unk> , new to the ways of earth and the <unk> or , if you <name> , the <unk>  of society .
" even so , " i mused , " <name> <name> look and speak , in another ten years . "
" you do n't care for ghosts , then , " i ventured to suggest , unless they are really terrifying ? "
" quite so , " the <name> assented .
" the regular <unk>  i mean the ghosts of ordinary <unk>  are very poor affairs .
i feel inclined to say , with <name> <unk> , <unk> tameness is shocking to me ' !
and they never do any midnight murders .
they could n't <unk> in gore , ' to save their lives ! "
" <unk> in gore ' is a very expressive phrase , certainly .
can it be done in any fluid , i wonder ? "
" i think not , " the <name> readily replied  quite as if she had thought it out , long ago .
" it has to be something thick .
for instance , you might <unk> in <unk> .
that , being white , would be more suitable for a ghost , supposing it wished to <unk> ! "
" you have a real good terrifying ghost in that book ? "
i hinted .
" how could you guess ? "
she exclaimed with the most engaging frankness , and placed the volume in my hands .
i opened it eagerly , with a not unpleasant thrill like what a good <unk> gives one ) at the <unk> ' coincidence of my having so unexpectedly divined the subject of her studies .
it was a book of domestic cookery , open at the article bread sauce . '
i returned the book , looking , i suppose , a little blank , as the <name> laughed merrily at my discomfiture .
" it 's far more exciting than some of the modern ghosts , i assure you !
now there was a ghost last month  i do n't mean a real ghost in in <unk>  but in a magazine .
it was a perfectly <unk> ghost .
it would n't have frightened a mouse !
it was n't a ghost that one would even offer a chair to ! "
" three score years and ten , baldness , and spectacles , have their advantages after all !
" , i said to myself .
" instead of a bashful youth and maiden , gasping out <unk> at awful intervals , here we have an old man and a child , quite at their ease , talking as if they had known each other for years !
then you think , " i continued aloud , " that we ought sometimes to ask a ghost to sit down ?
but have we any authority for it ?
in shakespeare , for instance  there are plenty of ghosts there  does shakespeare ever give the <unk> <unk> chair to ghost ' ? "
the <name> looked puzzled and thoughtful for a moment : then she almost clapped her hands .
" yes , yes , he does ! "
she cried .
" he makes hamlet say <unk> , rest , <unk> spirit ! " '
" and that , i suppose , means an easy-chair ? "
" an american rocking-chair , i think  " " <unk> junction , my <name> , change for <unk> ! "
the guard announced , flinging open the door of the carriage : and we soon found ourselves , with all our portable property around us , on the platform .
the accommodation , provided for passengers waiting at this junction , was distinctly inadequate  a single wooden bench , apparently intended for three <unk> only : and even this was already partially occupied by a very old man , in a <unk> frock , who sat , with rounded shoulders and drooping head , and with hands clasped on the top of his stick so as to make a sort of pillow for that wrinkled face with its look of patient weariness .
" come , you be off ! "
the station-master roughly accosted the poor old man .
" you be off , and make way for your betters !
this way , my <name> ! "
he added in a perfectly different tone .
" if your <unk> <name> take a seat , the train <name> be up in a few minutes . "
the cringing servility of his manner was due , no doubt , to the address <unk> on the pile of luggage , which announced their owner to be " <name> <name> <unk> , passenger to <unk> , via <unk> junction . "
as i watched the old man slowly rise to his feet , and hobble a few paces down the platform , the lines came to my lips :  " from sackcloth couch the monk arose , with toil his stiffen 'd limbs he rear 'd ; a hundred years had flung their snows on his thin locks and floating beard . "
[ image ... 'come , you be off ! ' ]
but the <name> scarcely noticed the little incident .
after one glance at the <unk> man , ' who stood tremulously leaning on his stick , she turned to me .
" this is not an american rocking-chair , by any means !
yet may i say , " slightly changing her place , so as to make room for me beside her , " may i say , in hamlet 's words , <unk> , rest  ' " she broke off with a silvery <unk> "
 <unk> spirit ! " '
i finished the sentence for her .
" yes , that describes a <unk> exactly !
and here is an instance of it , " i added , as the <name> local train <name> up alongside the platform , and the porters bustled about , opening <unk>  one of them helping the poor old man to hoist himself into a third-class carriage , while another of them <unk> conducted the <name> and myself into a first-class .
she paused , before following him , to watch the progress of the other passenger .
" poor old man ! "
she said .
" how weak and ill he looks !
it was a shame to let him be turned away like that .
i 'm very sorry  " at this moment it dawned on me that these words were not addressed to me , but that she was unconsciously thinking aloud .
i moved away a few steps , and waited to follow her into the carriage , where i resumed the conversation .
" shakespeare must have traveled by rail , if only in a dream : <unk> spirit ' is such a happy phrase . "
" <unk> ' referring , no doubt , " she rejoined , " to the sensational <unk> peculiar to the rail .
if steam has done nothing else , it has at least added a whole new species to english literature ! "
" no doubt of it , " i echoed .
" the true origin of all our medical books  and all our <unk>  " " no , no ! "
she broke in merrily .
" i did n't mean our literature !
we are quite abnormal .
but the <unk>  the little thrilling romances , where the murder comes at <name> fifteen , and the wedding at <name> forty  surely they are due to steam ? "
" and when we travel by electricity if i may venture to develop your theory we shall have leaflets instead of <unk> , and the murder and the wedding <name> come on the same <name> . "
" a development worthy of <name> !
" , the <name> exclaimed enthusiastically .
" only you reverse his theory .
instead of developing a mouse into an elephant , you would develop an elephant into a mouse ! "
but here we plunged into a tunnel , and i leaned back and closed my eyes for a moment , trying to recall a few of the incidents of my recent dream .
" i thought i saw  " i murmured sleepily : and then the phrase insisted on <unk> itself , and ran into " you thought you saw  he thought he saw  " and then it suddenly went off into a song :  " he thought he saw an elephant , that practised on a fife : he looked again , and found it was a letter from his wife .
'at length i realise , ' he said , " the bitterness of life ! ' "
and what a wild being it was who sang these wild words !
a gardener he seemed to be yet surely a mad one , by the way he <unk> his rake  madder , by the way he broke , ever and anon , into a frantic jig  maddest of all , by the shriek in which he brought out the last words of the stanza !
[ image ... <unk> gardener ] it was so far a description of himself that he had the feet of an elephant : but the rest of him was skin and bone : and the <unk> of loose straw , that bristled all about him , suggested that he had been originally stuffed with it , and that nearly all the stuffing had come out .
<name> and <name> waited patiently till the end of the first verse .
then <name> advanced alone ( <name> having suddenly turned shy ) and timidly introduced herself with the words " please , i 'm <name> ! "
" and who 's that other thing ?
' , said the gardener .
" what thing ? "
said <name> , looking round .
" oh , that 's <name> .
he 's my brother . "
" was he your brother yesterday ? "
the gardener anxiously enquired .
" course i were ! "
cried <name> , who had gradually crept nearer , and did n't at all like being talked about without having his share in the conversation .
" ah , well ! "
the gardener said with a kind of groan .
" things change so , here .
whenever i look again , it 's sure to be something different !
yet i does my duty !
i gets up <unk> at five  " " if i was oo , " said <name> , " i would n't wriggle so early .
it 's as bad as being a worm ! "
he added , in an undertone to <name> .
" but you should n't be lazy in the morning , <name> , " said <name> .
" remember , it 's the early bird that picks up the worm ! "
" it may , if it likes ! "
<name> said with a slight yawn .
" i do n't like eating worms , one bit .
i always stop in bed till the early bird has picked them up ! "
" i wonder you 've the face to tell me such <unk> ! "
cried the gardener .
to which <name> wisely replied " oo do n't want a face to tell <unk> <unk>  only a <unk> . "
<name> discreetly changed the subject .
" and did you plant all these flowers ? "
she said .
" what a lovely garden you 've made !
do you know , i 'd like to live here always ! "
" in the <unk>  " the gardener was beginning .
" but i 'd nearly forgotten what we came about ! "
<name> interrupted .
" would you please let us through into the road ?
there 's a poor old beggar just gone out  and he 's very hungry  and <name> wants to give him his cake , you know ! "
" it 's as much as my place is worth !
' , the gardener muttered , taking a key from his pocket , and beginning to unlock a door in the <unk> .
" how much are it <unk> ?
" <name> innocently enquired .
but the gardener only grinned .
" that 's a secret ! "
he said .
" mind you come back quick ! "
he called after the children , as they passed out into the road .
i had just time to follow them , before he shut the door again .
we hurried down the road , and very soon caught sight of the old beggar , about a quarter of a mile ahead of us , and the children at once set off running to overtake him .
lightly and swiftly they skimmed over the ground , and i could not in the least understand how it was i kept up with them so easily .
but the <unk> problem did not worry me so much as at another time it might have done , there were so many other things to attend to .
the old beggar must have been very deaf , as he paid no attention whatever to <name> 's eager shouting , but trudged wearily on , never pausing until the child got in front of him and held up the slice of cake .
the poor little fellow was quite out of breath , and could only utter the one word " cake ! "
not with the gloomy decision with which her excellency had so lately pronounced it , but with a sweet childish timidity , looking up into the old man 's face with eyes that loved 'all things both great and small . '
the old man snatched it from him , and devoured it greedily , as some hungry wild beast might have done , but never a word of thanks did he give his little benefactor  only growled " more , more ! "
and glared at the <unk> children .
" there is no more !
" , <name> said with tears in her eyes .
" i 'd eaten mine .
it was a shame to let you be turned away like that .
i 'm very sorry  " i lost the rest of the sentence , for my mind had recurred , with a great shock of surprise , to <name> <name> <unk> , who had so lately uttered these very words of <name> 's  yes , and in <name> 's own voice , and with <name> 's gentle pleading eyes !
" follow me ! "
were the next words i heard , as the old man waved his hand , with a dignified <name> that ill suited his ragged dress , over a bush , that stood by the road side , which began instantly to sink into the earth .
at another time i might have doubted the evidence of my eyes , or at least have felt some astonishment : but , in this strange scene , my whole being seemed absorbed in strong curiosity as to what would happen next .
when the bush had sunk quite out of our sight , marble steps were seen , leading downwards into darkness .
the old man led the way , and we eagerly followed .
the staircase was so dark , at first , that i could only just see the forms of the children , as , <unk> , they groped their way down after their guide : but it got lighter every moment , with a strange silvery brightness , that seemed to exist in the air , as there were no lamps visible ; and , when at last we reached a level floor , the room , in which we found ourselves , was almost as light as day .
it was <unk> , having in each <name> a slender pillar , round which silken draperies were twined .
the wall between the pillars was entirely covered , to the height of six or seven feet , with creepers , from which <name> quantities of ripe fruit and of brilliant flowers , that almost hid the leaves .
in another place , perchance , i might have wondered to see fruit and flowers growing together : here , my chief wonder was that neither fruit nor flowers were such as i had ever seen before .
higher up , each wall contained a circular window of coloured glass ; and over all was an arched roof , that seemed to be spangled all over with jewels .
with hardly less wonder , i turned this way and that , trying to make out how in the world we had come in : for there was no door : and all the walls were thickly covered with the lovely creepers .
" we are safe here , my darlings ! "
said the old man , laying a hand on <name> 's shoulder , and bending down to kiss her .
<name> <name> back hastily , with an offended air : but in another moment , with a glad cry of " why , it 's father !
" , she had run into his arms .
[ image ... a beggar 's palace ] " father !
father ! "
<name> repeated : and , while the happy children were being hugged and kissed , i could but rub my eyes and say " where , then , are the rags gone to ?
" ; for the old man was now dressed in <name> robes that glittered with jewels and gold embroidery , and wore a <unk> of gold around his head .
chapter 6 .
the magic locket .
" where are we , father ? "
<name> whispered , with her arms twined closely around the old man 's neck , and with her <name> cheek lovingly pressed to his .
" in <unk> , darling .
it 's one of the provinces of fairyland . "
" but i thought <unk> was ever so far from outland : and we 've come such a <name> little way ! "
" you came by the <name> road , sweet one .
only those of <name> blood can travel along it : but you 've been <name> ever since i was made king of <unk> that 's nearly a month ago .
they sent two ambassadors , to make sure that their invitation to me , to be their new king , should reach me .
one was a <name> ; so he was able to come by the <name> road , and to come <unk> to all but me : the other was a baron ; so he had to come by the common road , and i dare say he has n't even arrived yet . "
" then how far have we come ? "
<name> enquired .
" just a thousand miles , sweet one , since the gardener unlocked that door for you . "
" a thousand miles ! "
<name> repeated .
" and may i eat one ? "
" eat a mile , little rogue ? "
" no , " said <name> .
" i mean may i eat one of that fruits ? "
" yes , child , " said his father : " and then you 'll find out what pleasure is like  the pleasure we all seek so madly , and enjoy so mournfully ! "
<name> ran eagerly to the wall , and picked a fruit that was shaped something like a banana , but had the colour of a strawberry .
he ate it with beaming looks , that became gradually more gloomy , and were very blank indeed by the time he had finished .
" it has n't got no taste at all ! "
he complained .
" i could n't feel nuffin in my <unk> !
it 's a  what 's that hard word , <name> ? "
" it was a <unk> , " <name> gravely replied .
" are they all like that , father ? "
" they 're all like that to you , darling , because you do n't belong to <unk>  yet .
but to me they are real . "
<name> looked puzzled .
" i 'll try <unk> kind of fruits ! "
he said , and jumped down off the king 's knee .
" there 's some lovely striped ones , just like a rainbow ! "
and off he ran .
meanwhile the <unk> and <name> were talking together , but in such low tones that i could not catch the words : so i followed <name> , who was picking and eating other kinds of fruit , in the vain <name> of finding some that had a taste .
i tried to pick so me myself  but it was like grasping air , and i soon gave up the attempt and returned to <name> .
" look well at it , my darling , " the old man was saying , " and tell me how you like it . "
" 'it 's just lovely , " cried <name> , delightedly .
" <name> , come and look ! "
and she held up , so that he might see the light through it , a <unk> locket , apparently cut out of a single <name> , of a <name> blue colour , with a slender gold chain attached to it .
" it are <unk> pretty , " <name> more soberly remarked : and he began spelling out some words inscribed on it .
" all  <name>  love  <name> , " he made them out at last .
" and so they <unk> ! "
he cried , clasping his arms round her neck .
" everybody loves <name> ! "
" but we love her best , do n't we , <name> ? "
said the old king , as he took possession of the locket .
" now , <name> , look at this . "
and he showed her , lying on the palm of his hand , a locket of a deep crimson colour , the same shape as the blue one and , like it , attached to a slender golden chain .
" lovelier and lovelier ! "
exclaimed <name> , clasping her hands in ecstasy .
" look , <name> ! "
" and there 's words on this one , too , " said <name> .
" <name>  <name>  love  all . "
" now you see the difference , " said the old man : " different colours and different words .
choose one of them , darling .
i 'll give you which ever you like best . "
[ image ... the crimson locket ] <name> whispered the words , several times over , with a thoughtful smile , and then made her decision .
" it 's very nice to be loved , " she said : " but it 's nicer to love other people !
may i have the red one , father ? "
the old man said nothing : but i could see his eyes fill with tears , as he bent his head and pressed his lips to her forehead in a long loving kiss .
then he undid the chain , and showed her how to fasten it round her neck , and to hide it away under the edge of her frock .
" it 's for you to keep you know he said in a low voice , not for other people to see .
you 'll remember how to use it ?
yes , i 'll remember , said <name> .
" and now darlings it 's time for you to go back or they 'll be missing you and then that poor gardener <name> get into trouble ! "
once more a feeling of wonder rose in my mind as to how in the world we were to get back again  since i took it for granted that wherever the children went i was to go  but no shadow of doubt seemed to cross their minds as they hugged and kissed him murmuring over and over again " good-bye darling father ! "
and then suddenly and swiftly the darkness of midnight seemed to close in upon us and through the darkness harshly rang a strange wild song :  he thought he saw a buffalo upon the <unk> : he looked again , and found it was his sister 's husband 's niece .
<unk> you leave this house , ' he said , 'i 'll send for the police ! '
[ image ... 'he thought he saw a buffalo ' ] " that was me ! "
he added , looking out at us , through the <unk> door , as we stood waiting in the road . '
" and that 's what i 'd have done  as sure as potatoes are n't <unk>  if she had n't have <unk> herself off !
but i always loves my <unk> like anything . "
" who are oor <unk> ? "
said <name> .
" them as pay <unk> for me , a course ! "
the gardener replied .
" you can come in now , if you like . "
he flung the door open as he spoke , and we got out , a little dazzled and stupefied ( at least i felt so ) at the sudden transition from the <unk> of the <unk> to the <unk> platform of <unk> station .
a footman , in a handsome livery , came forwards and respectfully touched his hat .
" the carriage is here , my <name> , " he said , taking from her the wraps and small articles she was carrying : and <name> <name> , after shaking hands and bidding me " good-night ! "
with a pleasant smile , followed him .
it was with a somewhat blank and lonely feeling that i betook myself to the van from which the luggage was being taken out : and , after giving directions to have my boxes sent after me , i made my way on foot to <name> 's lodgings , and soon lost my lonely feeling in the hearty welcome my old friend gave me , and the cozy warmth and cheerful light of the little sitting-room into which he led me .
" little , as you see , but quite enough for us two .
now , take the easy-chair , old fellow , and let 's have another look at you !
well , you do look a bit pulled down ! "
and he put on a solemn professional air .
" i <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> .
social dissipation , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> : to be taken , feasting , three times a day ! "
" but , doctor ! "
i remonstrated .
" society does n't <unk> ' three times a day ! "
" that 's all you know about it ! "
the young doctor gaily replied .
" at home , <unk> , 3 p.m. at home , <unk> , 5 p.m. at home , music ( <unk> does n't give dinners ) , 8 p.m. carriages at 10 .
there you are ! "
it sounded very pleasant , i was obliged to admit .
" and i know some of the <unk> already , " i added .
" one of them came in the same carriage with me " " what was she like ?
then perhaps i can identify her . "
" the name was <name> <name> <unk> .
as to what she was like  well , i thought her very beautiful .
do you know her ? "
" yes  i do know her . "
and the grave doctor coloured slightly as he added " yes , i agree with you .
she is beautiful . "
" i quite lost my heart to her ! "
i went on mischievously .
" we talked  " " have some supper ! "
<name> interrupted with an air of relief , as the maid entered with the tray .
and he steadily resisted all my attempts to return to the subject of <name> <name> until the evening had almost worn itself away .
then , as we sat gazing into the fire , and conversation was <unk> into silence , he made a hurried confession .
" i had n't meant to tell you anything about her , " he said ( naming no names , as if there were only one 'she ' in the world ! )
" till you had seen more of her , and formed your own judgment of her : but somehow you surprised it out of me .
and i 've not breathed a word of it to any one else .
but i can trust you with a secret , old friend !
yes !
it 's true of me , what i suppose you said in jest .
" in the merest jest , believe me ! "
i said earnestly .
" why , man , i'm three times her age !
but if she 's your choice , then i 'm sure she 's all that is good and  " "  and sweet , " <name> went on , " and pure , and <unk> , and <unk> , and  " he broke off hastily , as if he could not trust himself to say more on a subject so sacred and so precious .
silence followed : and i leaned back drowsily in my easy-chair , filled with bright and beautiful imaginings of <name> and his <unk> , and of all the peace and happiness in store for them .
i pictured them to myself walking together , <unk> and lovingly , under arching trees , in a sweet garden of their own , and welcomed back by their faithful gardener , on their return from some brief excursion .
it seemed natural enough that the gardener should be filled with <unk> delight at the return of so gracious a master and mistress and how strangely childlike they looked !
i could have taken them for <name> and <name> less natural that he should show it by such wild dances , such crazy songs !
" he thought he saw a rattlesnake that questioned him in greek : he looked again , and found it was the middle of next week .
'the one thing i regret , ' he said , 'is that it can not speak ! "
 least natural of all that the vice-warden and 'my <name> ' should be standing close beside me , discussing an open letter , which had just been handed to him by the professor , who stood , meekly waiting , a few yards off .
" if it were not for those two brats , " i heard him mutter , glancing savagely at <name> and <name> , who were courteously listening to the gardener 's song , " there would be no difficulty whatever . "
" let 's hear that bit of the letter again , " said my <name> .
and the vice-warden read aloud :  "  and we therefore entreat you graciously to accept the kingship , to which you have been unanimously elected by the council of <unk> : and that you <name> allow your son <name> of whose goodness , cleverness , and beauty , reports have reached us  to be regarded as <unk> . "
" but what 's the difficulty ? "
said my <name> .
" why , do n't you see ?
the ambassador , that brought this , is waiting in the house : and he 's sure to see <name> and <name> : and then , when he sees uggug , and remembers all that about <unk> , cleverness , and beauty , ' why , he 's sure to  " " and where <name> you find a better boy than uggug ? "
my <name> indignantly interrupted .
" or a <unk> , or a lovelier ? "
to all of which the vice-warden simply replied " do n't you be a great <unk> goose !
our only chance is to keep those two brats out of sight .
if you can manage that , you may leave the rest to me .
i 'll make him believe uggug to be a model of cleverness and all that . "
" we must change his name to <name> , of course ? "
said my <name> .
the vice-warden rubbed his <name> .
" humph !
no ! "
he said musingly .
" would n't do .
the boy 's such an utter idiot , he 'd never learn to answer to it . "
" idiot , indeed ! "
cried my <name> .
" he 's no more an idiot than i am ! "
" you 're right , my dear , " the vice-warden soothingly i replied .
" he is n't , indeed ! "
my <name> was appeased .
" let 's go in and receive the ambassador , " she said , and beckoned to the professor .
" which room is he waiting in ? "
she inquired .
" in the library , madam . "
" and what did you say his name was ? "
said the vice-warden .
the professor referred to a card he held in his hand .
" his <unk> the baron <unk> . "
" why does he come with such a funny name ? "
said my <name> .
" he could n't well change it on the journey , " the professor meekly replied , " because of the luggage . "
" you go and receive him , " my <name> said to the vice-warden , " and i 'll attend to the children . "
chapter 7 .
the barons embassy .
i was following the vice-warden , but , on second thoughts , went after my <name> , being curious to see how she would manage to keep the children out of sight .
i found her holding <name> 's hand , and with her other hand stroking <name> 's hair in a most tender and motherly fashion : both children were looking bewildered and <unk> .
" my own darlings , " she was saying , " i 've been planning a little treat for you !
the professor shall take you a long walk into the woods this beautiful evening : and you shall take a basket of food with you , and have a little picnic down by the river ! "
<name> jumped , and clapped his hands .
" that are nice ! "
he cried .
" are n't it , <name> ? "
<name> , who had n't quite lost her surprised look , put up her mouth for a kiss .
" thank you very much , " she said earnestly .
my <name> turned her head away to conceal the broad grin of triumph that spread over her vast face , like a ripple on a lake .
" little <unk> ! "
she muttered to herself , as she marched up to the house .
i followed her in .
" quite so , your excellency , " the baron was saying as we entered the library .
" all the infantry were under my command . "
he turned , and was duly presented to my <name> .
" a military hero ? "
said my <name> .
the fat little man <unk> .
" well , yes , " he replied , modestly casting down his eyes .
" my ancestors were all famous for military genius . "
my <name> smiled graciously .
" it often runs in families , " she remarked : " just as a love for <unk> does . "
the baron looked slightly offended , and the vice-warden discreetly changed the subject .
" dinner <name> soon be ready , " he said .
" may i have the honour of conducting your <unk> to the <unk> ? "
" certainly , certainly ! "
the baron eagerly assented .
" it would never do to keep dinner waiting ! "
and he almost trotted out of the room after the vice-warden .
he was back again so speedily that the vice-warden had barely time to explain to my <name> that her remark about " a love for <unk> " was " unfortunate .
you might have seen , with half an eye , " he added , " that that 's his line .
military genius , indeed !
pooh ! "
" dinner ready yet ? "
the baron enquired , as he hurried into the room .
" <name> be in a few minutes , " the vice-warden replied .
" meanwhile , let's take a turn in the garden .
you were telling me , " he continued , as the trio left the house , " something about a great battle in which you had the command of the infantry  " " true , " said the baron .
" the enemy , as i was saying , far <unk> us : but i marched my men right into the middle of  what 's that ? "
the military hero exclaimed in agitated tones , drawing back behind the vice-warden , as a strange creature rushed wildly upon them , brandishing a spade .
" it 's only the gardener ! "
the vice-warden replied in an encouraging tone .
" quite harmless , i assure you .
hark , he 's singing !
its his favorite amusement . "
and once more those shrill discordant tones rang out :  " he thought he saw a banker 's clerk descending from the <unk> : he looked again , and found it was a hippopotamus : 'if this should stay to dine , ' he said , 'there wo n't be <unk> for us ! ' "
throwing away the spade , he broke into a frantic jig , snapping his fingers , and repeating , again and again , " there wo n't be much for us !
there wo n't be much for us ! "
[ image ... it was a <unk> ] once more the baron looked slightly offended , but the vice-warden hastily explained that the song had no allusion to him , and in fact had no meaning at all .
" you did n't mean anything by it , now did you ? "
he appealed to the gardener , who had finished his song , and stood , balancing himself on one leg , and looking at them , with his mouth open .
" i never means nothing , " said the gardener : and uggug luckily came up at the moment , and gave the conversation a new turn .
" allow me to present my son , " said the vice-warden ; adding , in a whisper , " one of the best and <unk> boys that ever lived !
i 'll contrive for you to see some of his cleverness .
he knows everything that other boys do n't know ; and in <unk> , in fishing , in painting , and in music , his skill is  but you shall judge for yourself .
you see that target over there ?
he shall shoot an arrow at it .
dear boy , " he went on aloud , " his <unk> would like to see you shoot .
bring his highness ' bow and arrows ! "
uggug looked very sulky as he received the bow and arrow , and prepared to shoot .
just as the arrow left the bow , the vice-warden trod heavily on the toe of the baron , who yelled with the pain .
" ten thousand pardons !
" he exclaimed .
" i stepped back in my excitement .
see !
it is a bull's-eye ! "
the baron gazed in astonishment .
" he held the bow so awkwardly , it seemed impossible ! "
he muttered .
but there was no room for doubt : there was the arrow , right in the centre of the bull's-eye !
" the lake is close by , " continued the vice-warden .
" bring his <unk> <unk> ! "
and uggug most unwillingly held the <name> , and dangled the fly over the water .
" a beetle on your arm ! "
cried my <name> , pinching the poor baron 's arm worse than if ten lobsters had seized it at once .
" that kind is poisonous , " she explained .
" but what a pity !
you missed seeing the fish pulled out ! "
an enormous dead <unk> was lying on the bank , with the hook in its mouth .
" i had always fancied , " the baron faltered , " that cod were salt-water fish ? "
" not in this country , " said the vice-warden .
" shall we go in ?
ask my son some question on the way any subject you like ! "
and the sulky boy was violently shoved forwards , to walk at the <unk> side .
" could your highness tell me , " the baron cautiously began , " how much seven times nine would come to ? "
" turn to the left ! "
cried the vice-warden , hastily stepping forwards to show the way  so hastily , that he ran against his unfortunate guest , who fell heavily on his face .
" so sorry ! "
my <name> exclaimed , as she and her husband helped him to his feet again .
" my son was in the act of saying <unk> ' as you fell ! "
the baron said nothing : he was covered with dust , and seemed much hurt , both in body and mind .
however , when they had got him into the house , and given him a good brushing , matters looked a little better .
dinner was served in due course , and every fresh dish seemed to increase the <unk> of the baron : but all efforts , to get him to express his opinion as to uggug 's cleverness , were in vain , until that interesting youth had left the room , and was seen from the open window , prowling about the lawn with a little basket , which he was filling with frogs .
" so fond of natural history as he is , dear boy ! "
said the <unk> mother .
" now do tell us , baron , what you think of him ! "
" to be perfectly candid , said the cautious baron , " i would like a little more evidence .
i think you mentioned his skill in  " " music ? "
said the vice-warden .
" why , he 's simply a prodigy !
you shall hear him play the piano ?
and he walked to the window .
" <unk>  i mean my boy !
come in for a minute , and bring the <unk> with you !
to turn over the music for him , " he added as an explanation .
uggug , having filled his basket with frogs , had no objection to obey , and soon appeared in the room , followed by a <unk> little man , who asked the vice-warden " vot music vill you haf ? "
" the <unk> that his highness plays so charmingly , " said the vice-warden .
" his highness haf not  " the <unk> began , but was sharply stopped by the vice-warden .
" silence , sir !
go and turn over the music for his highness .
my dear , " ( to the <unk> ) " <name> you show him what to do ?
and meanwhile , baron , i 'll just show you a most interesting map we have  of outland , and fairyland , and that sort of thing . "
by the time my <name> had returned , from explaining things to the <unk> , the map had been <name> up , and the baron was already much bewildered by the vice-warden 's habit of pointing to one place while he shouted out the name of another .
[ image ... the map of fairyland ] my <name> joining in , pointing out other places , and shouting other names , only made matters worse ; and at last the baron , in despair , took to pointing out places for himself , and feebly asked " is that great yellow <unk> fairyland ? "
" yes , that 's fairyland , " said the vice-warden : " and you might as well give him a hint , " he muttered to my <name> , " about going back to-morrow .
he eats like a shark !
it would hardly do for me to mention it . "
his wife caught the idea , and at once began giving hints of the most subtle and delicate kind .
" just see what a short way it is back to fairyland !
why , if you started to-morrow morning , you 'd get there in very little more than a week ! "
the baron looked incredulous .
" it took me a full month to come , " he said .
" but it 's ever so much shorter , going back , you know ! '
the baron looked appealingly to the vice-warden , who chimed in readily .
" you can go back five times , in the time it took you to come here once  if you start to-morrow morning ! "
all this time the <unk> was <unk> through the room .
the baron could not help admitting to himself that it was being magnificently played : but he tried in vain to get a glimpse of the youthful performer .
every time he had nearly succeeded in catching sight of him , either the vice-warden or his wife was sure to get in the way , pointing out some new place on the map , and deafening him with some new name .
he gave in at last , wished a hasty good-night , and left the room , while his host and hostess <unk> looks of triumph .
" deftly done ! "
cried the vice-warden .
" craftily contrived !
but what means all that tramping on the stairs ? "
he <unk> the door , looked out , and added in a tone of dismay , " the baron 's boxes are being carried down ! "
" and what means all that rumbling of wheels ? "
cried my <name> .
she peeped through the window curtains .
" the baron 's carriage has come round ! "
she groaned .
at this moment the door opened : a fat , furious face looked in : a voice , hoarse with passion , thundered out the words " my room is full of frogs  i leave you !
" : and the door closed again .
and still the <name> <unk> went <unk> through the room : but it was <name> 's masterly touch that roused the echoes , and thrilled my very soul with the tender music of the immortal <unk> <unk> ' : and it was not till the last note had died away that the tired but happy traveler could bring himself to utter the words " good-night ! "
and to seek his <unk> pillow .
chapter 8 .
a ride on a lion .
the next day glided away , pleasantly enough , partly in settling myself in my new quarters , and partly in strolling round the neighbourhood , under <name> 's guidance , and trying to form a general idea of <unk> and its inhabitants .
when five o'clock arrived , <name> proposed without any embarrassment this time  to take me with him up to 'the hall , ' in order that i might make acquaintance with the <name> of <unk> , who had taken it for the season , and renew acquaintance with his daughter <name> <name> .
my first impressions of the gentle , dignified , and yet genial old man were entirely favourable : and the real satisfaction that showed itself on his daughter 's face , as she met me with the words " this is indeed an unlooked-for pleasure !
" , was very soothing for whatever remains of personal vanity the failures and disappointments of many long years , and much <unk> with a rough world , had left in me .
yet i noted , and was glad to note , evidence of a far deeper feeling than mere friendly regard , in her meeting with <name> though this was , as i gathered , an almost daily occurrence  and the conversation between them , in which the <name> and i were only occasional <unk> , had an ease and a spontaneity rarely met with except between very old friends : and , as i knew that they had not known each other for a longer period than the summer which was now rounding into autumn , i felt certain that <unk> , ' and love alone , could explain the phenomenon .
" how convenient it would be , " <name> <name> laughingly remarked , a <unk> of my having insisted on saving her the trouble of carrying a cup of tea across the room to the <name> , " if cups of tea had no weight at all !
then perhaps ladies would sometimes be permitted to <name> them for short distances ! "
" one can easily imagine a situation , " said <name> , " where things would necessarily have no weight , relatively to each other , though each would have its usual weight , looked at by itself . "
" some desperate paradox ! "
said the <name> .
" tell us how it could be .
we shall never guess it . "
" well , suppose this house , just as it is , placed a few billion miles above a planet , and with nothing else near enough to disturb it : of course it falls to the planet ? "
the <name> nodded .
" of course though it might take some centuries to do it . "
" and is <unk> to be going on all the while ? "
said <name> <name> .
" that , and other things , " said <name> .
" the inhabitants would live their lives , grow up and die , and still the house would be falling , falling , falling !
but now as to the relative weight of things .
nothing can be heavy , you know , except by trying to fall , and being prevented from doing so .
you all <name> that ? "
we all granted that .
" well , now , if i take this book , and hold it out at arm 's length , of course i feel its weight .
it is trying to fall , and i prevent it .
and , if i let go , it fails to the floor .
but , if we were all falling together , it could n't be trying to fall any quicker , you know : for , if i let go , what more could it do than fall ?
and , as my hand would be falling too  at the same rate  it would never leave it , for that would be to get ahead of it in the race .
and it could never overtake the failing floor ! "
" i see it clearly , " said <name> <name> .
" but it makes one dizzy to think of such things !
how can you make us do it ? "
" there is a more curious idea yet , " i ventured to say .
" suppose a cord fastened to the house , from below , and pulled down by some one on the planet .
then of course the house goes faster than its natural rate of falling : but the furniture  with our <name> selves  would go on failing at their old pace , and would therefore be left behind . "
" practically , we should rise to the ceiling , " said the <name> .
" the inevitable result of which would be concussion of <name> . "
" to avoid that , " said <name> , " let us have the furniture fixed to the floor , and ourselves tied down to the furniture .
then the <unk> could go on in peace . "
" with one little drawback !
' , <name> <name> gaily interrupted .
" we should take the cups down with us : but what about the tea ? "
" i had forgotten the tea , " <name> confessed .
" that , no doubt , would rise to the ceiling unless you chose to drink it on the way ! "
" which , i think , is quite nonsense enough for one while ! "
said the <name> .
" what news does this gentleman bring us from the great world of london ? "
this <name> me into the conversation , which now took a more conventional tone .
after a while , <name> gave the signal for our departure , and in the cool of the evening we strolled down to the beach , enjoying the silence , broken only by the murmur of the sea and the far-away music of some fishermen 's song , almost as much as our late pleasant talk .
we sat down among the rocks , by a little pool , so <name> in animal , vegetable , and <unk>  or whatever is the right word  life , that i became entranced in the study of it , and , when <name> proposed returning to our lodgings , i begged to be left there for a while , to watch and muse alone .
the fishermen 's song grew ever nearer and clearer , as their boat stood in for the beach ; and i would have gone down to see them land their cargo of fish , had not the <unk> at my feet stirred my curiosity yet more keenly .
one ancient crab , that was for ever shuffling frantically from side to side of the pool , had particularly fascinated me : there was a vacancy in its stare , and an aimless violence in its behaviour , that irresistibly recalled the gardener who had befriended <name> and <name> : and , as i gazed , i caught the concluding notes of the tune of his crazy song .
the silence that followed was broken by the sweet voice of <name> .
" would you please let us out into the road ? "
" what !
after that old beggar again ? "
the gardener yelled , and began singing :  " he thought he saw a kangaroo that worked a <unk> : he looked again , and found it was a <unk> 'were i to swallow this , ' he said , 'i should be very ill ! ' "
[ image ... he thought he saw a kangaroo ] " we do n't want him to swallow anything , " <name> explained .
" he 's not hungry .
but we want to see him .
so <name> you please  " " certainly ! "
the gardener promptly replied .
" i always please .
never <unk> nobody .
there you are ! "
and he flung the door open , and let us out upon the <name> <unk> .
we soon found our way to the bush , which had so mysteriously sunk into the ground : and here <name> <name> the magic locket from its hiding-place , turned it over with a thoughtful air , and at last appealed to <name> in a rather helpless way .
" what was it we had to do with it , <name> ?
it 's all gone out of my head ! "
" kiss it ! "
was <name> 's invariable <unk> in cases of doubt and difficulty .
<name> kissed it , but no result followed .
" rub it the wrong way , " was <name> 's next suggestion .
" which is the wrong way ?
" , <name> most reasonably enquired .
the obvious plan was to try both ways .
rubbing from left to right had no visible effect whatever .
from right to left  " oh , stop , <name> ! "
<name> cried in sudden alarm .
" whatever is going to happen ? "
for a number of trees , on the neighbouring hillside , were moving slowly upwards , in solemn procession : while a mild little <name> , that had been rippling at our feet a moment before , began to swell , and foam , and hiss , and bubble , in a truly alarming fashion .
" rub it some other way ! "
cried <name> .
" try <unk> !
quick ! "
it was a happy thought .
<unk> did it : and the landscape , which had been showing signs of mental aberration in various directions , returned to its normal condition of <unk> with the exception of a small yellowish-brown mouse , which continued to run wildly up and down the road , lashing its tail like a little lion .
" let 's follow it , " said <name> : and this also turned out a happy thought .
the mouse at once settled down into a business-like <unk> , with which we could easily keep pace .
the only phenomenon , that gave me any uneasiness , was the rapid increase in the size of the little creature we were following , which became every moment more and more like a real lion .
soon the transformation was complete : and a <name> lion stood patiently waiting for us to come up with it .
no thought of fear seemed to occur to the children , who patted and stroked it as if it had been a <unk> .
[ image ... the <unk> ] " help me up ! "
cried <name> .
and in another moment <name> had lifted him upon the broad back of the gentle beast , and seated herself behind him , <unk> .
<name> took a good handful of mane in each hand , and made believe to guide this new kind of steed .
" <unk> !
' , seemed quite sufficient by way of verbal direction : the lion at once broke into an easy canter , and we soon found ourselves in the depths of the forest .
i say 'we , ' for i am certain that i accompanied them though how i managed to keep up with a cantering lion i am wholly unable to explain .
but i was certainly one of the party when we came upon an old <unk> cutting sticks , at whose feet the lion made a profound obeisance , <name> and <name> at the same moment dismounting , and leaping in to the arms of their father .
" from bad to worse ! "
the old man said to himself , dreamily , when the children had finished their rather confused account of the <unk> visit , gathered no doubt from general report , as they had not seen him themselves .
" from bad to worse !
that is their <name> .
i see it , but i can not alter it .
the selfishness of a mean and crafty man  the selfishness of an ambitious and silly woman   the selfishness of a spiteful and <unk> child all tend one way , from bad to worse !
and you , my darlings , must suffer it awhile , i fear .
yet , when things are at their worst , you can come to me .
i can do but little as yet  " gathering up a handful of dust and scattering it in the air , he slowly and solemnly pronounced some words that sounded like a charm , the children looking on in <unk> silence :  " let craft , ambition , spite , be quenched in reason 's night , till weakness turn to might , till what is dark be light , till what is wrong be right ! "
the cloud of dust spread itself out through the air , as if it were alive , forming curious shapes that were for ever changing into others .
" it makes letters !
it makes words ! "
<name> whispered , as he clung , <unk> , to <name> .
" only i ca'n't make them out !
read them , <name> ! "
" i 'll try , " <name> gravely replied .
" wait a minute  if only i could see that word  " " i should be very ill !
' , a discordant voice yelled in our ears .
" were i to swallow this , ' he said , 'i should be very ill ! ' "
chapter 9 .
a jester and a bear .
yes , we were in the garden once more : and , to escape that horrid discordant voice , we hurried indoors , and found ourselves in the library  uggug <unk> , the professor standing by with a bewildered air , and my <name> , with her arms clasped round her <unk> neck , repeating , over and over again , " and did they give him nasty lessons to learn ?
my own pretty pet ! "
" what 's all this noise about ? "
the vice-warden angrily enquired , as he strode into the room .
" and who put the <unk> here ? "
and he <name> his hat up on <name> , who was standing in the middle of the room , too much astonished by the sudden change of scene to make any attempt at removing it , though it came down to his shoulders , making him look something like a small candle with a large <unk> over it .
the professor mildly explained that his highness had been graciously pleased to say he would n't do his lessons .
" do your lessons this instant , you young cub ! "
thundered the vice-warden .
" and take this ! "
and a resounding box on the ear made the unfortunate professor reel across the room .
" save me ! "
faltered the poor old man , as he sank , <unk> , at my <name> 's feet .
" shave you ?
of course i <name> ! "
my <name> replied , as she lifted him into a chair , and pinned an <unk> round his neck .
" where 's the razor ? "
the vice-warden meanwhile had got hold of uggug , and was <unk> him with his umbrella .
" who left this loose nail in the floor ? "
he shouted , " hammer it in , i say !
hammer it in ! "
blow after blow fell on the writhing uggug , till he dropped howling to the floor .
[ image ... <unk> it in ! ' ]
then his father turned to the <unk> ' scene which was being enacted , and roared with laughter .
" excuse me , dear , i ca'n't help it ! "
he said as soon as he could speak .
" you are such an utter donkey !
kiss me , <unk> ! "
and he flung his arms round the neck of the terrified professor , who raised a wild <unk> , but whether he received the threatened kiss or not i was unable to see , as <name> , who had by this time released himself from his <unk> , rushed headlong out of the room , followed by <name> ; and i was so fearful of being left alone among all these crazy creatures that i hurried after them .
we must go to father ! "
<name> panted , as they ran down the garden .
" i 'm sure things are at their worst !
i 'll ask the gardener to let us out again . "
" but we ca'n't walk all the way ! "
<name> whimpered .
" how i wiss we had a <unk> , like uncle ! "
and , shrill and wild , rang through the air the familiar voice :  " he thought he saw a <unk> that stood beside his bed : he looked again , and found it was a bear without a head .
'poor thing , ' he said , 'poor silly thing !
it 's waiting to be fed ! ' "
[ image ... a bear without a head ] " no , i ca'n't let you out again ! "
he said , before the children could speak .
" the vice-warden gave it me , he did , for letting you out last time !
so be off with you ! "
and , turning away from them , he began digging frantically in the middle of a <unk> , singing , over and over again , " 'poor thing , ' he said , 'poor silly thing !
it 's waiting to be fed ! ' "
but in a more musical tone than the shrill <unk> in which he had begun .
the music grew fuller and richer at every moment : other manly voices joined in the refrain : and soon i heard the heavy thud that told me the boat had touched the beach , and the harsh grating of the shingle as the men dragged it up .
i roused myself , and , after lending them a hand in hauling up their boat , i lingered yet awhile to watch them <unk> a goodly assortment of the <unk> <unk> of the deep . '
when at last i reached our lodgings i was tired and sleepy , and glad enough to settle down again into the easy-chair , while <name> hospitably went to his cupboard , to get me out some cake and wine , without which , he declared , he could not , as a doctor , permit my going to bed .
and how that <unk> did creak !
it surely could not be <name> , who was opening and shutting it so often , moving so restlessly about , and muttering like the soliloquy of a <unk> !
no , it was a female voice .
also the figure <unk> by the <unk>  was a female figure , massive , and in flowing robes , could it be the landlady ?
the door opened , and a strange man entered the room .
" what is that donkey doing ? "
he said to himself , pausing , aghast , on the threshold .
the <name> , thus rudely referred to , was his wife .
she had got one of the <unk> open , and stood with her back to him , smoothing down a sheet of brown paper on one of the shelves , and whispering to herself " so , so !
deftly done !
craftily contrived ! "
her loving husband stole behind her on tiptoe , and tapped her on the head .
" boh ! "
he playfully shouted at her ear .
" never tell me again i ca'n't say <unk> ' to a goose ! "
my <name> wrung her hands .
" discovered ! "
she groaned .
" yet no  he is one of us !
reveal it not , oh man !
let it bide its time ! "
" reveal what not ? "
her husband testily replied , dragging out the sheet of brown paper .
" what are you hiding here , my <name> ?
i insist upon knowing ! "
my <name> cast down her eyes , and spoke in the littlest of little voices .
" do n't make fun of it , <name> ! "
she pleaded .
" it 's  it 's  don't you understand ?
it 's a dagger ! "
" and what 's that for ? "
sneered his excellency .
" we 've only got to make people think he 's dead !
we have n't got to kill him !
and made of tin , too ! "
he snarled , contemptuously bending the blade round his thumb .
now , madam , you 'll be good enough to explain .
first , what do you call me <name> for ? "
" it 's part of the conspiracy , love !
one must have an alias , you know  " " oh , an alias , is it ?
well !
and next , what did you get this dagger for ?
come , no <unk> !
you ca'n't deceive me ! "
" i got it for  for  for  " the detected conspirator stammered , trying her best to put on the <unk> that she had been practising at the looking-glass .
" for  " " for what , madam ! "
" well , for <unk> , if you must know , dearest !
that 's what i got it for , on my  " " now do n't say your word and honour ! "
groaned the other conspirator .
" why , they are n't worth half the money , put together ! "
" on my birthday , " my <name> concluded in a meek whisper .
" one must have a dagger , you know .
it 's part of the  " " oh , do n't talk of conspiracies ! "
her husband savagely interrupted , as he tossed the dagger into the cupboard .
" you know about as much how to manage a conspiracy as if you were a chicken .
why , the first thing is to get a disguise .
now , just look at this ! "
and with pardonable pride he fitted on the cap and bells , and the rest of the fool 's dress , and winked at her , and put his tongue in his cheek .
" is that the sort of thing , now . "
he demanded .
my <name> 's eyes flashed with all a conspirator 's enthusiasm .
" the very thing ! "
she exclaimed , clapping her hands .
" you do look , oh , such a perfect fool ! "
the fool smiled a doubtful smile .
he was not quite clear whether it was a compliment or not , to express it so plainly .
" you mean a jester ?
yes , that 's what i intended .
and what do you think your disguise is to be ? "
and he proceeded to unfold the parcel , the <name> watching him in rapture .
" oh , how lovely ! "
she cried , when at last the dress was unfolded .
" what a splendid disguise !
an esquimaux <unk> ! "
" an esquimaux peasant , indeed ! "
growled the other .
" here , put it on , and look at yourself in the glass .
why , it 's a bear , ca'n't you use your eyes ? "
he checked himself suddenly , as a harsh voice yelled through the room " he looked again , and found it was a bear without a head ! "
but it was only the gardener , singing under the open window .
the vice-warden stole on <unk> to the window , and closed it noiselessly , before he ventured to go on .
" yes , <unk> , a bear : but not without a head , i <name> !
you 're the bear , and me the keeper .
and if any one knows us , they 'll have sharp eyes , that 's all ! "
" i shall have to practise the steps a bit , " my <name> said , looking out through the bear 's mouth : " one ca'n't help being rather human just at first , you know .
and of course you 'll say 'come up , bruin !
' , wo n't you ? "
" yes , of course , " replied the keeper , laying hold of the chain , that <name> from the bear 's collar , with one hand , while with the other he cracked a little whip .
" now go round the room in a sort of a dancing attitude .
very good , my dear , very good .
come up , bruin !
come up , i say ! "
[ image ... 'come up , bruin ! ' ]
he roared out the last words for the benefit of uggug , who had just come into the room , and was now standing , with his hands spread out , and eyes and mouth wide open , the very picture of stupid amazement .
" oh , my ! "
was all he could gasp out .
the keeper pretended to be adjusting the bear 's collar , which gave him an opportunity of whispering , unheard by uggug , " my fault , i 'm afraid !
quite forgot to fasten the door .
plot 's ruined if he finds it out !
keep it up a minute or two longer .
be savage ! "
then , while seeming to pull it back with all his strength , he let it advance upon the scared boy : my <name> , with admirable presence of mind , kept up what she no doubt intended for a savage growl , though it was more like the purring of a cat : and uggug backed out of the room with such haste that he tripped over the mat , and was heard to fall heavily outside  an accident to which even his <unk> mother paid no heed , in the excitement of the moment .
the vice-warden shut and bolted the door .
" off with the disguises ! "
he panted .
" there 's not a moment to lose .
he 's sure to fetch the professor , and we could n't take him in , you know ! "
and in another minute the disguises were stowed away in the cupboard , the door <unk> , and the two conspirators seated lovingly <unk> on the sofa , earnestly discussing a book the vice-warden had hastily snatched off the table , which proved to be the <unk> of the capital of outland .
the door opened , very slowly and cautiously , and the professor peeped in , uggug 's stupid face being just visible behind him .
" it is a beautiful arrangement ! "
the vice-warden was saying with enthusiasm .
" you see , my precious one , that there are fifteen houses in green street , before you turn into west street . "
" fifteen houses !
is it possible ? "
my <name> replied .
" i thought it was fourteen ! "
and , so intent were they on this interesting question , that neither of them even looked up till the professor , leading uggug by the hand , stood close before them .
my <name> was the first to notice their approach .
" why , here 's the professor ! "
she exclaimed in her <unk> tones .
" and my precious child too !
are lessons over ? "
" a strange thing has happened ! "
the professor began in a trembling tone .
" his exalted <unk> " ( this was one of uggug 's many titles ) " tells me he has just seen , in this very room , a <unk> and a <unk> ! "
the vice-warden and his wife shook with <unk> merriment .
not in this room , darling ! "
said the fond mother .
" we 've been sitting here this hour or more , reading  , " here she referred to the book lying on her lap , "  reading the  the <unk> . "
" let me feel your pulse , my boy ! "
said the anxious father .
" now put out your tongue .
ah , i thought so !
he 's a little feverish , professor , and has had a bad dream .
put him to bed at once , and give him a cooling draught . "
" i ai n't been dreaming ! "
his exalted <unk> remonstrated , as the professor led him away .
" bad grammar , sir ! "
his father remarked with some sternness .
" kindly attend to that little matter , professor , as soon as you have corrected the <unk> .
and , by the way , professor ! "
( the professor left his distinguished pupil standing at the door , and meekly returned . )
" there is a rumour afloat , that the people wish to elect an  in point of fact , an  you understand that i mean an  " " not another professor ! "
the poor old man exclaimed in horror .
" no !
certainly not ! "
the vice-warden eagerly explained .
" merely an emperor , you understand . "
" an emperor ! "
cried the astonished professor , holding his head between his hands , as if he expected it to come to pieces with the shock .
" what <name> the warden  " " why , the warden <name> most likely be the new emperor ! "
my <name> explained .
" where could we find a better ?
unless , perhaps  " she glanced at her husband .
" where indeed ! "
the professor fervently responded , quite failing to take the hint .
the vice-warden resumed the thread of his discourse .
" the reason i mentioned it , professor , was to ask you to be so kind as to preside at the election .
you see it would make the thing respectable  no suspicion of anything , underhand  " " i fear i ca'n't , your excellency ! "
the old man faltered .
" what <name> the warden  " " true , true ! "
the vice-warden interrupted .
" your position , as <unk> , makes it awkward , i admit .
well , well !
then the election shall be held without you . "
" better so , than if it were held within me ! "
the professor murmured with a bewildered air , as if he hardly knew what he was saying .
" bed , i think your highness said , and a <unk> ? "
and he wandered dreamily back to where uggug sulkily awaited him .
i followed them out of the room , and down the passage , the professor murmuring to himself , all the time , as a kind of aid to his feeble memory , " c , c , c ; couch , <unk> , <unk> , " till , in turning a corner , he met <name> and <name> , so suddenly that the startled professor let go of his fat pupil , who instantly took to his heels .
chapter 10 .
the other professor .
" we were looking for you ! "
cried <name> , in a tone of great relief .
" we do want you so much , you ca'n't think ! "
" what is it , dear children ? "
the professor asked , beaming on them with a very different look from what uggug ever got from him .
" we want you to speak to the gardener for us , " <name> said , as she and <name> took the old man 's hands and led him into the hall .
" he 's ever so unkind ! "
<name> mournfully added .
" they 's all unkind to us , now that father 's gone .
the lion were much nicer ! "
" but you must explain to me , please , " the professor said with an anxious look , " which is the lion , and which is the gardener .
it 's most important not to get two such animals confused together .
and one 's very liable to do it in their case  both having mouths , you know  " " <unk> oo always <unk> two animals together ? "
<name> asked .
" pretty often , i 'm afraid , " the professor candidly confessed .
" now , for instance , there 's the <unk> and the <unk> . "
the professor pointed them out .
" one gets a little confused with them  both having doors , you know .
now , only yesterday  would you believe it ?  i put some <unk> into the clock , and tried to wind up the rabbit ! "
" did the rabbit go , after oo wounded it up ? "
said <name> .
the professor clasped his hands on the top of his head , and groaned .
" go ?
i should think it did go !
why , it 's gone ?
and where ever it's gone to  that 's what i ca'n't find out !
i 've done my best  i 've read all the article <unk> ' in the great dictionary  come in ! "
" only the tailor , sir , with your little <name> , " said a meek voice outside the door .
" ah , well , i can soon settle his business , " the professor said to the children , " if you 'll just wait a minute .
how much is it , this year , my man ? "
the tailor had come in while he was speaking .
" well , it 's been a doubling so many years , you see , " the tailor replied , a little gruffly , " and i think i 'd like the money now .
it 's two thousand pound , it is ! "
" oh , that 's nothing ! "
the professor carelessly remarked , feeling in his pocket , as if he always carried at least that amount about with him .
" but would n't you like to wait just another year , and make it four thousand ?
just think how <name> you 'd be !
why , you might be a king , if you liked ! "
" i do n't know as i 'd care about being a king , " the man said thoughtfully .
" but it ; dew sound a powerful sight o ' money !
well , i think i 'll wait  " " of course you <name> ! "
said the professor .
" there 's good sense in you , i see .
<unk> to you , my man ! "
" <name> you ever have to pay him that four thousand pounds ? "
<name> asked as the door closed on the departing <unk> .
" never , my child ! "
the professor replied emphatically .
" he 'll go on doubling it , till he dies .
you see it 's always worth while waiting another year , to get twice as much money !
and now what would you like to do , my little friends ?
shall i take you to see the other professor ?
this would be an excellent opportunity for a visit , " he said to himself , glancing at his watch : " he generally takes a short rest  of fourteen minutes and a half  about this time . "
<name> hastily went round to <name> , who was standing at the other side of the professor , and put his hand into hers .
" i thinks we 'd like to go , " he said doubtfully : " only please let 's go all together .
it 's best to be on the safe side , oo know ! "
" why , you talk as if you were <name> ! "
exclaimed the professor .
" i know i did , " <name> replied very humbly .
" i quite <unk> i wasn't <name> .
only i fought he might be <unk> fierce ! "
the professor laughed a jolly laugh .
" oh , he 's quite tame ! "
he said .
" he never bites .
he 's only a little  a little dreamy , you know . "
he took hold of <name> 's other hand ; and led the children down a long passage i had never noticed before  not that there was anything remarkable in that : i was constantly coming on new rooms and passages in that mysterious palace , and very seldom succeeded in finding the old ones again .
near the end of the passage the professor stopped .
" this is his room , " he said , pointing to the solid wall .
" we ca'n't get in through there ! "
<name> exclaimed .
<name> said nothing , till she had carefully examined whether the wall opened anywhere .
then she laughed merrily .
" you 're playing us a trick , you dear old thing ! "
she said .
" there 's no door here ! "
" there is n't any door to the room , " said the professor .
" we shall have to climb in at the window . "
so we went into the garden , and soon found the window of the other professor 's room .
it was a <unk> window , and stood <unk> open : the professor first lifted the two children in , and then he and i climbed in after them .
[ image ... the other professor ] the other professor was seated at a table , with a large book open before him , on which his forehead was resting : he had clasped his arms round the book , and was snoring heavily .
" he usually reads like that , " the professor remarked , " when the book 's very interesting : and then sometimes it 's very difficult to get him to attend ! "
this seemed to be one of the difficult times : the professor lifted him up , once or twice , and shook him violently : but he always returned to his book the moment he was let go of , and showed by his heavy breathing that the book was as interesting as ever .
" how dreamy he is ! "
the professor exclaimed .
" he must have got to a very interesting part of the book ! "
and he rained quite a shower of <unk> on the other professor 's back , shouting " <unk> !
<unk> ! "
all the time .
" is n't it wonderful that he should be so dreamy ? "
he said to <name> .
" if he 's always as sleepy as that , " <name> remarked , " a course he's dreamy ! "
" but what are we to do ? "
said the professor .
" you see he 's quite wrapped up in the book ! "
" suppose oo shuts the book ? "
<name> suggested .
" that 's it ! "
cried the delighted professor .
" of course that 'll do it ! "
and he shut up the book so quickly that he caught the other <unk> nose between the leaves , and gave it a severe pinch .
the other professor instantly rose to his feet , and carried the book away to the end of the room , where he put it back in its place in the <unk> .
" i 've been reading for eighteen hours and three-quarters , " he said , " and now i shall rest for fourteen minutes and a half .
is the lecture all ready ? "
" very nearly , " the professor humbly replied .
" i shall ask you to give me a hint or two  there <name> be a few little difficulties  " " and banquet , i think you said ? "
" oh , yes !
the banquet comes first , of course .
people never enjoy abstract science , you know , when they 're ravenous with hunger .
and then there 's the <unk> .
oh , there 'll be lots of entertainment ! "
" where <name> the ball come in ? "
said the other professor .
" i think it had better come at the beginning of the banquet  it brings people together so nicely , you know . "
" yes , that 's the right order .
first the meeting : then the eating : then the treating  for i 'm sure any lecture you give us <name> be a treat ! "
said the other professor , who had been standing with his back to us all this time , occupying himself in taking the books out , one by one , and turning them upside-down .
an <unk> , with a black board on it , stood near him : and , every time that he turned a book upside-down , he made a <name> on the board with a piece of chalk .
" and as to the <unk> '  which you have so kindly promised to give us  " the professor went on , thoughtfully rubbing his <name> .
" i think that had better come at the end of the banquet : then people can listen to it quietly . "
" shall i sing it ? "
the other professor asked , with a smile of delight .
" if you can , " the professor replied , cautiously .
" let me try , " said the other professor , seating himself at the <unk> .
" for the sake of argument , let us assume that it begins on a flat . "
and he struck the note in question .
" la , la , la !
i think that's within an octave of it . "
he struck the note again , and appealed to <name> , who was standing at his side .
" did i sing it like that , my child ? "
" no , oo did n't , " <name> replied with great decision .
" it were more like a duck . "
" single notes are apt to have that effect , " the other professor said with a sigh .
" let me try a whole verse .
there was a pig , that sat alone , beside a ruined pump .
by day and night he made his moan : it would have stirred a heart of stone to see him wring his hoofs and groan , because he could not jump .
would you call that a tune , professor ? "
he asked , when he had finished .
the professor considered a little .
" well , " he said at last , " some of the notes are the same as others and some are different but i should hardly call it a tune . "
" let me try it a bit by myself , " said the other professor .
and he began touching the notes here and there , and humming to himself like an angry <unk> .
" how do you like his singing ? "
the professor asked the children in a low voice .
" it is n't very beautiful , " <name> said , hesitatingly .
" it 's very extremely ugly ! "
<name> said , without any hesitation at all .
" all extremes are bad , " the professor said , very gravely .
" for instance , <unk> is a very good thing , when practised in moderation : but even <unk> , when carried to an extreme , has its disadvantages . "
" what are its disadvantages ? "
was the question that rose in my mind  and , as usual , <name> asked it for me .
" what are its lizard bandages ? '
" well , this is one of them , " said the professor .
" when a man 's tipsy ( that 's one extreme , you know ) , he sees one thing as two .
but , when he's extremely sober ( that 's the other extreme ) , he sees two things as one .
it 's equally inconvenient , whichever happens .
" what does <unk> ' mean ? "
<name> whispered to <name> .
" the difference between <unk> ' and <unk> ' is best explained by an example , " said the other professor , who had overheard the question .
" if you 'll just think over any poem that contains the two words  such as  " the professor put his hands over his ears , with a look of dismay .
" if you once let him begin a poem , " he said to <name> , " he 'll never leave off again !
he never does ! "
" did he ever begin a poem and not leave off again ? "
<name> enquired .
" three times , " said the professor .
<name> raised himself on tiptoe , till his lips were on a level with <name> 's ear .
" what became of them three poems ? "
he whispered .
" is he saying them all , now ? "
" hush ! "
said <name> .
" the other professor is speaking ! "
" i 'll say it very quick , " murmured the other professor , with downcast eyes , and melancholy voice , which contrasted oddly with his face , as he had forgotten to leave off smiling .
( " at least it was n't exactly a smile , " as <name> said afterwards : " it looked as if his mouth was made that shape . "
" go on then , " said the professor .
" what must be must be . "
" remember that ! "
<name> whispered to <name> , " it 's a very good rule for whenever you hurt yourself . "
" and it 's a very good rule for whenever i make a noise , " said the saucy little fellow .
" so you remember it too , miss ! "
" whatever do you mean ? "
said <name> , trying to frown , a thing she never managed particularly well .
" <unk> and <unk> , " said <name> , " have n't oo told me ' there must n't be so much noise , <name> ! '
when i 've <unk> oo 'there must ! '
why , there is n't no rules at all about 'there must n't ' !
but oo never believes me ! "
" as if any one could believe you , you wicked wicked boy ! "
said <name> .
the words were severe enough , but i am of opinion that , when you are really anxious to impress a criminal with a sense of his guilt , you ought not to pronounce the sentence with your lips quite close to his cheek  since a kiss at the end of it , however accidental , <unk> the effect terribly .
chapter 11 .
<name> and <name> .
" as i was saying , " the other professor resumed , " if you 'll just think over any poem , that contains the words  such as <unk> is poor , ' said <name> <name> , 'and i have always been his friend : and , though my means to give are small , at least i can afford to lend .
how few , in this cold age of greed , do good , except on selfish grounds !
but i can feel for <name> 's need , and i <name> lend him fifty pounds ! '
how great was <name> 's <name> to find his friend in such a genial vein !
how cheerfully the bond he signed , to pay the money back again !
'we ca'n't , ' said <name> , 'be too precise : 't is best to fix the very day : so , by a learned friend 's advice , i 've made it noon , the fourth of may .
[ image ... 'how <unk> the bond he signed ! ' ]
but this is <name> !
<name> said .
'the first of <name> , as i think .
five little weeks <name> soon be fled : one scarcely <name> have time to wink !
give me a year to speculate  to buy and sell  to drive a trade  ' said <name> 'i can not change the date .
on may the fourth it must be paid . '
'well , well ! '
said <name> , with a sigh .
<unk> me the cash , and i <name> go .
i 'll form a <unk> company , and turn an honest pound or so . '
'i 'm grieved , ' said <name> , 'to seem unkind : the money shalt of course be lent : but , for a week or two , i find it <name> not be convenient . '
so , week by week , poor <name> came and turned in <unk> away ; for still the answer was the same , 'i can not manage it to-day . '
and now the <name> showers were dry  the five short weeks were nearly spent  yet still he got the old reply , 'it is not quite convenient ! '
the fourth arrived , and punctual <name> came , with his legal friend , at noon .
'i thought it best , ' said he , 'to call : one can not settle things too soon . '
poor <name> shuddered in despair : his flowing locks he wildly tore : and very soon his yellow hair was lying all about the floor .
the legal friend was standing by , with sudden pity half <unk> : the <unk> trembled in his eye , the signed agreement in his hand : but when at length the legal soul resumed its customary force , 'the law , ' he said , 'we ca'n't control : pay , or the law must take its course ! '
said <name> 'how bitterly i rue that fatal morning when i called !
consider , <name> , what you do !
you wo n't be richer when you 're bald !
think you , by rending curls away , to make your difficulties less ?
forbear this violence , i pray : you do but add to my distress ! '
[ image ... 'poor <name> shuddered in despair ' ] 'not willingly would i inflict , ' said <name> , 'on that <name> heart one needless pang .
yet why so strict ?
is this to act a friendly part ?
however legal it may be to pay what never has been lent , this style of business seems to me extremely inconvenient !
'no nobleness of soul have i , like some that in this age are found ! '
( <name> blushed in sheer humility , and cast his eyes upon the ground ) 'this debt <name> simply swallow all , and make my life a life of woe ! '
'nay , nay , nay <name> ! '
answered <name> .
'you must not rail on fortune so !
'you have enough to eat and drink : you are respected in the world : and at the barber 's , as i think , you often get your whiskers curled .
though nobleness you ca'n't attain to any very great extent  the path of honesty is plain , however inconvenient ! '
" tis true , 'said <name> , ' i 'm alive : i keep my station in the world : once in the week i just contrive to get my whiskers oiled and curled .
but my assets are very low : my little income 's <unk> : to trench on capital , you know , is always inconvenient ! '
'but pay your debts ! '
cried honest <name> .
'my gentle <name> , pay your debts !
what matter if it swallows all that you describe as your " assets " ?
already you 're an hour behind : yet generosity is best .
it <unk> me  but never mind !
i <name> not charge you interest ! '
'how good !
how great ! '
poor <name> cried .
<unk> i must sell my <name> wig  the <unk> that has been my pride  my grand piano  and my pig ! '
full soon his property took wings : and daily , as each treasure went , he sighed to find the state of things grow less and less convenient .
weeks grew to months , and months to years : <name> was worn to skin and bone : and once he even said , with tears , 'remember , <name> , that promised <name> ! '
said <name> ' i 'll lend you , when i can , all the spare money i have got  ah , <name> , you 're a happy man !
yours is an enviable lot !
[ image ... such boots as these you seldom see ] 'i 'm getting stout , as you may see : it is but seldom i am well : i can not feel my ancient glee in listening to the <unk> : but you , you <unk> like a boy , your figure is so spare and light : the <unk> 's a note of <name> to such a healthy appetite ! '
said <name> 'i am well aware mine is a state of happiness : and yet how gladly could i spare some of the comforts i possess !
what you call healthy appetite i feel as hunger 's savage tooth : and , when no dinner is in sight , the <unk> 's a sound of <name> !
'no <unk> would accept this coat : such boots as these you seldom see .
ah , <name> , a single <unk> would make another man of me ! '
said <name> 'it fills me with surprise to hear you talk in such a tone : i fear you scarcely realise the blessings that are all your own !
'you 're safe from being <unk> : you 're sweetly picturesque in rags : you never know the aching head that comes along with <unk> : and you have time to cultivate that best of qualities , content  for which you 'll find your present state remarkably convenient ! '
said <name> 'though i can not sound the depths of such a man as you , yet in your character i 've found an inconsistency or two .
you seem to have long years to spare when there 's a promise to fulfil : and yet how punctual you were in calling with that little <name> ! '
'one ca n't be too deliberate , ' said <name> , 'in parting with one 's <unk> .
with bills , as you correctly state , i 'm punctuality itself : a man may surely claim his dues : but , when there 's money to be lent , a man must be allowed to choose such times as are convenient ! '
it chanced one day , as <name> sat gnawing a crust  his usual meal  <name> bustled in to have a chat , and grasped his hand with friendly zeal .
'i knew , ' said he , 'your frugal ways : so , that i might not wound your pride by bringing strangers in to gaze , i 've left my legal friend outside !
'you well remember , i am sure , when first your wealth began to go , and people sneered at one so poor , i never used my <name> so !
and when you 'd lost your little all , and found yourself a thing despised , i need not ask you to recall how tenderly i <unk> !
'then the advice i 've poured on you , so full of wisdom and of wit : all given gratis , though 't is true i might have fairly charged for it !
but i refrain from mentioning full many a deed i might relate for boasting is a kind of thing that i particularly hate .
[ image ... 'i <name> lend you fifty more ! ' ]
'how vast the total sum appears of all the kindnesses i 've done , from childhood 's <unk> years down to that <name> of <name> one !
that fifty pounds !
you little guessed how deep it drained my slender store : but there 's a heart within this breast , and i <name> lend you fifty more ! '
'not so , ' was <name> 's mild reply , his cheeks all wet with grateful tears ; no man recalls , so well as i , your services in bygone years : and this new offer , i admit , is very very kindly meant  still , to avail myself of it would not be quite convenient ! '
you 'll see in a moment what the difference is between <unk> ' and <unk> . '
you quite understand it now , do n't you ? "
he added , looking kindly at <name> , who was sitting , at <name> 's side , on the floor .
" yes , " said <name> , very quietly .
such a short speech was very unusual , for him : but just then he seemed , i fancied , a little exhausted .
in fact , he climbed up into <name> 's lap as he spoke , and rested his head against her shoulder .
" what a many verses it was ! "
he whispered .
chapter 12 .
a musical gardener .
the other professor regarded him with some anxiety .
" the smaller animal ought to go to bed at once , " he said with an air of authority .
" why at once ? "
said the professor .
" because he ca n't go at twice , " said the other professor .
the professor gently clapped his hands .
'is n't he wonderful ! "
he said to <name> .
" nobody else could have thought of the reason , so quick .
why , of course he ca'n't go at twice !
it would hurt him to be divided . "
this remark woke up <name> , suddenly and completely .
" i do n't want to be divided , " he said <unk> .
" it does very well on a diagram , " said the other professor .
" i could show it you in a minute , only the chalk 's a little blunt . "
" take care ! "
<name> anxiously exclaimed , as he began , rather clumsily , to point it .
" you 'll cut your finger off , if you hold the knife so ! "
" if oo cuts it off , <name> oo give it to me , please ?
<name> thoughtfully added .
" it 's like this , " said the other professor , hastily drawing a long line upon the black board , and marking the letters 'a , ' <unk> , ' at the two ends , and <unk> ' in the middle : " let me explain it to you .
if ab were to be divided into two parts at c  " " it would be drownded , " <name> pronounced confidently .
the other professor gasped .
" what would be drownded ? "
" why the <unk> , of course ! "
said <name> .
" and the two bits would sink down in the sea ! "
here the professor interfered , as the other professor was evidently too much puzzled to go on with his diagram .
" when i said it would hurt him , i was merely referring to the action of the nerves  " the other professor brightened up in a moment .
" the action of the nerves , " he began eagerly , " is curiously slow in some people .
i had a friend , once , that , if you burnt him with a red-hot poker , it would take years and years before he felt it ! "
" and if you only pinched him ? "
queried <name> .
" then it would take ever so much longer , of course .
in fact , i doubt if the man himself would ever feel it , at all .
his grandchildren might . "
" i would n't like to be the grandchild of a pinched grandfather , would you , mister sir ? "
<name> whispered .
" it might come just when you wanted to be happy ! "
that would be awkward , i admitted , taking it quite as a matter of course that he had so suddenly caught sight of me .
" but do n't you always want to be happy , <name> ? "
" not always , " <name> said thoughtfully .
" sometimes , when i 's too happy , i wants to be a little miserable .
then i just tell <name> about it , oo know , and <name> sets me some lessons .
then it 's all right . "
" i 'm sorry you do n't like lessons , " i said .
" you should copy <name> .
she 's always as busy as the day is long ! "
" well , so am i ! "
said <name> .
" no , no ! "
<name> corrected him .
" you 're as busy as the day is short ! "
" well , what 's the difference ? "
<name> asked .
" mister sir , is n't the day as short as it 's long ?
i mean , is n't it the same length ? "
never having considered the question in this light , i suggested that they had better ask the professor ; and they ran off in a moment to appeal to their old friend .
the professor left off polishing his spectacles to consider .
" my dears , " he said after a minute , " the day is the same length as anything that is the same length as it . "
and he resumed his <unk> task of polishing .
the children returned , slowly and thoughtfully , to report his answer .
" is n't he wise ? "
<name> asked in an <unk> whisper .
" if i was as wise as that , i should have a <unk> all day long .
i know i should ! "
" you appear to be talking to somebody  that is n't here , " the professor said , turning round to the children .
" who is it ? "
<name> looked puzzled .
" i never talks to nobody when he is n't here ! "
he replied .
" it is n't good manners .
oo should always wait till he comes , before oo talks to him ! "
the professor looked anxiously in my direction , and seemed to look through and through me without seeing me .
" then who are you talking to ? "
he said .
" there is n't anybody here , you know , except the other professor and he is n't here ! "
he added wildly , turning round and round like a <unk> .
" children !
help to look for him !
quick !
he 's got lost again ! "
the children were on their feet in a moment .
" where shall we look ? "
said <name> .
" anywhere ! "
shouted the excited professor .
" only be quick about it ! "
and he began trotting round and round the room , lifting up the chairs , and shaking them .
<name> took a very small book out of the bookcase , opened it , and shook it in imitation of the professor .
" he is n't here , " he said .
" he ca'n't be there , <name> ! "
<name> said indignantly .
" course he ca'n't ! "
said <name> .
" i should have <unk> him out , if he 'd been in there ! "
" has he ever been lost before ? "
<name> enquired , turning up a corner of the hearth-rug , and peeping under it .
" once before , " said the professor : " he once lost himself in a wood  " " and could n't he find <unk> again ? "
said <name> .
" why did n't he shout ?
he 'd be sure to hear <unk> , 'cause he could n't be far off , oo know . "
" lets try shouting , " said the professor .
" what shall we shout ? "
said <name> .
" on second thoughts , do n't shout , " the professor replied .
" the vice-warden might hear you .
he 's getting awfully strict ! "
this reminded the poor children of all the troubles , about which they had come to their old friend .
<name> sat down on the floor and began crying .
" he is so cruel ! "
he sobbed .
" and he lets uggug take away all my toys !
and such horrid meals ! "
" what did you have for dinner to-day ? "
said the professor .
" a little piece of a dead crow , " was <name> 's mournful reply .
" he means <unk> , " <name> explained .
" it were a dead crow , " <name> persisted .
" and there were a <unk>  and uggug ate it all  and i got nuffin but a crust !
and i asked for a orange  and  did n't get it ! "
and the poor little fellow buried his face in <name> 's lap , who kept gently stroking his hair , as she went on .
" it 's all true , professor dear !
they do treat my darling <name> very badly !
and they 're not kind to me either , " she added in a lower tone , as if that were a thing of much less importance .
the professor got out a large red silk handkerchief , and wiped his eyes .
" i wish i could help you , dear children ! "
he said .
" but what can i do ? "
" we know the way to fairyland  where father 's gone  quite well , " said <name> : " if only the gardener would let us out . "
" wo n't he open the door for you ? "
said the professor .
" not for us , " said <name> : " but i 'm sure he would for you .
do come and ask him , professor dear ! "
" i 'll come this minute ! "
said the professor .
<name> sat up and dried his eyes .
" is n't he kind , mister sir ? "
" he is indeed , " said i .
but the professor took no notice of my remark .
he had put on a beautiful cap with a long <unk> , and was selecting one of the other professor 's <unk> , from a stand in the corner of the room .
" a thick stick in one 's hand makes people respectful , " he was saying to himself .
" come along , dear children ! "
and we all went out into the garden together .
" i shall address him , first of all , " the professor explained as we went along , " with a few playful remarks on the weather .
i shall then question him about the other professor .
this <name> have a double advantage .
first , it <name> open the conversation ( you ca n't even drink a bottle of wine without opening it first ) : and secondly , if he 's seen the other professor , we shall find him that way : and , if he has n't , we sha'n't . "
on our way , we passed the target , at which uggug had been made to shoot during the ambassador 's visit .
" see ! "
said the professor , pointing out a hole in the middle of the bull's-eye .
" his imperial <unk> had only one shot at it ; and he went in just here !
<name> carefully examined the hole .
" could n't go in there , " he whispered to me .
" he are too fat ! "
we had no sort of difficulty in finding the gardener .
though he was hidden from us by some trees , that harsh voice of his served to direct us ; and , as we <name> nearer , the words of his song became more and more plainly audible :  " he thought he saw an albatross that fluttered round the lamp : he looked again , and found it was a <unk> .
'you 'd best be getting home , ' he said : 'the nights are very damp ! ' "
[ image ... he thought he saw an albatross ] " would it be afraid of catching cold ? "
said <name> .
if it got very damp , " <name> suggested , " it might stick to something , you know . "
" and that <unk> would have to go by the post , what ever it was ! "
<name> eagerly exclaimed .
" suppose it was a cow !
would n't it be dreadful for the other things ! "
" and all these things happened to him , " said the professor .
" that 's what makes the song so interesting . "
" he must have had a very curious life , " said <name> .
" you may say that ! "
the professor heartily rejoined .
" of course she may ! "
cried <name> .
by this time we had come up to the gardener , who was standing on one leg , as usual , and busily employed in watering a bed of flowers with an empty <unk> .
" it has n't got no water in it ! "
<name> explained to him , pulling his sleeve to attract his attention .
" it 's lighter to hold , " said the gardener .
" a lot of water in it makes one 's arms ache . "
and he went on with his work , singing softly to himself " the nights are very damp ! "
" in digging things out of the ground which you probably do now and then , " the professor began in a loud voice ; " in making things into heaps  which no doubt you often do ; and in kicking things about with one heel  which you seem never to leave off doing ; have you ever happened to notice another professor something like me , but different ? "
" never ! "
shouted the gardener , so loudly and violently that we all <name> back in alarm .
" there ai n't such a thing ! "
" we <name> try a less exciting topic , " the professor mildly remarked to the children .
" you were asking  " " we asked him to let us through the <unk> , " said <name> : " but he would n't : but perhaps he would for you ! "
the professor put the request , very humbly and courteously .
" i would n't mind letting you out , " said the gardener .
" but i mustn't open the door for children .
d'you think i 'd disobey the rules ?
not for <unk> ! "
the professor cautiously produced a couple of shillings .
" that 'll do it ! "
the gardener shouted , as he hurled the <unk> across the <unk> , and produced a handful of keys  one large one , and a number of small ones .
" but look here , professor dear ! "
whispered <name> .
" he need n't open the door for us , at all .
we can go out with you . "
" true , dear child ! "
the professor <unk> replied , as he replaced the coins in his pocket .
" that saves two shillings ! "
and he took the children 's hands , that they might all go out together when the door was opened .
this , however , did not seem a very likely event , though the gardener patiently tried all the small keys , over and over again .
at last the professor ventured on a gentle suggestion .
" why not try the large one ?
i have often observed that a door <unk> much more nicely with its own key . "
the very first trial of the large key proved a success : the gardener opened the door , and held out his hand for the money .
the professor shook his head .
" you are acting by rule , " he explained , " in opening the door for me .
and now it 's open , we are going out by rule  the rule of three . "
the gardener looked puzzled , and let us go out ; but , as he locked the door behind us , we heard him singing thoughtfully to himself " he thought he saw a <unk> that opened with a key : he looked again , and found it was a double rule of three : 'and all its mystery , ' he said , 'is clear as day to me ! ' "
" i shall now return , " said the professor , when we had walked a few yards : " you see , it 's impossible to read here , for all my books are in the house . "
but the children still kept fast hold of his hands .
" do come with us ! "
<name> entreated with tears in her eyes .
" well , well ! "
said the good-natured old man .
" perhaps i 'll come after you , some day soon .
but i must go back now .
you see i left off at a <unk> , and it 's so awkward not knowing how the sentence finishes !
besides , you 've got to go through <unk> first , and i 'm always a little nervous about dogs .
but it 'll be quite easy to come , as soon as i 've completed my new invention  for carrying <unk> , you know .
it wants just a little more working out . "
" wo n't that be very tiring , to <name> yourself ? "
<name> enquired .
" well , no , my child .
you see , whatever fatigue one <unk> by carrying , one saves by being carried !
good-bye , dears !
good-bye , sir ! "
he added to my intense surprise , giving my hand an affectionate squeeze .
" good-bye , professor ! "
i replied : but my voice sounded strange and far away , and the children took not the slightest notice of our farewell .
evidently they neither saw me nor heard me , as , with their arms lovingly twined round each other , they marched boldly on .
chapter 13 .
a visit to <unk> .
" there 's a house , away there to the left , " said <name> , after we had walked what seemed to me about fifty miles .
" let 's go and ask for a night 's lodging . "
" it looks a very <unk> house , " <name> said , as we turned into the road leading up to it .
" i <unk> <name> the dogs <name> be kind to us , i is so tired and hungry ! "
a mastiff , dressed in a <name> collar , and carrying a musket , was pacing up and down , like a sentinel , in front of the entrance .
he started , on catching sight of the children , and came forwards to meet them , keeping his musket pointed straight at <name> , who stood quite still , though he turned pale and kept tight hold of <name> 's hand , while the sentinel walked solemnly round and round them , and looked at them from all points of view .
[ image ... the <unk> ] " <unk> , <unk> <unk> ! "
he growled at last .
" <unk> <unk> <unk> !
bow <unk> <unk> ?
bow wow ? "
he asked <name> , severely .
of course <name> understood all this , easily enough .
all fairies understand <unk>  that is , <unk> .
but , as you may find it a little difficult , just at first , i had better put it into english for you .
" humans , i verily believe !
a couple of stray humans !
what dog do you belong to ?
what do you want ? "
" we do n't belong to a dog ! "
<name> began , in <unk> .
( " peoples never belongs to dogs ! "
he whispered to <name> . )
but <name> hastily checked him , for fear of hurting the <unk> feelings .
" please , we want a little food , and a night 's lodging  if there 's room in the house , " she added timidly .
<name> spoke <unk> very prettily : but i think it 's almost better , for you , to give the conversation in english .
" the house , indeed ! "
growled the sentinel .
" have you never seen a palace in your life ?
come along with me !
his majesty must settle what 's to be done with you . "
they followed him through the <unk> , down a long passage , and into a magnificent saloon , around which were grouped dogs of all sorts and sizes .
two splendid <unk> were solemnly sitting up , one on each side of the <unk> .
two or three <unk>  whom i guessed to be the body-guard of the king  were waiting in grim silence : in fact the only voices at all plainly audible were those of two little dogs , who had mounted a settee , and were holding a lively discussion that looked very like a quarrel .
" lords and ladies in waiting , and various court officials , " our guide gruffly remarked , as he led us in .
of me the courtiers took no notice whatever : but <name> and <name> were the subject of many inquisitive looks , and many whispered remarks , of which i only distinctly caught one  made by a <unk> <unk> to his friend " bah <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , hah bah ? "
( " she 's not such a <unk> human , is she ? " )
leaving the new arrivals in the centre of the saloon , the sentinel advanced to a door , at the further end of it , which bore an inscription , painted on it in <unk> , " <name> kennel  scratch and yell . "
before doing this , the sentinel turned to the children , and said " give me your names . "
" we 'd rather not ! "
<name> exclaimed , pulling ' <name> away from the door .
" we want them ourselves .
come back , <name> !
come quick ! "
" nonsense !
' , said <name> very decidedly : and gave their names in <unk> .
then the sentinel scratched violently at the door , and gave a yell that made <name> shiver from head to foot .
" <unk> wah ! "
said a deep voice inside .
( that 's <unk> for " come in ! " )
" it 's the king himself ! "
the mastiff whispered in an <unk> tone .
" take off your <unk> , and lay them humbly at his paws . "
( what we should call " at his feet . " )
<name> was just going to explain , very politely , that really they could n't perform that ceremony , because their <unk> would n't come off , when the door of the <name> kennel opened , and an enormous newfoundland dog put his head out .
" bow wow ? "
was his first question .
" when his majesty speaks to you , " the sentinel hastily whispered to <name> , " you should prick up your ears ! "
<name> looked doubtfully at <name> .
" i 'd rather not , please , " he said .
" it would hurt . "
[ image ... the <unk> ] " it does n't hurt a bit ! "
the sentinel said with some indignation .
" look !
it 's like this ! "
and he pricked up his ears like two railway signals .
<name> gently explained matters .
" i 'm afraid we ca'n't manage it , " she said in a low voice .
" i 'm very sorry : but our ears have n't got the right  " she wanted to say " machinery " in <unk> : but she had forgotten the word , and could only think of " steam-engine . "
the sentinel repeated <name> 's explanation to the king .
" ca n't prick up their ears without a steam-engine ! "
his majesty exclaimed .
" they must be curious creatures !
i must have a look at them ! "
and he came out of his kennel , and walked solemnly up to the children .
what was the amazement  nor to say the horror of the whole assembly , when <name> actually patted his majesty on the head , while <name> seized his long ears and pretended to tie them together under his <name> !
the sentinel groaned aloud : a beautiful greyhound who appeared to be one of the ladies in waiting  fainted away : and all the other courtiers hastily <name> back , and left plenty of room for the huge newfoundland to spring upon the audacious strangers , and tear them limb from limb .
only  he did n't .
on the contrary his majesty actually smiled so far as a dog can smile  and ( the other dogs could n't believe their eyes , but it was true , all the same ) his majesty wagged his tail !
" yah !
<unk> <unk> ! "
( that is " well !
i never ! " )
was the universal cry .
his majesty looked round him severely , and gave a slight growl , which produced instant silence .
" conduct my friends to the <unk> ! "
he said , laying such an emphasis on " my friends " that several of the dogs rolled over helplessly on their backs and began to lick <unk> feet .
a procession was formed , but i only ventured to follow as far as the door of the <unk> , so furious was the uproar of barking dogs within .
so i sat down by the king , who seemed to have gone to sleep , and waited till the children returned to say good-night , when his majesty got up and shook himself .
" time for bed ! "
he said with a sleepy yawn .
" the attendants <name> show you your room , " he added , aside , to <name> and <name> .
" bring lights ! "
and , with a dignified air , he held out his paw for them to kiss .
but the children were evidently not well practised in <unk> .
<name> simply stroked the great paw : <name> hugged it : the master of the ceremonies looked shocked .
all this time <unk> , in splendid livery , were running up with lighted candles : but , as fast as they put them upon the table , other waiters ran away with them , so that there never seemed to be one for me , though the master kept <unk> me with his elbow , and repeating " i ca'n't let you sleep here !
you 're not in bed , you know ! "
i made a great effort , and just succeeded in getting out the words " i know i 'm not .
i 'm in an arm-chair . "
" well , forty winks <name> do you no harm , " the master said , and left me .
i could scarcely hear his words : and no wonder : he was leaning over the side of a ship , that was miles away from the pier on which i stood .
the ship passed over the horizon and i sank back into the arm-chair .
the next thing i remember is that it was morning : breakfast was just over : <name> was lifting <name> down from a high chair , and saying to a spaniel , who was regarding them with a most benevolent smile , " yes , thank you we 've had a very nice breakfast .
have n't we , <name> ? "
there was too many bones in the  <name> began , but <name> frowned at him , and laid her finger on her lips , for , at this moment , the travelers were waited on by a very dignified officer , the <unk> , whose duty it was , first to conduct them to the king to bid him farewell and then to escort them to the boundary of <unk> .
the great newfoundland received them most <unk> but instead of saying " good-bye he startled the <unk> into giving three savage growls , by announcing that he would escort them himself .
it is a most unusual proceeding , your majesty !
the <unk> exclaimed , almost choking with vexation at being set aside , for he had put on his best <unk> , made entirely of <unk> , for the occasion .
" i shall escort them myself , " his majesty repeated , gently but firmly , laying aside the <name> robes , and changing his crown for a small coronet , " and you may stay at home . "
" i are glad ! "
<name> whispered to <name> , when they had got well out of hearing .
" he were so <unk> cross ! "
and he not only patted their <name> escort , but even hugged him round the neck in the exuberance of his delight .
his majesty calmly wagged the <name> tail .
" it 's quite a relief , " he said , " getting away from that palace now and then !
<name> dogs have a dull life of it , i can tell you !
would you mind " ( this to <name> , in a low voice , and looking a little shy and embarrassed ) " would you mind the trouble of just throwing that stick for me to fetch ? "
<name> was too much astonished to do anything for a moment : it sounded such a monstrous impossibility that a king should wish to run after a stick .
but <name> was equal to the occasion , and with a glad shout of " hi then !
fetch it , good doggie ! "
he hurled it over a clump of bushes .
the next moment the monarch of <unk> had bounded over the bushes , and picked up the stick , and came galloping back to the children with it in his mouth .
<name> took it from him with great decision .
" beg for it ! "
he insisted ; and his majesty begged .
" paw ! "
commanded <name> ; and his majesty gave his paw .
in short , the solemn ceremony of escorting the travelers to the boundaries of <unk> became one long <unk> game of play !
" but business is business ! "
the <unk> said at last .
" and i must go back to mine .
i could n't come any further , " he added , consulting a <unk> , which <name> on a chain round his neck , " not even if there were a cat insight ! "
they took an affectionate farewell of his majesty , and trudged on .
" that were a dear dog ! "
<name> exclaimed .
" has we to go far , <name> ?
i 's tired ! "
" not much further , darling ! "
<name> gently replied .
" do you see that shining , just beyond those trees ?
i 'm almost sure it 's the gate of fairyland !
i know it 's all golden  father told me so and so bright , so bright ! "
she went on dreamily .
" it <unk> ! "
said <name> , shading his eyes with one little hand , while the other clung tightly to <name> 's hand , as if he were <unk> at her strange manner .
for the child moved on as if walking in her sleep , her large eyes gazing into the far distance , and her breath coming and going in quick <unk> of eager delight .
i knew , by some mysterious mental light , that a great change was taking place in my sweet little friend ( for such i loved to think her ) and that she was passing from the condition of a mere outland sprite into the true <unk> .
upon <name> the change came later : but it was completed in both before they reached the golden gate , through which i knew it would be impossible for me to follow .
i could but stand outside , and take a last look at the two sweet children , ere they disappeared within , and the golden gate closed with a bang .
and with such a bang !
" it never <name> shut like any other <unk> , " <name> explained .
" there 's something wrong with the hinge .
however , here 's the cake and wine .
and you 've had your forty winks .
so you really must get off to bed , old man !
you 're fit for nothing else .
witness my hand , <name> forester , <unk> . "
by this time i was wide-awake again .
" not quite yet ! "
i pleaded .
" really i 'm not sleepy now .
and it is n't midnight yet . "
" well , i did want to say another word to you , " <name> replied in a <unk> tone , as he supplied me with the supper he had prescribed .
" only i thought you were too sleepy for it to-night . "
we took our midnight meal almost in silence ; for an unusual nervousness seemed to have seized on my old friend .
" what kind of a night is it ? "
he asked , rising and <unk> the <unk> , apparently to change the subject for a minute .
i followed him to the window , and we stood together , looking out , in silence .
" when i first spoke to you about  " <name> began , after a long and embarrassing silence , " that is , when we first talked about her  for i think it was you that introduced the subject  my own position in life forbade me to do more than worship her from a distance : and i was turning over plans for leaving this place finally , and settling somewhere out of all chance of meeting her again .
that seemed to be my only chance of usefulness in life .
would that have been wise ? "
i said .
" to leave yourself no <name> at all ? "
" there was no <name> to leave , " <name> firmly replied , though his eyes glittered with tears as he gazed upwards into the midnight sky , from which one solitary <name> , the glorious <unk> , ' blazed out in fitful splendour through the driving clouds .
" she was like that <name> to me  bright , beautiful , and pure , but out of reach , out of reach ! "
he <name> the curtains again , and we returned to our places by the fireside .
" what i wanted to tell you was this , " he resumed .
" i heard this evening from my solicitor .
i ca n't go into the details of the business , but the upshot is that my worldly wealth is much more than i thought , and i am ( or shall soon be ) in a position to offer marriage , without <unk> , to any <name> , even if she brought nothing .
i doubt if there would be anything on her side : the <name> is poor , i believe .
but i should have enough for both , even if health failed . "
" i wish you all happiness in your married life ! "
i cried .
" shall you speak to the <name> to-morrow ? "
" not yet awhile , " said <name> .
" he is very friendly , but i dare not think he means more than that , as yet .
and as for  as for <name> <name> , try as i may , i can not read her feelings towards me .
if there is love , she is hiding it !
no , i must wait , i must wait ! "
i did not like to press any further advice on my friend , whose judgment , i felt , was so much more sober and thoughtful than my own ; and we parted without more words on the subject that had now absorbed his thoughts , nay , his very life .
the next morning a letter from my solicitor arrived , summoning me to town on important business .
chapter 14 .
<unk> .
for a full month the business , for which i had returned to london , detained me there : and even then it was only the urgent advice of my physician that induced me to leave it unfinished and pay another visit to <unk> .
<name> had written once or twice during the month ; but in none of his letters was there any mention of <name> <name> .
still , i did not <unk> ill from his silence : to me it looked like the natural action of a lover , who , even while his heart was singing " she is mine !
" , would fear to paint his happiness in the cold phrases of a written letter , but would wait to tell it by word of mouth .
" yes , " i thought , " i am to hear his song of triumph from his own lips ! "
the night i arrived we had much to say on other matters : and , tired with the journey , i went to bed early , leaving the happy secret still untold .
next day , however , as we chatted on over the remains of luncheon , i ventured to put the momentous question .
" well , old friend , you have told me nothing of <name> <name>  nor when the happy day is to be ? "
" the happy day , " <name> said , looking unexpectedly grave , " is yet in the dim future .
we need to know  or , rather , she needs to know me better .
i know her sweet nature , thoroughly , by this time .
but i dare not speak till i am sure that my love is returned . "
" do n't wait too long ! "
i said gaily .
" faint heart never won fair <name> ! "
" it is <unk> heart , ' perhaps .
but really i dare not speak just yet . "
" but meanwhile , " i pleaded , " you are running a risk that perhaps you have not thought of .
some other man  " " no , " said <name> firmly .
" she is <unk> : i am sure of that .
yet , if she loves another better than me , so be it !
i <name> not spoil her happiness .
the secret shall die with me .
but she is my first  and my only love ! "
" that is all very beautiful sentiment , " i said , " but it is not practical .
it is not like you .
he either fears his fate too much , or his desert is small , who dares not put it to the touch , to win or lose it all . "
" i dare not ask the question whether there is another ! "
he said passionately .
" it would break my heart to know it ! "
" yet is it wise to leave it <unk> ?
you must not waste your life upon an 'if ' ! "
" i tell you i dare not !
' , " may i find it out for you ? "
i asked , with the freedom of an old friend .
" no , no ! "
he replied with a pained look .
" i entreat you to say nothing .
let it wait . "
" as you please , " i said : and judged it best to say no more just then .
" but this evening , " i thought , " i <name> call on the <name> .
i may be able to see how the land lies , without so much as saying a word ! "
it was a very hot afternoon  too hot to go for a walk or do anything  or else it would n't have happened , i believe .
in the first place , i want to know  dear child who reads this !  why fairies should always be teaching us to do our duty , and lecturing us when we go wrong , and we should never teach them anything ?
you can't mean to say that fairies are never greedy , or selfish , or cross , or deceitful , because that would be nonsense , you know .
well then , don't you think they might be all the better for a little lecturing and punishing now and then ?
i really do n't see why it should n't be tried , and i 'm almost sure that , if you could only catch a <name> , and put it in the corner , and give it nothing but bread and water for a day or two , you 'd find it quite an improved character  it would take down its conceit a little , at all events .
the next question is , what is the best time for seeing fairies ?
i believe i can tell you all about that .
the first rule is , that it must be a very hot day  that we may consider as settled : and you must be just a little sleepy  but not too sleepy to keep your eyes open , mind .
well , and you ought to feel a little  what one may call " <unk> "  the scotch call it " <unk> , " and perhaps that 's a prettier word ; if you do n't know what it means , i 'm afraid i can hardly explain it ; you must wait till you meet a <name> , and then you 'll know .
and the last rule is , that the crickets should not be chirping .
i ca n't stop to explain that : you must take it on trust for the present .
so , if all these things happen together , you have a good chance of seeing a <name>  or at least a much better chance than if they did n't .
the first thing i noticed , as i went lazily along through an open place in the wood , was a large beetle lying struggling on its back , and i went down upon one knee to help the poor thing to its feet again .
in some things , you know , you ca'n't be quite sure what an insect would like : for instance , i never could quite settle , supposing i were a moth , whether i would rather be kept out of the candle , or be allowed to fly straight in and get burnt  or again , supposing i were a spider , i 'm not sure if i should be quite pleased to have my web torn down , and the fly let loose  but i feel quite certain that , if i were a beetle and had rolled over on my back , i should always be glad to be helped up again .
so , as i was saying , i had gone down upon one knee , and was just reaching out a little stick to turn the beetle over , when i saw a sight that made me draw back hastily and hold my breath , for fear of making any noise and frightening the little creature a way .
not that she looked as if she would be easily frightened : she seemed so good and gentle that i 'm sure she would never expect that any one could wish to hurt her .
she was only a few inches high , and was dressed in green , so that you really would hardly have noticed her among the long grass ; and she was so delicate and graceful that she quite seemed to belong to the place , almost as if she were one of the flowers .
i may tell you , besides , that she had no wings ( i do n't believe in fairies with wings ) , and that she had quantities of long brown hair and large <name> brown eyes , and then i shall have done all i can to give you an idea of her .
[ image ... <unk> ] <name> ( i found out her name afterwards ) had knelt down , just as i was doing , to help the beetle ; but it needed more than a little stick for her to get it on its legs again ; it was as much as she could do , with both arms , to roll the heavy thing over ; and all the while she was talking to it , half scolding and half comforting , as a nurse might do with a child that had fallen down .
" there , there !
you need n't cry so much about it .
you 're not killed yet  though if you were , you could n't cry , you know , and so it 's a general rule against crying , my dear !
and how did you come to tumble over ?
but i can see well enough how it was  i need n't ask you that  walking over <unk> with your <name> in the air , as usual .
of course if you go among <unk> like that , you must expect to tumble .
you should look . "
the beetle murmured something that sounded like " i did look , " and <name> went on again .
" but i know you did n't !
you never do !
you always walk with your <name> up  you 're so dreadfully conceited .
well , let 's see how many legs are broken this time .
why , none of them , i declare !
and what 's the good of having six legs , my dear , if you can only kick them all about in the air when you tumble ?
legs are meant to walk with , you know .
now don't begin putting out your wings yet ; i 've more to say .
go to the frog that lives behind that <unk>  give him my compliments  <unk> compliments  can you say compliments ' ? "
the beetle tried and , i suppose , succeeded .
" yes , that 's right .
and tell him he 's to give you some of that salve i left with him yesterday .
and you 'd better get him to rub it in for you .
he 's got rather cold hands , but you must n't mind that . "
i think the beetle must have shuddered at this idea , for <name> went on in a graver tone .
" now you need n't pretend to be so particular as all that , as if you were too grand to be rubbed by a frog .
the fact is , you ought to be very much obliged to him .
suppose you could get nobody but a toad to do it , how would you like that ? "
there was a little pause , and then <name> added " now you may go .
be a good beetle , and do n't keep your <name> in the air . "
and then began one of those performances of humming , and whizzing , and restless banging about , such as a beetle <unk> in when it has decided on flying , but has n't quite made up its mind which way to go .
at last , in one of its awkward zigzags , it managed to fly right into my face , and , by the time i had recovered from the shock , the little <name> was gone .
i looked about in all directions for the little creature , but there was no trace of her  and my <unk> ' feeling was quite gone off , and the crickets were chirping again merrily  so i knew she was really gone .
and now i 've got time to tell you the rule about the crickets .
they always leave off chirping when a <name> goes by  because a <name> 's a kind of <name> over them , i suppose  at all events it 's a much grander thing than a cricket  so whenever you 're walking out , and the crickets suddenly leave off chirping , you may be sure that they see a <name> .
i walked on sadly enough , you may be sure .
however , i comforted myself with thinking " it 's been a very wonderful afternoon , so far .
i 'll just go quietly on and look about me , and i should n't wonder if i were to come across another <name> somewhere . "
peering about in this way , i happened to notice a plant with rounded leaves , and with queer little holes cut in the middle of several of them .
" ah , the <unk> <name> ! "
i carelessly remarked  you know i am very learned in natural history ( for instance , i can always tell kittens from chickens at one glance )  and i was passing on , when a sudden thought made me stoop down and examine the leaves .
then a little thrill of delight ran through me  for i noticed that the holes were all arranged so as to form letters ; there were three leaves side by side , with " b , " " r , " and " u " marked on them , and after some search i found two more , which contained an " n " and an " o . "
and then , all in a moment , a flash of inner light seemed to <unk> a part of my life that had all but faded into oblivion  the strange visions i had experienced during my journey to <unk> : and with a thrill of delight i thought " those visions are destined to be linked with my waking life ! "
by this time the <unk> ' feeling had come back again , and i suddenly observed that no crickets were chirping ; so i felt quite sure that " <name> was somewhere very near .
and so indeed he was  so near that i had very nearly walked over him without seeing him ; which would have been dreadful , always supposing that fairies can be walked over my own belief is that they are something of the nature of <unk> : and there 's no walking over them .
think of any pretty little boy you know , with <name> cheeks , large dark eyes , and tangled brown hair , and then fancy him made small enough to go comfortably into a <unk> , and you 'll have a very fair idea of him .
" what 's your name , little one ? "
i began , in as soft a voice as i could manage .
and , by the way , why is it we always begin by asking little children their names ?
is it because we fancy a name <name> help to make them a little bigger ?
you never thought of as king a real large man his name , now , did you ?
but , however that may be , i felt it quite necessary to know his name ; so , as he did n't answer my question , i asked it again a little louder .
" what 's your name , my little man ? "
" what 's <unk> ? "
he said , without looking up .
i told him my name quite gently , for he was much too small to be angry with .
" duke of anything ? "
he asked , just looking at me for a moment , and then going on with his work .
" not duke at all , " i said , a little ashamed of having to confess it .
" oo 're big enough to be two dukes , " said the little creature .
" i suppose oo 're sir something , then ? "
" no , " i said , feeling more and more ashamed .
" i have n't got any title . "
the <name> seemed to think that in that case i really was n't worth the trouble of talking to , for he quietly went on digging , and tearing the flowers to pieces .
after a few minutes i tried again .
" please tell me what your name is . "
" <name> , " the little fellow answered , very readily .
" why did n't oo say 'please ' before ? "
" that 's something like what we used to be taught in the nursery , " i thought to myself , looking back through the long years ( about a hundred of them , since you ask the question ) , to the time when i was a little child .
and here an idea came into my head , and i asked him " are n't you one of the fairies that teach children to be good ? "
" well , we have to do that sometimes , " said <name> , " and a dreadful bother it is . "
as he said this , he savagely tore a heartsease in two , and trampled on the pieces .
" what are you doing there , <name> ? "
i said .
" spoiling <name> 's garden , " was all the answer <name> would give at first .
but , as he went on tearing up the flowers , he muttered to himself " the nasty cross thing would n't let me go and play this morning ,  said i must finish my lessons first  lessons , indeed !
i 'll vex her finely , though ! "
" oh , <name> , you should n't do that ! "
i cried .
" do n't you know that 's revenge ?
and revenge is a wicked , cruel , dangerous thing ! "
" <unk> ? "
said <name> .
" what a funny word !
i suppose oo call it cruel and dangerous 'cause , if oo <unk> too far and <unk> in , oo 'd get drownded . "
" no , not <unk> , " i explained : " revenge " ( saying the word very slowly ) .
but i could n't help thinking that <name> 's explanation did very well for either word .
" oh ! "
said <name> , opening his eyes very wide , but without trying to repeat the word .
" come !
try and pronounce it , <name> ! "
i said , cheerfully .
" <unk> , <unk> . "
but <name> only tossed his little head , and said he could n't ; that his mouth was n't the right shape for words of that kind .
and the more i laughed , the more sulky the little fellow got about it .
" well , never mind , my little man ! "
i said .
" shall i help you with that job ? "
" yes , please , " <name> said , quite pacified .
" only i wiss i could think of <unk> to vex her more than this .
oo do n't know how hard it is to make her angry ! "
" now listen to me , <name> , and i 'll teach you quite a splendid kind of revenge ! "
" <unk> that 'll vex her finely ? "
he asked with gleaming eyes .
" something that <name> vex her finely .
first , we 'll get up all the weeds in her garden .
see , there are a good many at this end quite hiding the flowers . "
" but that wo n't vex her ! "
said <name> .
" after that , " i said , without noticing the remark , " we 'll water this highest bed  up here .
you see it 's getting quite dry and <name> . "
<name> looked at me <unk> , but he said nothing this time .
" then after that , " i went on , " the walks want sweeping a bit ; and i think you might cut down that tall <unk>  it 's so close to the garden that it 's quite in the way  " " what is oo talking about ? "
<name> impatiently interrupted me .
" all that wo n't vex her a bit ! "
" wo n't it ? "
i said , innocently .
" then , after that , suppose we put in some of these coloured pebbles  just to <name> the divisions between the different kinds of flowers , you know .
that 'll have a very pretty effect . "
<name> turned round and had another good stare at me .
at last there came an odd little twinkle into his eyes , and he said , with quite a new meaning in his voice , " that 'll do nicely .
let 's put 'em in rows  all the red together , and all the blue <unk> "
" that 'll do <unk> , " i said ; " and then  what kind of flowers does <name> like best ? "
<name> had to put his thumb in his mouth and consider a little before he could answer .
" violets , " he said , at last .
" there 's a beautiful bed of violets down by the <name>  " " oh , let 's fetch 'em ! "
cried <name> , giving a little skip into the air .
" here !
catch hold of my hand , and i 'll help oo along .
the grass is rather thick down that way . "
i could n't help laughing at his having so entirely forgotten what a big creature he was talking to .
" no , not yet , <name> , " i said : " we must consider what 's the right thing to do first .
you see we 've got quite a business before us . "
" yes , let 's consider , " said <name> , putting his thumb into his mouth again , and sitting down upon a dead mouse .
" what do you keep that mouse for ? "
i said .
" you should either bury it , or else throw it into the <name> . "
" why , it 's to measure with ! "
cried <name> .
" how ever would oo do a garden without one ?
we make each bed three <unk> and a half long , and two <unk> wide . "
i stopped him , as he was dragging it off by the tail to show me how it was used , for i was half afraid the <unk> ' feeling might go off before we had finished the garden , and in that case i should see no more of him or <name> .
" i think the best way <name> be for you to weed the beds , while i sort out these pebbles , ready to <name> the walks with . "
" that 's it ! "
cried <name> .
" and i 'll tell oo about the caterpillars while we work . "
" ah , let 's hear about the caterpillars , " i said , as i <name> the pebbles together into a heap and began dividing them into colours .
and <name> went on in a low , rapid tone , more as if he were talking to himself .
" yesterday i saw two little caterpillars , when i was sitting by the <name> , just where oo go into the wood .
they were quite green , and they had yellow eyes , and they did n't see me .
and one of them had got a moth 's wing to <name>  a great brown moth 's wing , oo know , all dry , with feathers .
so he could n't want it to eat , i should think  perhaps he meant to make a cloak for the <name> ? "
" perhaps , " i said , for <name> had twisted up the last word into a sort of question , and was looking at me for an answer .
one word was quite enough for the little fellow , and he went on merrily .
" well , and so he did n't want the other caterpillar to see the moth 's wing , oo know  so what must he do but try to <name> it with all his left legs , and he tried to walk on the other set .
of course he <unk> over after that . "
" after what ? "
i said , catching at the last word , for , to tell the truth , i had n't been attending much .
" he <unk> over , " <name> repeated , very gravely , " and if oo ever saw a caterpillar <unk> over , oo 'd know it 's a <unk> serious thing , and not sit grinning like that  and i sha'n't tell oo no more ! "
" indeed and indeed , <name> , i did n't mean to grin .
see , i 'm quite grave again now . "
but <name> only folded his arms , and said " do n't tell me .
i see a little twinkle in one of oor eyes  just like the moon . "
" why do you think i 'm like the moon , <name> ? "
i asked .
" oor face is large and round like the moon , " <name> answered , looking at me thoughtfully .
" it <unk> n't shine quite so bright  but it 's more cleaner . "
i could n't help smiling at this .
" you know i sometimes wash my face , <name> .
the moon never does that . "
" oh , <unk> n't she though ! "
cried <name> ; and he <unk> forwards and added in a solemn whisper , " the moon 's face gets <unk> and <unk> every night , till it 's black all across .
and then , when it 's dirty all over  so  " ( he passed his hand across his own <name> cheeks as he spoke ) " then she washes it . "
" then it 's all clean again , is n't it ? "
" not all in a moment , " said <name> .
" what a deal of teaching oo wants !
she washes it little by little  only she begins at the other edge , oo know . "
by this time he was sitting quietly on the dead mouse with his arms folded , and the <unk> was n't getting on a bit : so i had to say " work first , pleasure afterwards : no more talking till that bed 's finished . "
chapter 15 .
<name> 's revenge .
after that we had a few minutes of silence , while i sorted out the pebbles , and amused myself with watching <name> 's plan of gardening .
it was quite a new plan to me : he always measured each bed before he <unk> it , as if he was afraid the <unk> would make it shrink ; and once , when it came out longer than he wished , he set to work to thump the mouse with his little fist , crying out " there now !
it 's all gone wrong again !
why do n't oo keep oor tail straight when i tell oo ! "
" i 'll tell you what i 'll do , " <name> said in a <unk> , as we worked .
" oo like fairies , do n't oo ? "
" yes , " i said : " of course i do , or i should n't have come here .
i should have gone to some place where there are no fairies . "
<name> laughed contemptuously .
" why , oo might as well say oo 'd go to some place where there was n't any air  supposing oo did n't like air ! "
this was a rather difficult idea to grasp .
i tried a change of subject .
" you 're nearly the first <name> i ever saw .
have you ever seen any people besides me ? "
" plenty ! "
said <name> .
" we <unk> when we walk in the road . "
" but they ca'n't see you .
how is it they never tread on you ? "
" ca'n't tread on us , " said <name> , looking amused at my ignorance .
" why , suppose oo 're walking , here  so  " ( making little marks on the ground ) " and suppose there 's a <name>  that 's me  walking here .
very well then , oo put one foot here , and one foot here , so oo <unk> n't tread on the <name> . "
this was all very well as an explanation , but it did n't convince me .
" why should n't i put one foot on the <name> ? "
i asked .
" i do n't know why , " the little fellow said in a thoughtful tone .
" but i know oo would n't .
nobody never walked on the top of a <name> .
now i 'll tell oo what i 'll do , as oo 're so fond of fairies .
i 'll get oo an invitation to the <unk> 's dinner-party .
i know one of the <unk> . "
i could n't help laughing at this idea .
" do the waiters invite the guests ? "
i asked .
" oh , not to sit down ! "
<name> said .
" but to wait at table .
oo 'd like that , would n't oo ?
to hand about plates , and so on . "
" well , but that 's not so nice as sitting at the table , is it ? "
" of course it is n't , " <name> said , in a tone as if he rather pitied my ignorance ; " but if oo 're not even sir anything , oo ca'n't expect to be allowed to sit at the table , oo know . "
i said , as meekly as i could , that i did n't expect it , but it was the only way of going to a dinner-party that i really enjoyed .
and <name> tossed his head , and said , in a rather offended tone that i might do as i pleased  there were many he knew that would give their ears to go .
" have you ever been yourself , <name> ? "
" they invited me once , last week , " <name> said , very gravely .
" it was to wash up the <unk>  no , the <unk> i mean that was grand enough .
and i waited at table .
and i did n't hardly make only one mistake . "
" what was it ? "
i said .
" you need n't mind telling me . "
" only bringing scissors to cut the beef with , " <name> said carelessly .
" but the grandest thing of all was , i fetched the king a glass of cider ! "
" that was grand ! "
i said , biting my lip to keep myself from laughing .
" was n't it ? "
said <name> , very earnestly .
" oo know it is n't every one that 's had such an honour as that ! "
this set me thinking of the various queer things we call " an honour " in this world , but which , after all , have n't a bit more honour in them than what <name> enjoyed , when he took the king a glass of cider .
i do n't know how long i might not have dreamed on in this way , if <name> had n't suddenly roused me .
" oh , come here quick ! "
he cried , in a state of the wildest excitement .
" catch hold of his other horn !
i ca'n't hold him more than a minute ! "
he was struggling desperately with a great snail , clinging to one of its horns , and nearly breaking his poor little back in his efforts to drag it over a blade of grass .
i saw we should have no more gardening if i let this sort of thing go on , so i quietly took the snail away , and put it on a bank where he could n't reach it .
" we 'll hunt it afterwards , <name> , " i said , " if you really want to catch it .
but what 's the use of it when you 've got it ? "
" what 's the use of a fox when oo 've got it ? "
said <name> .
" i know oo big things hunt foxes . "
i tried to think of some good reason why " big things " should hunt foxes , and he should not hunt <unk> , but none came into my head : so i said at last , " well , i suppose one 's as good as the other .
i 'll go <unk> myself some day . "
" i should think oo would n't be so silly , " said <name> , " as to go <unk> by <unk> .
why , oo 'd never get the snail along , if oo had n't somebody to hold on to his other horn ! "
" of course i sha'n't go alone , " i said , quite gravely .
" by the way , is that the best kind to hunt , or do you recommend the ones without shells ? "
" oh , no , we never hunt the ones without shells , " <name> said , with a little shudder at the thought of it .
" they 're always so cross about it ; and then , if oo tumbles over them , they 're ever so sticky ! "
by this time we had nearly finished the garden .
i had fetched some violets , and <name> was just helping me to put in the last , when he suddenly stopped and said " i 'm tired . "
" rest then , " i said : " i can go on without you , quite well . "
<name> needed no second invitation : he at once began arranging the dead mouse as a kind of sofa .
" and i 'll sing oo a little song , " he said , as he rolled it about .
" do , " said i : " i like songs very much . "
" which song <name> oo choose ? "
<name> said , as he dragged the mouse into a place where he could get a good view of me .
" <unk> , ting , ting ' is the nicest . "
there was no resisting such a strong hint as this : however , i pretended to think about it for a moment , and then said " well , i like <unk> , ting , ting , ' best of all . "
[ image ... <name> 's revenge ] " that shows oo 're a good judge of music , " <name> said , with a pleased look .
" how many <unk> would oo like ? "
and he put his thumb into his mouth to help me to consider .
as there was only one cluster of <unk> within easy reach , i said very gravely that i thought one would do this time , and i picked it and gave it to him .
<name> ran his hand once or twice up and down the flowers , like a musician trying an instrument , producing a most delicious delicate tinkling as he did so .
i had never heard <unk> before  i do n't think one can , unless one 's in the <unk> state and i do n't know quite how to give you an idea of what it was like , except by saying that it sounded like a peal of bells a thousand miles off .
when he had satisfied himself that the flowers were in tune , he seated himself on the dead mouse ( he never seemed really comfortable anywhere else ) , and , looking up at me with a <name> twinkle in his eyes , he began .
by the way , the tune was rather a curious one , and you might like to try it for yourself , so here are the notes .
[ image ... music for <unk> ] " rise , oh , rise !
the daylight dies : the owls are hooting , ting , ting , ting !
wake , oh , wake !
beside the lake the <unk> are <unk> , ting , ting , ting !
welcoming our <name> king , we sing , sing , sing . "
he sang the first four lines briskly and merrily , making the <unk> chime in time with the music ; but the last two he sang quite slowly and gently , and merely waved the flowers backwards and forwards .
then he left off to explain .
" the <unk> is <unk> , and he lives across the lake  and sometimes he comes in a little boat  and we go and meet him and then we sing this song , you know . "
" and then you go and dine with him ? "
i said , mischievously .
" oo should n't talk , " <name> hastily said : " it <unk> the song so . "
i said i would n't do it again .
" i never talk myself when i 'm singing , " he went on very gravely : " so oo should n't either . "
then he tuned the <unk> once more , and sang :   " hear , oh , hear !
from far and near the music stealing , ting , ting , ting !
<name> belts <unk> the <unk> are merrily <unk> , ting , ting , ting !
welcoming our <name> king , we ring , ring , ring .
" see , oh , see !
on every tree what lamps are shining , ting , ting , ting !
they are eyes of fiery flies to light our dining , ting , ting , ting !
welcoming our <name> king they swing , swing , swing .
" haste , oh haste , to take and taste the dainties waiting , ting , ting , ting !
<unk> is stored  " " hush , <name> ! "
i interrupted in a warning whisper .
" she 's coming ! "
<name> checked his song , and , as she slowly made her way through the long grass , he suddenly rushed out headlong at her like a little bull , shouting " look the other way !
look the other way ! "
" which way ? "
<name> asked , in rather a frightened tone , as she looked round in all directions to see where the danger could be .
" that way ! "
said <name> , carefully turning her round with her face to the wood .
" now , walk backwards walk gently  do n't be frightened : oo sha'n't trip ! "
but <name> did trip notwithstanding : in fact he led her , in his hurry , across so many little sticks and stones , that it was really a wonder the poor child could keep on her feet at all .
but he was far too much excited to think of what he was doing .
i silently pointed out to <name> the best place to lead her to , so as to get a view of the whole garden at once : it was a little rising ground , about the height of a potato ; and , when they had mounted it , i <name> back into the shade , that <name> might n't see me .
i heard <name> cry out triumphantly " now oo may look ! "
and then followed a clapping of hands , but it was all done by <name> himself .
<name> : was silent  she only stood and gazed with her hands clasped together , and i was half afraid she did n't like it after all .
<name> too was watching her anxiously , and when she jumped down off the mound , and began wandering up and down the little walks , he cautiously followed her about , evidently anxious that she should form her own opinion of it all , without any hint from him .
and when at last she <name> a long breath , and gave her verdict  in a hurried whisper , and without the slightest regard to grammar  " it 's the loveliest thing as i never saw in all my life before ! "
the little fellow looked as well pleased as if it had been given by all the judges and <unk> in england put together .
" and did you really do it all by yourself , <name> ? "
said <name> .
" and all for me ? "
" i was helped a bit , " <name> began , with a <name> little laugh at her surprise .
" we 've been at it all the afternoon  i thought oo 'd like  " and here the poor little fellow 's lip began to quiver , and all in a moment he burst out crying , and running up to <name> he flung his arms passionately round her neck , and hid his face on her shoulder .
there was a little quiver in <name> 's voice too , as she whispered " why , what 's the matter , darling ? "
and tried to lift up his head and kiss him .
but <name> only clung to her , sobbing , and would n't be comforted till he had confessed .
" i tried  to spoil oor garden  first  but i 'll never  never  " and then came another burst of tears , which drowned the rest of the sentence .
at last he got out the words " i liked  putting in the flowers  for oo , <name>  and i never was so happy before . "
and the <name> little face came up at last to be kissed , all wet with tears as it was .
<name> was crying too by this time , and she said nothing but " <name> , dear ! "
and " i never was so happy before , " though why these two children who had never been so happy before should both be crying was a mystery to me .
i felt very happy too , but of course i did n't cry : " big things " never do , you know we leave all that to the fairies .
only i think it must have been raining a little just then , for i found a drop or two on my cheeks .
after that they went through the whole garden again , flower by flower , as if it were a long sentence they were spelling out , with kisses for <unk> , and a great hug by way of a <unk> when they got to the end .
" <unk> oo know , that was my <unk> , <name> ? "
<name> solemnly began .
<name> laughed merrily .
" what do you mean ? "
she said .
and she pushed back her heavy brown hair with both hands , and looked at him with dancing eyes in which the big <unk> were still glittering .
<name> <name> in a long breath , and made up his mouth for a great effort .
" i mean revenge , " he said : " now oo <unk> . "
and he looked so happy and proud at having said the word right at last , that i quite envied him .
i rather think <name> did n't " <unk> " at all ; but she gave him a little kiss on each cheek , which seemed to do just as well .
so they wandered off lovingly together , in among the <unk> , each with an arm twined round the other , whispering and laughing as they went , and never so much as once looked back at poor me .
yes , once , just before i quite lost sight of them , <name> half turned his head , and nodded me a saucy little good-bye over one shoulder .
and that was all the thanks i got for my trouble .
the very last thing i saw of them was this  <name> was stooping down with her arms round <name> 's neck , and saying <unk> in his ear , " do you know , <name> , i 've quite forgotten that hard word .
do say it once more .
come !
only this once , dear ! "
but <name> would n't try it again .
chapter 16 .
a changed crocodile .
the marvellous  the mysterious  had quite passed out of my life for the moment : and the <unk> reigned supreme .
i turned in the direction of the <name> 's house , as it was now 'the <unk> hour ' of five , and i knew i should find them ready for a cup of tea and a quiet chat .
<name> <name> and her father gave me a delightfully warm welcome .
they were not of the folk we meet in fashionable drawing-rooms who conceal all such feelings as they may chance to possess beneath the impenetrable mask of a conventional <unk> .
'the man with the iron mask ' was , no doubt , a rarity and a <name> in his own age : in modern london no one would turn his head to give him a second look !
no , these were real people .
when they looked pleased , it meant that they were pleased : and when <name> <name> said , with a bright smile , " i 'm very glad to see you again !
" , i knew that it was true .
still i did not venture to disobey the injunctions  crazy as i felt them to be  of the <unk> young doctor , by so much as alluding to his existence : and it was only after they had given me full details of a projected picnic , to which they invited me , that <name> <name> exclaimed , almost as an <unk> , " and do , if you can , bring doctor forester with you !
i 'm sure a day in the country would do him good .
i 'm afraid he studies too much  " it was 'on the tip of my tongue ' to quote the words " his only books are woman 's looks ! "
but i checked myself just in time  with something of the feeling of one who has crossed a street , and has been all but run over by a passing <unk> . '
"  and i think he has too lonely a life , " she went on , with a gentle earnestness that left no room whatever to suspect a double meaning .
" do get him to come !
and do n't forget the day , tuesday week .
we can drive you over .
it would be a pity to go by rail   there is so much pretty scenery on the road .
and our open carriage just holds four . "
" oh , i 'll persuade him to come ! "
i said with confidence  thinking " it would take all my powers of persuasion to keep him away ! "
the picnic was to take place in ten days : and though <name> readily accepted the invitation i brought him , nothing that i could say would induce him to call  either with me or without me on the <name> and his daughter in the meanwhile .
no : he feared to " wear out his welcome , " he said : they had " seen enough of him for one while " : and , when at last the day for the expedition arrived , he was so <unk> nervous and uneasy that i thought it best so to arrange our plans that we should go separately to the house  my intention being to arrive some time after him , so as to give him time to get over a meeting .
with this object i purposely made a considerable circuit on my way to the hall ( as we called the <name> 's house ) : " and if i could only manage to lose my way a bit , " i thought to myself , " that would suit me <unk> ! "
in this i succeeded better , and sooner , than i had ventured to <name> for .
the path through the wood had been made familiar to me , by many a solitary stroll , in my former visit to <unk> ; and how i could have so suddenly and so entirely lost it  even though i was so engrossed in thinking of <name> and his <unk> that i heeded little else  was a mystery to me .
" and this open place , " i said to myself , " seems to have some memory about it i can not distinctly recall  surely it is the very spot where i saw those <unk> !
but i <name> there are no snakes about ! "
i mused aloud , taking my seat on a fallen tree .
" i certainly do not like snakes  and i do n't suppose <name> likes them , either ! "
" no , he does n't like them ! "
said a demure little voice at my side .
" he 's not afraid of them , you know .
but he does n't like them .
he says they 're too <unk> ! "
words fail me to describe the beauty of the little group  couched on a patch of moss , on the trunk of the fallen tree , that met my eager gaze : <name> reclining with her elbow buried in the moss , and her <name> cheek resting in the palm of her hand , and <name> stretched at her feet with his head in her lap .
[ image ... fairies resting ] " too <unk> ? "
was all i could say in so sudden an emergency .
" i 'm not <unk> , " <name> said , carelessly : " but i do like straight animals best  " " but you like a dog when it wags its tail , <name> interrupted .
" you know you do , <name> ! "
" but there 's more of a dog , is n't there , mister sir ? "
<name> appealed to me .
" you would n't like to have a dog if it had n't got nuffin but a head and a tail ? "
i admitted that a dog of that kind would be uninteresting .
" there is n't such a dog as that , " <name> thoughtfully remarked .
" but there would be , " cried <name> , " if the professor shortened it up for us ! "
" shortened it up ? "
i said .
" that 's something new .
how does he do it ? "
" he 's got a curious machine " <name> was beginning to explain .
" a <unk> curious machine , " <name> broke in , not at all willing to have the story thus taken out of his mouth , " and if oo puts in  <unk>  at one end , oo know and he turns the handle  and it comes out at the <unk> end , oh , ever so short ! "
" as short as short !
" <name> echoed .
" and one day when we was in outland , oo know  before we came to fairyland me and <name> took him a big crocodile .
and he shortened it up for us .
and it did look so funny !
and it kept looking round , and saying <unk> is the rest of me got to ? '
and then its eyes looked unhappy  " " not both its eyes , " <name> interrupted .
" course not ! "
said the little fellow .
" only the eye that could n't see wherever the rest of it had got to .
but the eye that could see wherever  " " how short was the crocodile ? "
i asked , as the story was getting a little complicated .
" half as short again as when we caught it  so long , " said <name> , spreading out his arms to their full stretch .
i tried to calculate what this would come to , but it was too hard for me .
please make it out for me , dear child who reads this !
" but you did n't leave the poor thing so short as that , did you ? "
" well , no .
<name> and me took it back again and we got it stretched to  to  how much was it , <name> ? "
" two times and a half , and a little bit more , " said <name> .
" it would n't like that better than the other way , i 'm afraid ? "
" oh , but it did though ! "
<name> put in eagerly .
" it were proud of its new tail !
oo never saw a crocodile so proud !
why , it could go round and walk on the top of its tail , and along its back , all the way to its head ! "
[ image ... a changed crocodile ] not quite all the way , " said <name> .
" it could n't , you know . "
" ah , but it did , once ! "
<name> cried triumphantly .
" oo weren't looking  but i watched it .
and it walked on <unk> , so as it would n't wake itself , 'cause it thought it were asleep .
and it got both its paws on its tail .
and it walked and it walked all the way along its back .
and it walked and it walked on its forehead .
and it walked a <name> little way down its nose !
there now ! "
this was a good deal worse than the last puzzle .
please , dear child , help again !
" i do n't believe no crocodile never walked along its own forehead ! "
<name> cried , too much excited by the controversy to limit the number of her <unk> .
" oo do n't know the reason why it did it !
' , <name> scornfully retorted .
" it had a <unk> good reason .
i heerd it say 'why should n't i walk on my own forehead ? '
so a course it did , oo know ! "
" if that 's a good reason , <name> , " i said , " why should n't you get up that tree ? "
" shall , in a minute , " said <name> : " soon as we 've done talking .
only two peoples ca'n't talk <unk> <unk> , when one 's getting up a tree , and the other is n't ! "
it appeared to me that a conversation would scarcely be <unk> while trees were being climbed , even if both the <unk> ' were doing it : but it was evidently dangerous to oppose any theory of <name> 's ; so i thought it best to let the question drop , and to ask for an account of the machine that made things longer .
this time <name> was at a loss , and left it to <name> .
" it 's like a mangle , " she said : " if things are put in , they get <unk>  " " <unk> ! "
<name> interrupted .
" yes . "
<name> accepted the correction , but did not attempt to pronounce the word , which was evidently new to her .
" they get  like that  and they come out , oh , ever so long ! "
" once , " <name> began again , " <name> and me <unk>  " " wrote ! "
<name> whispered .
" well , we <unk> a <unk> , and the professor mangled it longer for us .
it were 'there was a little man , and he had a little gun , and the bullets  ' " " i know the rest , " i interrupted .
" but would you say it long i mean the way that it came out of the mangle ? "
" we 'll get the professor to sing it for you , " said <name> .
" it would spoil it to say it . "
" i would like to meet the professor , " i said .
" and i would like to take you all with me , to see some friends of mine , that live near here .
would you like to come ? "
" i do n't think the professor would like to come , " said <name> .
" he 's very shy .
but we 'd like it very much .
only we 'd better not come this size , you know . "
the difficulty had occurred to me already : and i had felt that perhaps there would be a slight awkwardness in introducing two such <name> friends into society .
" what size <name> you be ? "
i enquired .
" we 'd better come as  common children , " <name> thoughtfully replied .
" that 's the easiest size to manage . "
" could you come to-day ? "
i said , thinking " then we could have you at the picnic ! "
<name> considered a little .
" not to-day , " she replied .
" we haven't got the things ready .
we 'll come on  tuesday next , if you like .
and now , really <name> , you must come and do your lessons . "
" i wiss oo would n't say <unk> <name> ! ' "
the little fellow pleaded , with pouting lips that made him look prettier than ever .
" it always show 's there 's something horrid coming !
and i wo n't kiss you , if you 're so unkind . "
" ah , but you have kissed me ! "
<name> exclaimed in <name> triumph .
" well then , i 'll <unk> you ! "
and he threw his arms round her neck for this novel , but apparently not very painful , operation .
" it 's very like kissing ! "
<name> remarked , as soon as her lips were again free for speech .
" oo do n't know nuffin about it !
it were just the <unk> ! "
<name> replied with much severity , as he marched away .
<name> turned her laughing face to me .
" shall we come on tuesday ? "
she said .
" very well , " i said : " let it be tuesday next .
but where is the professor ?
did he come with you to fairyland ? "
" no , " said <name> .
" but he promised he 'd come and see us , some day .
he 's getting his lecture ready .
so he has to stay at home . "
" at home ? "
i said dreamily , not feeling quite sure what she had said .
" yes , sir .
his lordship and <name> <name> are at home .
please to walk this way . "
chapter 17 .
the three <unk> .
still more dreamily i found myself following this imperious voice into a room where the <name> , his daughter , and <name> , were seated .
" so you 're come at last ! "
said <name> <name> , in a tone of playful reproach .
" i was delayed , " i stammered .
though what it was that had delayed me i should have been puzzled to explain !
luckily no questions were asked .
the carriage was ordered round , the hamper , containing our contribution to the picnic , was duly stowed away , and we set forth .
there was no need for me to maintain the conversation .
<name> <name> and <name> were evidently on those most delightful of terms , where one has no need to check thought after thought , as it rises to the lips , with the fear 'this <name> not be appreciated  this <name> give ' offence  this <name> sound too serious  this <name> sound flippant ' : like very old friends , in fullest sympathy , their talk rippled on .
" why should n't we desert the picnic and go in some other direction ? "
she suddenly suggested .
" a party of four is surely <unk> ?
and as for food , our hamper  " " why should n't we ?
what a genuine <name> 's argument ! "
laughed <name> .
" a <name> never knows on which side the <unk> <unk>  the burden of proving  lies ! "
" do men always know ? "
she asked with a pretty assumption of meek <unk> .
" with one exception  the only one i can think of dr. <unk> , who has asked the senseless question 'why should i deprive my neighbour of his goods against his <name> ? '
fancy that as an argument for honesty !
his position seems to be <unk> only honest because i see no reason to steal . '
and the thief 's answer is of course complete and crushing .
'i deprive my neighbour of his goods because i want them myself .
and i do it against his <name> because there 's no chance of getting him to consent to it ! ' "
" i can give you one other exception , " i said : " an argument i heard only to-day  and not by a <name> .
'why should n't i walk on my own forehead ? ' "
" what a curious subject for speculation ! "
said <name> <name> , turning to me , with eyes brimming over with laughter .
" may we know who propounded the question ?
and did he walk on his own forehead ? "
" i ca'n't remember who it was that said it ! "
i faltered .
" nor where i heard it ! "
" whoever it was , i <name> we shall meet him at the picnic ! "
said <name> <name> .
" it 's a far more interesting question than 'is n't this a picturesque ruin ? '
are n't those <unk> lovely ? '
i shall have to answer those two questions ten times , at least , this afternoon ! "
" that 's one of the miseries of society ! "
said <name> .
" why ca'n't people let one enjoy the beauties of nature without having to say so every minute ?
why should life be one long catechism ? "
" it 's just as bad at a <unk> , " the <name> remarked .
" i went to the <unk> last may , with a conceited young artist : and he did torment me !
i would n't have minded his <unk> the pictures himself : but i had to agree with him  or else to argue the point , which would have been worse ! "
" it was <unk> criticism , of course ? "
said <name> .
" i do n't see the 'of course ' at all . "
" why , did you ever know a conceited man dare to praise a picture ?
the one thing he dreads ( next to not being noticed ) is to be proved <unk> !
if you once praise a picture , your character for infallibility hangs by a thread .
suppose it 's a <unk> , and you venture to say <unk> well . '
somebody measures it , and finds one of the proportions an eighth of an inch wrong .
you are disposed of as a critic !
'did you say he draws well ? '
your friends enquire sarcastically , while you <name> your head and blush .
no .
the only safe course , if any one says <unk> well , ' is to shrug your shoulders .
<unk> well ? '
you repeat thoughtfully .
<unk> well ?
humph ! '
that 's the way to become a great critic ! "
thus <unk> chatting , after a pleasant drive through a few miles of beautiful scenery , we reached the rendezvous  a ruined castle  where the rest of the <unk> were already assembled .
we spent an hour or two in sauntering about the ruins : gathering at last , by common consent , into a few random groups , seated on the side of a mound , which commanded a good view of the old castle and its surroundings .
the momentary silence , that ensued , was promptly taken possession of or , more correctly , taken into custody  by a voice ; a voice so smooth , so monotonous , so sonorous , that one felt , with a shudder , that any other conversation was <unk> , and that , unless some desperate remedy were adopted , we were fated to listen to a lecture , of which no man could foresee the end !
the speaker was a <unk> man , whose large , flat , pale face was bounded on the north by a fringe of hair , on the east and west by a fringe of <unk> , and on the south by a fringe of beard  the whole constituting a uniform halo of <unk> <unk> bristles .
his features were so entirely destitute of expression that i could not help saying to myself  helplessly , as if in the clutches of a <unk>  " they are only <unk> in : no final touches as yet ! "
and he had a way of ending every sentence with a sudden smile , which spread like a ripple over that vast blank surface , and was gone in a moment , leaving behind it such absolute solemnity that i felt impelled to murmur " it was not he : it was somebody else that smiled ! "
" do you observe ? "
( such was the phrase with which the wretch began each sentence ) " do you observe the way in which that broken arch , at the very top of the ruin , stands out against the clear sky ?
it is placed exactly right : and there is exactly enough of it .
a little more , or a little less , and all would be utterly spoiled ! "
[ image ... a lecture , on <name> ] " oh gifted architect ! "
murmured <name> , <unk> to all but <name> <name> and myself .
" foreseeing the exact effect his work would have , when in ruins , centuries after his death ! "
" and do you observe , where those trees slope down the hill , ( indicating them with a sweep of the hand , and with all the <unk> air of the man who has himself arranged the landscape ) , " how the mists rising from the river fill up exactly those intervals where we need <unk> , for artistic effect ?
here , in the foreground , a few clear touches are not amiss : but a <unk> without mist , you know !
it is simply barbarous !
yes , we need <unk> ! "
the orator looked so pointedly at me as he uttered these words , that i felt bound to reply , by murmuring something to the effect that i hardly felt the need myself  and that i enjoyed looking at a thing , better , when i could see it .
" quite so ! "
the great man sharply took me up .
" from your point of view , that is correctly put .
but for anyone who has a soul for <name> , such a view is preposterous .
nature is one thing .
<name> is another .
nature shows us the world as it is .
but <name>  as a latin author tells us  <name> , you know the words have escaped my memory " <unk> est <unk> <unk> , " <name> interposed with a delightful <unk> .
" quite so ! "
the orator replied with an air of relief .
" i thank you !
<unk> est <unk> <unk> but that is n't it . "
and , for a few peaceful moments , the orator brooded , <unk> , over the quotation .
the welcome opportunity was seized , and another voice struck into the silence .
" what a lovely old ruin it is ! "
cried a young <name> in spectacles , the very embodiment of the march of mind , looking at <name> <name> , as the proper recipient of all really original remarks .
" and do n't you admire those <unk> on the trees ?
i do , intensely ! "
<name> <name> shot a meaning glance at me ; but replied with admirable gravity .
" oh yes indeed , indeed !
so true ! "
" and is n't strange , said the young <name> , passing with startling suddenness from sentiment to science , " that the mere impact of certain coloured rays upon the retina should give us such exquisite pleasure ? "
" you have studied physiology , then ? "
a certain young doctor courteously enquired .
" oh , yes !
is n't it a sweet science ? "
<name> slightly smiled .
" it seems a paradox , does it not , " he went on , " that the image formed on the retina should be inverted ? "
" it is puzzling , " she candidly admitted .
" why is it we do not see things upside-down ? "
" you have never heard the theory , then , that the <name> also is inverted ? "
" no indeed !
what a beautiful fact !
but how is it proved ? "
" thus , " replied <name> , with all the gravity of ten professors rolled into one .
" what we call the <unk> of the <name> is really its base : and what we call its base is really its <unk> : it is simply a question of nomenclature . "
this last <unk> settled the matter .
" how truly delightful ! "
the fair scientist exclaimed with enthusiasm .
" i shall ask our physiological lecturer why he never gave us that exquisite theory ! "
" i 'd give something to be present when the question is asked ! "
<name> whispered to me , as , at a signal from <name> <name> , we moved on to where the <unk> had been collected , and devoted ourselves to the more substantial business of the day .
we <unk> ' on ourselves , as the modern barbarism ( combining two good things in such a way as to secure the discomforts of both and the advantages of neither ) of having a picnic with servants to wait upon you , had not yet reached this out-of-the-way region  and of course the gentlemen did not even take their places until the ladies had been duly provided with all imaginable <unk> .
then i supplied myself with a plate of something solid and a glass of something fluid , and found a place next to <name> <name> .
it had been left vacant  apparently for <name> , as a distinguished stranger : but he had turned shy , and had placed himself next to the young <name> in spectacles , whose high rasping voice had already cast loose upon society such ominous phrases as " man is a bundle of qualities !
" , " the objective is only attainable through the <unk> ! " .
<name> was bearing it bravely : but several faces wore a look of alarm , and i thought it high time to start some less metaphysical topic .
" in my nursery days , " i began , " when the weather did n't suit for an <unk> picnic , we were allowed to have a peculiar kind , that we enjoyed hugely .
the table cloth was laid under the table , instead of upon it : we sat round it on the floor : and i believe we really enjoyed that extremely uncomfortable kind of dinner more than we ever did the orthodox arrangement ! "
" i 've no doubt of it , " <name> <name> replied .
" there 's nothing a <unk> child hates so much as regularity .
i believe a really healthy boy would thoroughly enjoy greek grammar  if only he might stand on his head to learn it !
and your <unk> certainly spared you one feature of a picnic , which is to me its chief drawback . "
" the chance of a shower ? "
i suggested .
" no , the chance  or rather the certainty of live things occurring in combination with one 's food !
spiders are my <unk> .
now my father has no sympathy with that sentiment  have you , dear ? "
for the <name> had caught the word and turned to listen .
" to each his sufferings , all are men , " he replied in the sweet sad tones that seemed natural to him : " each has his pet aversion . "
" but you 'll never guess his ! "
<name> <name> said , with that delicate silvery laugh that was music to my ears .
i declined to attempt the impossible .
" he does n't like snakes ! "
she said , in a stage whisper .
" now , isn't that an unreasonable aversion ?
fancy not liking such a dear , <unk> , <unk> affectionate creature as a snake ! "
" not like snakes ! "
i exclaimed .
" is such a thing possible ? "
" no , he does n't like them , " she repeated with a pretty <unk> .
" he 's not afraid of them , you know .
but he does n't like them .
he says they 're too <unk> ! "
i was more startled than i liked to show .
there was something so uncanny in this <name> of the very words i had so lately heard from that little <unk> , that it was only by a great effort i succeeded in saying , carelessly , " let us banish so unpleasant a topic .
wo n't you sing us something , <name> <name> ?
i know you do sing without music . "
" the only songs i know  without music  are desperately sentimental , i 'm afraid !
are your tears all ready ? "
" quite ready !
quite ready ! "
came from all sides , and <name> <name>  not being one of those <unk> who think it de <unk> to decline to sing till they have been <unk> three or four times , and have pleaded failure of memory , loss of voice , and other conclusive reasons for silence  began at once :  [ image ... 'three <unk> on a mossy stone ' ] " there be three <unk> on a mossy stone , beside a dark and covered way : each dreams himself a monarch on his throne , and so they stay and stay though their old father <unk> alone , they stay , and stay , and stay .
" there be three <unk> loitering around , longing to share that mossy seat : each herring tries to sing what she has found that makes life seem so sweet .
thus , with a grating and uncertain sound , they <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , " the <unk> , on the salt <unk> , sought vainly for her absent ones : the <unk> , writhing in a cave , shrieked out ' return , my sons !
you shalt have buns , ' he shrieked , ' if you 'll behave !
yea , buns , and buns , and buns ! '
" 'i fear , ' said she , 'your sons have gone astray ?
my daughters left me while i slept . '
'yes 'm , ' the badger said : 'it 's as you say . '
'they should be better kept . '
thus the poor parents talked the time away , and wept , and wept , and wept . "
here <name> broke off suddenly .
" the <unk> ' song wants <unk> tune , <name> , " he said .
" and i ca'n't sing it not <unk> oo plays it for me ! "
[ image ... 'three <unk> , writhing in a cave ' ] instantly <name> seated herself upon a <name> mushroom , that happened to grow in front of a <name> , as if it were the most ordinary musical instrument in the world , and played on the petals as if they were the notes of an organ .
and such delicious <name> music it was !
such <unk> music !
<name> held his head on one side , and listened very gravely for a few moments until he had caught the <name> .
then the sweet childish voice rang out once more :  " oh , dear beyond our dearest dreams , fairer than all that fairest seems !
to feast the <name> hours away , to revel in a <unk> !
how blest would be a life so free   <unk> to consume , and drink the subtle <unk> !
" and if in other days and hours , mid other <unk> and other flowers , the choice were given me how to dine   <unk> what thou wilt : it shalt be thine ! '
oh , then i see the life for me <unk> to consume , and drink the subtle <unk> ! "
" oo may leave off playing now , <name> .
i can do the <unk> tune much better <unk> a compliment . "
" he means <unk> accompaniment , ' " <name> whispered , smiling at my puzzled look : and she pretended to shut up the stops of the organ .
" the <unk> did not care to talk to fish : they did not <unk> on <unk> ' songs : they never had experienced the dish to which that name belongs : and oh , to pinch their tails , ' ( this was their wish , ) 'with tongs , yea , tongs , and tongs ! ' "
i ought to mention that he marked the parenthesis , in the air , with his finger .
it seemed to me a very good plan .
you know there 's no sound to represent it  any more than there is for a question .
suppose you have said to your friend " you are better to-day , " and that you want him to understand that you are asking him a question , what can be simpler than just to make a " ? " .
in the air with your finger ?
he would understand you in a moment !
[ image ... 'those aged one waxed <name> ' ] " 'and are not these the fish , ' the eldest sighed , <unk> mother dwells beneath the <unk> 'they are the fish ! '
the second one replied .
'and they have left their home ! '
'oh wicked fish , ' the youngest badger cried , 'to roam , yea , roam , and roam ! '
" gently the <unk> trotted to the shore the <name> shore that fringed the bay : each in his mouth a living herring bore  those aged ones waxed <name> : clear rang their voices through the ocean 's roar , <unk> , hooray , hooray ! ' "
" so they all got safe home again , " <name> said , after waiting a minute to see if i had anything to say : he evidently felt that some remark ought to be made .
and i could n't help wishing there were some such rule in society , at the conclusion of a song  that the singer herself should say the right thing , and not leave it to the audience .
suppose a young <name> has just been <unk> ( 'with a grating and uncertain sound ' ) <name> 's exquisite lyric 'i arise from dreams of thee ' : how much nicer it would be , instead of your having to say " oh , thank you , thank you ! "
for the young <name> herself to remark , as she draws on her gloves , while the impassioned words 'oh , press it to thine own , or it <name> break at last ! '
are still ringing in your ears , "  but she would n't do it , you know .
so it did break at last . "
" and i knew it would ! "
she added quietly , as i started at the sudden crash of broken glass .
" you 've been holding it sideways for the last minute , and letting all the champagne run out !
were you asleep , i wonder ?
i 'm so sorry my singing has such a narcotic effect ! "
chapter 18 .
queer street , number forty .
<name> <name> was the speaker .
and , for the moment , that was the only fact i could clearly realise .
but how she came to be there and how i came to be there  and how the glass of champagne came to be there  all these were questions which i felt it better to think out in silence , and not commit myself to any statement till i understood things a little more clearly .
'first accumulate a mass of facts : and then construct a theory . '
that , i believe , is the true scientific method .
i sat up , rubbed my <unk> , and began to accumulate facts .
a smooth grassy slope , bounded , at the upper end , by venerable ruins half buried in <name> , at the lower , by a stream seen through arching trees  a dozen <unk> people , seated in little groups here and there  some open <unk>  the debris of a picnic  such were the facts accumulated by the scientific <unk> .
and now , what deep , far-reaching theory was he to construct from them ?
the <unk> found himself at fault .
yet stay !
one fact had escaped his notice .
while all the rest were grouped in twos and in threes , <name> was alone : while all tongues were talking , his was silent : while all faces were <name> , his was gloomy and despondent .
here was a fact indeed !
the <unk> felt that a theory must be constructed without delay .
<name> <name> had just risen and left the party .
could that be the cause of his despondency ?
the theory hardly rose to the dignity of a working hypothesis .
clearly more facts were needed .
the <unk> looked round him once more : and now the facts accumulated in such bewildering profusion , that the theory was lost among them .
for <name> <name> had gone to meet a strange gentleman , just visible in the distance : and now she was returning with him , both of them talking eagerly and joyfully , like old friends who have been long parted : and now she was moving from group to group , introducing the new hero of the hour : and he , young , tall , and handsome , moved gracefully at her side , with the erect bearing and firm tread of a soldier .
verily , the theory looked gloomy for <name> !
his eye caught mine , and he crossed to me .
" he is very handsome , " i said .
" abominably handsome ! "
muttered <name> : then smiled at his own bitter words .
" lucky no one heard me but you ! "
" doctor forester , " said <name> <name> , who had just joined us , " let me introduce to you my cousin <name> <unk> captain <unk> , i should say . "
<name> shook off his <unk> instantly and completely , as he rose and gave the young soldier his hand .
" i have heard of you , " he said .
" i 'm very glad to make the acquaintance of <name> <name> 's cousin . "
" yes , that 's all i 'm distinguished for , as yet ! "
said <name> ( so we soon got to call him ) with a winning smile .
" and i doubt , " glancing at <name> <name> , " if it even amounts to a <unk> !
but it 's something to begin with . "
" you must come to my father , <name> , " said <name> <name> .
" i think he's wandering among the ruins . "
and the pair moved on .
the gloomy look returned to <name> 's face : and i could see it was only to distract his thoughts that he took his place at the side of the metaphysical young <name> , and resumed their interrupted discussion .
" talking of <name> <name> , " he began , " do you really find no logical difficulty in regarding nature as a process of <unk> , passing from definite coherent <unk> to indefinite incoherent <unk> ? "
amused as i was at the ingenious jumble he had made of <name> 's words , i kept as grave a face as i could .
no physical difficulty , " she confidently replied : " but i haven't studied logic much .
would you state the difficulty ? "
" well , " said <name> , " do you accept it as self-evident ?
is it as obvious , for instance , as that <unk> that are greater than the same are greater than one another ' ? "
" to my mind , " she modestly replied , " it seems quite as obvious .
i grasp both truths by intuition .
but other minds may need some logical  i forget the technical terms . "
" for a complete logical argument , " <name> began with admirable solemnity , " we need two prim misses  " " of course ! "
she interrupted .
" i remember that word now .
and they produce  ? "
" a delusion , " said <name> .
" ye  es ? "
she said dubiously .
" i do n't seem to remember that so well .
but what is the whole argument called ? "
" a <unk> ?
" ah , yes !
i remember now .
but i do n't need a <unk> , you know , to prove that mathematical axiom you mentioned . "
" nor to prove that 'all angles are equal ' , i suppose ? "
" why , of course not !
one takes such a simple truth as that for granted ! "
here i ventured to interpose , and to offer her a plate of strawberries and cream .
i felt really uneasy at the thought that she might detect the trick : and i contrived , unperceived by her , to shake my head <unk> at the <unk> .
equally unperceived by her , <name> slightly raised his shoulders , and spread his hands abroad , as who should say " what else can i say to her ? "
and moved away , leaving her to discuss her strawberries by <unk> , ' or any other way she preferred .
by this time the carriages , that were to convey the <unk> to their respective homes , had begun to assemble outside the <unk> : and it became evident  now that <name> <name> 's cousin had joined our party that the problem , how to convey five people to <unk> , with a carriage that would only hold four , must somehow be solved .
the honorable <name> <unk> , who was at this moment walking up and down with <name> <name> , might have solved it at once , no doubt , by announcing his intention of returning on foot .
of this solution there did not seem to be the very smallest probability .
the next best solution , it seemed to me , was that i should walk home : and this i at once proposed .
" you 're sure you do n't mind ?
' , said the <name> .
" i 'm afraid the carriage wont take us all , and i do n't like to suggest to <name> to desert his cousin so soon . "
" so far from minding it , " i said , " i should prefer it .
it <name> give me time to sketch this beautiful old ruin . "
" i 'll keep you company , " <name> suddenly said .
and , in answer to what i suppose was a look of surprise on my face , he said in a low voice , " i really would rather .
i shall be quite de <unk> in the carriage ! "
" i think i 'll walk too , " said the <name> .
" you 'll have to be content with <name> as your escort , " he added , to <name> <name> , who had joined us while he was speaking .
" you must be as entertaining as <unk>  'three gentlemen rolled into one '  " <name> <name> said to her companion .
" it <name> be a grand military exploit ! "
" a sort of forlorn <name> ? "
the captain modestly suggested .
" you do pay pretty compliments ! "
laughed his fair cousin .
" good day to you , gentlemen three  or rather deserters three ! "
and the two young folk entered the carriage and were driven away .
" how long <name> your sketch take ? "
said <name> .
" well , " i said , " i should like an hour for it .
do n't you think you had better go without me ?
i 'll return by train .
i know there 's one in about an hour 's time . "
" perhaps that would be best , " said the <name> .
" the station is quite close . "
so i was left to my own devices , and soon found a comfortable seat , at the foot of a tree , from which i had a good view of the ruins .
" it is a very drowsy day , " i said to myself , idly turning over the leaves of the sketch-book to find a blank <name> .
" why , i thought you were a mile off by this time ! "
for , to my surprise , the two <unk> were back again .
" i came back to remind you , " <name> said , " that the trains go every ten minutes  " " nonsense ! "
i said .
" it is n't the metropolitan railway ! "
" it is the metropolitan railway , " the <name> insisted .
" 'this is a part of kensington . "
" why do you talk with your eyes shut ? "
said <name> .
" wake up ! "
" i think it 's the heat makes me so drowsy , " i said , hoping , but not feeling quite sure , that i was talking sense .
" am i awake now ? "
" i think not , " the <name> judicially pronounced .
" what do you think , doctor ?
he 's only got one eye open ! "
" and he 's snoring like anything ! "
cried <name> .
" do wake up , you dear old thing ! "
and he and <name> set to work , rolling the heavy head from side to side , as if its connection with the shoulders was a matter of no sort of importance .
and at last the professor opened his eyes , and sat up , blinking at us with eyes of utter bewilderment .
" would you have the kindness to mention , " he said , addressing me with his usual old-fashioned courtesy , " whereabouts we are just now and who we are , beginning with me ? "
i thought it best to begin with the children .
" this is <name> .
sir ; and this is <name> . "
" ah , yes !
i know them well enough ! "
the old man murmured .
" its myself i 'm most anxious about .
and perhaps you 'll be good enough to mention , at the same time , how i got here ? "
" a harder problem occurs to me , " i ventured to say : " and that is , how you 're to get back again . "
" true , true ! "
the professor replied .
" that 's the problem , no doubt .
viewed as a problem , outside of oneself , it is a most interesting one .
viewed as a portion of one 's own biography , it is , i must admit , very distressing ! "
he groaned , but instantly added , with a chuckle , " as to myself , i think you mentioned that i am  " " oo 're the professor ! "
<name> shouted in his ear .
" did n't oo know that ?
oo 've come from outland !
and it 's ever so far away from here ! "
the professor <unk> to his feet with the agility of a boy .
" then there 's no time to lose ! "
he exclaimed anxiously .
" i 'll just ask this guileless peasant , with his brace of buckets that contain ( apparently ) water , if he 'll be so kind as to direct us .
guileless peasant ! "
he proceeded in a louder voice .
" would you tell us the way to outland ? "
the guileless peasant turned with a sheepish grin .
" hey ? "
was all he said .
" the way  to  outland ! "
the professor repeated .
the guileless peasant set down his buckets and considered .
" ah <unk>  " " i ought to mention , " the professor hastily put in , " that whatever you say <name> be used in evidence against you . "
the guileless peasant instantly resumed his buckets .
" then ah says nowt ! "
he answered briskly , and walked away at a great pace .
the children gazed sadly at the rapidly vanishing figure .
" he goes very quick ! "
the professor said with a sigh .
" but i know that was the right thing to say .
i 've studied your english laws .
however , let's ask this next man that 's coming .
he is not guileless , and he is not a peasant  but i do n't know that either point is of vital importance . "
it was , in fact , the honourable <name> <unk> , who had apparently fulfilled his task of escorting <name> <name> home , and was now strolling leisurely up and down the road outside the house , enjoying ; a solitary cigar .
" might i trouble you , sir , to tell us the nearest way to outland ! "
oddity as he was , in outward appearance , the professor was , in that essential nature which no outward disguise could conceal , a thorough gentleman .
and , as such , <name> <unk> accepted him instantly .
he took the cigar from his mouth , and delicately shook off the ash , while he considered .
" the name sounds strange to me , " he said .
" i doubt if i can help you ? '
" it is not very far from fairyland , " the professor suggested .
<name> <unk> 's <unk> were slightly raised at these words , and an amused smile , which he courteously tried to repress , flitted across his handsome face : " a trifle cracked ! "
he muttered to himself .
" but what a jolly old patriarch it is ! "
then he turned to the children .
" and ca'n't you help him , little folk ? "
he said , with a gentleness of tone that seemed to win their hearts at once .
" surely you know all about it ?
'how many miles to babylon ?
<unk> miles and ten .
can i get there by <unk> ?
yes , and back again ! ' "
to my surprise , <name> ran forwards to him , as if he were some old friend of theirs , seized the disengaged hand and <name> on to it with both of his own : and there stood this tall dignified officer in the middle of the road , gravely swinging a little boy to and fro , while <name> stood ready to push him , exactly as if a real swing had suddenly been provided for their pastime .
" we do n't want to get to babylon , oo know ! "
<name> explained as he swung .
" and it is n't <unk> : it 's daylight ! "
<name> added , giving the swing a push of extra vigour , which nearly took the whole machine off its balance .
by this time it was clear to me that <name> <unk> was quite unconscious of my presence .
even the professor and the children seemed to have lost sight of me : and i stood in the midst of the group , as unconcernedly as a ghost , seeing but unseen .
" how perfectly <unk> ! "
the professor exclaimed with enthusiasm .
he had his watch in his hand , and was carefully counting <unk> oscillations .
" he measures time quite as accurately as a pendulum ! "
[ image ... 'how perfectly <unk> ! ' ]
" yet even <unk> , " the good-natured young soldier observed , as he carefully released his hand from <name> 's grasp , " are not a <name> for ever !
come , that 's enough for one <unk> , little man ! '
next time we meet , you shall have another .
meanwhile you 'd better take this old gentleman to queer street , number  " " we 'll find it ! "
cried <name> eagerly , as they dragged the professor away .
" we are much indebted to you ! "
the professor said , looking over his shoulder .
" do n't mention it ! "
replied the officer , raising his hat as a parting salute .
" what number did you say ! "
the professor called from the distance .
the officer made a trumpet of his two hands .
" forty ! "
he shouted in <unk> tones .
" and not piano , by any means ! "
he added to himself .
" it 's a mad world , my masters , a mad world ! "
he lit another cigar , and strolled on towards his hotel .
" what a lovely evening ! "
i said , joining him as he passed me .
" lovely indeed , " he said .
" where did you come from ?
dropped from the clouds ? "
" i 'm strolling your way , " i said ; and no further explanation seemed necessary .
" have a cigar ? "
" thanks : i 'm not a smoker . "
" is there a lunatic asylum near here ? "
" not that i know of . "
" thought there might be .
met a lunatic just now .
queer old fish as ever i saw ! "
and so , in friendly chat , we took our homeward ways , and wished each other <unk> ' at the door of his hotel .
left to myself , i felt the <unk> ' feeling rush over me again , and saw , standing at the door of number forty , the three figures i knew so well .
" then it 's the wrong house ? "
<name> was saying .
" no , no !
it 's the right house , " the professor cheerfully replied : " but it 's the wrong street .
that 's where we 've made our mistake !
our best plan , now , <name> be to  " it was over .
the street was empty , commonplace life was around me , and the <unk> ' feeling had fled .
chapter 19 .
how to make a <unk> .
the week passed without any further communication with the <unk> , ' as <name> was evidently fearful that we might <unk> out our welcome ' ; but when , on <name> morning , we were setting out for church , i gladly agreed to his proposal to go round and enquire after the <name> , who was said to be unwell .
<name> , who was strolling in the garden , gave us a good report of the invalid , who was still in bed , with <name> <name> in attendance .
" are you coming with us to church ? "
i enquired .
" thanks , no , " he courteously replied .
" it 's not  exactly in my line , you know .
it 's an excellent institution  for the poor .
when i 'm with my own folk , i go , just to set them an example .
but i 'm not known here : so i think i 'll excuse myself sitting out a sermon .
<unk> are always so dull ! "
<name> was silent till we were out of hearing .
then he said to himself , almost <unk> , " where two or three are gathered together in my name , there am i in the midst of them . "
" yes , " i assented : " no doubt that is the principle on which <unk> rests . "
" and when he does go , " he continued ( our thoughts ran so much together , that our conversation was often slightly <unk> ) , " i suppose he repeats the words 'i believe in the communion of saints ' ? "
but by this time we had reached the little church , into which a goodly stream of <unk> , consisting mainly of fishermen and their families , was flowing .
the service would have been pronounced by any modern <unk> <unk>  or religious <unk> , which is it ?  to be crude and cold : to me , coming fresh from the <unk> developments of a london church under a <unk> <unk> ' rector , it was unspeakably refreshing .
there was no theatrical procession of demure little <unk> , trying their best not to <unk> under the admiring gaze of the congregation : the people 's share in the service was taken by the people themselves , unaided , except that a few good voices , judiciously posted here and there among them , kept the singing from going too far astray .
there was no murdering of the <name> music , contained in the bible and the liturgy , by its recital in a dead monotone , with no more expression than a mechanical <unk> .
no , the prayers were prayed , the lessons were read , and best of all the sermon was talked ; and i found myself repeating , as we left the church , the words of <name> , when he <unk> out of his sleep . '
" 'surely the lord is in this place !
this is none other but the house of god , and this is the gate of heaven . ' "
" yes , " said <name> , apparently in answer to my thoughts , " those <unk> services are fast becoming pure <unk> .
more and more the people are beginning to regard them as <unk> , ' in which they only <unk> ' in the french sense .
and it is specially bad for the little boys .
they 'd be much less self-conscious as <unk> .
with all that <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> , and being always en evidence , no wonder if they 're eaten up with vanity , the <unk> little <unk> ! "
when we passed the hall on our return , we found the <name> and <name> <name> sitting out in the garden .
<name> had gone for a stroll .
we joined them , and the conversation soon turned on the sermon we had just heard , the subject of which was <unk> . '
" what a change has come over our pulpits , " <name> remarked , " since the time when <unk> gave that utterly selfish definition of virtue , 'the doing good to mankind , in obedience to the <name> of god , and for the sake of everlasting happiness ' ! "
<name> <name> looked at him <unk> , but she seemed to have learned by intuition , what years of experience had taught me , that the way to <unk> <name> 's deepest thoughts was neither to assent nor dissent , but simply to listen .
" at that time , " he went on , " a great tidal wave of selfishness was sweeping over human thought .
right and wrong had somehow been transformed into gain and loss , and religion had become a sort of commercial transaction .
we may be thankful that our preachers are beginning to take a nobler view of life . "
" but is it not taught again and again in the bible ? "
i ventured to ask .
" not in the bible as a whole , " said <name> .
" in the old testament , no doubt , rewards and punishments are constantly appealed to as motives for action .
that teaching is best for children , and the israelites seem to have been , mentally , utter children .
we guide our children thus , at first : but we appeal , as soon as possible , to their innate sense of right and wrong : and , when that stage is safely past , we appeal to the highest motive of all , the <name> for likeness to , and union with , the supreme good .
i think you <name> find that to be the teaching of the bible , as a whole , beginning with 'that thy days may be long in the land , ' and ending with 'be ye perfect , even as your father which is in heaven is perfect . ' "
we were silent for awhile , and then <name> went off on another tack .
" look at the literature of hymns , now .
how <unk> it is , through and through , with selfishness !
there are few human compositions more utterly degraded than some modern hymns ! "
i quoted the stanza " whatever , lord , we tend to thee , repaid a <unk> shall be , then gladly <name> we give to thee , giver of all ! '
" yes , " he said grimly : " that is the typical stanza .
and the very last <unk> i heard was infected with it .
after giving many good reasons for <name> , the preacher wound up with 'and , for all you give , you <name> be repaid a <unk> ! '
oh the utter meanness of such a motive , to be put before men who do know what self-sacrifice is , who can appreciate generosity and heroism !
talk of original sin ! "
he went on with increasing bitterness .
" can you have a stronger proof of the original goodness there must be in this nation , than the fact that religion has been preached to us , as a commercial speculation , for a century , and that we still believe in a god ? "
" it could n't have gone on so long , " <name> <name> musingly remarked , " if the opposition had n't been practically silenced  put under what the french call la <unk> .
surely in any <unk> , or in private society , such teaching would soon have been hooted down ? "
" i trust so , " said <name> : " and , though i do n't want to see <unk> in church ' <unk> , i must say that our preachers enjoy an enormous privilege  which they ill deserve , and which they <unk> terribly .
we put our man into a pulpit , and we virtually tell him 'now , you may stand there and talk to us for half-an-hour .
we wo n't interrupt you by so much as a word !
you shall have it all your own way ! '
and what does he give us in return ?
shallow <unk> , that , if it were addressed to you over a dinner-table , you would think 'does the man take me for a fool ? ' "
the return of <name> from his walk checked the tide of <name> 's eloquence , and , after a few minutes ' talk on more conventional topics , we took our leave .
<name> <name> walked with us to the gate .
" you have given me much to think about , " she said earnestly , as she gave <name> her hand .
" i 'm so glad you came in ! "
and her words brought a real glow of pleasure into that pale worn face of his .
on the tuesday , as <name> did not seem equal to more walking , i took a long stroll by myself , having stipulated that he was not to give the whole day to his books , but was to meet me at the hall at about tea-time .
on my way back , i passed the station just as the <unk> came in sight , and sauntered down the stairs to see it come in .
but there was little to gratify my idle curiosity : and , when the train was empty , and the platform clear , i found it was about time to be moving on , if i meant to reach the hall by five .
as i approached the end of the platform , from which a steep irregular wooden staircase conducted to the upper world , i noticed two passengers , who had evidently arrived by the train , but who , oddly enough , had entirely escaped my notice , though the arrivals had been so few .
they were a young woman and a little girl : the former , so far as one could judge by appearances , was a <unk> , or possibly a <unk> , in attendance on the child , whose refined face , even more than her dress , distinguished her as of a higher class than her companion .
the child 's face was refined , but it was also a worn and sad one , and told a tale ( or so i seemed to read it ) of much illness and suffering , sweetly and patiently borne .
she had a little crutch to help herself along with : and she was now standing , looking wistfully up the long staircase , and apparently waiting till she could muster courage to begin the <unk> ascent .
there are some things one says in life  as well as things one does  which come automatically , by reflex action , as the physiologists say ( meaning , no doubt , action without reflection , just as <unk> is said to be derived 'a non <unk> ' ) .
closing one 's eyelids , when something seems to be flying into the eye , is one of those actions , and saying " may i <name> the little girl up the stairs ? "
was another .
it was n't that any thought of offering help occurred to me , and that then i spoke : the first intimation i had , of being likely to make that offer , was the sound of my own voice , and the discovery that the offer had been made .
the servant paused , doubtfully glancing from her charge to me , and then back again to the child .
" would you like it , dear ? "
she asked her .
but no such doubt appeared to cross the child 's mind : she lifted her arms eagerly to be taken up .
" please ! "
was all she said , while a faint smile flickered on the weary little face .
i took her up with scrupulous care , and her little arm was at once clasped <unk> round my neck .
[ image ... the lame child ] she was a very light weight  so light , in fact , that the ridiculous idea crossed my mind that it was rather easier going up , with her in my arms , than it would have been without her : and , when we reached the road above , with its <unk> and loose stones  all formidable obstacles for a lame child  i found that i had said " i 'd better <name> her over this rough place , " before i had formed any mental connection between its roughness and my gentle little burden .
" indeed it 's troubling you too much , sir ! "
the maid exclaimed .
" she can walk very well on the flat . "
but the arm , that was twined about my neck , clung just an atom more closely at the suggestion , and decided me to say " she 's no weight , really .
i 'll <name> her a little further .
i 'm going your way . "
the nurse raised no further objection : and the next speaker was a ragged little boy , with bare feet , and a broom over his shoulder , who ran across the road , and pretended to sweep the perfectly dry road in front of us .
" give us a <unk> ! "
the little urchin pleaded , with a broad grin on his dirty face .
" do n't give him a <unk> ! "
said the little <name> in my arms .
the words sounded harsh : but the tone was gentleness itself .
" he 's an idle little boy ! "
and she laughed a laugh of such silvery sweetness as i had never yet heard from any lips but <name> 's .
to my astonishment , the boy actually joined in the laugh , as if there were some subtle sympathy between them , as he ran away down the road and vanished through a gap in the hedge .
but he was back in a few moments , having discarded his broom and provided himself , from some mysterious source , with an exquisite bouquet of flowers .
" buy a <unk> , buy a <unk> !
only a <unk> ! "
he chanted , with the melancholy drawl of a professional beggar .
" do n't buy it ! "
was her majesty 's edict as she looked down , with a lofty scorn that seemed curiously mixed with tender interest , on the ragged creature at her feet .
but this time i turned rebel , and ignored the <name> commands .
such lovely flowers , and of forms so entirely new to me , were not to be abandoned at the bidding of any little maid , however imperious .
i bought the bouquet : and the little boy , after popping the <unk> into his mouth , turned <unk> , as if to ascertain whether the human mouth is really adapted to serve as a <unk> .
with wonder , that increased every moment , i turned over the flowers , and examined them one by one : there was not a single one among them that i could remember having ever seen before .
at last i turned to the <unk> .
" do these flowers grow wild about here ?
i never saw  " but the speech died away on my lips .
the <unk> had vanished !
" you can put me down , now , if you like , " <name> quietly remarked .
i obeyed in silence , and could only ask myself " is this a dream ?
" , on finding <name> and <name> walking one on either side of me , and clinging to my hands with the ready confidence of childhood .
" you 're larger than when i saw you last ! "
i began .
" really i think we ought to be introduced again !
there 's so much of you that i never met before , you know . "
" very well ! "
<name> merrily replied .
" this is <name> .
it does n't take long .
he 's only got one name ! "
" there 's another name to me ! "
<name> protested , with a reproachful look at the mistress of the ceremonies .
" and it 's  ' <unk> ' ! "
" oh , of course .
i forgot , " said <name> .
" <name>  <unk> ! "
" and did you come here to meet me , my children ? "
i enquired .
" you know i said we 'd come on tuesday , <name> explained .
" are we the proper size for common children ? "
" quite the right size for children , " i replied , ( adding mentally " though not common children , by any means ! " )
" but what became of the <unk> ? "
" it are gone ! "
<name> solemnly replied .
" then it was n't solid , like <name> and you ? "
" no .
oo could n't touch it , oo know .
if oo walked at it , oo 'd go right <unk> ! "
" i quite expected you 'd find it out , once , " said <name> .
" <name> ran it against a telegraph post , by accident .
and it went in two halves .
but you were looking the other way . "
i felt that i had indeed missed an opportunity : to witness such an event as a <unk> going 'in two halves ' does not occur twice in a <unk> !
" when did oo guess it were <name> ? "
<name> enquired .
[ image ... 'it went in two halves ' ] " i did n't guess it , till it was <name> , " i said .
" but how did you manage the <unk> ? "
" <name> managed it , " said <name> .
" it 's called a <unk> . "
" and how do you make a <unk> , <name> ? "
" the professor <unk> me how , " said <name> .
" first oo takes a lot of air  " " oh , <name> ! "
<name> interposed .
" the professor said you were n't to tell ! "
but who did her voice ? "
i asked .
" indeed it 's troubling you too much , sir !
she can walk very well on the flat . "
<name> laughed merrily as i turned hastily from side to side , looking in all directions for the speaker .
" that were me ! "
he gleefully proclaimed , in his own voice .
" she can indeed walk very well on the flat , " i said .
" and i think i was the flat . "
by this time we were near the hall .
" this is where my friends live , " i said .
" <name> you come in and have some tea with them ? "
<name> gave a little jump of <name> : and <name> said " yes , please .
you 'd like some tea , <name> , would n't you ?
he has n't tasted tea , " she explained to me , " since we left outland . "
" and that were n't good tea ! "
said <name> .
" it were so <unk> weak ! "
chapter 20 .
light come , light go .
<name> <name> 's smile of welcome could not quite conceal the look of surprise with which she regarded my new companions .
i presented them in due form .
" this is <name> , <name> <name> .
and this is <name> . "
" any <unk> ? "
she enquired , her eyes twinkling with fun .
" no , " i said gravely .
" no <unk> . "
she laughed , evidently thinking i said it in fun ; and stooped to kiss the children a salute to which <name> submitted with reluctance : <name> returned it with interest .
while she and <name> ( who had arrived before me ) supplied the children with tea and cake , i tried to engage the <name> in conversation : but he was restless and <unk> , and we made little progress .
at last , by a sudden question , he betrayed the cause of his <unk> .
" would you let me look at those flowers you have in your hand ? "
" willingly ! "
i said , handing him the bouquet .
botany was , i knew , a favourite study of his : and these flowers were to me so entirely new and mysterious , that i was really curious to see what a botanist would say of them .
they did not diminish his <unk> .
on the contrary , he became every moment more excited as he turned them over .
" these are all from central <name> ! "
he said , laying aside part of the bouquet .
" they are rare , even there : and i have never seen them in any other part of the world .
these two are mexican  this one  " ( he rose hastily , and carried it to the window , to examine it in a better light , the flush of excitement mounting to his very forehead ) "  is .
i am nearly sure  but i have a book of indian botany here  " he took a volume from the <unk> , and turned the leaves with trembling fingers .
" yes !
compare it with this picture !
it is the exact duplicate !
this is the flower of the <unk> , which usually grows only in the depths of forests ; and the flower fades so quickly after being plucked , that it is scarcely possible to keep its form or colour even so far as the outskirts of the forest !
yet this is in full bloom !
where did you get these flowers ? "
he added with breathless eagerness .
i glanced at <name> , who , gravely and silently , laid her finger on her lips , then beckoned to <name> to follow her , and ran out into the garden ; and i found myself in the position of a defendant whose two most important witnesses have been suddenly taken away .
" let me give you the flowers ! "
i stammered out at last , quite 'at my wit 's end ' as to how to get out of the difficulty .
" you know much more about them than i do ! "
" i accept them most gratefully !
but you have not yet told me  " the <name> was beginning , when we were interrupted , to my great relief , by the arrival of <name> <unk> .
to <name> , however , the new-comer was , i saw clearly , anything but welcome .
his face clouded over : he <name> a little back from the circle , and took no further part in the conversation , which was wholly maintained , for some minutes , by <name> <name> and her lively cousin , who were discussing some new music that had just arrived from london .
" do just try this one ! "
he pleaded .
" the music looks easy to sing at sight , and the song 's quite appropriate to the occasion . "
" then i suppose it's 'five o'clock tea !
ever to thee faithful i 'll be , five o'clock tea ! " '
laughed <name> <name> , as she sat down to the piano , and lightly struck a few random chords .
" not quite : and yet it is a kind of <unk> to thee faithful i 'll be ! '
it 's a pair of hapless lovers : he crosses the <unk> deep : and she is left lamenting . "
" that is indeed appropriate ! "
she replied mockingly , as he placed the song before her .
" and am i to do the lamenting ?
and who for , if you please ? "
she played the air once or twice through , first in quick , and finally in slow , time ; and then gave us the whole song with as much graceful ease as if she had been familiar with it all her life :  " he <unk> so lightly to the land , all in his manly pride : he kissed her cheek , he pressed her hand , yet still she glanced aside .
'too <name> he seems , ' she darkly dreams , 'too gallant and too <name> to think of me  poor simple me   when he is far away ! '
'i bring my love this goodly <name> across the seas , ' he said : 'a gem to deck the dearest girl that ever sailor wed ! '
she <unk> it tight ' her eyes are bright : her throbbing heart would say 'he thought of me  he thought of me   when he was far away ! '
the ship has sailed into the west : her <unk> is flown : a dull dead pain is in her breast , and she is weak and lone : yet there 's a smile upon her face , a smile that seems to say 'he 'll think of me he 'll think of me   when he is far away !
'though waters wide between us glide , our lives are warm and near : no distance parts two faithful hearts two hearts that love so dear : and i <name> trust my <unk> , for ever and a day , to think of me  to think of me   when he is far away ! ' "
the look of displeasure , which had begun to come over <name> 's face when the young captain spoke of love so lightly , faded away as the song proceeded , and he listened with evident delight .
but his face darkened again when <name> demurely remarked " do n't you think 'my <unk> would have fitted the tune just as well ! "
" why , so it would ! "
<name> <name> gaily retorted .
" soldiers , sailors , <unk> , tailors , what a lot of words would fit in !
i think 'my <unk> sounds best .
do n't you ? "
to spare my friend further pain , i rose to go , just as the <name> was beginning to repeat his particularly embarrassing question about the flowers .
" you have not yet  ' " yes , i 've had some tea , thank you ! "
i hastily interrupted him .
" and now we really must be going .
good evening , <name> <name> ! "
and we made our <unk> , and escaped , while the <name> was still absorbed in examining the mysterious bouquet .
<name> <name> accompanied us to the door .
" you could n't have given my father a more acceptable present ! "
she said , warmly .
" he is so passionately fond of botany .
i 'm afraid i know nothing of the theory of it , but i keep his <unk> <unk> in order .
i must get some sheets of <unk> , and dry these new treasures for him before they fade .
" that wo n't be no good at all ! "
said <name> , who was waiting for us in the garden .
" why wo n't it ? "
said i .
" you know i had to give the flowers , to stop questions ?
" yes , it ca'n't be helped , " said <name> : " but they <name> be sorry when they find them gone ! "
" but how <name> they go ? "
" well , i do n't know how .
but they <name> go .
the <unk> was only a <unk> , you know .
<name> made it up . "
these last words were in a whisper , as she evidently did not wish <name> to hear .
but of this there seemed to be little risk : he hardly seemed to notice the children , but paced on , silent and abstracted ; and when , at the entrance to the wood , they bid us a hasty farewell and ran off , he seemed to wake out of a <unk> .
the bouquet vanished , as <name> had predicted ; and when , a day or two afterwards , <name> and i once more visited the hall , we found the <name> and his daughter , with the old housekeeper , out in the garden , examining the fastenings of the drawing-room window .
" we are holding an inquest , " <name> <name> said , advancing to meet us : " and we admit you , as accessories before the fact , to tell us all you know about those flowers . "
" the accessories before the fact decline to answer any questions , " i gravely replied .
" and they reserve their defence . "
" well then , turn <name> 's evidence , please !
the flowers have disappeared in the night , " she went on , turning to <name> , " and we are quite sure no one in the house has meddled with them .
somebody must have entered by the window  " " but the fastenings have not been tampered with , " said the <name> .
" it must have been while you were dining , my <name> , " said the housekeeper .
" that was it , said the <name> .
" the thief must have seen you bring the flowers , " turning to me , " and have noticed that you did not take them away .
and he must have known their great value  they are simply priceless ! "
he exclaimed , in sudden excitement .
" and you never told us how you got them ! "
said <name> <name> .
" some day , " i stammered , " i may be free to tell you .
just now , would you excuse me ? "
the <name> looked disappointed , but kindly said " very well , we <name> ask no questions . "
[ image ... five o'clock tea ] " but we consider you a very bad <name> 's evidence , " <name> <name> added playfully , as we entered the <unk> .
" we pronounce you to be an accomplice : and we sentence you to solitary confinement , and to be fed on bread and butter .
do you take sugar ? "
" it is disquieting , certainly , " she resumed , when all <unk> had been duly supplied , " to find that the house has been entered by a thief in this out-of-the-way place .
if only the flowers had been eatables , one might have suspected a thief of quite another shape  " " you mean that universal explanation for all mysterious <unk> , 'the cat did it ' ? "
said <name> .
" yes , " she replied .
" what a convenient thing it would be if all thieves had the same shape !
it 's so confusing to have some of them quadrupeds and others <unk> ! "
" it has occurred to me , " said <name> , " as a curious problem in <unk>  the science of final causes , " he added , in answer to an <unk> look from <name> <name> .
" and a final cause is  ? "
" well , suppose we say  the last of a series of connected events  each of the series being the cause of the next  for whose sake the first event takes place . "
" but the last event is practically an effect of the first , is n't it ?
and yet you call it a cause of it ! "
<name> pondered a moment .
" the words are rather confusing , i <name> you , " he said .
" <name> this do ?
the last event is an effect of the first : but the necessity for that event is a cause of the necessity for the first . "
" that seems clear enough , " said <name> <name> .
" now let us have the problem . "
" it 's merely this .
what object can we imagine in the arrangement by which each different size ( roughly speaking ) of living creatures has its special shape ?
for instance , the human race has one kind of shape  <unk> .
another set , ranging from the lion to the mouse , are quadrupeds .
go down a step or two further , and you come to insects with six legs  <unk>  a beautiful name , is it not ?
but beauty , in our sense of the word , seems to diminish as we go down : the creature becomes more  i wo n't say <unk> ' of any of god 's creatures  more uncouth .
and , when we take the microscope , and go a few steps lower still , we come upon <unk> , terribly uncouth , and with a terrible number of legs ! "
" the other alternative , " said the <name> , " would be a <unk> series of repetitions of the same type .
never mind the monotony of it : let's see how it would work in other ways .
begin with the race of men , and the creatures they require : let us say horses , cattle , sheep , and dogs we do n't exactly require frogs and spiders , do we , <name> ? "
<name> <name> shuddered perceptibly : it was evidently a painful subject .
" we can dispense with them , " she said gravely .
" well , then we 'll have a second race of men , <unk> high  " "  who would have one source of exquisite enjoyment , not possessed by ordinary men ! "
<name> interrupted .
" what source ? "
said the <name> .
" why , the grandeur of scenery !
surely the grandeur of a mountain , to me , depends on its size , relative to me ?
double the height of the mountain , and of course it 's twice as grand .
<unk> my height , and you produce the same effect . "
" happy , happy , happy small ! "
<name> <name> murmured rapturously .
" none but the short , none but the short , none but the short enjoy the tall ! "
" but let me go on , " said the <name> .
" we 'll have a third race of men , five inches high ; a fourth race , an inch high  " " they could n't eat common beef and mutton , i 'm sure ! "
<name> <name> interrupted .
" true , my child , i was forgetting .
each set must have its own cattle and sheep . "
" and its own vegetation , " i added .
" what could a cow , an inch high , do with grass that waved far above its head ? "
" that is true .
we must have a pasture within a pasture , so to speak .
the common grass would serve our <unk> cows as a green forest of palms , while round the root of each tall stem would stretch a <name> carpet of microscopic grass .
yes , i think our scheme <name> work fairly well .
and it would be very interesting , coming into contact with the races below us .
what sweet little things the <unk> <unk> would be !
i doubt if even <name> would run away from one of them ! "
" do n't you think we ought to have a <unk> series , as well ? "
said <name> <name> .
" only fancy being a hundred yards high !
one could use an elephant as a <unk> , and a crocodile as a pair of scissors ! "
" and would you have races of different sizes communicate with one another ? "
i enquired .
" would they make war on one another , for instance , or enter into treaties ? "
" war we must exclude , i think .
when you could crush a whole nation with one blow of your fist , you could n't conduct war on equal terms .
but anything , involving a collision of minds only , would be possible in our ideal world  for of course we must allow mental powers to all , <unk> of size .
" perhaps the fairest rule would be that , the smaller the race , the greater should be its intellectual development ! "
" do you mean to say , " said <name> <name> , " that these <unk> of an inch high are to argue with me ? "
" surely , surely ! "
said the <name> .
" an argument does n't depend for its logical force on the size of the creature that utters it ! "
she tossed her head indignantly .
" i would not argue with any man less than six inches high ! "
she cried .
" i 'd make him work ! "
" what at ? "
said <name> , listening to all this nonsense with an amused smile .
" embroidery ! "
she readily replied .
" what lovely embroidery they would do ! "
" yet , if they did it wrong , " i said , " you could n't argue the question .
i do n't know why : but i agree that it could n't be done . "
" the reason is , " said <name> <name> , " one could n't sacrifice one's dignity so far . "
" of course one could n't ! "
echoed <name> .
" any more than one could argue with a potato .
it would be altogether  excuse the ancient pun  <unk> <unk> ! "
" i doubt it , " said i .
" even a pun does n't quite convince me . "
" well , if that is not the reason , " said <name> <name> , " what reason would you give ? "
i tried hard to understand the meaning of this question : but the persistent humming of the bees confused me , and there was a drowsiness in the air that made every thought stop and go to sleep before it had got well thought out : so all i could say was " that must depend on the weight of the potato . "
i felt the remark was not so sensible as i should have liked it to be .
but <name> <name> seemed to take it quite as a matter of course .
" in that case  " she began , but suddenly started , and turned away to listen .
" do n't you hear him ? "
she said .
" he 's crying .
we must go to him , somehow . "
and i said to myself " that 's very strange .
i quite thought it was <name> <name> talking to me .
why , it 's <name> all the while ! "
and i made another great effort to say something that should have some meaning in it .
" is it about the potato ? "
chapter 21 .
through the <name> door .
" i do n't know , " said <name> .
" hush !
i must think .
i could go to him , by myself , well enough .
but i want you to come too . "
" let me go with you , " i pleaded .
" i can walk as fast as you can , i 'm sure . "
<name> laughed merrily .
" what nonsense ! "
she cried .
" why , you ca'n't walk a bit !
you 're lying quite flat on your back !
you do n't understand these things . "
" i can walk as well as you can , " i repeated .
and i tried my best to walk a few steps : but the ground slipped away backwards , quite as fast as i could walk , so that i made no progress at all .
<name> laughed again .
" there , i told you so !
you 've no idea how funny you look , moving your feet about in the air , as if you were walking !
wait a bit .
i 'll ask the professor what we 'd better do . "
and she knocked at his <unk> .
the door opened , and the professor looked out .
" what 's that crying i heard just now ? "
he asked .
" is it a human animal ? "
" it 's a boy , " <name> said .
" i 'm afraid you 've been teasing him ? "
" no , indeed i have n't ! "
<name> said , very earnestly .
" i never tease him ! "
" well , i must ask the other professor about it . "
he went back into the study , and we heard him whispering " small human animal  says she hasn't been teasing him  the kind that 's called boy  " " ask her which boy , " said a new voice .
the professor came out again .
" which boy is it that you have n't been teasing ? "
<name> looked at me with twinkling eyes .
" you dear old thing ! "
she exclaimed , standing on tiptoe to kiss him , while he gravely stooped to receive the salute .
" how you do puzzle me !
why , there are several boys i have n't been teasing ! "
the professor returned to his friend : and this time the voice said " tell her to bring them here  all of them ! "
" i ca'n't , and i wo n't !
" <name> exclaimed , the moment he reappeared .
" it 's <name> that 's crying : and he 's my brother : and , please , we both want to go : he ca'n't walk , you know : he 's  he 's dreaming , you know " ( this in a whisper , for fear of hurting my feelings ) .
" do let 's go through the <name> door ! "
" i 'll ask him , " said the professor , disappearing again .
he returned directly .
" he says you may .
follow me , and walk on <unk> . "
the difficulty with me would have been , just then , not to walk on <unk> .
it seemed very hard to reach down far enough to just touch the floor , as <name> led me through the study .
the professor went before us to unlock the <name> door .
i had just time to glance at the other professor , who was sitting reading , with his back to us , before the professor showed us out through the door , and locked it behind us .
<name> was standing with his hands over his face , crying bitterly .
[ image ... 'what 's the matter , darling ? ' ]
" what 's the matter , darling ? "
said <name> , with her arms round his neck .
" hurted mine self <unk> much ! "
sobbed the poor little fellow .
" i 'm so sorry , darling !
how ever did you manage to hurt yourself so ? "
" course i managed it ! "
said <name> , laughing through his tears .
" <unk> oo think nobody else but oo ca'n't manage things ? "
matters were looking distinctly brighter , now <name> had begun to argue .
" come , let 's hear all about it ! "
i said .
" my foot took it into its head to slip  " <name> began .
" a foot has n't got a head ! "
<name> put in , but all in vain .
" i <unk> down the bank .
and i <unk> over a stone .
and the stone hurted my foot !
and i trod on a <name> .
and the <name> <unk> my finger ! "
poor <name> sobbed again .
the complete list of woes was too much for his feelings .
" and it <unk> i did n't mean to trod on it ! "
he added , as the climax .
" that <name> should be ashamed of itself ! "
i said severely , and <name> hugged and kissed the wounded hero till all tears were dried .
" my finger 's quite <unk> now ! "
said <name> .
" why <unk> there be stones ?
mister sir , <unk> oo know ? "
" they 're good for something , " i said : " even if we do n't know what .
what 's the good of <unk> , now ? "
" <unk> ? "
said <name> .
" oh , they 're ever so pretty !
and stones are n't pretty , one bit .
would oo like some <unk> , mister sir ? "
" <name> ! "
<name> murmured reproachfully .
" you must n't say <unk> ' and 'sir , ' both at once !
remember what i told you ! "
" you <unk> me i were to say mister ' when i <unk> about him , and i were to say 'sir ' when i <unk> to him ! "
" well , you 're not doing both , you know . "
" ah , but i is doing <unk> , miss <unk> ! "
<name> exclaimed triumphantly .
" i <unk> to speak about the <unk>  and i <unk> to speak to the <unk> .
so a course i said <unk> sir ' ! "
" that 's all right , <name> , " i said .
" course it 's all right ! "
said <name> .
" <name> just knows nuffin at all ! "
" there never was an <unk> boy ! "
said <name> , frowning till her bright eyes were nearly invisible .
" and there never was an <unk> girl ! "
retorted <name> .
" come along and pick some <unk> .
that 's all she 's fit for ! "
he added in a very loud whisper to me .
" but why do you say <unk> , ' <name> ?
<unk> is the right word . "
" it 's because he jumps about so , " <name> said , laughing .
" yes , that 's it , " <name> assented .
" <name> tells me the words , and then , when i jump about , they get <unk> up in my head  till they 're all froth ! "
i expressed myself as perfectly satisfied with this explanation .
" but are n't you going to pick me any <unk> , after all ? "
" course we <name> ! "
cried <name> .
" come along , <name> ! "
and the happy children raced away , bounding over the turf with the fleetness and <name> of young antelopes .
" then you did n't find your way back to outland ? "
i said to the professor .
" oh yes , i did ! "
he replied , " we never got to queer street ; but i found another way .
i 've been backwards and forwards several times since then .
i had to be present at the election , you know , as the author of the new <unk> .
the emperor was so kind as to wish that i should have the credit of it .
'let come what come may , ' ( i remember the very words of the imperial speech ) 'if it should turn out that the warden is alive , you <name> bear witness that the change in the <unk> is the professor 's doing , not mine ! '
i never was so glorified in my life , before ! "
tears trickled down his cheeks at the recollection , which apparently was not wholly a pleasant one .
" is the warden supposed to be dead ? "
" well , it 's supposed so : but , mind you , i do n't believe it !
the evidence is very weak  mere <unk> .
a wandering jester , with a <unk> ( they found their way into the palace , one day ) has been telling people he comes from fairyland , and that the warden died there .
i wanted the vice-warden to question him , but , most unluckily , he and my <name> were always out walking when the jester came round .
yes , the warden 's supposed to be dead ! "
and more tears trickled down the old man 's cheeks .
" but what is the new <unk> ? "
the professor brightened up again .
" the emperor started the thing , " he said .
" he wanted to make everybody in outland twice as <name> as he was before just to make the new government popular .
only there wasn't nearly enough money in the treasury to do it .
so i suggested that he might do it by doubling the value of every coin and <unk> in outland .
it 's the simplest thing possible .
i wonder nobody ever thought of it before !
and you never saw such universal <name> .
the shops are full from morning to night .
everybody 's buying everything ! "
" and how was the <unk> done ? "
a sudden gloom overcast the professor 's jolly face .
" they did it as i went home after the election , " he mournfully replied .
" it was kindly meant but i did n't like it !
they waved flags all round me till i was nearly blind : and they rang bells till i was nearly deaf : and they strewed the road so thick with flowers that i lost my way ! "
and the poor old man sighed deeply .
" how far is it to outland ? "
i asked , to change the subject .
" about five days ' march .
but one must go back  occasionally .
you see , as <unk> , i have to be always in attendance on <name> uggug .
the empress would be very angry if i left him , even for an hour . "
" but surely , every time you come here , you are absent ten days , at least ? "
" oh , more than that ! "
the professor exclaimed .
" a fortnight , sometimes .
but of course i keep a memorandum of the exact time when i started , so that i can put the <unk> back to the very moment ! "
" excuse me , " i said .
" i do n't understand . "
silently the professor <name> front his pocket a square gold watch , with six or eight hands , and held it out for my inspection .
" this , " he began , " is an outlandish watch  " " so i should have thought . "
"  which has the peculiar property that , instead of its going with the time , the time goes with it .
i trust you understand me now ? "
" hardly , " i said .
" permit me to explain .
so long as it is let alone , it takes its own course .
time has no effect upon it . "
" i have known such watches , " i remarked .
" it goes , of course , at the usual rate .
only the time has to go with it .
hence , if i move the hands , i change the time .
to move them forwards , in advance of the true time , is impossible : but i can move them as much as a month backwards  that is the limit .
and then you have the events all over again  with any alterations experience may suggest . "
" what a blessing such a watch would be , " i thought , " in real life !
to be able to <unk> some heedless word  to undo some reckless deed !
might i see the thing done ? "
" with pleasure ! "
said the good <unk> professor .
" when i move this hand back to here , " pointing out the place , " history goes back fifteen minutes ! "
trembling with excitement , i watched him push the hand round as he described .
" hurted mine self <unk> much ! "
shrilly and suddenly the words rang in my ears , and , more startled than i cared to show , i turned to look for the speaker .
yes !
there was <name> , standing with the tears running down his cheeks , just as i had seen him a quarter of an hour ago ; and there was <name> with her arms round his neck !
i had not the heart to make the dear little fellow go through his troubles a second time , so hastily begged the professor to push the hands round into their former position .
in a moment <name> and <name> were gone again , and i could just see them in the far distance , picking <unk> . '
" wonderful , indeed ! "
i exclaimed .
" it has another property , yet more wonderful , " said the professor .
" you see this little <name> ?
that is called the <unk> <name> . '
if you push it in , the events of the next hour happen in the reverse order .
do not try it now .
i <name> lend you the watch for a few days , and you can amuse yourself with experiments . "
" thank you very much ! "
i said as he gave me the watch .
" i 'll take the greatest care of it  why , here are the children again ! "
" we could only but find six <unk> , " said <name> , putting them into my hands , " 'cause <name> said it were time to go back .
and here 's a big <unk> for <unk> !
we could n't only find but two ! "
" thank you : it 's very nice , " i said .
and i suppose you ate the other , <name> ? "
" no , i did n't , " <name> said , carelessly .
" are n't they pretty <unk> , mister sir ? "
" yes , very : but what makes you limp so , my child ? "
" mine foot 's come hurted again ! "
<name> mournfully replied .
and he sat down on the ground , and began nursing it .
the professor held his head between his hands  an attitude that i knew indicated distraction of mind .
" better rest a minute , " he said .
" it may be better then  or it may be worse .
if only i had some of my medicines here !
i 'm <unk> , you know , " he added , aside to me .
" shall i go and get you some blackberries , darling ? "
<name> whispered , with her arms round his neck ; and she kissed away a tear that was trickling down his cheek .
<name> brightened up in a moment .
" that are a good plan ! "
he exclaimed .
" i thinks my foot would come quite <unk> , if i <unk> a <unk>  two or three blackberries  six or seven blackberries  " <name> got up hastily .
" i 'd better go she said , aside to me , before he gets into the double figures !
let me come and help you , i said .
i can reach higher up than you can .
yes , please , said <name> , putting her hand into mine : and we walked off together .
<name> loves blackberries , she said , as we paced slowly along by a tall hedge , that looked a promising place for them , and it was so sweet of him to make me eat the only one !
oh , it was you that ate it , then ?
<name> did n't seem to like to tell me about it .
no ; i saw that , said <name> .
he 's always afraid of being praised .
but he made me eat it , really !
i would much rather he  oh , what 's that ?
and she clung to my hand , <unk> , as we came in sight of a hare , lying on its side with legs stretched out just in the entrance to the wood .
it 's a hare , my child .
perhaps it 's asleep .
no , it is n't asleep , <name> said , timidly going nearer to look at it : it 's eyes are open .
is it  is it  her voice dropped to an <unk> whisper , is it dead , do you think ? "
" yes , it 's quite dead , " i said , after stooping to examine it .
" poor thing !
i think it 's been hunted to death .
i know the <unk> were out yesterday .
but they have n't touched it .
perhaps they caught sight of another , and left it to die of fright and exhaustion . "
" hunted to death ? "
<name> repeated to herself , very slowly and sadly .
" i thought hunting was a thing they played at like a game .
<name> and i hunt <unk> : but we never hurt them when we catch them ! "
" sweet <name> ! "
i thought .
" how am i to get the idea of sport into your innocent mind ? "
and as we stood , <unk> , looking down at the dead hare , i tried to put the thing into such words as she could understand .
" you know what fierce <unk> lions and tigers are ? "
<name> nodded .
" well , in some countries men have to kill them , to save their own lives , you know . "
" yes , " said <name> : " if one tried to kill me , <name> would kill it if he could . "
" well , and so the men  the hunters  get to enjoy it , you know : the running , and the fighting , and the shouting , and the danger . "
" yes , " said <name> .
" <name> likes danger . "
" well , but , in this country , there are n't any lions and tigers , loose : so they hunt other creatures , you see . "
i hoped , but in vain , that this would satisfy her , and that she would ask no more questions .
" they hunt foxes , " <name> said , thoughtfully .
" and i think they kill them , too .
foxes are very fierce .
i daresay men do n't love them .
are hares fierce ? "
" no , " i said .
" a hare is a sweet , gentle , timid animal  almost as gentle as a lamb . "
" but , if men love hares , why  why  " her voice quivered , and her sweet eyes were brimming over with tears .
" i 'm afraid they do n't love them , dear child . "
" all children love them , " <name> said .
" all ladies love them . "
" i 'm afraid even ladies go to hunt them , sometimes . "
<name> shuddered .
' " oh , no , not ladies ! '
she earnestly pleaded .
" not <name> <name> ! "
" no , she never does , i 'm sure  but this is too sad a sight for you , dear .
let 's try and find some  " but <name> was not satisfied yet .
in a hushed , solemn tone , with bowed head and clasped hands , she put her final question .
" does god love hares ? "
" yes ! "
i said .
" i 'm sure he does !
he loves every living thing .
even sinful men .
how much more the animals , that can not sin ! "
" i do n't know what <unk> ' means , " said <name> .
and i did n't try to explain it .
" come , my child , " i said , trying to lead her away .
" wish good-bye to the poor hare , and come and look for blackberries . "
" good-bye , poor hare ! "
<name> obediently repeated , looking over her shoulder at it as we turned away .
and then , all in a moment , her self-command gave way .
pulling her hand out of mine , she ran back to where the dead hare was lying , and flung herself down at its side in such an agony of grief as i could hardly have believed possible in so young a child .
" oh , my darling , my darling ! "
she moaned , over and over again .
" and god meant your life to be so beautiful ! "
sometimes , but always keeping her face hidden on the ground , she would reach out one little hand , to stroke the poor dead thing , and then once more bury her face in her hands , and sob as if her heart would break .
[ image ... the dead hare ] i was afraid she would really make herself ill : still i thought it best to let her weep away the first sharp agony of grief : and , after a few minutes , the sobbing gradually ceased , and <name> rose to her feet , and looked calmly at me , though tears were still streaming down her cheeks .
i did not dare to speak again , just yet ; but simply held out my hand to her , that we might quit the melancholy spot .
yes , i 'll come now , she said .
very reverently she kneeled down , and kissed the dead hare ; then rose and gave me her hand , and we moved on in silence .
a child 's sorrow is violent but short ; and it was almost in her usual voice that she said after a minute " oh stop stop !
here are some lovely blackberries ! "
we filled our hands with fruit and returned in all haste to where the professor and <name> were seated on a bank awaiting our return .
just before we came within <unk> <name> checked me .
" please do n't tell <name> about the hare ! "
she said .
very well , my child .
but why not ?
tears again glittered in those sweet eyes and she turned her head away so that i could scarcely hear her reply .
" he 's  he 's very fond of gentle creatures you know .
and he 'd  he 'd be so sorry !
i do n't want him to be made sorry . "
and your agony of sorrow is to count for nothing , then , sweet unselfish child !
i thought to myself .
but no more was said till we had reached our friends ; and <name> was far too much engrossed , in the feast we had brought him , to take any notice of <name> 's unusually grave manner .
" i 'm afraid it 's getting rather late , professor ? "
i said .
" yes , indeed , " said the professor .
" i must take you all through the <name> door again .
you 've stayed your full time . "
" might n't we stay a little longer ! "
pleaded <name> .
" just one minute ! "
added <name> .
but the professor was <unk> .
" it 's a great privilege , coming through at all , " he said .
" we must go now . "
and we followed him obediently to the <name> door , which he threw open , and signed to me to go through first .
" you 're coming too , are n't you ? "
i said to <name> .
" yes , " she said : " but you wo n't see us after you 've gone through . "
" but suppose i wait for you outside ? "
i asked , as i stepped through the doorway .
" in that case , " said <name> , " i think the potato would be quite justified in asking your weight .
i can quite imagine a really superior <unk> declining to argue with any one under fifteen stone ! "
with a great effort i recovered the thread of my thoughts .
" we lapse very quickly into nonsense ! "
i said .
chapter 22 .
crossing the line .
" let us lapse back again , " said <name> <name> .
" take another cup of tea ?
i <name> that 's sound common sense ? "
" and all that strange adventure , " i thought , " has occupied the space of a single <unk> in <name> <name> 's speech !
a single <unk> , for which <unk> tell us to <unk> one ' ! "
( i felt no doubt that the professor had kindly put back the time for me , to the exact point at which i had gone to sleep . )
when , a few minutes afterwards , we left the house , <name> 's first remark was certainly a strange one .
" we 've been there just twenty minutes , " he said , " and i 've done nothing but listen to you and <name> <name> talking : and yet , somehow , i feel exactly as if i had been talking with her for an hour at least ! "
and so he had been , i felt no doubt : only , as the time had been put back to the beginning of the <unk> he referred to , the whole of it had passed into oblivion , if not into nothingness !
but i valued my own reputation for sanity too highly to venture on explaining to him what had happened .
for some cause , which i could not at the moment divine , <name> was unusually grave and silent during our walk home .
it could not be connected with <name> <unk> , i thought , as he had for some days been away in london : so that , having <name> <name> almost 'all to himself '  for i was only too glad to hear those two conversing , to have any wish to intrude any remarks of my own  he ought , theoretically , to have been specially radiant and contented with life .
" can he have heard any bad news ? "
i said to myself .
and , almost as if he had read my thoughts , he spoke .
" he <name> be here by the last train , " he said , in the tone of one who is continuing a conversation rather than beginning one .
" captain <unk> , do you mean ? "
" yes  captain <unk> , " said <name> : " i said 'he , ' because i fancied we were talking about him .
the <name> told me he comes tonight , though to-morrow is the day when he <name> know about the commission that he's hoping for .
i wonder he does n't stay another day to hear the result , if he 's really so anxious about it as the <name> believes he is . "
" he can have a telegram sent after him , " i said : " but it 's not very <unk> , running away from possible bad news ! "
" he 's a very good fellow , " said <name> : " but i confess it would be good news for me , if he got his commission , and his marching orders , all at once !
i wish him all happiness  with one exception .
good night ! "
( we had reached home by this time . )
" i 'm not good company to-night  better be alone . "
it was much the same , next day .
<name> declared he was n't fit for society , and i had to set forth alone for an <unk> .
i took the road to the station , and , at the point where the road from the <unk> ' joined it , i paused , seeing my friends in the distance , seemingly bound for the same goal .
" <name> you join us ? "
the <name> said , after i had exchanged greetings with him , and <name> <name> , and captain <unk> .
" this restless young man is expecting a telegram , and we are going to the station to meet it . "
" there is also a restless young woman in the case , " <name> <name> added .
" that goes without saying , my child , " said her father .
" women are always restless ! "
" for generous appreciation of all one 's best qualities , " his daughter impressively remarked , " there 's nothing to compare with a father , is there , <name> ? "
" cousins are not 'in it , ' " said <name> : and then somehow the conversation lapsed into two <unk> , the younger folk taking the lead , and the two old men following with less eager steps .
" and when are we to see your little friends again ? "
said the <name> .
" they are singularly attractive children . "
" i shall be delighted to bring them , when i can , " i said !
" but i do n't know , myself , when i am likely to see them again . "
" i 'm not going to question you , " said the <name> : " but there 's no harm in mentioning that <name> is simply tormented with curiosity !
we know most of the people about here , and she has been vainly trying to guess what house they can possibly be staying at . "
" some day i may be able to enlighten her : but just at present  " " thanks .
she must bear it as best she can .
i tell her it 's a grand opportunity for practising <name> .
but she hardly sees it from that point of view .
why , there are the children ! "
so indeed they were : waiting ( for us , apparently ) at a stile , which they could not have climbed over more than a few moments , as <name> <name> and her cousin had passed it without seeing them .
on catching sight of us , <name> ran to meet us , and to exhibit to us , with much pride , the handle of a <unk>  the blade having been broken off  which he had picked up in the road .
" and what shall you use it for , <name> ? "
i said .
" do n't know , " <name> carelessly replied : " must think . "
" a child 's first view of life , " the <name> remarked , with that sweet sad smile of his , " is that it is a period to be spent in accumulating portable property .
that view gets modified as the years glide away . "
and he held out his hand to <name> , who had placed herself by me , looking a little shy of him .
but the gentle old man was not one with whom any child , human or <name> , could be shy for long ; and she had very soon deserted my hand for his  <name> alone remaining faithful to his first friend .
we overtook the other couple just as they reached the station , and both <name> <name> and <name> greeted the children as old friends  the latter with the words " so you got to babylon by <unk> , after all ? "
" yes , and back again ! "
cried <name> .
<name> <name> looked from one to the other in blank astonishment .
" what , you know them , <name> ? "
she exclaimed .
" this mystery grows deeper every day ! "
" then we must be somewhere in the third act , " said <name> .
" you don't expect the mystery to be cleared up till the fifth act , do you ? "
" but it 's such a long drama ! "
was the plaintive reply .
" we must have got to the fifth act by this time ! "
" third act , i assure you , " said the young soldier mercilessly .
" scene , a <unk> .
lights down .
enter <name> ( in disguise , of course ) and faithful attendant .
this is the <name>  " ( taking <name> 's hand ) " and here stands his humble servant ! "
what is your <name> highness next <unk> ? "
and he made a most <unk> low bow to his puzzled little friend .
" oo 're not a servant ! "
<name> scornfully exclaimed .
" oo 're a <unk> ! "
" servant , i assure your <name> highness ! "
<name> respectfully insisted .
" allow me to mention to your <name> highness my various situations  past , present , and future . "
" what did oo begin <unk> ? "
<name> asked , beginning to enter into the jest .
" was oo a <unk> ? "
" lower than that , your <name> highness !
years ago , i offered myself as a slave  as a <unk> slave , ' i think it 's called ? "
he asked , turning to <name> <name> .
but <name> <name> heard him not : something had gone wrong with her glove , which entirely engrossed her attention .
" did oo get the place ? "
said <name> .
" sad to say , your <name> highness , i did not !
so i had to take a situation as  as waiter , which i have now held for some years haven't i ? "
he again glanced at <name> <name> .
" <name> dear , do help me to button this glove ! "
<name> <name> whispered , hastily stooping down , and failing to hear the question .
" and what <name> oo be next ? "
said <name> .
" my next place <name> , i <name> , be that of groom .
and after that  " " do n't puzzle the child so ! "
<name> <name> interrupted .
" what nonsense you talk ! "
"  after that , " <name> persisted , " i <name> to obtain the situation of housekeeper , which  fourth act ! "
he proclaimed , with a sudden change of tone .
" lights turned up .
red lights .
green lights .
distant rumble heard .
enter a <unk> ! "
and in another minute the train <name> up alongside of the platform , and a stream of passengers began to flow out from the <unk> office and <unk> .
" did you ever make real life into a drama ? "
said the <name> .
" now just try .
i 've often amused myself that way .
consider this platform as our stage .
good entrances and <unk> on both sides , you see .
capital background scene : real engine moving up and down .
all this bustle , and people passing to and fro , must have been most carefully rehearsed !
how naturally they do it !
with never a glance at the audience !
and every grouping is quite fresh , you see .
no repetition ! "
it really was admirable , as soon as i began to enter into it from this point of view .
even a <name> passing , with a barrow piled with luggage , seemed so realistic that one was tempted to applaud .
he was followed by an angry mother , with hot red face , dragging along two screaming children , and calling , to some one behind , " <name> !
come on ! "
enter <name> , very meek , very silent , and loaded with parcels .
and he was followed , in his turn , by a frightened little <unk> , carrying a fat baby , also screaming .
all the children screamed .
" capital <unk> ! "
said the old man aside .
" did you notice the <unk> 's look of terror ?
it was simply perfect ! "
" you have struck quite a new vein , " i said .
" to most of us life and its pleasures seem like a mine that is nearly worked out . "
" worked out ! "
exclaimed the <name> .
" for any one with true dramatic instincts , it is only the overture that is ended !
the real treat has yet to begin .
you go to a theatre , and pay your ten shillings for a stall , and what do you get for your money ?
perhaps it 's a dialogue between a couple of farmers  unnatural in their overdone caricature of farmers ' dress  more unnatural in their constrained attitudes and gestures  most unnatural in their attempts at ease and <unk> in their talk .
go instead and take a seat in a third-class <unk> , and you 'll get the same dialogue done to the life !
<unk>  no orchestra to block the view  and nothing to pay ! "
" which reminds me , " said <name> .
" there is nothing to pay on receiving a telegram !
shall we enquire for one ? "
and he and <name> <name> strolled off in the direction of the telegraph-office .
" i wonder if shakespeare had that thought in his mind , " i said , " when he wrote 'all the world 's a stage ' ? "
the old man sighed .
" and so it is , " he said , " look at it as you <name> .
life is indeed a drama ; a drama with but few <unk>  and no bouquets ! "
he added dreamily .
" we spend one half of it in <unk> the things we did in the other half ! "
" and the secret of enjoying it , " he continued , resuming his cheerful tone , " is intensity ! "
" but not in the modern <unk> sense , i presume ?
like the young <name> , in punch , who begins a conversation with 'are you intense ? ' "
" by no means ! "
replied the <name> .
" what i mean is intensity of thought  a concentrated attention .
we lose half the pleasure we might have in life , by not really attending .
take any instance you like : it does n't matter how trivial the pleasure may be  the principle is the same .
suppose a and b are reading the same second-rate <unk> novel .
a never troubles himself to master the relationships of the characters , on which perhaps all the interest of the story depends : he <unk> ' over all the descriptions of scenery , and every passage that looks rather dull : he does n't half attend to the passages he does read : he goes on reading merely from want of resolution to find another occupation  for hours after he ought to have put the book aside : and reaches the <unk> ' in a state of utter weariness and depression !
b puts his whole soul into the thing  on the principle that <unk> is worth doing is worth doing well ' : he masters the <unk> : he calls up pictures before his <unk> 's <unk> as he reads about the scenery : best of all , he resolutely shuts the book at the end of some chapter , while his interest is yet at its keenest , and turns to other subjects ; so that , when next he allows himself an hour at it , it is like a hungry man sitting down to dinner : and , when the book is finished , he returns to the work of his daily life like 'a giant refreshed ' ! "
" but suppose the book were really rubbish  nothing to repay attention ? "
" well , suppose it , " said the <name> .
" my theory meets that case , i assure you !
a never finds out that it is rubbish , but <unk> on to the end , trying to believe he 's enjoying himself .
b quietly shuts the book , when he 's read a dozen pages , walks off to the library , and changes it for a better !
i have yet another theory for adding to the enjoyment of life  that is , if i have not exhausted your <name> ?
i 'm afraid you find me a very garrulous old man . "
" no indeed ! "
i exclaimed earnestly .
and indeed i felt as if one could not easily tire of the sweet sadness of that gentle voice .
" it is , that we should learn to take our pleasures quickly , and our pains slowly . "
" but why ?
i should have put it the other way , myself . "
" by taking artificial pain  which can be as trivial as you please  slowly , the result is that , when real pain comes , however severe , all you need do is to let it go at its ordinary pace , and it's over in a moment ! "
" very true , " i said , " but how about the pleasure ? "
" why , by taking it quick , you can get so much more into life .
it takes you three hours and a half to hear and enjoy an opera .
suppose i can take it in , and enjoy it , in half-an-hour .
why , i can enjoy seven operas , while you are listening ; to one ! "
" always supposing you have an orchestra capable of playing them , " i said .
" and that orchestra has yet to be found ! "
the old man smiled .
" i have heard an 'air played , " he said , " and by no means a short one  played right through , variations and all , in three seconds ! "
" when ?
and how ? "
i asked eagerly , with a <unk> that i was dreaming again .
" it was done by a little <unk> , " he quietly replied .
" after it had been wound up , the <unk> , or something , broke , and it ran down , as i said , in about three seconds .
but it must have played all the notes , you know ! "
" did you enjoy it ?
i asked , with all the severity of a <unk> barrister .
" no , i did n't ! "
he candidly confessed .
" but then , you know , i hadn't been trained to that kind of music ! "
" i should much like to try your plan , " i said , and , as <name> and <name> happened to run up to us at the moment , i left them to keep the <name> company , and strolled along the platform , making each person and event play its part in an <unk> drama for my especial benefit .
" what , is the <name> tired of you already ? "
i said , as the children ran past me .
" no ! "
<name> replied with great emphasis .
" he wants the <unk> .
so <name> 's going to be a little <unk> ! "
" mind you charge a good price for it ! "
i called after them .
returning up the platform , i came upon <name> alone .
" well , child , " i said , " where 's your little <unk> ?
could n't he get you an <unk> ? "
" he went to get one at the <unk> at the other side , " said <name> ; " and he 's coming across the line with it  oh , <name> , you ought to cross by the bridge ! "
for the distant thud , thud , of the express was already audible .
suddenly a look of horror came over her face .
" oh , he 's fallen down on the rails ! "
she cried , and darted past me at a speed that quite defied the hasty effort i made to stop her .
but the <unk> old station-master happened to be close behind me : he was n't good for much , poor old man , but he was good for this ; and , before i could turn round , he had the child clasped in his arms , saved from the certain death she was rushing to .
so intent was i in watching this scene , that i hardly saw a flying figure in a light grey suit , who shot across from the back of the platform , and was on the line in another second .
so far as one could take note of time in such a moment of horror , he had about ten clear seconds , before the express would be upon him , in which to cross the rails and to pick up <name> .
whether he did so or not it was quite impossible to guess : the next thing one knew was that the express had passed , and that , whether for life or death , all was over .
when the cloud of dust had cleared away , and the line was once more visible , we saw with thankful hearts that the child and his deliverer were safe .
" all right ! "
<name> called to us cheerfully , as he recrossed the line .
" he 's more frightened than hurt ! "
[ image ... crossing the line ] he lifted the little fellow up into <name> <name> 's arms , and mounted the platform as gaily as if nothing had happened : but he was as pale as death , and leaned heavily on the arm i hastily offered him , fearing he was about to faint .
" i 'll just  sit down a moment  " he said dreamily : "  where 's <name> ? "
<name> ran to him , and flung her arms round his neck , sobbing as if her heart would break .
" do n't do that , my darling ! "
<name> murmured , with a strange look in his eyes .
" nothing to cry about now , you know .
but you very nearly got yourself killed for nothing ! "
" for <name> ! "
the little maiden sobbed .
" and he would have done it for me .
would n't you , <name> ? "
" course i would ! "
<name> said , looking round with a bewildered air .
<name> <name> kissed him in silence as she put him down out of her arms .
then she beckoned <name> to come and take his hand , and signed to the children to go back to where the <name> was seated .
" tell him , " she whispered with quivering lips , " tell him  all is well ! "
then she turned to the hero of the day .
" i thought it was death , " she said .
" thank god , you are safe !
did you see how near it was ? "
" i saw there was just time , <name> said lightly .
" a soldier must learn to <name> his life in his hand , you know .
i 'm all right now .
shall we go to the telegraph-office again ?
i daresay it 's come by this time . "
i went to join the <name> and the children , and we waited  almost in silence , for no one seemed inclined to talk , and <name> was <unk> on <name> 's lap  till the others joined us .
no telegram had come .
" i 'll take a stroll with the children , " i said , feeling that we were a little de <unk> , " and i 'll look in , in the course of the evening . "
" we must go back into the wood , now , " <name> said , as soon as we were out of hearing .
" we ca'n't stay this size any longer . "
" then you <name> be quite <name> fairies again , next time we meet ? "
" yes , " said <name> : " but we 'll be children again some day  if you'll let us .
<name> 's very anxious to see <name> <name> again . "
" she are <unk> nice , " said <name> .
" i shall be very glad to take you to see her again , " i said .
" had n't i better give you back the professor 's watch ?
it 'll be too large for you to <name> when you 're fairies , you know . "
<name> laughed merrily .
i was glad to see he had quite recovered from the terrible scene he had gone through .
" oh no , it wo n't ! "
he said .
" when we go small , it 'll go small ! "
" and then it 'll go straight to the professor , " <name> added , " and you wo n't be able to use it <unk> : so you 'd better use it all you can , now .
we must go small when the sun sets .
good-bye ! "
" good-bye ! "
cried <name> .
but their voices sounded very far away , and , when i looked round , both children had disappeared .
" and it wants only two hours to sunset ! "
i said as i strolled on .
" i must make the best of my time ! "
chapter 23 .
an outlandish watch .
as i entered the little town , i came upon two of the fishermen 's wives <unk> that last word " which never was the last " : and it occurred to me , as an experiment with the magic watch , to wait till the little scene was over , and then to <unk> ' it .
" well , good night <unk> !
and ye <unk> forget to send us word when your <name> writes ? "
" nay , ah <unk> forget .
an ' if she is n't suited , she can but coom back .
good night <unk> ! "
a casual observer might have thought " and there ends the dialogue ! "
that casual observer would have been mistaken .
" ah , she 'll like 'em , i <unk> ' ye !
they 'll not treat her bad , <name> may depend .
they 're <unk> canny <unk> .
good night ! "
" ay , they are that !
good night ! "
" good night !
and ye 'll send us word if she writes ? "
" aye , ah <name> , <name> may depend !
good night <unk> ! "
and at last they parted .
i waited till they were some twenty yards apart , and then put the watch a minute back .
the instantaneous change was startling : the two figures seemed to flash back into their former <unk> "
 is n't suited , she can but coom back .
good night <unk> ! "
one of them was saying : and so the whole dialogue was repeated , and , when they had parted for the second time , i let them go their several ways , and strolled on through the town .
" but the real usefulness of this magic power , " i thought , " would be to undo some harm , some painful event , some accident  " i had not long to wait for an opportunity of testing this property also of the magic watch , for , even as the thought passed through my mind , the accident i was imagining occurred .
a light cart was standing at the door of the 'great <unk> depot ' of <unk> , laden with <unk> <unk> , which the driver was carrying into the shop , one by one .
one of the cases had fallen into the street , but it scarcely seemed worth while to step forward and pick it up , as the man would be back again in a moment .
yet , in that moment , a young man riding a bicycle came sharp round the corner of the street and , in trying to avoid running over the box , upset his machine , and was thrown headlong against the wheel of the <unk> .
the driver ran out to his assistance , and he and i together raised the unfortunate <unk> and carried him into the shop .
his head was cut and bleeding ; and one knee seemed to be badly injured ; and it was speedily settled that he had better be conveyed at once to the only surgery in the place .
i helped them in emptying the cart , and placing in it some pillows for the wounded man to rest on ; and it was only when the driver had mounted to his place , and was starting for the surgery , that i bethought me of the strange power i possessed of <unk> all this harm .
" now is my time ! "
i said to myself , as i moved back the hand of the watch , and saw , almost without surprise this time , all things restored to the places they had occupied at the critical moment when i had first noticed the fallen packing-case .
instantly i stepped out into the street , picked up the box , and replaced it in the cart : in the next moment the bicycle had spun round the corner , passed the cart without let or hindrance , and soon vanished in the distance , in a cloud of dust .
" delightful power of magic ! "
i thought .
" how much of human suffering i have  not only relieved , but actually annihilated ! "
and , in a glow of conscious virtue , i stood watching the unloading of the cart , still holding the magic watch open in my hand , as i was curious to see what would happen when we again reached the exact time at which i had put back the hand .
the result was one that , if only i had considered the thing carefully , i might have foreseen : as the hand of the watch touched the <name> , the <unk>  which had driven off , and was by this time half-way down the street , was back again at the door , and in the act of starting , while  oh woe for the golden dream of world-wide benevolence that had dazzled my dreaming fancy !  the wounded youth was once more reclining on the heap of pillows , his pale face set rigidly in the hard lines that told of pain resolutely endured .
" oh mocking magic watch ! "
i said to myself , as i passed out of the little town , and took the seaward road that led to my lodgings .
" the good i fancied i could do is vanished like a dream : the evil of this troublesome world is the only abiding reality ! "
and now i must record an experience so strange , that i think it only fair , before beginning to relate it , to release my <unk> reader from any obligation he may feel to believe this part of my story .
i would not have believed it , i freely confess , if i had not seen it with my own eyes : then why should i expect it of my reader , who , quite possibly , has never seen anything of the sort ?
i was passing a pretty little villa , which stood rather back from the road , in its own grounds , with bright flower-beds in front  creepers wandering over the walls and hanging in <unk> about the <unk>  an easy-chair forgotten on the lawn , with a newspaper lying near it  a small <unk> " <unk> " before it , resolved to guard the treasure even at the sacrifice of life  and a <unk> standing <unk> <unk> .
" here is my chance , " i thought , " for testing the reverse action of the magic watch ! "
i pressed the <unk> ' and walked in .
in another house , the entrance of a stranger might cause surprise  perhaps anger , even going so far as to expel the said stranger with violence : but here , i knew , nothing of the sort could happen .
the ordinary course of events first , to think nothing about me ; then , hearing my footsteps to look up and see me ; and then to wonder what business i had there  would be reversed by the action of my watch .
they would first wonder who i was , then see me , then look down , and think no more about me .
and as to being expelled with violence , that event would necessarily come first in this case .
" so , if i can once get in , " i said to myself , " all risk of expulsion <name> be over ! "
[ image ... 'the <unk> sat up ' ] the <unk> sat up , as a <unk> measure , as i passed ; but , as i took no notice of the treasure he was guarding , he let me go by without even one <unk> bark .
" he that takes my life , " he seemed to be saying , <unk> , to himself , " takes trash : but he that takes the daily telegraph  ! "
but this awful contingency i did not face .
the party in the drawing-room  i had walked straight in , you understand , without ringing the <name> , or giving any notice of my approach  consisted of four laughing <name> children , of ages from about fourteen down to ten , who were , apparently , all coming towards the door ( i found they were really walking backwards ) , while their mother , seated by the fire with some <unk> on her lap , was saying , just as i entered the room , " now , girls , you may get your things on for a walk . "
to my utter astonishment  for i was not yet accustomed to the action of the watch " all smiles ceased ' , ( as browning says ) on the four pretty faces , and they all got out pieces of <unk> , and sat down .
no one noticed me in the least , as i quietly took a chair and sat down to watch them .
when the <unk> had been unfolded , and they were all ready to begin , their mother said " come , that 's done , at last !
you may fold up your work , girls . "
but the children took no notice whatever of the remark ; on the contrary , they set to work at once sewing  if that is the proper word to describe an operation such as i had never before witnessed .
each of them threaded her needle with a short end of thread attached to the work , which was instantly pulled by an invisible force through the stuff , dragging the needle after it : the nimble fingers of the little <unk> caught it at the other side , but only to lose it again the next moment .
and so the work went on , steadily <unk> itself , and the <unk> little dresses , or whatever they were , steadily falling to pieces .
now and then one of the children would pause , as the recovered thread became <unk> long , wind it on a <unk> , and start again with another short end .
at last all the work was picked to pieces and put away , and the <name> led the way into the next room , walking backwards , and making the insane remark " not yet , dear : we must get the sewing done first . "
after which , i was not surprised to see the children skipping backwards after her , exclaiming " oh , mother , it is such a lovely day for a walk ! "
in the dining-room , the table had only dirty plates and empty dishes on it .
however the party  with the addition of a gentleman , as good-natured , and as <name> , as the children  seated themselves at it very contentedly .
you have seen people eating <unk> , and every now and then cautiously conveying a <unk> from their lips to their plates ?
well , something like that went on all through this ghastly  or shall we say <unk> ' ?  banquet .
an empty fork is raised to the lips : there it receives a <unk> piece of mutton , and swiftly conveys it to the plate , where it instantly attaches itself to the mutton already there .
soon one of the plates , furnished with a complete slice of mutton and two potatoes , was handed up to the presiding gentleman , who quietly replaced the slice on the joint , and the potatoes in the dish .
their conversation was , if possible , more bewildering than their mode of dining .
it began by the youngest girl suddenly , and without provocation , addressing her eldest sister .
" oh , you wicked story-teller ! "
she said .
i expected a sharp reply from the sister ; but , instead of this , she turned laughingly to her father , and said , in a very loud <unk> , " to be a bride ! "
the father , in order to do his part in a conversation that seemed only fit for lunatics , replied " whisper it to me , dear . "
but she did n't whisper ( these children never did anything they were told ) : she said , quite loud , " of course not !
everybody knows what <name> wants ! "
and little <name> shrugged her shoulders , and said , with a pretty <unk> , " now , father , you 're not to tease !
you know i do n't want to be <unk> to anybody ! "
" and <name> 's to be the fourth , " was her father 's idiotic reply .
here number three put in her oar .
" oh , it is settled , mother dear , really and truly !
<name> told us all about it .
it 's to be next tuesday four weeks  and three of her cousins are coming ; to be <unk>  and  " " she does n't forget it , <name> ! "
the mother laughingly replied .
" i do wish they 'd get it settled !
i do n't like long engagements . "
and <name> wound up the conversation  if so chaotic a series of remarks deserves the name  with " only think !
we passed the cedars this morning , just exactly as <name> <unk> was standing at the gate , wishing good-bye to mister  i forget his name .
of course we looked the other way . "
by this time i was so hopelessly confused that i gave up listening , and followed the dinner down into the kitchen .
but to you , o <unk> reader , resolute to believe no item of this weird adventure , what need to tell how the mutton was placed on the spit , and slowly <unk>  how the potatoes were wrapped in their skins , and handed over to the gardener to be buried  how , when the mutton had at length attained to <unk> , the fire , which had gradually changed from <unk> to a mere blaze , died down so suddenly that the cook had only just time to catch its last flicker on the end of a match  or how the maid , having taken the mutton off the spit , carried it ( backwards , of course ) out of the house , to meet the butcher , who was coming ( also backwards ) down the road ?
the longer i thought over this strange adventure , the more hopelessly tangled the mystery became : and it was a real relief to meet <name> in the road , and get him to go with me up to the hall , to learn what news the telegraph had brought .
i told him , as we went , what had happened at the station , but as to my further adventures i thought it best , for the present , to say nothing .
the <name> was sitting alone when we entered .
" i am glad you are come in to keep me company , " he said .
" <name> is gone to bed  the excitement of that terrible scene was too much for her  and <name> has gone to the hotel to pack his things , to start for london by the early train . "
" then the telegram has come ? "
i said .
" did you not hear ?
oh , i had forgotten : it came in after you left the station .
yes , it 's all right : <name> has got his commission ; and , now that he has arranged matters with <name> , he has business in town that must be seen to at once . "
" what arrangement do you mean ? "
i asked with a sinking heart , as the thought of <name> 's crushed hopes came to my mind .
" do you mean that they are engaged ? "
" they have been engaged  in a sense  for two years , " the old man gently replied : " that is , he has had my promise to consent to it , so soon as he could secure a permanent and settled line in life .
i could never be happy with my child married to a man without an object to live for  without even an object to die for ! "
" i <name> they <name> be happy , " a strange voice said .
the speaker was evidently in the room , but i had not heard the door open , and i looked round in some astonishment .
the <name> seemed to share my surprise .
" who spoke ? "
he exclaimed .
" it was i , " said <name> , looking at us with a worn , haggard face , and eyes from which the light of life seemed suddenly to have faded .
" and let me wish you <name> also , dear friend , " he added , looking sadly at the <name> , and speaking in the same hollow tones that had startled us so much .
" thank you , " the old man said , simply and heartily .
a silence followed : then i rose , feeling sure that <name> would wish to be alone , and bade our gentle host 'good night ' : <name> took his hand , but said nothing : nor did he speak again , as we went home till we were in the house and had lit our <unk> candles .
then he said more to himself than to me " the heart knoweth its own bitterness .
i never understood those words till now . "
the next few days passed wearily enough .
i felt no inclination to call by myself at the hall ; still less to propose that <name> should go with me : it seemed better to wait till time  that gentle healer of our bitterest sorrows should have helped him to recover from the first shock of the disappointment that had blighted his life .
business however soon demanded my presence in town ; and i had to announce to <name> that i must leave him for a while .
" but i <name> to run down again in a month i added .
i would stay now , if i could .
i do n't think it 's good for you to be alone .
no , i ca'n't face solitude , here , for long , said <name> .
but don't think about me .
i have made up my mind to accept a post in <name> , that has been offered me .
out there , i suppose i shall find something to live for ; i ca'n't see anything at present .
'this life of mine i guard , as god 's high gift , from <unk> and wrong , not greatly care to lose ! ' "
" yes , " i said : " your <unk> bore as heavy a blow , and lived through it . "
" a far heavier one than mine , said <name> .
" the woman he loved proved false .
there is no such cloud as that on my memory of  of  " he left the name <unk> , and went on hurriedly .
" but you <name> return , <name> you not ? "
" yes , i shall come back for a short time . "
" do , " said <name> : " and you shall write and tell me of our friends .
i 'll send you my address when i 'm settled down . "
chapter 24 .
the frogs ' <unk> .
and so it came to pass that , just a week after the day when my <unk> first appeared as children , i found myself taking a <unk> through the wood , in the <name> of meeting them once more .
i had but to stretch myself on the smooth turf , and the <unk> feeling was on me in a moment .
" put oor ear <unk> low down , " said <name> , " and i 'll tell oo a secret !
it 's the frogs ' <unk>  and we 've lost the baby ! "
" what baby ? "
i said , quite bewildered by this complicated piece of news .
" the <name> 's baby , a course ! "
said <name> .
" <unk> 's baby .
and <unk> <unk> sorry .
<name> , she 's  oh so sorry ! "
" how sorry is she ? "
i asked , mischievously .
" three-quarters of a yard , " <name> replied with perfect solemnity .
" and i 'm a little sorry too , " he added , shutting his eyes so as not to see that he was smiling .
" and what are you doing about the baby ? "
" well , the soldiers are all looking for it  up and down everywhere . "
" the soldiers ? "
i exclaimed .
" yes , a course ! "
said <name> .
" when there 's no fighting to be done , the soldiers <unk> any little odd jobs , oo know . "
i was amused at the idea of its being a 'little odd job ' to find the <name> baby .
" but how did you come to lose it ? "
i asked .
" we put it in a flower , " <name> , who had just joined us , explained with her eyes full of tears .
" only we ca'n't remember which ! "
" she says us put it in a flower , " <name> interrupted , " 'cause she <unk> want i to get punished .
but it were really me what put it there .
<name> were picking <unk> . "
[ image ... the <name> 's baby ] " you should n't say <unk> put it in a flower ' , " <name> very gravely remarked .
" well , <unk> , then , " said <name> .
" i never can remember those horrid h 's ! "
" let me help you to look for it , " i said .
so <name> and i made a <unk> of discovery ' among all the flowers ; but there was no baby to be seen .
" what 's become of <name> ? "
i said , when we had completed our tour .
" he 's down in the ditch there , " said <name> , " amusing a young frog . "
i went down on my hands and knees to look for him , for i felt very curious to know how young frogs ought to be amused .
after a <unk> search , i found him sitting at the edge of the ditch , by the side of the little frog , and looking rather disconsolate .
" how are you getting on , <name> ? "
i said , nodding to him as he looked up .
" ca'n't amuse it no more , " <name> answered , very dolefully , " 'cause it wo n't say what it would like to do next !
i 've showed it all the <unk>  and a live <unk>   but it wo n't say nuffin !
what  would oo like ? '
he shouted into the ear of the frog : but the little creature sat quite still , and took no notice of him .
" it 's deaf , i think ! "
<name> said , turning away with a sigh .
" and it 's time to get the theatre ready . "
" who are the audience to be ? "
" only but frogs , " said <name> .
" but they have n't <unk> yet .
they wants to be drove up , like sheep . "
" would it save time , " i suggested , " if i were to walk round with <name> , to drive up the frogs , while you get the theatre ready ? "
" that are a good plan ! "
cried <name> .
" but where are <name> ? "
" i 'm here ! "
said <name> , peeping over the edge of the bank .
" i was just watching two frogs that were having a race . "
" which won it ?
" <name> eagerly inquired .
<name> was puzzled .
" he does ask such hard questions ! "
she confided to me .
" and what 's to happen in the theatre ? "
i asked .
" first they have their <unk> , " <name> said : " then <name> does some bits of shakespeare ; then he tells them a story . "
" i should think the frogs like the feast best .
do n't they ? "
" well , there 's generally very few of them that get any .
they <name> keep their mouths shut so tight !
and it 's just as well they do , " she added , " because <name> likes to cook it himself : and he cooks very queerly . "
now they 're all in .
would you just help me to put them with their heads the right way ? "
we soon managed this part of the business , though the frogs kept up a most discontented croaking all the time .
" what are they saying ? "
i asked <name> .
" they 're saying <unk> !
fork ! '
it 's very silly of them !
you 're not going to have forks ! "
she announced with some severity .
" those that want any feast have just got to open their mouths , and <name> 'll put some of it in ! "
at this moment <name> appeared , wearing a little white apron to show that he was a cook , and carrying a <unk> full of very <unk> soup .
i watched very carefully as he moved about among the frogs ; but i could not see that any of them opened their mouths to be fed  except one very young one , and i 'm nearly sure it did it accidentally , in yawning .
however <name> instantly put a large spoonful of soup into its mouth , and the poor little thing coughed violently for some time .
so <name> and i had to share the soup between us , and to pretend to enjoy it , for it certainly was very queerly cooked .
i only ventured to take one spoonful of it ( " <name> 's <unk> , " <name> said it was ) , and must candidly confess that it was not at all nice ; and i could not feel surprised that so many of the guests had kept their mouths shut up tight .
" what 's the soup made of , <name> ? "
said <name> , who had put a spoonful of it to her lips , and was making a wry face over it .
and <name> 's answer was anything but encouraging .
" bits of things ! "
the entertainment was to conclude with " bits of shakespeare , " as <name> expressed it , which were all to be done by <name> , <name> being fully engaged in making the frogs keep their heads towards the stage : after which <name> was to appear in his real character , and tell them a story of his own invention .
" <name> the story have a moral to it ? "
i asked <name> , while <name> was away behind the hedge , dressing for the first <unk> . '
" i think so , " <name> replied doubtfully .
" there generally is a moral , only he puts it in too soon . "
" and <name> he say all the bits of shakespeare ? "
" no , he 'll only act them , " said <name> .
" he knows hardly any of the words .
when i see what he 's dressed like , i 've to tell the frogs what character it is .
they 're always in such a hurry to guess !
do n't you hear them all saying 'what ?
what ? ' "
and so indeed they were : it had only sounded like croaking , till <name> explained it , but i could now make out the " <unk> ?
<unk> ? "
quite distinctly .
" but why do they try to guess it before they see it ? "
" i do n't know , " <name> said : " but they always do .
sometimes they begin guessing weeks and weeks before the day ! "
( so now , when you hear the frogs croaking in a particularly melancholy way , you may be sure they 're trying to guess <name> 's next shakespeare <unk> ' .
is n't that interesting ? )
however , the chorus of guessing was cut short by <name> , who suddenly rushed on from behind the scenes , and took a flying leap down among the frogs , to <unk> them .
for the oldest and <unk> frog  who had never been properly arranged so that he could see the stage , and so had no idea what was going on  was getting restless , and had upset several of the frogs , and turned others round with their heads the wrong way .
and it was no good at all , <name> said , to do a <unk> ' of shakespeare when there was nobody to look at it ( you see he did n't count me as anybody ) .
so he set to work with a stick , stirring them up , very much as you would stir up tea in a cup , till most of them had at least one great stupid eye gazing at the stage .
" oo must come and sit among them , <name> , " he said in despair , " i've put these two <unk> , with their noses the same way , ever so many times , but they do <unk> so ! "
so <name> took her place as <unk> of the ceremonies , ' and <name> vanished again behind the scenes , to dress for the first <unk> . '
" hamlet ! "
was suddenly proclaimed , in the clear sweet tones i knew so well .
the croaking all ceased in a moment , and i turned to the stage , in some curiosity to see what <name> 's ideas were as to the behaviour of shakespeare 's greatest character .
according to this eminent interpreter of the drama , hamlet wore a short black cloak ( which he chiefly used for <unk> up his face , as if he suffered a good deal from toothache ) , and turned out his toes very much as he walked .
" to be or not to be ! "
hamlet remarked in a cheerful tone , and then turned <unk> several times , his cloak dropping off in the performance .
i felt a little disappointed : <name> 's <name> of the part seemed so wanting in dignity .
" wo n't he say any more of the speech ? "
i whispered to <name> .
" i think not , " <name> whispered in reply .
" he generally turns <unk> when he does n't know any more words . "
<name> had meanwhile settled the question by disappearing from the stage ; and the frogs instantly began inquiring the name of the next character .
" you 'll know directly ! "
cried <name> , as she adjusted two or three young frogs that had struggled round with their backs to the stage .
" <unk> ! "
she added , as <name> <unk> .
<unk> had something twisted round him , that went over one shoulder and under the other arm , and was meant , i believe , for a scotch <unk> .
he had a thorn in his hand , which he held out at arm 's length , as if he were a little afraid of it .
" is this a dagger ? "
<unk> inquired , in a puzzled sort of tone : and instantly a chorus of " thorn !
thorn ! "
arose from the frogs ( i had quite learned to understand their croaking by this time ) .
" it 's a dagger ! "
<name> proclaimed in a peremptory tone .
" hold your tongues ! "
and the croaking ceased at once .
shakespeare has not told us , so far as i know , that <unk> had any such eccentric habit as turning <unk> in private life : but <name> evidently considered it quite an essential part of the character , and left the stage in a series of <unk> .
however , he was back again in a few moments , having tucked under his <name> the end of a tuft of wool ( probably left on the thorn by a wandering sheep ) , which made a magnificent beard , that reached nearly down to his feet .
" <unk> ! "
<name> proclaimed .
" no , i beg your pardon ! "
she hastily corrected herself , " king lear !
i had n't noticed the crown . "
( <name> had very cleverly provided one , which fitted him exactly , by cutting out the centre of a <unk> to make room for his head . )
king lear folded his arms ( to the imminent peril of his beard ) and said , in a mild explanatory tone , " ay , every inch a king ! "
and then paused , as if to consider how this could best be proved .
and here , with all possible deference to <name> as a <unk> critic , i must express my opinion that the poet did not mean his three great tragic heroes to be so strangely alike in their personal habits ; nor do i believe that he would have accepted the faculty of turning <unk> as any proof at all of <name> descent .
yet it appeared that king lear , after deep meditation , could think of no other argument by which to prove his kingship : and , as this was the last of the <unk> of shakespeare ( " we never do more than three , " <name> explained in a whisper ) , <name> gave the audience quite a long series of <unk> before he finally retired , leaving the <unk> frogs all crying out " more !
more ! "
which i suppose was their way of <unk> a performance .
but <name> would n't appear again , till the proper time came for telling the story .
[ image ... the frogs ' <unk> ] when he appeared at last in his real character , i noticed a remarkable change in his behaviour .
he tried no more <unk> .
it was clearly his opinion that , however suitable the habit of turning <unk> might be to such petty individuals as hamlet and king lear , it would never do for <name> to sacrifice his dignity to such an extent .
but it was equally clear that he did not feel entirely at his ease , standing all alone on the stage , with no costume to disguise him : and though he began , several times , " there were a mouse  , " he kept glancing up and down , and on all sides , as if in search of more comfortable quarters from which to tell the story .
standing on one side of the stage , and partly overshadowing it , was a tall <unk> , which seemed , as the evening breeze gently swayed it hither and thither , to offer exactly the sort of accommodation that the orator desired .
having once decided on his quarters , it needed only a second or two for him to run up the stem like a <name> squirrel , and to seat himself astride on the topmost bend , where the <unk> clustered most closely , and from whence he could look down on his audience from such a height that all shyness vanished , and he began his story merrily .
" once there were a mouse and a crocodile and a man and a goat and a lion . "
i had never heard the <unk> <unk> ' tumbled into a story with such profusion and in such reckless haste ; and it fairly took my breath away .
even <name> gave a little gasp , and allowed three of the frogs , who seemed to be getting tired of the entertainment , to hop away into the ditch , without attempting to stop them .
" and the mouse found a shoe , and it thought it were a <unk> .
so it got right in , and it stayed in ever so long . "
" why did it stay in ? "
said <name> .
her function seemed to be much the same as that of the chorus in a greek play : she had to encourage the orator , and draw him out , by a series of intelligent questions .
" 'cause it thought it could n't get out again , " <name> explained .
" it were a clever mouse .
it knew it could n't get out of traps ! "
but why did it go in at all ? "
said <unk> "
 and it <unk> , and it <unk> , " <name> proceeded , ignoring this question , " and at last it got right out again .
and it looked at the <name> in the shoe .
and the man 's name were in it .
so it knew it was n't its own shoe . "
" had it thought it was ? "
said <name> .
" why , did n't i tell oo it thought it were a <unk> ? "
the indignant orator replied .
" please , mister sir , <name> oo make <name> attend ? "
<name> was silenced , and was all attention : in fact , she and i were most of the audience now , as the frogs kept hopping away , and there were very few of them left .
" so the mouse gave the man his shoe .
and the man were <unk> glad , cause he had n't got but one shoe , and he were hopping to get the other . "
here i ventured on a question .
" do you mean <unk> , ' or <unk> ' ? "
" <unk> , " said <name> .
" and the man took the goat out of the sack . "
( " we have n't heard of the sack before , " i said .
" nor you wo n't hear of it again , " said <name> ) .
" and he said to the goat , 'oo <name> walk about here till i comes back . '
and he went and he tumbled into a deep hole .
and the goat walked round and round .
and it walked under the tree .
and it <unk> its tail .
and it looked up in the tree .
and it sang a sad little song .
oo never heard such a sad little song ! "
" can you sing it , <name> ? "
i asked .
" <unk> , i can , " <name> readily replied .
" and i <unk> .
it would make <name> cry  " " it would n't !
' , <name> interrupted in great indignation .
" and i do n't believe the goat sang it at all ! "
" it did , though ! "
said <name> .
" it singed it right <unk> .
i sawed it singing with its long beard  " " it could n't sing with its beard , " i said , hoping to puzzle the little fellow : " a beard is n't a voice . "
" well then , oo could n't walk with <name> ! "
<name> cried triumphantly .
" <name> is n't a foot ! "
i thought i had better follow <name> 's example , and be silent for a while .
<name> was too sharp for us .
" and when it had singed all the song , it ran away  for to get along to look for the man , oo know .
and the crocodile got along after it  for to bite it , oo know .
and the mouse got along after the crocodile . "
" was n't the crocodile running ? "
<name> enquired .
she appealed to me .
" crocodiles do run , do n't they ? "
i suggested " crawling " as the proper word .
" he was n't running , " said <name> , " and he was n't crawling .
he went struggling along like a <unk> .
and he held his <name> ever so high in the air  " " what did he do that for ? "
said <name> .
" 'cause he had n't got a <unk> ! "
said <name> .
" ca'n't oo make out nuffin <unk> i <unk> it ?
why , if he 'd had a <unk> , a course he'd have held his head down  like this  and he 'd have put a lot of warm blankets round it ! "
" if he 'd had any blankets , " <name> argued .
" course he had blankets ! "
retorted her brother .
" <unk> oo think crocodiles goes walks <unk> blankets ?
and he frowned with his eyebrows .
and the goat was <unk> <unk> at his eyebrows ! "
" i 'd never be afraid of eyebrows ? "
exclaimed <name> .
" i should think oo would , though , if they 'd got a crocodile fastened to them , like these had !
and so the man <unk> , and he <unk> , and at last he got right out of the hole . "
<name> gave another little gasp : this rapid dodging about among the characters of the story had taken away her breath .
" and he <unk> away for to look for the goat , oo know .
and he heard the lion grunting   " " lions do n't grunt , " said <name> .
" this one did , " said <name> .
" and its mouth were like a large cupboard .
and it had plenty of room in its mouth .
and the lion <unk> after the man for to eat him , oo know .
and the mouse <unk> after the lion . "
" but the mouse was running after the crocodile , " i said : " he couldn't run after both ! "
<name> sighed over the density of his audience , but explained very patiently .
" he did <unk> after <unk> : 'cause they went the same way !
and first he caught the crocodile , and then he did n't catch the lion .
and when he 'd caught the crocodile , what <unk> oo think he did  'cause he 'd got pincers in his pocket ? "
" i ca'n't guess , " said <name> .
[ image ... 'he wrenched out that crocodile 's <unk> ! ' ]
" nobody could n't guess it ! "
<name> cried in high glee .
" why , he wrenched out that crocodile 's <unk> ! "
" which tooth ? "
i ventured to ask .
but <name> was not to be puzzled .
" the <unk> he were going to bite the goat with , a course ! "
" he could n't be sure about that , " i argued , " unless he wrenched out all its teeth . "
<name> laughed merrily , and half sang , as he swung himself backwards and forwards , " he did  wrenched  out  all its <unk> ! "
" why did the crocodile wait to have them wrenched out ? "
said <name> .
" it had to wait , " said <name> .
i ventured on another question .
" but what became of the man who said 'you may wait here till i come back ' ? "
" he did n't say 'oo may , ' " <name> explained .
" he said , 'oo <name> . '
just like <name> says to me 'oo <name> do oor lessons till twelve o'clock . '
oh , i wiss , " he added with a little sigh , " i wiss <name> would say 'oo may do oor lessons ' ! "
this was a dangerous subject for discussion , <name> seemed to think .
she returned to the story .
" but what became of the man ? "
" well , the lion <unk> at him .
but it came so slow , it were three weeks in the air  " " did the man wait for it all that time ? "
i said .
" course he did n't ! "
<name> replied , gliding <unk> down the stem of the <unk> , for the story was evidently close to its end .
" he sold his house , and he packed up his things , while the lion were coming .
and he went and he lived in another town .
so the lion ate the wrong man . "
this was evidently the moral : so <name> made her final proclamation to the frogs .
" the story 's finished !
and whatever is to be learned from it , " she added , aside to me , " i 'm sure i do n't know ! "
i did not feel quite clear about it myself , so made no suggestion : but the frogs seemed quite content , moral or no moral , and merely raised a husky chorus of " off !
off ! "
as they hopped away .
chapter 25 .
looking eastward .
" it 's just a week , " i said , three days later , to <name> , " since we heard of <name> <name> 's engagement .
i think i ought to call , at any rate , and offer my congratulations .
wo n't you come with me ? "
a pained expression passed over his face .
" when must you leave us ? "
he asked .
" by the first train on monday . "
" well  yes , i <name> come with you .
it would seem strange and unfriendly if i did n't .
but this is only friday .
give me till <name> afternoon .
i shall be stronger then . "
shading his eyes with one hand , as if <unk> of the tears that were coursing down his cheeks , he held the other out to me .
it trembled as i clasped it .
i tried to frame some words of sympathy ; but they seemed poor and cold , and i left them unspoken .
" good night ! "
was all i said .
" good night , dear friend ! "
he replied .
there was a manly vigour in his tone that convinced me he was wrestling with , and <unk> over , the great sorrow that had so nearly wrecked his life  and that , on the <unk> of his dead self , he would surely rise to higher things !
there was no chance , i was glad to think , as we set out on <name> afternoon , of meeting <name> at the hall , as he had returned to town the day after his engagement was announced .
his presence might have disturbed the calm  the almost unnatural calm  with which <name> met the woman who had won his heart , and murmured the few graceful words of sympathy that the occasion demanded .
<name> <name> was perfectly radiant with happiness : sadness could not live in the light of such a smile : and even <name> brightened under it , and , when she remarked " you see i 'm watering my flowers , though it is the <unk> , " his voice had almost its old ring of cheerfulness as he replied " even on the <unk> works of <name> are allowed .
but this is n't the <unk> .
the <unk> has ceased to exist . "
" i know it 's not saturday , " <name> <name> replied ; " but is n't <name> often called 'the <name> sabbath ' ? "
" it is so called , i think , in recognition of the spirit of the jewish institution , that one day in seven should be a day of rest .
but i hold that christians are freed from the literal observance of the fourth commandment . "
" then where is our authority for <name> observance ? "
" we have , first , the fact that the seventh day was <unk> ' , when god rested from the work of creation .
that is binding on us as <unk> .
secondly , we have the fact that 'the lord 's day ' is a <name> institution .
that is binding on us as christians . "
" and your practical rules would be  ? "
" first , as <unk> , to keep it holy in some special way , and to make it , so far as is reasonably possible , a day of rest .
secondly , as christians , to attend public worship . "
" and what of amusements ? "
" i would say of them , as of all kinds of work , whatever is innocent on a week-day , is innocent on <name> , provided it does not interfere with the duties of the day . "
" then you would allow children to play on <name> ? "
" certainly i should .
why make the day irksome to their restless natures ? "
" i have a letter somewhere , " said <name> <name> , " from an old friend , describing the way in which <name> was kept in her younger days .
i <name> fetch it for you . "
" i had a similar description , <name> voce , years ago , " <name> said when she had left us , " from a little girl .
it was really touching to hear the melancholy tone in which she said 'on <name> i must n't play with my doll !
on <name> i must n't run on the sands !
on <name> i must n't dig in the garden ! '
poor child !
she had indeed abundant cause for hating <name> ! "
" here is the letter , " said <name> <name> , returning .
" let me read you a piece of it . "
" when , as a child , i first opened my eyes on a <unk> , a feeling of dismal anticipation , which began at least on the friday , <unk> .
i knew what was before me , and my wish , if not my word , was 'would god it were evening ! '
it was no day of rest , but a day of texts , of <unk> ( <unk> ' ) , of tracts about converted <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> deaths of sinners saved .
" up with the lark , hymns and portions of scripture had to be learned by heart till 8 o'clock , when there were <unk> , then breakfast , which i was never able to enjoy , partly from the fast already undergone , and partly from the outlook i dreaded .
" at 9 came sunday-school ; and it made me indignant to be put into the class with the <unk> , as well as alarmed lest , by some mistake of mine , i should be put below them .
" the <unk> was a veritable wilderness of <unk> .
i wandered in it , pitching the <unk> of my thoughts on the lining of the square <unk> , the <unk> of my small brothers , and the horror of knowing that , on the monday , i should have to write out , from memory , <unk> of the rambling disconnected <unk> sermon , which might have had any text but its own , and to stand or fall by the result .
" this was followed by a , cold dinner at 1 ( servants to have no work ) , sunday-school again from 2 to 4 , and <unk> at 6 .
the intervals were perhaps the greatest trial of all , from the efforts i had to make , to be less than usually sinful , by reading books and sermons as barren as the dead sea .
there was but one <name> spot , in the distance , all that day : and that was <unk> , ' which never could come too early ! "
" such teaching was well meant , no doubt , " said <name> ; " but it must have driven many of its victims into deserting the <unk> altogether . "
" i 'm afraid i was a deserter this morning , " she gravely said .
" i had to write to <name> .
would you  would you mind my telling you something he said about prayer ?
it had never struck me in that light before . "
" in what light ? "
said <name> .
" why , that all nature goes by fixed , regular laws  science has proved that .
so that asking god to do anything ( except of course praying for spiritual blessings ) is to expect a miracle : and we 've no right to do that .
i 've not put it as well as he did : but that was the outcome of it , and it has confused me .
please tell me what you can say in answer to it . "
" i do n't propose to discuss captain <unk> 's difficulties , " <name> gravely replied ; " specially as he is not present .
but , if it is your difficulty , " ( his voice unconsciously took a <unk> tone ) " then i <name> speak . "
" it is my difficulty , " she said anxiously .
" then i <name> begin by asking 'why did you except spiritual blessings ? '
is not your mind a part of nature ? "
" yes , but <unk> comes in there  i can choose this or that ; and god can influence my choice . "
" then you are not a <unk> ? "
" oh , no ! "
she earnestly exclaimed .
" thank god ! "
<name> said to himself , but in so low a whisper that only i heard it .
" you <name> then that i can , by an act of free choice , move this cup , " <unk> the action to the word , " this way or that way ? "
" yes , i <name> it . "
" well , let us see how far the result is produced by fixed laws .
the cup moves because certain mechanical forces are impressed on it by my hand .
my hand moves because certain forces  electric , magnetic , or whatever <unk> ' may prove to be  are impressed on it by my <name> .
this nerve-force , stored in the <name> , would probably be traceable , if science were complete , to chemical forces supplied to the <name> by the blood , and ultimately derived from the food i eat and the air i breathe . "
" but would not that be <unk> ?
where would <unk> come in ? "
" in choice of nerves , " replied <name> .
" the nerve-force in the <name> may flow just as naturally down one nerve as down another .
we need something more than a fixed law of nature to settle which nerve shall <name> it .
that <unk> ' is <unk> . "
her eyes sparkled . "
" i see what you mean ! "
she exclaimed .
" human <unk> is an exception to the system of fixed law .
<name> said something like that .
and then i think he pointed out that god can only influence nature by influencing human wills .
so that we might reasonably pray 'give us this day our daily bread , ' because many of the causes that produce bread are under man 's control .
but to pray for rain , or fine weather , would be as unreasonable as  " she checked herself , as if fearful of saying something irreverent .
in a hushed , low tone , that trembled with emotion , and with the solemnity of one in the presence of death , <name> slowly replied " shalt he that <unk> with the almighty instruct him ?
shall we 'the swarm that in the <unk> beam were born , ' feeling in ourselves the power to direct , this way or that , the forces of nature  of nature , of which we form so trivial a part  shall we , in our boundless arrogance , in our pitiful conceit , deny that power to the ancient of days ?
saying , to our creator , 'thus far and no further .
thou <unk> , but thou canst not rule ! ' ? "
<name> <name> had covered her face in her hands , and did not look up .
she only murmured " thanks , thanks ! "
again and again .
we rose to go .
<name> said , with evident effort , " one word more .
if you would know the power of prayer  in anything and everything that man can need try it .
ask , and it shall be given you .
i  have tried it .
i know that god answers prayer ! "
our walk home was a silent one , till we had nearly reached the lodgings : then <name> murmured  and it was almost an <name> of my own thoughts  " what knowest thou , o wife , whether thou shalt save thy husband ? "
the subject was not touched on again .
we sat on , talking , while hour after hour , of this our last night together , glided away unnoticed .
he had much to tell me about <name> , and the new life he was going to , and the work he hoped to do .
and his great generous soul seemed so filled with <name> ambition as to have no space left for any vain regret or selfish <unk> .
" come , it is nearly morning !
<name> said at last , rising and leading the way upstairs .
" the sun <name> be rising in a few minutes : and , though i have <unk> defrauded you of your last chance of a night 's rest here , i 'm sure you 'll forgive me : for i really could n't bring myself to say 'good night ' sooner .
and god knows whether you 'll ever see me again , or hear of me ! "
" hear of you i am certain i shall ! "
i warmly responded , and quoted the concluding lines of that strange poem <unk> ' :  " oh , never <name> was lost here , but it rose afar look east , where whole new thousands are !
in <unk> what <unk> ? "
" aye , look eastward ! "
<name> eagerly replied , pausing at the <unk> window , which commanded a fine view of the sea and the eastward horizon .
" the west is the fitting tomb for all the sorrow and the sighing , all the errors and the follies of the past : for all its withered hopes and all its buried loves !
from the east comes new strength , new ambition , new <name> , new life , new love !
look eastward !
aye , look eastward ! "
his last words were still ringing in my ears as i entered my room , and <unk> the <unk> , just in time to see the sun burst in <name> from his <unk> , and clothe the world in the light of a new day .
" so may it be for him , and me , and all of us ! "
i mused .
" all that is evil , and dead , and hopeless , fading with the night that is past !
all that is good , and living , and hopeful , rising with the <name> of day !
" fading , with the night , the chilly mists , and the <unk> vapours , and the heavy shadows , and the wailing gusts , and the owl 's melancholy <unk> : rising , with the day , the darting shafts of light , and the wholesome morning breeze , and the warmth of a dawning life , and the mad music of the lark !
look eastward !
" fading , with the night , the clouds of ignorance , and the deadly blight of sin , and the silent tears of sorrow : and ever rising , higher , higher , with the day , the radiant <name> of knowledge , and the sweet breath of purity , and the throb of a world 's ecstasy !
look eastward !
[ image ... 'look eastward ! ' ]
" fading , with the night , the memory of a dead love , and the withered leaves of a blighted <name> , and the sickly <unk> and moody regrets <unk> the best energies of the soul : and rising , <unk> , rolling upward like a living flood , the manly resolve , and the dauntless <name> , and the heavenward gaze of <name>  the substance of things hoped for , the evidence of things not seen !

<unk> preface to the fourth edition .
the chief alterations , since the first edition , have been made in the chapter on <unk> ' ( pp .
2 , 3 ) and the book on <unk> ( pp .
10 to 19 ) .
the chief additions have been the questions on words and phrases , added to the <unk> at p. 94 , and the notes inserted at pp .
164 , 194 .
in book i , chapter ii , i have adopted a new definition of <unk> ' , which enables me to regard the whole universe as a <unk> , ' and thus to dispense with the very awkward phrase 'a set of things . '
in the chapter on <unk> of existence ' i have adopted a new <unk> form , ' in which the class , whose existence is affirmed or denied , is regarded as the predicate , instead of the subject , of the proposition , thus <unk> a very subtle difficulty which <unk> the other form .
these subtle difficulties seem to lie at the root of every tree of knowledge , and they are far more hopeless to grapple with than any that occur in its higher branches .
for example , the difficulties of the <unk> proposition of euclid are mere child 's play compared with the mental torture endured in the effort to think out the essential nature of a straight line .
and , in the present work , the difficulties of the " 5 liars " problem , at p. 192 , are " trifles , light as air , " compared with the bewildering question " what is a thing ? "
in the chapter on <unk> of relation ' i have inserted a new section , containing the proof that a proposition , beginning with " all , " is a double proposition ( a fact that is quite independent of the arbitrary rule , laid down in the next section , that such a proposition is to be understood as implying the actual existence of its subject ) .
this proof was given , in the earlier editions , incidentally , in the course of the discussion of the biliteral diagram : but its proper place , in this treatise , is where i have now introduced it .
<unk> in the <unk> , i have made a good many verbal alterations , in order to evade a difficulty , which i fear <name> have perplexed some of the readers of the first three editions .
some of the premisses were so worded that their terms were not <unk> of the univ .
named in the dictionary , but of a larger class , of which the univ .
was only a portion .
in all such cases , it was intended that the reader should perceive that what was asserted of the larger class was thereby asserted of the <unk> , and should ignore , as superfluous , all that it asserted of its other portion .
thus , in ex .
15 , the univ .
was stated to be " ducks in this village , " and the third premiss was " mrs .
bond has no gray ducks , " i.e .
" no gray ducks are ducks belonging to mrs .
bond . "
here the terms are not <unk> of the <unk> , but of the larger class " ducks , " of which the univ .
is only a portion : and it was intended that the reader should perceive that what is here asserted of " ducks " is thereby asserted of " ducks in this village . "
and should treat this premiss as if it were " mrs .
bond has no gray ducks in this village , " and should ignore , as superfluous , what it asserts as to the other portion of the class " ducks , " viz .
" mrs .
bond has no gray ducks out of this village " .
in the appendix i have given a new version of the problem of the " five liars . "
my object , in doing so , is to escape the subtle and mysterious difficulties which beset all attempts at regarding a proposition as being its own subject , or a set of propositions as being subjects for one another .
it is certainly , a most bewildering and unsatisfactory theory : one can not help feeling that there is a great lack of substance in all this shadowy host   that , as the procession of phantoms glides before us , there is not one that we can pounce upon , and say " here is a proposition that must be either true or false ! "
  that it is but a <unk> feast , to which we have been bidden   and that its prototype is to be found in that <unk> island , whose inhabitants " earned a precarious living by taking in each <unk> washing " !
by simply translating " telling 2 truths " into " taking both of 2 <unk> ( salt and mustard ) , " " telling 2 lies " into " taking neither of them " and " telling a truth and a lie ( order not specified ) " into " taking only one <unk> ( it is not specified which ) , " i have escaped all those metaphysical puzzles , and have produced a problem which , when translated into a set of <unk> premisses , furnishes the very same data as were furnished by the problem of the " five liars . "
<unk> the coined words , introduced in previous editions , such as " eliminands " and " <unk> " , perhaps hardly need any apology : they were indispensable to my system : but the new plural , here used for the first time , viz .
" <unk> " , <name> , i fear , be condemned as " bad english " , unless i say a word in its defence .
we have three singular <unk> , in english , of plural form , " series " , " species " , and " sorites " : in all three , the awkwardness , of using the same word for both singular and plural , must often have been felt : this has been remedied , in the case of " series " by <unk> the plural " <unk> " , which has already found its way into the <unk> : so i am no rash <unk> , but am merely " following suit " , in using the new plural " <unk> " .
in conclusion , let me point out that even those , who are obliged to study formal logic , with a view to being able to answer <unk> in that subject , <name> find the study of symbolic logic most helpful for this purpose , in throwing light upon many of the <unk> with which formal logic abounds , and in furnishing a delightfully easy method of testing the results arrived at by the <unk> processes which formal logic <unk> upon its <unk> .
this is , i believe , the very first attempt ( with the exception of my own little book , the game of logic , published in 1886 , a very incomplete performance ) that has been made to <unk> this fascinating subject .
it has cost me years of hard work : but if it should prove , as i <name> it may , to be of real service to the young , and to be taken up , in high schools and in private families , as a valuable addition to their stock of healthful mental <unk> , such a result would more than repay ten times the labour that i have expended on it .

christmas , <unk> <unk> introduction .
to <unk> [ n.b .
some remarks , addressed to teachers , <name> be found in the appendix , at p .
165 . ]
the <unk> , who wishes to try the question fairly , whether this little book does , or does not , supply the materials for a most interesting mental recreation , is earnestly advised to adopt the following rules :  ( 1 ) begin at the beginning , and do not allow yourself to gratify a mere idle curiosity by dipping into the book , here and there .
this would very likely lead to your throwing it aside , with the remark " this is much too hard for me !
" , and thus losing the chance of adding a very large item to your stock of mental delights .
this rule ( of not dipping ) is very desirable with other kinds of books   such as novels , for instance , where you may easily spoil much of the enjoyment you would otherwise get from the story , by dipping into it further on , so that what the author meant to be a pleasant surprise comes to you as a matter of course .
some people , i know , make a practice of looking into vol .
iii first , just to see how the story ends : and perhaps it is as well just to know that all ends happily   that the <unk> lovers do marry after all , that he is proved to be quite innocent of the murder , that the wicked cousin is completely <unk> in his plot and gets the punishment he deserves , and that the <name> uncle in <name> ( <unk> why in <name> ?
<unk> because , somehow , uncles never can get <name> anywhere else ) dies at exactly the right moment   before taking the trouble to read vol .
i .
this , i say , is just <unk> with a novel , where vol .
iii has a meaning , even for those who have not read the earlier part of the story ; but , with a scientific book , it is sheer insanity : you <name> find the latter part hopelessly unintelligible , if you read it before reaching it in regular course .
<unk> ( 2 ) do n't begin any fresh chapter , or section , until you are certain that you thoroughly understand the whole book up to that point , and that you have worked , correctly , most if not all of the examples which have been set .
so long as you are conscious that all the land you have passed through is absolutely conquered , and that you are leaving no <unk> difficulties behind you , which <name> be sure to turn up again later on , your triumphal progress <name> be easy and delightful .
otherwise , you <name> find your state of <unk> get worse and worse as you proceed , till you give up the whole thing in utter disgust .
( 3 ) when you come to any passage you do n't understand , read it again : if you still do n't understand it , read it again : if you fail , even after three readings , very likely your <name> is getting a little tired .
in that case , put the book away , and take to other occupations , and next day , when you come to it fresh , you <name> very likely find that it is quite easy .
( 4 ) if possible , find some genial friend , who <name> read the book along with you , and <name> talk over the difficulties with you .
talking is a wonderful <unk> of difficulties .
when i come upon anything   in logic or in any other hard subject   that entirely puzzles me , i find it a capital plan to talk it over , aloud , even when i am all alone .
one can explain things so clearly to one 's self !
and then , you know , one is so patient with one 's self : one never gets irritated at one 's own stupidity !
if , dear reader , you <name> faithfully observe these rules , and so give my little book a really fair trial , i promise you , most confidently , that you <name> find symbolic logic to be one of the most , if not the most , fascinating of mental <unk> !
in this first part , i have carefully avoided all difficulties which seemed to me to be beyond the grasp of an intelligent child of ( say ) twelve or fourteen years of age .
i have myself taught most of its contents , <unk> voce , to many children , and have found them take a real intelligent interest in the subject .
for those , who succeed in <unk> part i , and who begin , like <name> , " asking for more , " i <name> to provide , in part ii , some tolerably hard nuts to crack   nuts that <name> require all the <unk> they happen to possess !
<unk> mental recreation is a thing that we all of us need for our mental health ; and you may get much healthy enjoyment , no doubt , from games , such as <unk> , chess , and the new game " <unk> " .
but , after all , when you have made yourself a first-rate player at any one of these games , you have nothing real to show for it , as a result !  you enjoyed the game , and the victory , no doubt , at the time : but you have no result that you can treasure up and get real good out of .
and , all the while , you have been leaving unexplored a perfect mine of wealth .
once master the machinery of symbolic logic , and you have a mental occupation always at hand , of absorbing interest , and one that <name> be of real use to you in any subject you may take up .
it <name> give you clearness of thought   the ability to see your way through a puzzle   the habit of arranging your ideas in an orderly and <unk> form   and , more valuable than all , the power to detect <unk> , and to tear to pieces the flimsy illogical arguments , which you <name> so continually encounter in books , in newspapers , in speeches , and even in sermons , and which so easily <unk> those who have never taken the trouble to master this fascinating <name> .
try it. that is all i ask of you !

introductory. the universe contains <unk> . '
[ for example , " i , " " london , " " roses , " " redness , " " old english books , " " the letter which i received yesterday . " ]
things have <unk> . '
[ for example , " large , " " red , " " old , " " which i received yesterday . " ]
one thing may have many attributes ; and one attribute may belong to many things .
[ thus , the thing " a rose " may have the attributes " red , " " scented , " " <unk> , " & c. ; and the attribute " red " may belong to the things " a rose , " " a brick , " " a ribbon , " & c. ] any attribute , or any set of attributes , may be called an <unk> . '
[ this word is introduced in order to avoid the constant repetition of the phrase " attribute or set of attributes . "
thus , we may say that a rose has the attribute " red " ( or the adjunct " red , " whichever we prefer ) ; or we may say that it has the adjunct " red , scented and <unk> . " ]
<unk> chapter ii .
<unk> <unk> , ' or the formation of classes , is a mental process , in which we imagine that we have put together , in a group , certain things .
such a group is called a <unk> . '
this process may be performed in three different ways , as follows :  ( 1 ) we may imagine that we have put together all things .
the class so formed ( i.e .
the class " things " ) contains the whole universe .
( 2 ) we may think of the class " things , " and may imagine that we have picked out from it all the things which possess a certain adjunct not possessed by the whole class .
this adjunct is said to be <unk> ' to the class so formed .
in this case , the class " things " is called a <unk> ' with regard to the class so formed : the class , so formed , is called a <unk> ' of the class " things " : and its peculiar adjunct is called its <unk> ' .
<unk> as this process is entirely mental , we can perform it whether there is , or is not , an existing thing which possesses that adjunct .
if there is , the class is said to be <unk> ' ; if not , it is said to be <unk> ' , or <unk> . '
[ for example , we may imagine that we have picked out , from the class " things , " all the things which possess the adjunct " material , artificial , consisting of houses and streets " ; and we may thus form the real class " towns . "
here we may regard " things " as a genus , " towns " as a species of things , and " material , artificial , consisting of houses and streets " as its <unk> .
again , we may imagine that we have picked out all the things which possess the adjunct " weighing a ton , easily lifted by a baby " ; and we may thus form the imaginary class " things that weigh a ton and are easily lifted by a baby . " ]
( 3 ) we may think of a certain class , not the class " things , " and may imagine that we have picked out from it all the members of it which possess a certain adjunct not possessed by the whole class .
this adjunct is said to be <unk> ' to the smaller class so formed .
in this case , the class thought of is called a <unk> ' with regard to the smaller class picked out from it : the smaller class is called a <unk> ' of the larger : and its peculiar adjunct is called its <unk> ' .
[ for example , we may think of the class " towns , " and imagine that we have picked out from it all the towns which possess the attribute " lit with gas " ; and we may thus form the real class " towns lit with gas . "
here we may regard " towns " as a genus , " towns lit with gas " as a species of towns , and " lit with gas " as its <unk> .
if , in the above example , we were to alter " lit with gas " into " paved with gold , " we should get the imaginary class " towns paved with gold . " ]
a class , containing only one member is called an <unk> . '
[ for example , the class " towns having four million inhabitants , " which class contains only one member , viz .
" london . " ]
<unk> hence , any single thing , which we can name so as to distinguish it from all other things , may be regarded as a <unk> class .
[ thus " london " may be regarded as the <unk> class , picked out from the class " towns , " which has , as its <unk> , " having four million inhabitants . " ]
a class , containing two or more members , is sometimes regarded as one single thing .
when so regarded , it may possess an adjunct which is not possessed by any member of it taken separately .
[ thus , the class " the soldiers of the tenth regiment , " when regarded as one single thing , may possess the attribute " formed in square , " which is not possessed by any member of it taken separately . ]
<unk> chapter iii .
<unk> § 1 .
introductory. <unk> ' is a mental process , in which we think of a certain class of things , and imagine that we have divided it into two or more smaller classes .
[ thus , we might think of the class " books , " and imagine that we had divided it into the two smaller classes " bound books " and " unbound books , " or into the three classes , " books <unk> at less than a shilling , " " <unk> , " " books <unk> at more than a shilling , " or into the twenty-six classes , " books whose names begin with a , " " books whose names begin with b , " & c. ] a class , that has been obtained by a certain division , is said to be <unk> ' with every class obtained by that division .
[ thus , the class " bound books " is codivisional with each of the two classes , " bound books " and " unbound books . "
similarly , the battle of waterloo may be said to have been " contemporary " with every event that happened in <unk> . ]
hence a class , obtained by division , is codivisional with itself .
[ thus , the class " bound books " is codivisional with itself .
similarly , the battle of waterloo may be said to have been " contemporary " with itself . ]
<unk> § 2 .
<unk> if we think of a certain class , and imagine that we have picked out from it a certain smaller class , it is evident that the remainder of the large class does not possess the <unk> of that smaller class .
hence it may be regarded as another smaller class , whose <unk> may be formed , from that of the class first picked out , by <unk> the word " not " ; and we may imagine that we have divided the class first thought of into two smaller classes , whose <unk> are contradictory .
this kind of division is called <unk> ' .
[ for example , we may divide " books " into the two classes whose <unk> are " old " and " <unk> . " ]
in performing this process , we may sometimes find that the attributes we have chosen are used so loosely , in ordinary conversation , that it is not easy to decide which of the things belong to the one class and which to the other .
in such a case , it would be necessary to lay down some arbitrary rule , as to where the one class should end and the other begin .
[ thus , in dividing " books " into " old " and " <unk> , " we may say " let all books printed before a.d. 1801 , be regarded as 'old , ' and all others as <unk> ' . " ]
<unk> let it be understood that , if a class of things be divided into two classes , whose <unk> have contrary meanings , each <unk> is to be regarded as equivalent to the other with the word " not " <unk> .
[ thus , if " books " be divided into " old " and " new " the attribute " old " is to be regarded as equivalent to " <unk> , " and the attribute " new " as equivalent to " <unk> . " ]
<unk> after dividing a class , by the process of <unk> , into two smaller classes , we may <unk> each of these into two still smaller classes ; and this process may be repeated over and over again , the number of classes being doubled at each repetition .
[ for example , we may divide " books " into " old " and " new " ( i.e .
" <unk> " ) : we may then <unk> each of these into " english " and " foreign " ( i.e .
" <unk> " ) , thus getting four classes , viz .
( 1 ) old english ; ( 2 ) old foreign ; ( 3 ) new english ; ( 4 ) new foreign .
if we had begun by dividing into " english " and " foreign , " and had then <unk> into " old " and " new , " the four classes would have been ( 1 ) english old ; ( 2 ) english new ; ( 3 ) foreign old ; ( 4 ) foreign new .
the reader <name> easily see that these are the very same four classes which we had before . ]
<unk> chapter iv .
<unk> the word " thing " , which conveys the idea of a thing , without any idea of an adjunct , represents any single thing .
any other word ( or phrase ) , which conveys the idea of a thing , with the idea of an adjunct represents any thing which possesses that adjunct ; i.e. , it represents any member of the class to which that adjunct is peculiar .
such a word ( or phrase ) is called a <unk> ' ; and , if there be an existing thing which it represents , it is said to be a name of that thing .
[ for example , the words " thing , " " treasure , " " town , " and the phrases " valuable thing , " " material artificial thing consisting of houses and streets , " " town lit with gas , " " town paved with gold , " " old english book . " ]
just as a class is said to be real , or unreal , according as there is , or is not , an existing thing in it , so also a name is said to be real , or unreal , according as there is , or is not , an existing thing represented by it .
[ thus , " town lit with gas " is a real name : " town paved with gold " is an unreal name . ]
every name is either a substantive only , or else a phrase consisting of a substantive and one or more adjectives ( or phrases used as adjectives ) .
every name , except " thing " , may usually be expressed in three different forms :  ( a ) the substantive " thing " , and one or more adjectives ( or phrases used as adjectives ) conveying the ideas of the attributes ; <unk> ( b ) a substantive , conveying the idea of a thing with the ideas of some of the attributes , and one or more adjectives ( or phrases used as adjectives ) conveying the ideas of the other attributes ; ( c ) a substantive conveying the idea of a thing with the ideas of all the attributes .
[ thus , the phrase " material living thing , belonging to the animal kingdom , having two hands and two feet " is a name expressed in form ( a ) .
if we choose to roll up together the substantive " thing " and the adjectives " material , living , belonging to the animal kingdom , " so as to make the new substantive " animal , " we get the phrase " animal having two hands and two feet , " which is a name ( representing the same thing as before ) expressed in form ( b ) .
and , if we choose to roll up the whole phrase into one word , so as to make the new substantive " man , " we get a name ( still representing the very same thing ) expressed in form ( c ) . ]
a name , whose substantive is in the plural number , may be used to represent either ( 1 ) members of a class , regarded as separate things ; or ( 2 ) a whole class , regarded as one single thing .
[ thus , when i say " some soldiers of the tenth regiment are tall , " or " the soldiers of the tenth regiment are brave , " i am using the name " soldiers of the tenth regiment " in the first sense ; and it is just the same as if i were to point to each of them separately , and to say " this soldier of the tenth regiment is tall , " " that soldier of the tenth regiment is tall , " and so on .
but , when i say " the soldiers of the tenth regiment are formed in square , " i am using the phrase in the second sense ; and it is just the same as if i were to say " the tenth regiment is formed in square . " ]
<unk> chapter v. <unk> it is evident that every member of a species is also a member of the genus out of which that species has been picked , and that it possesses the <unk> of that species .
hence it may be represented by a name consisting of two parts , one being a name representing any member of the genus , and the other being the <unk> of that species .
such a name is called a <unk> ' of any member of that species , and to give it such a name is to <unk> ' it .
[ thus , we may define a " treasure " as a " valuable thing . "
in this case we regard " things " as the genus , and " valuable " as the <unk> . ]
the following examples , of this process , may be taken as models for working others .
[ note that , in each definition , the substantive , representing a member ( or members ) of the genus , is printed in capitals . ]
1 .
define " a treasure . "
<unk> " a valuable thing . "
2 .
define " treasures . "
<unk> " valuable things . "
3 .
define " a town . "
<unk> " a material artificial thing , consisting of houses and streets . "
<unk> 4 .
define " men . "
<unk> " material , living things , belonging to the animal kingdom , having two hands and two feet " ; or else " animals having two hands and two feet . "
5 .
define " london . "
<unk> " the material artificial thing , which consists of houses and streets , and has four million inhabitants " ; or else " the town which has four million inhabitants . "
[ note that we here use the article " the " instead of " a " , because we happen to know that there is only one such thing .
the reader can set himself any number of examples of this process , by simply choosing the name of any common thing ( such as " house , " " tree , " " knife " ) , making a definition for it , and then testing his answer by referring to any english dictionary . ]
<unk> book ii .
propositions .
chapter i .
propositions <unk> § 1 .
introductory. note that the word " some " is to be regarded , henceforward , as meaning " one or more . "
the word <unk> , ' as used in ordinary conversation , may be applied to any word , or phrase , which conveys any information whatever .
[ thus the words " yes " and " no " are propositions in the ordinary sense of the word ; and so are the phrases " you owe me five <unk> " and " i do n't ! "
such words as " oh ! "
or " never !
" , and such phrases as " fetch me that book ! "
" which book do you mean ? "
do not seem , at first sight , to convey any information ; but they can easily be turned into equivalent forms which do so , viz .
" i am surprised , " " i <name> never consent to it , " " i order you to fetch me that book , " " i want to know which book you mean . " ]
but a <unk> , ' as used in this first part of " symbolic logic , " has a peculiar form , which may be called its <unk> <unk> ' ; and if any proposition , which we wish to use in an argument , is not in normal form , we must reduce it to such a form , before we can use it .
<unk> a <unk> , ' when in normal form , asserts , as to certain two classes , which are called its <unk> ' and <unk> , ' either ( 1 ) that some members of its subject are members of its predicate ; or ( 2 ) that no members of its subject are members of its predicate ; or ( 3 ) that all members of its subject are members of its predicate .
the subject and the predicate of a proposition are called its <unk> . '
two propositions , which convey the same information , are said to be <unk> ' .
[ thus , the two propositions , " i see <name> " and " <name> is seen by me , " are equivalent . ]
§ 2 .
normal form of a <unk> a proposition , in normal form , consists of four parts , viz.  ( 1 ) the word " some , " or " no , " or " all . "
( this word , which tells us how many members of the subject are also members of the predicate , is called the <unk> of <unk> . ' )
( 2 ) name of subject .
( 3 ) the verb " are " ( or " is " ) .
( this is called the <unk> . ' )
( 4 ) name of predicate .
<unk> § 3 .
various kinds of <unk> a proposition , that begins with " some " , is said to be <unk> . '
it is also called 'a proposition <unk> <unk> . '
[ note , that it is called <unk> , ' because it refers to a part only of the subject . ]
a proposition , that begins with " no " , is said to be <unk> <unk> . '
it is also called 'a proposition <unk> <unk> . '
a proposition , that begins with " all " , is said to be <unk> <unk> . '
it is also called 'a proposition <unk> <unk> . '
[ note , that they are called <unk> ' , because they refer to the whole of the subject . ]
a proposition , whose subject is an individual , is to be regarded as universal .
[ let us take , as an example , the proposition " <name> is not well " .
this of course implies that there is an individual , to whom the speaker refers when he mentions " <name> " , and whom the listener knows to be referred to .
hence the class " men referred to by the speaker when he mentions <unk> ' " is a <unk> class , and the proposition is equivalent to " all the men , who are referred to by the speaker when he mentions <unk> ' , are not well . " ]
propositions are of two kinds , <unk> of existence ' and <unk> of relation . '
these shall be discussed separately .
<unk> chapter ii .
propositions of <unk> a <unk> of <unk> ' , when in normal form , has , for its subject , the class " existing things " .
its sign of quantity is " some " or " no " .
[ note that , though its sign of quantity tells us how many existing things are members of its predicate , it does not tell us the exact number : in fact , it only deals with two <name> , which are , in ascending order , " 0 " and " 1 or more . " ]
it is called " a proposition of existence " because its effect is to assert the reality ( i.e .
the real existence ) , or else the <unk> , of its predicate .
[ thus , the proposition " some existing things are honest men " asserts that the class " honest men " is real .
this is the normal form ; but it may also be expressed in any one of the following forms :  ( 1 ) " honest men exist " ; ( 2 ) " some honest men exist " ; ( 3 ) " the class <unk> men ' exists " ; ( 4 ) " there are honest men " ; ( 5 ) " there are some honest men " .
similarly , the proposition " no existing things are men fifty feet high " asserts that the class " men 50 feet high " is imaginary .
this is the normal form ; but it may also be expressed in any one of the following forms :  ( 1 ) " men 50 feet high do not exist " ; ( 2 ) " no men 50 feet high exist " ; ( 3 ) " the class 'men 50 feet high ' does not exist " ; ( 4 ) " there are not any men 50 feet high " ; ( 5 ) " there are no men 50 feet high . " ]
<unk> chapter iii .
propositions of <unk> § 1 .
introductory. a <unk> of <unk> , of the kind to be here discussed , has , for its terms , two <unk> of the same genus , such that each of the two names conveys the idea of some attribute not conveyed by the other .
[ thus , the proposition " some merchants are misers " is of the right kind , since " merchants " and " misers " are <unk> of the same genus " men " ; and since the name " merchants " conveys the idea of the attribute " mercantile " , and the name " misers " the idea of the attribute " miserly " , each of which ideas is not conveyed by the other name .
but the proposition " some dogs are <unk> " is not of the right kind , since , although it is true that " dogs " and " <unk> " are <unk> of the same genus " animals " , it is not true that the name " dogs " conveys the idea of any attribute not conveyed by the name " <unk> " .
such propositions <name> be discussed in part ii . ]
the genus , of which the two terms are <unk> , is called the <unk> of <unk> , ' or ( more briefly ) the <unk> the sign of quantity is " some " or " no " or " all " .
[ note that , though its sign of quantity tells us how many members of its subject are also members of its predicate , it does not tell us the exact number : in fact , it only deals with three <name> , which are , in ascending order , " 0 " , " 1 or more " , " the total number of members of the subject " . ]
it is called " a proposition of relation " because its effect is to assert that a certain relationship exists between its terms .
<unk> § 2 .
reduction of a proposition of relation to normal <unk> the rules , for doing this , are as follows :  ( 1 ) ascertain what is the subject ( i.e. , ascertain what class we are talking about ) ; ( 2 ) if the verb , governed by the subject , is not the verb " are " ( or " is " ) , substitute for it a phrase beginning with " are " ( or " is " ) ; ( 3 ) ascertain what is the predicate ( i.e. , ascertain what class it is , which is asserted to contain some , or none , or all , of the members of the subject ) ; ( 4 ) if the name of each term is completely expressed ( i.e .
if it contains a substantive ) , there is no need to determine the <unk> .
' ; but , if either name is <unk> expressed , and contains attributes only , it is then necessary to determine a <unk> .
' , in order to insert its name as the substantive .
( 5 ) ascertain the sign of quantity ; ( 6 ) arrange in the following order :  sign of quantity , subject , <unk> , predicate .
[ let us work a few examples , to illustrate these rules .
( 1 ) " some apples are not ripe . "
( 1 ) the subject is " apples . "
( 2 ) the verb is " are . "
( 3 ) the predicate is " <unk> * * * . "
( as no substantive is expressed , and we have not yet settled what the univ .
is to be , we are forced to leave a blank . )
( 4 ) let univ .
be " fruit . "
( 5 ) the sign of quantity is " some . "
( 6 ) the proposition now becomes " some | apples | are | <unk> fruit . "
<unk> ( 2 ) " none of my speculations have brought me as much as 5 per cent . "
( 1 ) the subject is " my speculations . "
( 2 ) the verb is " have brought , " for which we substitute the phrase " are * * * that have brought " .
( 3 ) the predicate is " * * * that have brought & c. " ( 4 ) let univ .
be " transactions . "
( 5 ) the sign of quantity is " none of . "
( 6 ) the proposition now becomes " none of | my speculations | are | transactions that have brought me as much as 5 per cent . "
( 3 ) " none but the brave deserve the fair . "
to begin with , we note that the phrase " none but the brave " is equivalent to " no <unk> . "
( 1 ) the subject has for its attribute " <unk> . "
but no substantive is supplied .
so we express the subject as " <unk> * * * . "
( 2 ) the verb is " deserve , " for which we substitute the phrase " are deserving of " .
( 3 ) the predicate is " * * * deserving of the fair . "
( 4 ) let univ .
be " persons . "
( 5 ) the sign of quantity is " no . "
( 6 ) the proposition now becomes " no | <unk> persons | are | persons deserving of the fair . "
( 4 ) " a lame puppy would not say " thank you " if you offered to lend it a <unk> . "
( 1 ) the subject is evidently " lame puppies , " and all the rest of the sentence must somehow be packed into the predicate .
( 2 ) the verb is " would not say , " & c. , for which we may substitute the phrase " are not grateful for . "
( 3 ) the predicate may be expressed as " * * * not grateful for the <name> of a <unk> . "
( 4 ) let univ .
be " puppies . "
( 5 ) the sign of quantity is " all . "
( 6 ) the proposition now becomes " all | lame puppies | are | puppies not grateful for the <name> of a <unk> . "
<unk> ( 5 ) " no one takes in the times , unless he is well-educated . "
( 1 ) the subject is evidently persons who are not well-educated ( " no one " evidently means " no person " ) .
( 2 ) the verb is " takes in , " for which we may substitute the phrase " are persons taking in . "
( 3 ) the predicate is " persons taking in the times . "
( 4 ) let univ .
be " persons . "
( 5 ) the sign of quantity is " no . "
( 6 ) the proposition now becomes " no | persons who are not well-educated | are | persons taking in the times . "
( 6 ) " my carriage <name> meet you at the station . "
( 1 ) the subject is " my carriage . "
this , being an <unk> , ' is equivalent to the class " my carriages . "
( note that this class contains only one member . )
( 2 ) the verb is " <name> meet " , for which we may substitute the phrase " are * * * that <name> meet . "
( 3 ) the predicate is " * * * that <name> meet you at the station . "
( 4 ) let univ .
be " things . "
( 5 ) the sign of quantity is " all . "
( 6 ) the proposition now becomes " all | my carriages | are | things that <name> meet you at the station . "
( 7 ) " happy is the man who does not know what <unk> ' means ! "
( 1 ) the subject is evidently " the man & c. " ( note that in this sentence , the predicate comes first . )
at first sight , the subject seems to be an <unk> ' ; but on further consideration , we see that the article " the " does not imply that there is only one such man .
hence the phrase " the man who " is equivalent to " all men who " .
( 2 ) the verb is " are . "
( 3 ) the predicate is " happy * * * . "
( 4 ) let univ .
be " men . "
( 5 ) the sign of quantity is " all . "
( 6 ) the proposition now becomes " all | men who do not know what <unk> means | are | happy men . "
<unk> ( 8 ) " some farmers always grumble at the weather , whatever it may be . "
( 1 ) the subject is " farmers . "
( 2 ) the verb is " grumble , " for which we substitute the phrase " are * * * who grumble . "
( 3 ) the predicate is " * * * who always grumble & c. " ( 4 ) let univ .
be " persons . "
( 5 ) the sign of quantity is " some . "
( 6 ) the proposition now becomes " some | farmers | are | persons who always grumble at the weather , whatever it may be . "
( 9 ) " no lambs are accustomed to smoke cigars . "
( 1 ) the subject is " lambs . "
( 2 ) the verb is " are . "
( 3 ) the predicate is " * * * accustomed & c. " ( 4 ) let univ .
be " animals . "
( 5 ) the sign of quantity is " no . "
( 6 ) the proposition now becomes " no | lambs | are | animals accustomed to smoke cigars . "
( 10 ) " i ca'n't understand examples that are not arranged in regular order , like those i am used to . "
( 1 ) the subject is " examples that , " & c. ( 2 ) the verb is " i ca'n't understand , " which we must alter , so as to have " examples , " instead of " i , " as the <unk> case .
it may be expressed as " are not understood by me . "
( 3 ) the predicate is " * * * not understood by me . "
( 4 ) let univ .
be " examples . "
( 5 ) the sign of quantity is " all . "
( 6 ) the proposition now becomes " all | examples that are not arranged in regular order like those i am used to | are | examples not understood by me . " ]
<unk> § 3 .
a proposition of relation , beginning with " all " , is a double <unk> a proposition of relation , beginning with " all " , asserts ( as we already know ) that " all members of the subject are members of the predicate " .
this evidently contains , as a part of what it tells us , the smaller proposition " some members of the subject are members of the predicate " .
[ thus , the proposition " all bankers are <name> men " evidently contains the smaller proposition " some bankers are <name> men " . ]
the question now arises " what is the rest of the information which this proposition gives us ? "
in order to answer this question , let us begin with the smaller proposition , " some members of the subject are members of the predicate , " and suppose that this is all we have been told ; and let us proceed to inquire what else we need to be told , in order to know that " all members of the subject are members of the predicate " .
[ thus , we may suppose that the proposition " some bankers are <name> men " is all the information we possess ; and we may proceed to inquire what other proposition needs to be added to it , in order to make up the entire proposition " all bankers are <name> men " . ]
let us also suppose that the <unk> . '
( i.e .
the genus , of which both the subject and the predicate are <unk> ) has been divided ( by the process of <unk> ) into two smaller classes , viz .
( 1 ) the predicate ; ( 2 ) the class whose <unk> is contradictory to that of the predicate .
[ thus , we may suppose that the genus " men , " ( of which both " bankers " and " <name> men " are <unk> ) has been divided into the two smaller classes , " <name> men " , " poor men " . ]
<unk> now we know that every member of the subject is ( as shown at p. 6 ) a member of the univ .
hence every member of the subject is either in class ( 1 ) or else in class ( 2 ) .
[ thus , we know that every banker is a member of the genus " men " .
hence , every banker is either in the class " <name> men " , or else in the class " poor men " . ]
also we have been told that , in the case we are discussing , some members of the subject are in class ( 1 ) .
what else do we need to be told , in order to know that all of them are there ?
evidently we need to be told that none of them are in class ( 2 ) ; i.e .
that none of them are members of the class whose <unk> is contradictory to that of the predicate .
[ thus , we may suppose we have been told that some bankers are in the class " <name> men " .
what else do we need to be told , in order to know that all of them are there ?
evidently we need to be told that none of them are in the class " poor men " . ]
hence a proposition of relation , beginning with " all " , is a double proposition , and is <unk> ' to ( i.e .
gives the same information as ) the two propositions ( 1 ) " some members of the subject are members of the predicate " ; ( 2 ) " no members of the subject are members of the class whose <unk> is contradictory to that of the predicate " .
[ thus , the proposition " all bankers are <name> men " is a double proposition , and is equivalent to the two propositions ( 1 ) " some bankers are <name> men " ; ( 2 ) " no bankers are poor men " . ]
<unk> § 4 .
what is implied , in a proposition of relation , as to the reality of its terms ?  note that the rules , here laid down , are arbitrary , and only apply to part i of my " symbolic logic . "
a proposition of relation , beginning with " some " , is henceforward to be understood as asserting that there are some existing things , which , being members of the subject , are also members of the predicate ; i.e .
that some existing things are members of both terms at once .
hence it is to be understood as implying that each term , taken by itself , is real .
[ thus , the proposition " some <name> men are invalids " is to be understood as asserting that some existing things are " <name> invalids " .
hence it implies that each of the two classes , " <name> men " and " invalids " , taken by itself , is real . ]
a proposition of relation , beginning with " no " , is henceforward to be understood as asserting that there are no existing things which , being members of the subject , are also members of the predicate ; i.e .
that no existing things are members of both terms at once .
but this implies nothing as to the reality of either term taken by itself .
[ thus , the proposition " no <unk> are <unk> " is to be understood as asserting that no existing things are " <unk> " .
but this implies nothing as to the reality , or the unreality , of either of the two classes , " <unk> " and " <unk> " , taken by itself .
in this case as it happens , the subject is imaginary , and the predicate real . ]
a proposition of relation , beginning with " all " , contains ( see § 3 ) a similar proposition beginning with " some " .
hence it is to be understood as implying that each term , taken by itself , is real .
[ thus , the proposition " all <unk> are savage animals " contains the proposition " some <unk> are savage animals " .
hence it implies that each of the two classes , " <unk> " and " savage animals " , taken by itself , is real . ]
<unk> § 5 .
translation of a proposition of relation into one or more propositions of <unk> we have seen that a proposition of relation , beginning with " some , " asserts that some existing things , being members of its subject , are also members of its predicate .
hence , it asserts that some existing things are members of both ; i.e .
it asserts that some existing things are members of the class of things which have all the attributes of the subject and the predicate .
hence , to translate it into a proposition of existence , we take " existing things " as the new subject , and things , which have all the attributes of the subject and the predicate , as the new predicate .
similarly for a proposition of relation beginning with " no " .
a proposition of relation , beginning with " all " , is ( as shown in § 3 ) equivalent to two propositions , one beginning with " some " and the other with " no " , each of which we now know how to translate .
[ let us work a few examples , to illustrate these rules .
( 1 ) " some apples are not ripe . "
here we arrange thus :  " some " sign of quantity .
" existing things " subject .
" are " <unk> .
" <unk> apples " predicate .
or thus :  " some | existing things | are | <unk> apples . "
<unk> ( 2 ) " some farmers always grumble at the weather , whatever it may be . "
here we arrange thus :  " some | existing things | are | farmers who always grumble at the weather , whatever it may be . "
( 3 ) " no lambs are accustomed to smoke cigars . "
here we arrange thus :  " no | existing things <unk> | lambs accustomed to smoke cigars . "
( 4 ) " none of my speculations have brought me as much as 5 per cent . "
here we arrange thus :  " no | existing things | are | speculations of mine , which have brought me as much as 5 per cent . "
( 5 ) " none but the brave deserve the fair . "
here we note , to begin with , that the phrase " none but the brave " is equivalent to " no <unk> men . "
we then arrange thus :  " no | existing things | are | <unk> men deserving of the fair . "
( 6 ) " all bankers are <name> men . "
this is equivalent to the two propositions " some bankers are <name> men " and " no bankers are poor men . "
here we arrange thus :  " some | existing things | are | <name> bankers " ; and " no | existing things | are | poor bankers . " ]

<unk> book iii .
the biliteral diagram .
·       · | | | | xy | xy ' | | | | |    |    | | | | | x'y | x'y ' | | | | ·       · chapter i .
symbols and <unk> first , let us suppose that the above diagram is an enclosure assigned to a certain class of things , which we have selected as our <unk> of discourse . '
or , more briefly , as our <unk> ' .
[ for example , we might say " let univ .
be <unk> ' " ; and we might imagine the diagram to be a large table , assigned to all " books . " ]
[ the reader is strongly advised , in reading this chapter , not to refer to the above diagram , but to draw a large one for himself , without any letters , and to have it by him while he reads , and keep his finger on that particular part of it , about which he is reading . ]
<unk> secondly , let us suppose that we have selected a certain adjunct , which we may call " x , " and have divided the large class , to which we have assigned the whole diagram , into the two smaller classes whose <unk> are " x " and " not-x " ( which we may call " x ' " ) , and that we have assigned the north half of the diagram to the one ( which we may call " the class of <unk> , " or " the <unk> " ) , and the south half to the other ( which we may call " the class of <unk> , " or " the <unk> " ) .
[ for example , we might say " let x mean 'old , ' so that x ' <name> mean 'new ' , " and we might suppose that we had divided books into the two classes whose <unk> are " old " and " new , " and had assigned the north half of the table to " old books " and the south half to " new books . " ]
thirdly , let us suppose that we have selected another adjunct , which we may call " y " , and have subdivided the <unk> into the two classes whose <unk> are " y " and " y ' " , and that we have assigned the <unk> cell to the one ( which we may call " the <unk> " ) , and the <unk> cell to the other ( which we may call " the <unk> " ) .
[ for example , we might say " let y mean <unk> , ' so that y' <name> mean <unk> ' " , and we might suppose that we had subdivided " old books " into the two classes whose <unk> are " english " and " foreign " , and had assigned the <unk> cell to " old english books " , and the <unk> cell to " old foreign books . " ]
fourthly , let us suppose that we have subdivided the <unk> in the same manner , and have assigned the <unk> cell to the <unk> , and the <unk> cell to the <unk> .
[ for example , we might suppose that we had subdivided " new books " into the two classes " new english books " and " new foreign books " , and had assigned the <unk> cell to the one , and the <unk> cell to the other . ]
it is evident that , if we had begun by dividing for y and y ' , and had then subdivided for x and x ' , we should have got the same four classes .
hence we see that we have assigned the west half to the <unk> , and the east half to the <unk> .
<unk> [ thus , in the above example , we should find that we had assigned the west half of the table to " english books " and the east half to " foreign books . "
·          · | old | old | | english | foreign | | books | books | |     |     | | new | new | | english | foreign | | books | books | ·          · we have , in fact , assigned the four quarters of the table to four different classes of books , as here shown . ]
the reader should carefully remember that , in such a phrase as " the <unk> , " the word " things " means that particular kind of things , to which the whole diagram has been assigned .
[ thus , if we say " let univ .
be <unk> ' , " we mean that we have assigned the whole diagram to " books . "
in that case , if we took " x " to mean " old " , the phrase " the <unk> " would mean " the old books . " ]
the reader should not go on to the next chapter until he is quite familiar with the blank diagram i have advised him to draw .
he ought to be able to name , instantly , the adjunct assigned to any compartment named in the right-hand column of the following table .
also he ought to be able to name , instantly , the compartment assigned to any adjunct named in the left-hand column .
to make sure of this , he had better put the book into the hands of some genial friend , while he himself has nothing but the blank diagram , and get that genial friend to question him on this table , dodging about as much as possible .
the questions and answers should be something like this :  <unk> table i .
·                     · | <unk> | compartments , or cells ,  | | of | assigned to them. | | <unk> | | |       |              | | x | north half .
| | x ' | south " | | y | west " | | y ' | east " | |       |              | | xy | north-west cell .
| | xy ' | " east " | | x'y | south-west " | | x'y ' | " east " | ·                     · q .
" adjunct for west half ? "
a .
" y . "
q .
" compartment for xy ' ? "
a .
" north-east cell . "
q .
" adjunct for south-west cell ? "
a .
" x'y . "
& c. , & c. after a little practice , he <name> find himself able to do without the blank diagram , and <name> be able to see it mentally ( " in my mind 's eye , <unk> ! " )
while answering the questions of his genial friend .
when this result has been reached , he may safely go on to the next chapter .
<unk> chapter ii .
<unk> let us agree that a red counter , placed within a cell , shall mean " this cell is occupied " ( i.e .
" there is at least one thing in it " ) .
let us also agree that a red counter , placed on the partition between two cells , shall mean " the compartment , made up of these two cells , is occupied ; but it is not known whereabouts , in it , its occupants are . "
hence it may be understood to mean " at least one of these two cells is occupied : possibly both are . "
our ingenious american cousins have invented a phrase to describe the condition of a man who has not yet made up his mind which of two political parties he <name> join : such a man is said to be " <unk> on the <unk> . "
this phrase exactly describes the condition of the red counter .
let us also agree that a grey counter , placed within a cell , shall mean " this cell is empty " ( i.e .
" there is nothing in it " ) .
[ the reader had better provide himself with 4 red counters and 5 grey ones . ]
<unk> chapter iii .
representation of <unk> § 1 .
introductory. <unk> , in stating such propositions as " some <unk> exist " or " no <unk> are <unk> " , i shall omit the word " things " , which the reader can supply for himself , and shall write them as " some x exist " or " no x are y " .
[ note that the word " things " is here used with a special meaning , as explained at p .
23 . ]
a proposition , containing only one of the letters used as symbols for attributes , is said to be <unk> ' .
[ for example , " some x exist " , " no y ' exist " , & c. ] a proposition , containing two letters , is said to be <unk> .
[ for example , " some xy ' exist " , " no x ' are y " , & c. ] a proposition is said to be <unk> terms <unk> ' the letters it contains , whether with or without accents .
[ thus , " some xy ' exist " , " no x ' are y " , & c. , are said to be in terms of x and y . ]
<unk> § 2 .
representation of propositions of <unk> let us take , first , the proposition " some x exist " .
[ note that this proposition is ( as explained at p. 12 ) equivalent to " some existing things are <unk> . " ]
this tells us that there is at least one thing in the north half ; that is , that the north half is occupied .
and this we can evidently represent by placing a red counter ( here represented by a dotted circle ) on the partition which divides the north half .
·    · | ( . )
| |  |  | | | | ·    · [ in the " books " example , this proposition would be " some old books exist " . ]
similarly we may represent the three similar propositions " some x' exist " , " some y exist " , and " some y ' exist " .
[ the reader should make out all these for himself .
in the " books " example , these propositions would be " some new books exist " , & c. ] let us take , next , the proposition " no x exist " .
this tells us that there is nothing in the north half ; that is , that the north half is empty ; that is , that the north-west cell and the north-east cell are both of them empty .
and this we can represent by placing two grey counters in the north half , one in each cell .
·    · | ( ) | ( ) | |  |  | | | | ·    · [ the reader may perhaps think that it would be enough to place a grey counter on the partition in the north half , and that , just as a red counter , so placed , would mean " this half is occupied " , so a grey one would mean " this half is empty " .
this , however , would be a mistake .
we have seen that a red counter , so placed , would mean " at least one of these two cells is occupied : possibly both are . "
hence a grey one would merely mean " at least one of these two cells is empty : possibly both are " .
but what we have to represent is , that both cells are certainly empty : and this can only be done by placing a grey counter in each of them .
in the " books " example , this proposition would be " no old books exist " . ]
<unk> similarly we may represent the three similar propositions " no x ' exist " , " no y exist " , and " no y ' exist " .
[ the reader should make out all these for himself .
in the " books " example , these three propositions would be " no new books exist " , & c. ] let us take , next , the proposition " some xy exist " .
this tells us that there is at least one thing in the north-west cell ; that is , that the north-west cell is occupied .
and this we can represent by placing a red counter in it .
·    · | ( .
) | | |  |  | | | | ·    · [ in the " books " example , this proposition would be " some old english books exist " . ]
similarly we may represent the three similar propositions " some xy' exist " , " some x'y exist " , and " some x'y ' exist " .
[ the reader should make out all these for himself .
in the " books " example , these three propositions would be " some old foreign books exist " , & c. ] let us take , next , the proposition " no xy exist " .
this tells us that there is nothing in the north-west cell ; that is , that the north-west cell is empty .
and this we can represent by placing a grey counter in it .
·    · | ( ) | | |  |  | | | | ·    · [ in the " books " example , this proposition would be " no old english books exist " . ]

[ the reader should make out all these for himself .
in the " books " example , these three propositions would be " no old foreign books exist " , & c. ] <unk> we have seen that the proposition " no x exist " may be represented by placing two grey counters in the north half , one in each cell .
·    · | ( ) | ( ) | |  |  | | | | ·    · we have also seen that these two grey counters , taken separately , represent the two propositions " no xy exist " and " no xy ' exist " .
hence we see that the proposition " no x exist " is a double proposition , and is equivalent to the two propositions " no xy exist " and " no xy ' exist " .
[ in the " books " example , this proposition would be " no old books exist " .
hence this is a double proposition , and is equivalent to the two propositions " no old english books exist " and " no old foreign books exist " . ]
§ 3 .
representation of propositions of <unk> let us take , first , the proposition " some x are y " .
this tells us that at least one thing , in the north half , is also in the west half .
hence it must be in the space common to them , that is , in the north-west cell .
hence the north-west cell is occupied .
and this we can represent by placing a red counter in it .
·    · | ( .

[ the reader should make out all these for himself .
in the " books " example , these three propositions would be " some old books are foreign " , & c. ] <unk> let us take , next , the proposition " some y are x " .
this tells us that at least one thing , in the west half , is also in the north half .
hence it must be in the space common to them , that is , in the north-west cell .
hence the north-west cell is occupied .

·    · | ( .

[ the reader should make out all these for himself .
in the " books " example , these three propositions would be " some english books are new " , & c. ] we see that this one diagram has now served to represent no less than three propositions , viz .
( 1 ) " some xy exist ; ( 2 ) some x are y ; ( 3 ) some y are x " .
·    · | ( .
) | | |  |  | | | | ·    · hence these three propositions are equivalent .
[ in the " books " example , these propositions would be ( 1 ) " some old english books exist ; ( 2 ) some old books are english ; ( 3 ) some english books are old " . ]
the two equivalent propositions , " some x are y " and " some y are x " , are said to be <unk> ' to each other ; and the process , of changing one into the other , is called <unk> ' , or <unk> ' .
[ for example , if we were told to convert the proposition " some apples are not ripe , " we should first choose our univ .
( say " fruit " ) , and then complete the proposition , by supplying the substantive " fruit " in the predicate , so that it would be " some apples are <unk> fruit " ; and we should then convert it by <unk> its terms , so that it would be " some <unk> fruit are apples " . ]
<unk> similarly we may represent the three similar <unk> of equivalent propositions ; the whole set of four <unk> being as follows :  ( 1 ) " some xy exist " = " some x are y " = " some y are x " .
( 2 ) " some xy ' exist " = " some x are y ' " = " some y ' are x " .
( 3 ) " some x'y exist " = " some x ' are y " = " some y are x ' " .
( 4 ) " some x'y ' exist " = " some x ' are y ' " = " some y ' are x ' " .
let us take , next , the proposition " no x are y " .
this tell us that no thing , in the north half , is also in the west half .
hence there is nothing in the space common to them , that is , in the north-west cell .
hence the north-west cell is empty .

interpretation of biliteral diagram when marked with <unk> the diagram is supposed to be set before us , with certain counters placed upon it ; and the problem is to find out what proposition , or propositions , the counters represent .
as the process is simply the reverse of that discussed in the previous chapter , we can avail ourselves of the results there obtained , as far as they go .
first , let us suppose that we find a red counter placed in the north-west cell .
·    · | ( .
) | | |  |  | | | | ·    · we know that this represents each of the trio of equivalent propositions " some xy exist " = " some x are y " = " some y are x " .
similarly we may interpret a red counter , when placed in the north-east , or south-west , or south-east cell .
next , let us suppose that we find a grey counter placed in the north-west cell .
·    · | ( ) | | |  |  | | | | ·    · we know that this represents each of the trio of equivalent propositions " no xy exist " = " no x are y " = " no y are x " .
similarly we may interpret a grey counter , when placed in the north-east , or south-west , or south-east cell .
<unk> next , let us suppose that we find a red counter placed on the partition which divides the north half .
·    · | ( . )
| |  |  | | | | ·    · we know that this represents the proposition " some x exist . "
similarly we may interpret a red counter , when placed on the partition which divides the south , or west , or east half .
* * * * * next , let us suppose that we find two red counters placed in the north half , one in each cell .
·    · | ( . ) | ( .
) | |  |  | | | | ·    · we know that this represents the double proposition " some x are y and some are y ' " .
similarly we may interpret two red counters , when placed in the south , or west , or east half .
* * * * * next , let us suppose that we find two grey counters placed in the north half , one in each cell .
·    · | ( ) | ( ) | |  |  | | | | ·    · we know that this represents the proposition " no x exist " .
similarly we may interpret two grey counters , when placed in the south , or west , or east half .
* * * * * lastly , let us suppose that we find a red and a grey counter placed in the north half , the red in the <unk> cell , and the grey in the <unk> cell .
·    · | ( .
) | ( ) | |  |  | | | | ·    · we know that this represents the proposition , " all x are y " .
[ note that the half , occupied by the two counters , settles what is to be the subject of the proposition , and that the cell , occupied by the red counter , settles what is to be its predicate . ]
<unk> similarly we may interpret a red and a grey counter , when placed in any one of the seven similar positions red in north-east , grey in north-west ; red in south-west , grey in south-east ; red in south-east , grey in south-west ; red in north-west , grey in south-west ; red in south-west , grey in north-west ; red in north-east , grey in south-east ; red in south-east , grey in north-east .
once more the genial friend must be appealed to , and requested to examine the reader on tables ii and iii , and to make him not only represent propositions , but also interpret diagrams when marked with counters .
the questions and answers should be like this :  q .
represent " no x ' are y ' . "
a. grey counter in s.e .
cell .
q .
interpret red counter on e. partition .
a .
" some y ' exist . "
q .
represent " all y ' are x . "
a .
red in n.e .
cell ; grey in s.e .
q .
interpret grey counter in s.w .
cell .
a .
" no x'y exist " = " no x ' are y " = " no y are x ' " .
& c. , & c. at first the <unk> <name> need to have the board and counters before him ; but he <name> soon learn to dispense with these , and to answer with his eyes shut or gazing into vacancy .

symbols and <unk> first , let us suppose that the above <unk> diagram is the biliteral diagram that we have been using in book iii. , and that we change it into a triliteral diagram by drawing an inner square , so as to divide each of its 4 cells into 2 portions , thus making 8 cells altogether .
the <unk> diagram shows the result .
[ the reader is strongly advised , in reading this chapter , not to refer to the above diagrams , but to make a large copy of the right-hand one for himself , without any letters , and to have it by him while he reads , and keep his finger on that particular part of it , about which he is reading . ]
<unk> secondly , let us suppose that we have selected a certain adjunct , which we may call " m " , and have subdivided the <unk> into the two classes whose <unk> are m and m ' , and that we have assigned the n.w .
inner cell to the one ( which we may call " the class of <unk> " , or " the <unk> " ) , and the n.w .
outer cell to the other ( which we may call " the class of <unk> " , or " the <unk> " ) .
[ thus , in the " books " example , we might say " let m mean <unk> ' , so that m ' <name> mean <unk> ' " , and we might suppose that we had subdivided the class " old english books " into the two classes , " old english bound books " and " old english unbound books " , and had assigned the n.w .
inner cell to the one , and the n.w .
outer cell to the other . ]
thirdly , let us suppose that we have subdivided the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> in the same manner , and have , in each case , assigned the inner cell to the class possessing the attribute m , and the outer cell to the class possessing the attribute m ' .
[ thus , in the " books " example , we might suppose that we had subdivided the " new english books " into the two classes , " new english bound books " and " new english unbound books " , and had assigned the s.w .
inner cell to the one , and the s.w .
outer cell to the other . ]
it is evident that we have now assigned the inner square to the <unk> , and the outer border to the <unk> .
[ thus , in the " books " example , we have assigned the inner square to " bound books " and the outer border to " unbound books " . ]
when the reader has made himself familiar with this diagram , he ought to be able to find , in a moment , the compartment assigned to a particular pair of attributes , or the cell assigned to a particular trio of attributes .
the following rules <name> help him in doing this :  ( 1 ) arrange the attributes in the order x , y , m. <unk> ( 2 ) take the first of them and find the compartment assigned to it .
( 3 ) then take the second , and find what portion of that compartment is assigned to it .
( 4 ) treat the third , if there is one , in the same way .
[ for example , suppose we have to find the compartment assigned to ym .
we say to ourselves " y has the west half ; and m has the inner portion of that west half . "
again , suppose we have to find the cell assigned to <unk> ' .
we say to ourselves " x ' has the south half ; y has the west portion of that south half , i.e .
has the south-west quarter ; and m ' has the outer portion of that south-west quarter . " ]
the reader should now get his genial friend to question him on the table given on the next <name> , in the style of the following <unk> .
q .
adjunct for south half , inner portion ?
a. x 'm .
q. compartment for m ' ?

[ note that the full meaning of this proposition is ( as explained at p. 12 ) " some existing things are <unk> " . ]
this tells us that there is at least one thing in the inner portion of the north half ; that is , that this compartment is occupied .
and this we can evidently represent by placing a red counter on the partition which divides it .

representation of two propositions of relation , one in terms of x and m , and the other in terms of y and m , on the same <unk> the reader had better now begin to draw little diagrams for himself , and to <name> them with the digits " i " and " o " , instead of using the board and counters : he may put a " i " to represent a red counter ( this may be interpreted to mean " there is at least one thing here " ) , and a " o " to represent a grey counter ( this may be interpreted to mean " there is nothing here " ) .
the pair of propositions , that we shall have to represent , <name> always be , one in terms of x and m , and the other in terms of y and m. when we have to represent a proposition beginning with " all " , we break it up into the two propositions to which it is equivalent .
when we have to represent , on the same diagram , propositions , of which some begin with " some " and others with " no " , we represent the negative ones first .
this <name> sometimes save us from having to put a " i " " on a fence " and afterwards having to shift it into a cell .
[ let us work a few examples .
( 1 ) " no x are m ' ; no y ' are m " .
let us first represent " no x are m ' " .
this gives us diagram a .
then , representing " no y ' are m " on the same diagram , we get diagram b. <unk> a b ·        · ·        · | ( o ) | ( o ) | | ( o ) | ( o ) | | ·  |  · | | ·  |  · | | | | | | | | | ( o ) | | |  |  |  |  | |  |  |  |  | | | | | | | | | ( o ) | | | ·  |  · | | ·  |  · | | | | | | | ·        · ·        · ( 2 ) " some m are x ; no m are y " .
if , neglecting the rule , we were begin with " some m are x " , we should get diagram a .
and if we were then to take " no m are y " , which tells us that the inner n.w .
cell is empty , we should be obliged to take the " i " off the fence ( as it no longer has the choice of two cells ) , and to put it into the inner n.e .
cell , as in diagram c. this trouble may be saved by beginning with " no m are y " , as in diagram b .
and now , when we take " some m are x " , there is no fence to sit on !
the " i " has to go , at once , into the n.e .
cell , as in diagram c. a b c ·        · ·        · ·        · | | | | | | | | | | ·  |  · | | ·  |  · | | ·  |  · | | | ( i ) | | | | ( o ) | | | | | ( o ) | ( i ) | | |  |  |  |  | |  |  |  |  | |  |  |  |  | | | | | | | | ( o ) | | | | | ( o ) | | | | ·  |  · | | ·  |  · | | ·  |  · | | | | | | | | | | ·        · ·        · ·        · ( 3 ) " no x ' are m ' ; all m are y " .
here we begin by breaking up the second into the two propositions to which it is equivalent .
thus we have three propositions to represent , viz.  ( 1 ) " no x ' are m ' ; ( 2 ) some m are y ; ( 3 ) no m are y ' " .
these we <name> take in the order 1 , 3 , 2 .
first we take no .
( 1 ) , viz .
" no x ' are m ' " .
this gives us diagram a. <unk> adding to this , no .
( 3 ) , viz .
" no m are y ' " , we get diagram b .
this time the " i " , representing no .
( 2 ) , viz .
" some m are y , " has to sit on the fence , as there is no " o " to order it off !
this gives us diagram c. a b c ·        · ·        · ·        · | | | | | | | | | | ·  |  · | | ·  |  · | | ·  |  · | | | | | | | | | ( o ) | | | | | ( o ) | | |  |  |  |  | |  |  |  |  | |  | ( i ) |  |  | | | | | | | | | ( o ) | | | | | ( o ) | | | ·  |  · | | ·  |  · | | ·  |  · | | ( o ) | ( o ) | | ( o ) | ( o ) | | ( o ) | ( o ) | ·        · ·        · ·        · ( 4 ) " all m are x ; all y are m " .
here we break up both propositions , and thus get four to represent , viz.  ( 1 ) " some m are x ; ( 2 ) no m are x ' ; ( 3 ) some y are m ; ( 4 ) no y are m ' " .
these we <name> take in the order 2 , 4 , 1 , 3 .
first we take no .
( 2 ) , viz .
" no m are x ' " .
this gives us diagram a .
to this we add no .
( 4 ) , viz .
" no y are m ' " , and thus get diagram b .
if we were to add to this no .
( 1 ) , viz .
" some m are x " , we should have to put the " i " on a fence : so let us try no .
( 3 ) instead , viz .
" some y are m " .
this gives us diagram c. and now there is no need to trouble about no .
( 1 ) , as it would not add anything to our information to put a " i " on the fence .
the diagram already tells us that " some m are x " . ]

interpretation , in terms of x and y , of triliteral diagram , when marked with counters or <unk> the problem before us is , given a marked triliteral diagram , to ascertain what propositions of relation , in terms of x and y , are represented on it .
the best plan , for a beginner , is to draw a biliteral diagram alongside of it , and to transfer , from the one to the other , all the information he can .
he can then read off , from the biliteral diagram , the required propositions .
after a little practice , he <name> be able to dispense with the biliteral diagram , and to read off the result from the triliteral diagram itself .
to transfer the information , observe the following rules :  ( 1 ) examine the n.w .
quarter of the triliteral diagram .
( 2 ) if it contains a " i " , in either cell , it is certainly occupied , and you may <name> the n.w .

<unk> book v. syllogisms .
chapter i .
introductory when a trio of biliteral propositions of relation is such that ( 1 ) all their six terms are species of the same genus , ( 2 ) every two of them contain between them a pair of codivisional classes , ( 3 ) the three propositions are so related that , if the first two were true , the third would be true , the trio is called a <unk> ' ; the genus , of which each of the six terms is a species , is called its <unk> of <unk> ' , or , more briefly , its <unk> ' ; the first two propositions are called its <unk> ' , and the third its <unk> ' ; also the pair of codivisional terms in the premisses are called its <unk> ' , and the other two its <unk> ' .
the conclusion of a syllogism is said to be <unk> ' from its premisses : hence it is usual to <unk> to it the word " therefore " ( or the symbol " . ' . " ) .
<unk> [ note that the <unk> ' are so called because they are eliminated , and do not appear in the conclusion ; and that the <unk> ' are so called because they are retained , and do appear in the conclusion .
note also that the question , whether the conclusion is or is not consequent from the premisses , is not affected by the actual truth or <unk> of any of the trio , but depends entirely on their relationship to each other .
as a <unk> , let us take the trio " no <unk> are <unk> ; no <unk> are <unk> .
no <unk> are <unk> . "
which we may write , as explained at p. 26 , thus :  " no x are m ; no y are m ' .
no x are y " .
here the first and second contain the pair of codivisional classes m and m ' ; the first and third contain the pair x and x ; and the second and third contain the pair y and y .
also the three propositions are ( as we shall see hereafter ) so related that , if the first two were true , the third would also be true .
hence the trio is a syllogism ; the two propositions , " no x are m " and " no y are m ' " , are its premisses ; the proposition " no x are y " is its conclusion ; the terms m and m ' are its eliminands ; and the terms x and y are its <unk> .
hence we may write it thus :  " no x are m ; no y are m ' .
. ' .
no x are y " .
as a second specimen , let us take the trio " all cats understand french ; some chickens are cats .
some chickens understand french " .
these , put into normal form , are " all cats are creatures understanding french ; some chickens are cats .
some chickens are creatures understanding french " .
here all the six terms are species of the genus " creatures . "
also the first and second propositions contain the pair of codivisional classes " cats " and " cats " ; the first and third contain the pair " creatures understanding french " and " creatures understanding french " ; and the second and third contain the pair " chickens " and " chickens " .
<unk> also the three propositions are ( as we shall see at p. 64 ) so related that , if the first two were true , the third would be true .
( the first two are , as it happens , not strictly true in our planet .
but there is nothing to hinder them from being true in some other planet , say mars or jupiter  in which case the third would also be true in that planet , and its inhabitants would probably engage chickens as <unk> .
they would thus secure a singular contingent privilege , unknown in england , namely , that they would be able , at any time when provisions ran short , to <unk> the <unk> for the <unk> ! )
hence the trio is a syllogism ; the genus " creatures " is its <unk> .
' ; the two propositions , " all cats understand french " and " some chickens are cats " , are its premisses , the proposition " some chickens understand french " is its conclusion ; the terms " cats " and " cats " are its eliminands ; and the terms , " creatures understanding french " and " chickens " , are its <unk> .
hence we may write it thus :  " all cats understand french ; some chickens are cats ; . ' .
some chickens understand french " . ]
<unk> chapter ii .
problems in <unk> § 1 .
introductory. when the terms of a proposition are represented by words , it is said to be <unk> ' ; when by letters , <unk> . '
to translate a proposition from concrete into abstract form , we fix on a <unk> , and regard each term as a species of it , and we choose a letter to represent its <unk> .
[ for example , suppose we wish to translate " some soldiers are brave " into abstract form .
we may take " men " as <unk> , and regard " soldiers " and " brave men " as species of the genus " men " ; and we may choose x to represent the peculiar attribute ( say " military " ) of " soldiers , " and y to represent " brave . "
then the proposition may be written " some military men are brave men " ; i.e. " some <unk> are <unk> " ; i.e. ( omitting " men , " as explained at p. 26 ) " some x are y . "
in practice , we should merely say " let univ .
be " men " , x = soldiers , y = brave " , and at once translate " some soldiers are brave " into " some x are y . " ]
the problems we shall have to solve are of two kinds , viz .
( 1 ) " given a pair of propositions of relation , which contain between them a pair of codivisional classes , and which are proposed as premisses : to ascertain what conclusion , if any , is consequent from them . "
( 2 ) " given a trio of propositions of relation , of which every two contain a pair of codivisional classes , and which are proposed as a syllogism : to ascertain whether the proposed conclusion is consequent from the proposed premisses , and , if so , whether it is complete . "
these problems we <name> discuss separately .
<unk> § 2 .
given a pair of propositions of relation , which contain between them a pair of codivisional classes , and which are proposed as premisses : to ascertain what conclusion , if any , is consequent from them. the rules , for doing this , are as follows :  ( 1 ) determine the <unk> of discourse ' .
( 2 ) construct a dictionary , making m and m ( or m and m ' ) represent the pair of codivisional classes , and x ( or x ' ) and y ( or y ' ) the other two .
( 3 ) translate the proposed premisses into abstract form .
( 4 ) represent them , together , on a triliteral diagram .
( 5 ) ascertain what proposition , if any , in terms of x and y , is also represented on it .
( 6 ) translate this into concrete form .
it is evident that , if the proposed premisses were true , this other proposition would also be true .
hence it is a conclusion consequent from the proposed premisses .
[ let us work some examples .
( 1 ) " no son of mine is dishonest ; people always treat an honest man with respect " .
taking " men " as <unk> , we may write these as follows :  " no sons of mine are dishonest men ; all honest men are men treated with respect " .
we can now construct our dictionary , viz .
m = honest ; x = sons of mine ; y = treated with respect .
( note that the expression " x = sons of mine " is an <unk> form of " x = the <unk> of <unk> of mine ' , when regarded as a species of 'men ' " . )
the next thing is to translate the proposed premisses into abstract form , as follows :  " no x are m ' ; all m are y " .
<unk> next , by the process described at p. 50 , we represent these on a triliteral diagram , thus :  ·        · | ( o ) | ( o ) | | ·  |  · | | | | ( o ) | | |  | ( i ) |  |  | | | | ( o ) | | | ·  |  · | | | | ·        · next , by the process described at p. 53 , we transfer to a biliteral diagram all the information we can .
·    · | | ( o ) | |  |  | | | | ·    · the result we read as " no x are y ' " or as " no y ' are x , " whichever we prefer .
so we refer to our dictionary , to see which <name> look best ; and we choose " no x are y ' " , which , translated into concrete form , is " no son of mine fails to be treated with respect " .
( 2 ) " all cats understand french ; some chickens are cats " .
taking " creatures " as <unk> , we write these as follows :  " all cats are creatures understanding french ; some chickens are cats " .
we can now construct our dictionary , viz .
m = cats ; x = understanding french ; y = chickens .
the proposed premisses , translated into abstract form , are " all m are x ; some y are m " .
in order to represent these on a triliteral diagram , we break up the first into the two propositions to which it is equivalent , and thus get the three propositions ( 1 ) " some m are x ; ( 2 ) no m are x ' ; ( 3 ) some y are m " .
the rule , given at p. 50 , would make us take these in the order 2 , 1 , 3 .
this , however , would produce the result ·         · | | | | ·   |   · | | | ( i ) ( i ) | | | |   |   | | | | ( o ) | ( o ) | | | ·   |   · | | | | ·         · <unk> so it would be better to take them in the order 2 , 3 , 1 .
nos .
( 2 ) and ( 3 ) give us the result here shown ; and now we need not trouble about no .
( 1 ) , as the proposition " some m are x " is already represented on the diagram .
·        · | | | | ·  |  · | | | ( i ) | | | |  |  |  |  | | | ( o ) | ( o ) | | | ·  |  · | | | | ·        · transferring our information to a biliteral diagram , we get ·    · | ( i ) | | |  |  | | | | ·    · this result we can read either as " some x are y " or " some y are x " .
after consulting our dictionary , we choose " some y are x " , which , translated into concrete form , is " some chickens understand french . "
( 3 ) " all diligent students are successful ; all ignorant students are unsuccessful " .
let univ .
be " students " ; m = successful ; x = diligent ; y = ignorant .
these premisses , in abstract form , are " all x are m ; all y are m ' " .
these , broken up , give us the four propositions ( 1 ) " some x are m ; ( 2 ) no x are m ' ; ( 3 ) some y are m ' ; ( 4 ) no y are m " .
which we <name> take in the order 2 , 4 , 1 , 3 .
representing these on a triliteral diagram , we get ·        · | ( o ) | ( o ) | | ·  |  · | | | ( o ) | ( i ) | | |  |  |  |  | | | ( o ) | | | | ·  |  · | | ( i ) | | ·        · and this information , transferred to a biliteral diagram , is ·    · | ( o ) | ( i ) | |  |  | | ( i ) | | ·    · here we get two conclusions , viz .
" all x are y ' ; all y are x ' . "
<unk> and these , translated into concrete form , are " all diligent students are ( <unk> , i.e . )
learned ; all ignorant students are ( <unk> , i.e . )
idle " .
( see p .
4 . )
( 4 ) " of the prisoners who were put on their trial at the last <unk> , all , against whom the verdict <unk> ' was returned , were sentenced to imprisonment ; some , who were sentenced to imprisonment , were also sentenced to hard labour " .
let univ .
be " the prisoners who were put on their trial at the last <unk> " ; m = who were sentenced to imprisonment ; x = against whom the verdict <unk> ' was returned ; y = who were sentenced to hard labour .
the premisses , translated into abstract form , are " all x are m ; some m are y " .
breaking up the first , we get the three ( 1 ) " some x are m ; ( 2 ) no x are m ' ; ( 3 ) some m are y " .
representing these , in the order 2 , 1 , 3 , on a triliteral diagram , we get ·        · | ( o ) | ( o ) | | ·  |  · | | | ( i ) | | |  | ( i ) |  |  | | | | | | | ·  |  · | | | | ·        · here we get no conclusion at all .
you would very likely have guessed , if you had seen only the premisses , that the conclusion would be " some , against whom the verdict <unk> ' was returned , were sentenced to hard labour " .
but this conclusion is not even true , with regard to the <unk> i have here invented .
" not true !  " you exclaim .
" then who were they , who were sentenced to imprisonment and were also sentenced to hard labour ?
they must have had the verdict <unk> ' returned against them , or how could they be sentenced ? "
well , it happened like this , you see .
they were three ruffians , who had committed <unk> .
when they were put on their trial , they pleaded <unk> ' .
so no verdict was returned at all ; and they were sentenced at once . ]
i <name> now work out , in their briefest form , as models for the reader to imitate in working examples , the above four concrete problems .

the method of <unk> .
chapter i .
introductory. let us agree that " x { 1 } " shall mean " some existing things have the attribute x " , i.e .
( more briefly ) " some x exist " ; also that " xy { 1 } " shall mean " some xy exist " , and so on .
such a proposition may be called an <unk> . '
[ note that , when there are two letters in the expression , it does not in the least matter which stands first : " xy { 1 } " and " <unk> { 1 } " mean exactly the same . ]
also that " x { 0 } " shall mean " no existing things have the attribute x " , i.e .
( more briefly ) " no x exist " ; also that " xy { 0 } " shall mean " no xy exist " , and so on .
such a proposition may be called a <unk> ' .
also that " + " shall mean " and " .
[ thus " ab { 1 } + cd { 0 } " means " some ab exist and no cd exist " . ]
also that " ¶ " shall mean " would , if true , prove " .
[ thus , " x { 0 } ¶ xy { 0 } " means " the proposition 'no x <unk> would , if true , prove the proposition 'no xy exist ' " . ]
when two letters are both of them <unk> , or both not <unk> , they are said to have <unk> <unk> ' , or to be <unk> ' : when one is <unk> , and the other not , they are said to have <unk> <unk> ' , or to be <unk> ' .
<unk> chapter ii .
representation of propositions of <unk> let us take , first , the proposition " some x are y " .
this , we know , is equivalent to the proposition of existence " some xy exist " .
( see p .
31 . )
hence it may be represented by the expression " xy { 1 } " .
the converse proposition " some y are x " may of course be represented by the same expression , viz .
" xy { 1 } " .
similarly we may represent the three similar pairs of converse propositions , viz.  " some x are y ' " = " some y ' are x " , " some x ' are y " = " some y are x ' " , " some x ' are y ' " = " some y ' are x ' " .
let us take , next , the proposition " no x are y " .
this , we know , is equivalent to the proposition of existence " no xy exist " .
( see p .
33 . )
hence it may be represented by the expression " xy { 0 } " .
the converse proposition " no y are x " may of course be represented by the same expression , viz .
" xy { 0 } " .
similarly we may represent the three similar pairs of converse propositions , viz.  " no x are y ' " = " no y ' are x " , " no x ' are y " = " no y are x ' " , " no x ' are y ' " = " no y ' are x ' " .
<unk> let us take , next , the proposition " all x are y " .
now it is evident that the double proposition of existence " some x exist and no xy ' exist " tells us that some <unk> exist , but that none of them have the attribute y ' : that is , it tells us that all of them have the attribute y : that is , it tells us that " all x are y " .
also it is evident that the expression " x { 1 } + xy' { 0 } " represents this double proposition .
hence it also represents the proposition " all x are y " .
[ the reader <name> perhaps be puzzled by the statement that the proposition " all x are y " is equivalent to the double proposition " some x exist and no xy ' exist , " remembering that it was stated , at p. 33 , to be equivalent to the double proposition " some x are y and no x are y ' " ( i.e .
" some xy exist and no xy' exist " ) .
the explanation is that the proposition " some xy exist " contains superfluous information .
" some x exist " is enough for our purpose . ]
this expression may be written in a shorter form , viz .
" x { 1 } y' { 0 } " , since each <unk> takes effect back to the beginning of the expression .
similarly we may represent the seven similar propositions " all x are y ' " , " all x ' are y " , " all x ' are y ' " , " all y are x " , " all y are x ' " , " all y ' are x " , and " all y ' are x ' " .
[ the reader should make out all these for himself . ]
it <name> be convenient to remember that , in translating a proposition , beginning with " all " , from abstract form into <unk> form , or vice <unk> , the predicate changes sign ( that is , changes from positive to negative , or else from negative to positive ) .
[ thus , the proposition " all y are x ' " becomes " y { 1 } x { 0 } " , where the predicate changes from x ' to x .
again , the expression " x' { 1 } y' { 0 } " becomes " all x ' are y " , where the predicate changes for y ' to y . ]
<unk> chapter iii .
<unk> § 1 .
representation of <unk> we already know how to represent each of the three propositions of a syllogism in <unk> form .
when that is done , all we need , besides , is to write the three expressions in a row , with " + " between the premisses , and " ¶ " before the conclusion .
[ thus the syllogism " no x are m ' ; all m are y .
. ' .
no x are y ' . "
may be represented thus :  <unk> { 0 } + m { 1 } y' { 0 } ¶ xy' { 0 } when a proposition has to be translated from concrete form into <unk> form , the reader <name> find it convenient , just at first , to translate it into abstract form , and thence into <unk> form .
but , after a little practice , he <name> find it quite easy to go straight from concrete form to <unk> form . ]
<unk> § 2 .
formulæ for solving problems in <unk> when once we have found , by diagrams , the conclusion to a given pair of premisses , and have represented the syllogism in <unk> form , we have a formula , by which we can at once find , without having to use diagrams again , the conclusion to any other pair of premisses having the same <unk> forms .
[ thus , the expression xm { 0 } + ym' { 0 } ¶ xy { 0 } is a formula , by which we can find the conclusion to any pair of premisses whose <unk> forms are xm { 0 } + ym' { 0 } for example , suppose we had the pair of propositions " no <unk> are healthy ; no unhealthy men are strong " .
proposed as premisses .
taking " men " as our <unk> ' , and making m = healthy ; x = <unk> ; y = strong ; we might translate the pair into abstract form , thus :  " no x are m ; no m ' are y " .
these , in <unk> form , would be xm { 0 } + <unk> { 0 } which are identical with those in our formula .
hence we at once know the conclusion to be xy { 0 } that is , in abstract form , " no x are y " ; that is , in concrete form , " no <unk> are strong " . ]
i shall now take three different forms of pairs of premisses , and work out their conclusions , once for all , by diagrams ; and thus obtain some useful formulæ .
i shall call them " fig .
i " , " fig .
ii " , and " fig .

xy { 0 } | ( o ) | | ·        · in this case we see that the conclusion is a <unk> , and that the <unk> have kept their signs .
and we should find this rule to hold good with any pair of premisses which fulfil the given conditions .
[ the reader had better satisfy himself of this , by working out , on diagrams , several varieties , such as m { 1 } x { 0 } + ym' { 0 } ( which ¶ xy { 0 } ) <unk> { 0 } + m { 1 } y { 0 } ( which ¶ xy { 0 } ) <unk> { 0 } + ym' { 0 } ( which ¶ x'y { 0 } ) m' { 1 } x' { 0 } + m { 1 } y' { 0 } ( which ¶ x'y' { 0 } ) . ]
if either <unk> is asserted in the premisses to exist , of course it may be so asserted in the conclusion .
hence we get two <unk> of fig .
i , viz .
( a ) where one <unk> is so asserted ; ( b ) where both are so asserted .
[ the reader had better work out , on diagrams , examples of these two <unk> , such as m { 1 } x { 0 } + y { 1 } m' { 0 } ( which proves y { 1 } x { 0 } ) x { 1 } m' { 0 } + m { 1 } y { 0 } ( which proves x { 1 } y { 0 } ) x' { 1 } m { 0 } + y { 1 } m' { 0 } ( which proves x' { 1 } y { 0 } + y { 1 } x' { 0 } ) . ]
the formula , to be remembered , is xm { 0 } + ym' { 0 } ¶ xy { 0 } with the following two rules :  ( 1 ) two <unk> , with unlike eliminands , yield a <unk> , in which both <unk> keep their <unk> <unk> ( 2 ) a <unk> , asserted in the premisses to exist , may be so asserted in the <unk> [ note that rule ( 1 ) is merely the formula expressed in words . ]

<unk> § 3 .
<unk> any argument which <unk> us , by seeming to prove what it does not really prove , may be called a <unk> ' ( derived from the latin verb <unk> " i deceive " ) : but the particular kind , to be now discussed , consists of a pair of propositions , which are proposed as the premisses of a syllogism , but yield no conclusion .
when each of the proposed premisses is a proposition in i , or e , or a , ( the only kinds with which we are now concerned , ) the fallacy may be detected by the <unk> of diagrams , ' by simply setting them out on a triliteral diagram , and observing that they yield no information which can be transferred to the biliteral diagram .
but suppose we were working by the <unk> of <unk> , ' and had to deal with a pair of proposed premisses , which happened to be a <unk> , ' how could we be certain that they would not yield any conclusion ?
our best plan is , i think , to deal with <unk> in the same was as we have already dealt with syllogisms : that is , to take certain forms of pairs of propositions , and to work them out , once for all , on the triliteral diagram , and ascertain that they yield no conclusion ; and then to record them , for future use , as formulæ for <unk> , just as we have already recorded our three formulæ for syllogisms .
<unk> now , if we were to record the two sets of formulæ in the same shape , viz .
by the method of <unk> , there would be considerable risk of confusing the two kinds .
hence , in order to keep them distinct , i propose to record the formulæ for <unk> in words , and to call them " forms " instead of " formulæ . "
let us now proceed to find , by the method of diagrams , three " forms of <unk> , " which we <name> then put on record for future use .
they are as follows :  ( 1 ) fallacy of like eliminands not asserted to exist .
( 2 ) fallacy of unlike eliminands with an entity-premiss .
( 3 ) fallacy of two <unk> .
these shall be discussed separately , and it <name> be seen that each fails to yield a conclusion .
( 1 ) fallacy of like eliminands not asserted to <unk> it is evident that neither of the given propositions can be an entity , since that kind asserts the existence of both of its terms ( see p. 20 ) .
hence they must both be <unk> .
hence the given pair may be represented by ( xm { 0 } + ym { 0 } ) , with or without x { 1 } , y { 1 } .

method of proceeding with a given pair of <unk> let us suppose that we have before us a pair of propositions of relation , which contain between them a pair of codivisional classes , and that we wish to ascertain what conclusion , if any , is consequent from them .
we translate them , if necessary , into <unk> , and then proceed as follows :  ( 1 ) we examine their <unk> , in order to see whether they are ( a ) a pair of <unk> ; or ( b ) a <unk> and an entity ; or ( c ) a pair of <unk> .
( 2 ) if they are a pair of <unk> , we examine their eliminands , in order to see whether they are unlike or like .
if their eliminands are unlike , it is a case of fig .
i .
we then examine their <unk> , to see whether one or both of them are asserted to exist .
if one <unk> is so asserted , it is a case of fig .
i ( a ) ; if both , it is a case of fig .
i ( b ) .
if their eliminands are like , we examine them , in order to see whether either of them is asserted to exist .
if so , it is a case of fig .

( 3 ) if they are a <unk> and an entity , we examine their eliminands , in order to see whether they are like or unlike .
if their eliminands are like , it is a case of fig .

chapter i .
introductory. when a set of three or more biliteral propositions are such that all their terms are species of the same genus , and are also so related that two of them , taken together , yield a conclusion , which , taken with another of them , yields another conclusion , and so on , until all have been taken , it is evident that , if the original set were true , the last conclusion would also be true .
such a set , with the last conclusion tacked on , is called a <unk> ' ; the original set of propositions is called its <unk> ' ; each of the intermediate conclusions is called a <unk> <unk> ' of the sorites ; the last conclusion is called its <unk> <unk> , ' or , more briefly , its <unk> ' ; the genus , of which all the terms are species , is called its <unk> of <unk> ' , or , more briefly , its <unk> ' ; the terms , used as eliminands in the syllogisms , are called its <unk> ' ; and the two terms , which are retained , and therefore appear in the conclusion , are called its <unk> ' .
[ note that each partial conclusion contains one or two eliminands ; but that the complete conclusion contains <unk> only . ]
the conclusion is said to be <unk> ' from the premisses ; for which reason it is usual to <unk> to it the word " therefore " ( or the symbol " . ' . " ) .
[ note that the question , whether the conclusion is or is not consequent from the premisses , is not affected by the actual truth or <unk> of any one of the propositions which make up the sorites , by depends entirely on their relationship to one another .
<unk> as a <unk> , let us take the following set of 5 propositions :  ( 1 ) " no a are b ' ; ( 2 ) all b are c ; ( 3 ) all c are d ; ( 4 ) no e ' are a ' ; ( 5 ) all h are e ' " .
here the first and second , taken together , yield " no a are c ' " .
this , taken along with the third , yields " no a are d ' " .
this , taken along with the fourth , yields " no d ' are e ' " .
and this , taken along with the fifth , yields " all h are d " .
hence , if the original set were true , this would also be true .
hence the original set , with this tacked on , is a sorites ; the original set is its premisses ; the proposition " all h are d " is its conclusion ; the terms a , b , c , e are its eliminands ; and the terms d and h are its <unk> .
hence we may write the whole sorites thus :  " no a are b ' ; all b are c ; all c are d ; no e ' are a ' ; all h are e ' .
. ' .
all h are d " .
in the above sorites , the 3 partial conclusions are the positions " no a are e ' " , " no a are d ' " , " no d ' are e ' " ; but , if the premisses were arranged in other ways , other partial conclusions might be obtained .
thus , the order <unk> yields the partial conclusions " no c ' are b ' " , " all h are b " , " all h are c " .
there are altogether nine partial conclusions to this sorites , which the reader <name> find it an interesting task to make out for himself . ]
<unk> chapter ii .
problems in <unk> § 1 .
introductory. the problems we shall have to solve are of the following form :  " given three or more propositions of relation , which are proposed as premisses : to ascertain what conclusion , if any , is consequent from them . "
we <name> limit ourselves , at present , to problems which can be worked by the formulæ of fig .
i .
( see p .
75 . )
those , that require other formulæ , are rather too hard for beginners .
such problems may be solved by either of two methods , viz .
( 1 ) the method of separate syllogisms ; ( 2 ) the method of <unk> .
these shall be discussed separately .
<unk> § 2 .
solution by method of separate <unk> the rules , for doing this , are as follows :  ( 1 ) name the <unk> of discourse ' .
( 2 ) construct a dictionary , making a , b , c , & c. represent the terms .
( 3 ) put the proposed premisses into <unk> form .
( 4 ) select two which , containing between them a pair of codivisional classes , can be used as the premisses of a syllogism .
( 5 ) find their conclusion by formula .
( 6 ) find a third premiss which , along with this conclusion , can be used as the premisses of a second syllogism .
( 7 ) find a second conclusion by formula .
( 8 ) proceed thus , until all the proposed premisses have been used .
( 9 ) put the last conclusion , which is the complete conclusion of the sorites , into concrete form .
[ as an example of this process , let us take , as the proposed set of premisses , ( 1 ) " all the policemen on this beat sup with our cook ; ( 2 ) no man with long hair can fail to be a poet ; ( 3 ) <name> judd has never been in prison ; ( 4 ) our cook 's <unk> ' all love cold mutton ; ( 5 ) none but policemen on this beat are poets ; ( 6 ) none but her <unk> ' ever sup with our cook ; ( 7 ) men with short hair have all been in prison . "
univ .
" men " ; a = <name> judd ; b = cousins of our cook ; c = having been in prison ; d = long-haired ; e = loving cold mutton ; h = poets ; k = policemen on this beat ; l = <unk> with our cook <unk> we now have to put the proposed premisses into <unk> form .
let us begin by putting them into abstract form .
the result is ( 1 ) " all k are l ; ( 2 ) no d are h ' ; ( 3 ) all a are c ' ; ( 4 ) all b are e ; ( 5 ) no k ' are h ; ( 6 ) no b ' are l ; ( 7 ) all d ' are c. " and it is now easy to put them into <unk> form , as follows :  ( 1 ) k { 1 } <unk> { 0 } ( 2 ) <unk> { 0 } ( 3 ) a { 1 } c { 0 } ( 4 ) b { 1 } e' { 0 } ( 5 ) <unk> { 0 } ( 6 ) <unk> { 0 } ( 7 ) d' { 1 } c' { 0 } we now have to find a pair of premisses which <name> yield a conclusion .
let us begin with no .
( 1 ) , and look down the list , till we come to one which we can take along with it , so as to form premisses belonging to fig .
i .
we find that no .
( 5 ) <name> do , since we can take k as our <unk> .
so our first syllogism is ( 1 ) k { 1 } <unk> { 0 } ( 5 ) <unk> { 0 } . ' .
<unk> { 0 } ... ( 8 ) we must now begin again with <unk> { 0 } and find a premiss to go along with it .
we find that no .
( 2 ) <name> do , h being our <unk> .
so our next syllogism is ( 8 ) <unk> { 0 } ( 2 ) <unk> { 0 } . ' .
<unk> { 0 } ... ( 9 ) we have now used up nos .
( 1 ) , ( 5 ) , and ( 2 ) , and must search among the others for a partner for <unk> { 0 } .
we find that no .
( 6 ) <name> do .
so we write ( 9 ) <unk> { 0 } ( 6 ) <unk> { 0 } . ' .
<unk> { 0 } ... ( 10 ) now what can we take along with <unk> { 0 } ?
no .
( 4 ) <name> do .
( 10 ) <unk> { 0 } ( 4 ) b { 1 } e' { 0 } . ' .
<unk> { 0 } ... ( 11 ) <unk> along with this we may take no .
( 7 ) .
( 11 ) <unk> { 0 } ( 7 ) d' { 1 } c' { 0 } . ' .
<unk> { 0 } ... ( 12 ) and along with this we may take no .
( 3 ) .
( 12 ) <unk> { 0 } ( 3 ) a { 1 } c { 0 } . ' .
a { 1 } e' { 0 } this complete conclusion , translated into abstract form , is " all a are e " ; and this , translated into concrete form , is " <name> judd loves cold mutton . "
in actually working this problem , the above explanations would , of course , be omitted , and all , that would appear on paper , would be as follows :  ( 1 ) k { 1 } <unk> { 0 } ( 2 ) <unk> { 0 } ( 3 ) a { 1 } c { 0 } ( 4 ) b { 1 } e' { 0 } ( 5 ) <unk> { 0 } ( 6 ) <unk> { 0 } ( 7 ) d' { 1 } c' { 0 } ( 1 ) k { 1 } <unk> { 0 } ( 5 ) <unk> { 0 } . ' .
<unk> { 0 } ... ( 8 ) ( 8 ) <unk> { 0 } ( 2 ) <unk> { 0 } . ' .
<unk> { 0 } ... ( 9 ) ( 9 ) <unk> { 0 } ( 6 ) <unk> { 0 } . ' .
<unk> { 0 } ... ( 10 ) ( 10 ) <unk> { 0 } ( 4 ) b { 1 } e' { 0 } . ' .
<unk> { 0 } ... ( 11 ) ( 11 ) <unk> { 0 } ( 7 ) d' { 1 } c' { 0 } . ' .
<unk> { 0 } ... ( 12 ) ( 12 ) <unk> { 0 } ( 3 ) a { 1 } c { 0 } . ' .
a { 1 } e' { 0 } note that , in working a sorites by this process , we may begin with any premiss we choose . ]
<unk> § 3 .
solution by method of <unk> consider the pair of premisses xm { 0 } + ym' { 0 } which yield the conclusion xy { 0 } we see that , in order to get this conclusion , we must eliminate m and m ' , and write x and y together in one expression .
now , if we agree to <name> m and m ' as eliminated , and to read the two expressions together , as if they were written in one , the two premisses <name> then exactly represent the conclusion , and we need not write it out separately .
let us agree to <name> the eliminated letters by <unk> them , putting a single score under the first , and a double one under the second .
the two premisses now become xm { 0 } + ym' { 0 }  = which we read as " xy { 0 } " .
in copying out the premisses for <unk> , it <name> be convenient to omit all <unk> .
as to the " 0 's " we may always suppose them written , and , as to the " 1 's " , we are not concerned to know which terms are asserted to exist , except those which appear in the complete conclusion ; and for them it <name> be easy enough to refer to the original list .
<unk> [ i <name> now go through the process of solving , by this method , the example worked in § 2 .
the data are 1 2 3 4 k { 1 } <unk> { 0 } + <unk> { 0 } + a { 1 } c { 0 } + b { 1 } e' { 0 } + 5 6 7 <unk> { 0 } + <unk> { 0 } + d' { 1 } c' { 0 } the reader should take a piece of paper , and write out this solution for himself .
the first line <name> consist of the above data ; the second must be composed , bit by bit , according to the following directions .
we begin by writing down the first premiss , with its <unk> over it , but omitting the <unk> .
we have now to find a premiss which can be combined with this , i.e. , a premiss containing either k ' or l. the first we find is no .
5 ; and this we tack on , with a + .
to get the conclusion from these , k and k ' must be eliminated , and what remains must be taken as one expression .
so we <unk> them , putting a single score under k , and a double one under k ' .
the result we read as <unk> .
we must now find a premiss containing either l or h ' .
looking along the row , we fix on no .
2 , and tack it on .
now these 3 <unk> are really equivalent to ( <unk> + <unk> ' ) , in which h and h ' must be eliminated , and what remains taken as one expression .
so we <unk> them .
the result reads as l 'd .
we now want a premiss containing l or d ' .
no .
6 <name> do .
these 4 <unk> are really equivalent to ( l 'd + <unk> ) .
so we <unk> l ' and l. the result reads as <unk> ' .
we now want a premiss containing d ' or b .
no .
4 <name> do .
here we <unk> b ' and b .
the result reads as de ' .
we now want a premiss containing d ' or e. no .
7 <name> do .
here we <unk> d and d ' .
the result reads as <unk> ' .
we now want a premiss containing c or e. no .
3 <name> do  in fact must do , as it is the only one left .
here we <unk> c ' and c ; and , as the whole thing now reads as <unk> , we tack on <unk> { 0 } as the conclusion , with a ¶ .
we now look along the row of data , to see whether e ' or a has been given as <unk> .
we find that a has been so given in no .
3 .
so we add this fact to the conclusion , which now stands as ¶ <unk> { 0 } + a { 1 } , i.e. ¶ a { 1 } e' { 0 } ; i.e .
" all a are e. " if the reader has faithfully obeyed the above directions , his written solution <name> now stand as follows :  1 2 3 4 k { 1 } <unk> { 0 } + <unk> { 0 } + a { 1 } c { 0 } + b { 1 } e' { 0 } + 5 6 7 <unk> { 0 } + <unk> { 0 } + d' { 1 } c' { 0 } 1 5 2 6 4 7 3 <unk> ' + <unk> + <unk> ' + <unk> + be ' + <unk> ' + ac  =  =  = = =  = ¶ <unk> { 0 } + a { 1 } i.e. ¶ a { 1 } e' { 0 } ; i.e. " all a are e. " <unk> the reader should now take a second piece of paper , and copy the data only , and try to work out the solution for himself , beginning with some other premiss .
if he fails to bring out the conclusion a { 1 } e' { 0 } , i would advise him to take a third piece of paper , and begin again ! ]
i <name> now work out , in its briefest form , a sorites of 5 premisses , to serve as a model for the reader to imitate in working examples .
( 1 ) " i greatly value everything that <name> gives me ; ( 2 ) nothing but this bone <name> satisfy my dog ; ( 3 ) i take particular care of everything that i greatly value ; ( 4 ) this bone was a present from <name> ; ( 5 ) the things , of which i take particular care , are things i do not give to my dog " .
univ .
" things " ; a = given by <name> to me ; b = given by me to my dog ; c = greatly valued by me ; d = satisfactory to my dog ; e = taken particular care of by me ; h = this bone .
1 2 3 4 5 a { 1 } c' { 0 } + <unk> { 0 } + c { 1 } e' { 0 } + h { 1 } a' { 0 } + e { 1 } b { 0 } 1 3 4 2 5 ac ' + ce ' + <name> ' + h 'd + <unk> ¶ <unk> { 0 }  = = = = i.e .
" nothing , that i give my dog , satisfies him , " or , " my dog is not satisfied with anything that i give him ! "
[ note that , in working a sorites by this process , we may begin with any premiss we choose .
for instance , we might begin with no .

<unk> notes .
( a ) [ see p. 80 ] .
one of the favourite objections , brought against the science of logic by its <unk> , is that a syllogism has no real validity as an argument , since it involves the fallacy of <unk> <unk> ( i.e .
" begging the question " , the essence of which is that the whole conclusion is involved in one of the premisses ) .
this formidable objection is <unk> , with beautiful clearness and simplicity , by these three diagrams , which show us that , in each of the three figures , the conclusion is really involved in the two premisses taken together , each contributing its share .
thus , in fig .
i. , the premiss xm { 0 } empties the inner cell of the n.w .
quarter , while the premiss ym { 0 } empties its outer cell .
hence it needs the two premisses to empty the whole of the n.w .
quarter , and thus to prove the conclusion xy { 0 } .
again , in fig .
ii. , the premiss xm { 0 } empties the inner cell of the n.w .
quarter .
the premiss ym { 1 } merely tells us that the inner portion of the w. half is occupied , so that we may place a 'i ' in it , somewhere ; but , if this were the whole of our information , we should not know in which cell to place it , so that it would have to 'sit on the fence ' : it is only when we learn , from the other premiss , that the upper of these two cells is empty , that we feel <unk> to place the 'i ' in the lower cell , and thus to prove the conclusion x'y { 1 } .
lastly , in fig .
iii. , the information , that m exists , merely <unk> us to place a 'i ' somewhere in the inner square   but it has large choice of fences to sit upon !
it needs the premiss xm { 0 } to drive it out of the n. half of that square ; and it needs the premiss ym { 0 } to drive it out of the w. half .
hence it needs the two premisses to drive it into the inner portion of the s.e .
quarter , and thus to prove the conclusion x'y' { 1 } .
<unk> appendix , addressed to teachers .
§ 1 .
introductory. there are several matters , too hard to discuss with <unk> , which nevertheless need to be explained to any teachers , into whose hands this book may fall , in order that they may thoroughly understand what my symbolic method is , and in what respects it differs from the many other methods already published .
these matters are as follows :  the " <unk> import " of propositions .
the use of " <unk> " ( or " <unk> " ) as a <unk> .
the theory " two negative premisses prove nothing . "
<unk> 's method of diagrams .
<unk> 's method of diagrams .
my method of diagrams .
the solution of a syllogism by various methods .
my method of treating syllogisms and sorites .
some account of parts ii , iii .
§ 2 .
the " <unk> import " of <unk> the writers , and editors , of the logical text-books which run in the ordinary grooves   to whom i shall hereafter refer by the ( i <name> inoffensive ) title " the logicians "   take , on this subject , what seems to me to be a more humble position than is at all necessary .
they speak of the <unk> of a proposition " with bated breath " , almost as if it were a living , conscious entity , capable of declaring for itself what it chose to mean , and that we , poor human creatures , had nothing to do but to ascertain what was its sovereign <name> and pleasure , and submit to it .
<unk> in opposition to this view , i maintain that any writer of a book is fully <unk> in attaching any meaning he likes to any word or phrase he intends to use .
if i find an author saying , at the beginning of his book , " let it be understood that by the word <unk> ' i shall always mean <unk> ' , and that by the word <unk> ' i shall always mean <unk> ' , " i meekly accept his ruling , however <unk> i may think it .
and so , with regard to the question whether a proposition is or is not to be understood as asserting the existence of its subject , i maintain that every writer may adopt his own rule , provided of course that it is consistent with itself and with the accepted facts of logic .
let us consider certain views that may logically be held , and thus settle which of them may conveniently be held ; after which i shall hold myself free to declare which of them i intend to hold .
the kinds of propositions , to be considered , are those that begin with " some " , with " no " , and with " all " .
these are usually called propositions " in i " , " in e " , and " in a " .
first , then , a proposition in i may be understood as asserting , or else as not asserting , the existence of its subject .
( by " existence " i mean of course whatever kind of existence suits its nature .
the two propositions , " dreams exist " and " drums exist " , denote two totally different kinds of " existence " .
a dream is an aggregate of ideas , and exists only in the mind of a dreamer : whereas a drum is an aggregate of wood and parchment , and exists in the hands of a drummer . )
first , let us suppose that i " asserts " ( i.e .
" asserts the existence of its subject " ) .
here , of course , we must regard a proposition in a as making the same assertion , since it necessarily contains a proposition in i .
we now have i and a " asserting " .
does this leave us free to make what supposition we choose as to e ?
my answer is " no .
we are tied down to the supposition that e does not assert . "
this can be proved as follows :  if possible , let e " assert " .
then ( taking x , y , and z to represent attributes ) we see that , if the proposition " no xy are z " be true , some things exist with the attributes x and y : i.e .
" some x are y . "
<unk> also we know that , if the proposition " some xy are z " be true , the same result follows .
but these two propositions are <unk> , so that one or other of them must be true .
hence this result is always true : i.e .
the proposition " some x are y " is always true !
<unk> est <unk> ( see note ( a ) , p. 195 ) .
we see , then , that the supposition " i asserts " necessarily leads to " a asserts , but e does not " .
and this is the first of the various views that may <unk> be held .
next , let us suppose that i does not " assert . "
and , along with this , let us take the supposition that e does " assert . "
hence the proposition " no x are y " means " some x exist , and none of them are y " : i.e .
" all of them are <unk> , " which is a proposition in a .
we also know , of course , that the proposition " all x are not-y " proves " no x are y . "
now two propositions , each of which proves the other , are equivalent .
hence every proposition in a is equivalent to one in e , and therefore " asserts " .
hence our second conceivable view is " e and a assert , but i does not . "
this view does not seen to involve any necessary contradiction with itself or with the accepted facts of logic .
but , when we come to test it , as applied to the actual facts of life , we shall find i think , that it fits in with them so badly that its adoption would be , to say the least of it , singularly inconvenient for ordinary folk .
let me record a little dialogue i have just held with my friend jones , who is trying to form a new club , to be regulated on strictly logical principles .
<unk> " well , jones !
have you got your new club started yet ? "
jones ( rubbing his hands ) .
" you 'll be glad to hear that some of the members ( mind , i only say <unk> ' ) are millionaires !
rolling in gold , my boy ! "
<unk> " that sounds well .
and how many members have entered ? "
jones ( staring ) .
" none at all .
we have n't got it started yet .
what makes you think we have ? "
<unk> " why , i thought you said that some of the members   " <unk> jones ( contemptuously ) .
" you do n't seem to be aware that we're working on strictly logical principles .
a particular proposition does not assert the existence of its subject .
i merely meant to say that we 've made a rule not to admit any members till we have at least three candidates whose incomes are over ten thousand a year ! "
<unk> " oh , that's what you meant , is it ?
let 's hear some more of your rules . "
<unk> " another is , that no one , who has been convicted seven times of forgery , is admissible . "
<unk> " and here , again , i suppose you do n't mean to assert there are any such convicts in existence ? "
<unk> " why , that 's exactly what i do mean to assert !
do n't you know that a universal negative asserts the existence of its subject ?
of course we did n't make that rule till we had satisfied ourselves that there are several such convicts now living . "
the reader can now decide for himself how far this second conceivable view would fit in with the facts of life .
he <name> , i think , agree with me that jones ' view , of the <unk> import ' of propositions , would lead to some inconvenience .
thirdly , let us suppose that neither i nor e " asserts " .
now the supposition that the two propositions , " some x are y " and " no x are not-y " , do not " assert " , necessarily involves the supposition that " all x are y " does not " assert " , since it would be absurd to suppose that they assert , when combined , more than they do when taken separately .
hence the third ( and last ) of the conceivable views is that neither i , nor e , nor a , " asserts " .
the advocates of this third view would interpret the proposition " some x are y " to mean " if there were any x in existence , some of them would be y " ; and so with e and a .
it admits of proof that this view , as regards a , conflicts with the accepted facts of logic .
let us take the syllogism <unk> , which is universally accepted as valid .
its form is " all m are x ; all m are y .
. ' .
some y are x " .
<unk> this they would interpret as follows :  " if there were any m in existence , all of them would be x ; if there were any m in existence , all of them would be y .
. ' .
if there were any y in existence , some of them would be x " .
that this conclusion does not follow has been so briefly and clearly explained by mr. <unk> ( in his " formal logic " , dated <unk> , pp .
356 , 357 ) , that i prefer to quote his words :  " let no proposition imply the existence either of its subject or of its <unk> " take , as an example , a syllogism in <unk> :  <unk> m is p , all m is s ,  . ' .
some s is p . '
" taking s , m , p , as the minor , middle , and <name> terms respectively , the conclusion <name> imply that , if there is an s , there is some p. <name> the premisses also imply this ?
if so , then the syllogism is valid ; but not otherwise .
" the conclusion implies that if s exists p exists ; but , consistently with the premisses , s may be <unk> while m and p are both non-existent .
an implication is , therefore , contained in the conclusion , which is not justified by the premisses . "
this seems to me entirely clear and convincing .
still , " to make <unk> " , i may as well throw the above ( <unk> ) syllogism into a concrete form , which <name> be within the grasp of even a <unk> reader .
let us suppose that a boys ' school has been set up , with the following system of rules :  " all boys in the first ( the highest ) class are to do french , greek , and latin .
all in the second class are to do greek only .
all in the third class are to do latin only . "
suppose also that there are boys in the third class , and in the second ; but that no boy has yet risen into the first .
it is evident that there are no boys in the school doing french : still we know , by the rules , what would happen if there were any .
<unk> we are <unk> , then , by the data , to assert the following two propositions :  " if there were any boys doing french , all of them would be doing greek ; if there were any boys doing french , all of them would be doing latin . "
and the conclusion , according to " the logicians " would be " if there were any boys doing latin , some of them would be doing greek . "
here , then , we have two true premisses and a false conclusion ( since we know that there are boys doing latin , and that none of them are doing greek ) .
hence the argument is invalid .
similarly it may be shown that this " <unk> " interpretation destroys the validity of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
some of " the logicians " <name> , no doubt , be ready to reply " but we are not <unk> !
why should we be responsible for the validity of the syllogisms of so <unk> an author as aldrich ? "
very good .
then , for the special benefit of these " friends " of mine ( with what ominous emphasis that name is sometimes used !
" i must have a private interview with you , my young friend , " says the bland dr. birch , " in my library , at 9 a.m. tomorrow .
and you <name> please to be punctual !
" ) , for their special benefit , i say , i <name> produce another charge against this " <unk> " interpretation .
it actually <unk> the ordinary process of " conversion " , as applied to proposition in '_i ' .
every <unk> , <unk> or otherwise , accepts it as an established fact that " some x are y " may be legitimately converted into " some y are x . "
but is it equally clear that the proposition " if there were any x , some of them would be y " may be legitimately converted into " if there were any y , some of them would be x " ?
i trow not .
the example i have already used   of a boys ' school with a non-existent first class   <name> serve admirably to illustrate this new flaw in the theory of " the logicians . "
<unk> let us suppose that there is yet another rule in this school , viz .
" in each class , at the end of the term , the head boy and the second boy shall receive prizes . "
this rule entirely <unk> us to assert ( in the sense in which " the logicians " would use the words ) " some boys in the first class <name> receive prizes " , for this simply means ( according to them ) " if there were any boys in the first class , some of them would receive prizes . "
now the converse of this proposition is , of course , " some boys , who <name> receive prizes , are in the first class " , which means ( according to " the logicians " ) " if there were any boys about to receive prizes , some of them would be in the first class " ( which class we know to be empty ) .
of this pair of converse propositions , the first is undoubtedly true : the second , as undoubtedly , false .
it is always sad to see a <unk> knock down his own wicket : one <unk> him , as a man and a brother , but , as a <unk> , one can but pronounce him " out ! "
we see , then , that , among all the conceivable views we have here considered , there are only two which can logically be held , viz .
i and a " assert " , but e does not .
e and a " assert " , but i does not .
the second of these i have shown to involve great practical inconvenience .
the first is the one adopted in this book .
( see p .
19 . )
some further remarks on this subject <name> be found in note ( b ) , at p. 196 .
§ 3 .
the use of " <unk> " ( or " <unk> " ) as a <unk> is it better to say " <name> <unk> <unk> " or " <name> is <unk> " ?
" some of my acquaintances <unk> <unk> " or " some of my acquaintances are <unk> " ?
that is the sort of question we have now to discuss .
<unk> this is no question of logical right and wrong : it is merely a matter of taste , since the two forms mean exactly the same thing .
and here , again , " the logicians " seem to me to take much too humble a position .
when they are putting the final touches to the grouping of their proposition , just before the curtain goes up , and when the <unk>   always a rather fussy <unk> father ' , asks them " am i to have the 'not ' , or <name> you tack it on to the predicate ? "
they are much too ready to answer , like the subtle <unk> , " leave it to you , sir ! "
the result seems to be , that the grasping <unk> constantly gets a " not " that had better have been merged in the predicate , and that propositions are differentiated which had better have been recognised as precisely similar .
surely it is simpler to treat " some men are jews " and " some men are gentiles " as being both of them , affirmative propositions , instead of translating the latter into " some men <unk> jews " , and regarding it as a negative propositions ?
the fact is , " the logicians " have somehow acquired a perfectly morbid dread of negative attributes , which makes them shut their eyes , like frightened children , when they come across such terrible propositions as " all not-x are y " ; and thus they exclude from their system many very useful forms of syllogisms .
under the influence of this unreasoning terror , they plead that , in <unk> by contradiction , the negative part is too large to deal with , so that it is better to regard each thing as either included in , or excluded from , the positive part .
i see no force in this plea : and the facts often go the other way .
as a personal question , dear reader , if you were to group your acquaintances into the two classes , men that you would like to be seen with , and men that you would not like to be seen with , do you think the latter group would be so very much the larger of the two ?
for the purposes of symbolic logic , it is so much the most convenient plan to regard the two <unk> , produced by <unk> , on the same footing , and to say , of any thing , either that it " is " in the one , or that it " is " in the other , that i do not think any reader of this book is likely to demur to my adopting that course .
<unk> § 4 .
the theory that " two negative premisses prove nothing " . this i consider to be another craze of " the logicians " , fully as morbid as their dread of a negative attribute .
it is , perhaps , best <unk> by the method of <unk> <unk> .
take the following pairs of premisses :  " none of my boys are conceited ; none of my girls are greedy " .
" none of my boys are clever ; none but a clever boy could solve this problem " .
" none of my boys are learned ; some of my boys are not <unk> " .
( this last proposition is , in my system , an affirmative one , since i should read it " are <unk> " ; but , in dealing with " the logicians , " i may fairly treat it as a negative one , since they would read it " <unk> <unk> " . )
if you , dear reader , declare , after full consideration of these pairs of premisses , that you can not deduce a conclusion from any of them   why , all i can say is that , like the duke in <name> , you " <name> have to be contented with our <unk> sympathy " !
[ see note ( c ) , p .

§ 5 .
<unk> 's method of <unk> diagrams seem to have been used , at first , to represent propositions only .
in <unk> 's well-known circles , each was supposed to contain a class , and the diagram consisted of two circles , which exhibited the relations , as to <unk> and exclusion , existing between the two classes .
 /  \ / / y \ \ | <unk> | \ x / \_____/ thus , the diagram , here given , exhibits the two classes , whose respective attributes are x and y , as so related to each other that the following propositions are all simultaneously true :  " all x are y " , " no x are not-y " , " some x are y " , " some y are not-x " , " some not-y are not-x " , and , of course , the <unk> of the last four .
<unk>  /  \ / / y \ \ | <unk> | \ x / \_____/ similarly , with this diagram , the following propositions are true :  " all y are x " , " no y are not-x " , " some y are x " , " some x are not-y " , " some not-x are not-y " , and , of course , the <unk> of the last four .
  / \ / \ / \ / \ | x | | y | \ / \ / \_____/ \_____/ similarly , with this diagram , the following are true :  " all x are not-y " , " all y are not-x " , " no x are y " , " some x are not-y " , " some y are not-x " , " some not-x are not-y " , and the <unk> of the last four .
  / \_/ \ / / \ \ | x | | y | \ \_/ / \_____/ \_____/ similarly , with this diagram , the following are true :  " some x are y " , " some x are not-y " , " some not-x are y " , " some not-x are not-y " , and of course , their four <unk> .
note that all <unk> 's diagrams assert " some not-x are not-y . "
apparently it never <unk> to him that it might sometimes fail to be true !
now , to represent " all x are y " , the first of these diagrams would suffice .
similarly , to represent " no x are y " , the third would suffice .
but to represent any particular proposition , at least three diagrams would be needed ( in order to include all the possible cases ) , and , for " some not-x are not-y " , all the four .
§ 6 .
<unk> 's method of <unk> let us represent " not-x " by " x ' " .
mr. <unk> 's method of diagrams is a great advance on the above method .
he uses the last of the above diagrams to represent any desired relation between x and y , by simply shading a compartment known to be empty , and placing a + in one known to be occupied .
thus , he would represent the three propositions " some x are y " , " no x are y " , and " all x are y " , as follows :    / \_/ \ / / \ \ | | + | | \ \_/ / \_____/ \_____/   / \_/ \ / / # \ \ | | # # # | | \ \ # / / \_____/ \_____/   / # # # # # \_/ \ / # # # # # # # / \ \ | # # # # # # # | + | | \ # # # # # # # \_/ / \ # # # # # / \_____/ <unk> it <name> be seen that , of the four classes , whose peculiar sets of attributes are xy , xy ' , x'y , and x'y ' , only three are here provided with closed compartments , while the fourth is allowed the rest of the infinite plane to range about in !
this arrangement would involve us in very serious trouble , if we ever attempted to represent " no x ' are y ' . "
mr. <unk> once ( at p. 281 ) encounters this awful task ; but <unk> it , in a quite masterly fashion , by the simple <unk> " we have not troubled to shade the outside of this diagram " !
to represent two propositions ( containing a common term ) together , a <unk> diagram is needed .
this is the one used by mr. <unk> .
 / \ / x \ <unk> \_/ <unk> / \ / \ / \ | <unk> | \ m \_/ y / \_____/ \_____/ here , again , we have only seven closed compartments , to accommodate the eight classes whose peculiar sets of attributes are <unk> , <unk> ' , & c. " with four terms in request , " mr. <unk> says , " the most simple and symmetrical diagram seems to me that produced by making four ellipses intersect one another in the desired manner " .
this , however , provides only fifteen closed compartments .
b   c / \ / \ a / \/ \ d / \ \ /\ / / \ / \ \/ \/ / \ \ \ /\ /\ / / \ \/ \/ \/ / \ /\ /\ /\ / \ \ \/ \/ / / \ <unk> <unk> / \ <unk> / <unk> for five letters , " the simplest diagram i can suggest , " mr. <unk> says , " is one like this ( the small ellipse in the centre is to be regarded as a portion of the outside of c ; i.e .
its four component portions are inside b and d but are no part of c ) .
it must be admitted that such a diagram is not quite so simple to draw as one might wish it to be ; but then consider what the alternative is of one undertakes to deal with five terms and all their combinations  nothing short of the disagreeable task of writing out , or in some way putting before us , all the 32 combinations involved . "
b c d    / \/ \/ \ a / / \ /\ /\ / \ \ e / / \ / \ / \ / \ \ / \ \/ \/ \/ / \ / \ /\ /\ /\ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ | \/ \/  \/ \/ | | /\ <unk> <unk> /\ | | / \ / /\ /\ \ / \ | | | \/ | \/ | \/ | | | | /\ | /\ | /\ | | | \ / \ \/ \/ / \ / | \ \/ <unk> \/ / \ /\ /\ /\ /\ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \/ \/ \/ \ / \ \ /\ /\ /\ / / \ \ / \ / \ / \ / / \ \/ \/ \/ \/ / \ <unk> / \ / \ / <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> this diagram gives us 31 closed compartments .
for six letters , mr. <unk> suggests that we might use two diagrams , like the above , one for the <unk> , and the other for the <unk> , of all the other combinations .
" this " , he says , " would give the desired 64 subdivisions . "
this , however , would only give 62 closed compartments , and one infinite area , which the two classes , <unk> and <unk> ' , would have to share between them .
beyond six letters mr. <unk> does not go .
§ 7 .
my method of <unk> my method of diagrams resembles mr. <unk> 's , in having separate compartments assigned to the various classes , and in marking these compartments as occupied or as empty ; but it differs from his method , in assigning a closed area to the universe of discourse , so that the class which , under mr. <unk> 's liberal sway , has been ranging at <name> through infinite space , is suddenly dismayed to find itself " cabin 'd , <unk> 'd , confined " , in a limited cell like any other class !
also i use <unk> , instead of curvilinear , figures ; and i <name> an occupied cell with a 'i ' ( meaning that there is at least one thing in it ) , and an empty cell with a 'o ' ( meaning that there is no thing in it ) .
for two letters , i use this diagram , in which the north half is assigned to <unk> ' , the south to <unk> ' ( or <unk> " ) , the west to y , and the east to y ' .
thus the n.w .
cell contains the <unk> , the n.e .
cell the <unk> , and so on .
·    · | | | |  |  | | | | ·    · for three letters , i <unk> these four cells , by drawing an inner square , which i assign to m , the outer border being assigned to m ' .
i thus get eight cells that are needed to accommodate the eight classes , whose peculiar sets of attributes are <unk> , <unk> ' , & c. ·        · | | | | ·  |  · | | | | | | |  |  |  |  | | | | | | | ·  |  · | | | | ·        · this last diagram is the most complex that i use in the elementary part of my <unk> logic . '
but i may as well take this opportunity of describing the more complex ones which <name> appear in part ii .
<unk> for four letters ( which i call a , b , c , d ) i use this diagram ; assigning the north half to a ( and of course the rest of the diagram to a ' ) , the west half to b , the horizontal oblong to c , and the upright oblong to d. we have now got 16 cells .
·           · | | | | ·  |  · | | | | | | | ·  |  |  |  · | | | | | | | | |  |  |  |  |  |  | | | | | | | | | ·  |  |  |  · | | | | | | | ·  |  · | | | | ·           · for five letters ( adding e ) i <unk> the 16 cells of the previous diagram by oblique partitions , assigning all the upper portions to e , and all the lower portions to e ' .
here , i admit , we lose the advantage of having the <unk> all together , " in a <unk> " , like the other 4 classes .
still , it is very easy to find ; and the operation , of <unk> it , is nearly as easy as that of <unk> any other class .
we have now got 32 cells .
·           · | / | / | | / ·  |  · / | | / | / | / | / | | ·  |  |  |  · | | | / | / | / | / | | |  |  |  |  |  |  | | | / | / | / | / | | | ·  |  |  |  · | | / | / | / | / | | / ·  |  · / | | / | / | ·           · for six letters ( adding h , as i avoid <unk> letters ) i substitute upright crosses for the oblique partitions , assigning the 4 portions , into which each of the 16 cells is thus divided , to the four classes eh , eh ' , <unk> , <unk> ' .
we have now got 64 cells .

§ 8 .
solution of a syllogism by various <unk> the best way , i think , to exhibit the differences between these various methods of solving syllogisms , <name> be to take a concrete example , and solve it by each method in turn .
let us take , as our example , no .
29 ( see p. 102 ) .
" no philosophers are conceited ; some conceited persons are not gamblers .
. ' .
some persons , who are not gamblers , are not philosophers . "
<unk> ( 1 ) solution by ordinary <unk> these premisses , as they stand , <name> give no conclusion , as they are both negative .
if by <unk> ' or <unk> ' , we write the minor premiss thus , 'some conceited persons are <unk> , ' we can get a conclusion in <unk> , viz .
" no philosophers are conceited ; some conceited persons are <unk> .
. ' .
some <unk> are not philosophers " this can be proved by reduction to <unk> , thus :  " no conceited persons are philosophers ; some <unk> are conceited .
. ' .
some <unk> are not philosophers " .
the validity of <unk> follows directly from the axiom <unk> <unk> et <unk> ' .
( 2 ) symbolic <unk> before proceeding to discuss other methods of solution , it is necessary to translate our syllogism into an abstract form .
let us take " persons " as our <unk> of discourse ' ; and let x = " philosophers " , m = " conceited " , and y = " gamblers . "
then the syllogism may be written thus :  " no x are m ; some m are y ' .
. ' .
some y ' are x ' . "
( 3 ) solution by <unk> 's method of <unk> the <name> premiss requires only one diagram , viz .
1   / \ / \ / \ / \ | x | | m | \ / \ / \_____/ \_____/ <unk> the minor requires three , viz .
2   / \ / \ / \ / \ | y | | m | \ / \ / \_____/ \_____/ 3   / \_/ \ / / \ \ | y | | m | \ \_/ / \_____/ \_____/ 4  /  \ / / y \ \ | <unk> | \ m / \_____/ the combination of <name> and minor , in every possible way requires nine , viz .
figs .
1 and 2 give 5    / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ / \ | x | | y | | m | \ / \ / \ / \_____/ \_____/ \_____/ 6    / \_/ \ / \ / / \ \ / \ | x | | y | | m | \ \_/ / \ / \_____/ \_____/ \_____/ 7   / \ / \ / \ / \ | xy | | m | \ / \ / \_____/ \_____/ 8   /  \ / \ / / x \ \ / \ | <unk> | | m | \ y / \ / \_____/ \_____/ 9   /  \ / \ / / y \ \ / \ | <unk> | | m | \ x / \ / \_____/ \_____/ figs .
1 and 3 give 10    / \ / \_/ \ / \ / / \ \ | x | | y | | m | \ / \ \_/ / \_____/ \_____/ \_____/ 11    / \_/ \_/ \ / / \ / \ \ | x | | y | | m | \ \_/ \_/ / \_____/ \_____/ \_____/ 12   / \_/ \ / / x \ / \ \ | <unk> | m | \ y \_/ / \_____/ \_____/ figs .
1 and 4 give 13   / \ /  \ / \ / / y \ \ | x | | <unk> | \ / \ m / \_____/ \_____/ from this group ( figs .
5 to 13 ) we have , by disregarding m , to find the relation of x and y .
on examination we find that figs .
5 , 10 , 13 express the relation of entire mutual exclusion ; that figs .
6 , 11 express partial <unk> and partial exclusion ; that fig .
7 expresses coincidence ; that figs .
8 , 12 express entire <unk> of x in y ; and that fig .
9 expresses entire <unk> of y in x. <unk> we thus get five biliteral diagrams for x and y , viz .
14   / \ / \ / \ / \ | x | | y | \ / \ / \_____/ \_____/ 15   / \_/ \ / / \ \ | x | | y | \ \_/ / \_____/ \_____/ 16  / \ / \ | xy | \ / \_____/ 17  /  \ / / x \ \ | <unk> | \ y / \_____/ 18  /  \ / / y \ \ | <unk> | \ x / \_____/ where the only proposition , represented by them all , is " some not-y are not-x , " i.e .
" some persons , who are not gamblers , are not philosophers "   a result which <unk> would hardly have regarded as a valuable one , since he seems to have assumed that a proposition of this form is always true !
( 4 ) solution by <unk> 's method of <unk> the following solution has been kindly supplied to me mr. <unk> himself .
" the minor premiss declares that some of the constituents in my ' must be saved : <name> these constituents with a cross .
 / + \ / \ <unk> # # + # \_/ <unk> / \ # # # / # \ / \ | + <unk> # <unk> | \ m \_/ y / \_____/ \_____/ the <name> declares that all xm must be destroyed ; <unk> it .
then , as some my ' is to be saved , it must clearly be <unk> ' .
that is , there must exist <unk> ' ; or <unk> m , <unk> ' .
in common phraseology , 'some y ' are x ' , ' or , 'some <unk> are <unk> . ' "
<unk> ( 5 ) solution by my method of <unk> the first premiss asserts that no xm exist : so we <name> the <unk> as empty , by placing a 'o ' in each of its cells .
the second asserts that some my ' exist : so we <name> the <unk> as occupied , by placing a 'i ' in its only available cell .
·        · | | | | ·  |  · | | | ( o ) | ( o ) | | |  |  |  |  | | | | ( i ) | | | ·  |  · | | | | ·        · the only information , that this gives us as to x and y , is that the <unk> is occupied , i.e .
that some x'y ' exist .
hence " some x ' are y ' " : i.e .
" some persons , who are not philosophers , are not gamblers " .
( 6 ) solution by my method of <unk> xm { 0 } + <unk> { 1 } ¶ x'y' { 1 } i.e .
" some persons , who are not philosophers , are not gamblers . "
§ 9 .
my method of treating syllogisms and <unk> of all the strange things , that are to be met with in the ordinary text-books of formal logic , perhaps the strangest is the violent contrast one finds to exist between their ways of dealing with these two subjects .
while they have elaborately discussed no less than nineteen different forms of syllogisms   each with its own special and exasperating rules , while the whole constitute an almost useless machine , for practical purposes , many of the conclusions being incomplete , and many quite legitimate forms being ignored   they have limited sorites to two forms only , of childish simplicity ; and these they have dignified with special names , apparently under the impression that no other possible forms existed !
as to syllogisms , i find that their nineteen forms , with about a score of others which they have ignored , can all be arranged under three forms , each with a very simple rule of its own ; and the only question the reader has to settle , in working any one of the 101 examples given at p. 101 of this book , is " does it belong to fig .
i. , ii. , or iii. ? "
<unk> as to sorites , the only two forms , recognised by the text-books , are the <unk> , whose premisses are a series of propositions in a , so arranged that the predicate of each is the subject of the next , and the <unk> , whose premisses are the very same series , written backwards .
<unk> , it seems , was the first who noticed the startling fact that it does not affect the force of a syllogism to <unk> the order of its premisses , and who applied this discovery to a sorites .
if we assume ( as surely we may ? )
that he is the same man as that transcendent genius who first noticed that 4 times 5 is the same thing as 5 times 4 , we may apply to him what somebody ( <name> yates , i think it was ) has said of <unk> , viz. , " here is a man who , beyond all others of his generation , has been favoured with glimpses of the obvious ! "
these <unk>   not to say <unk>   forms of a sorites i have , in this book , ignored from the very first , and have not only admitted freely propositions in e , but have purposely stated the premisses in random order , leaving to the reader the useful task of arranging them , for himself , in an order which can be worked as a series of regular syllogisms .
in doing this , he can begin with any one of them he likes .
i have tabulated , for curiosity , the various orders in which the premisses of the <unk> sorites 1 .
all a are b ; 2 .
all b are c ; 3 .
all c are d ; 4 .
all d are e ; 5 .
all e are h .
. ' .
all a are h. may be <unk> arranged , and i find there are no less than sixteen such orders , viz. , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
of these the first and the last have been dignified with names ; but the other fourteen   first enumerated by an obscure writer on logic , towards the end of the nineteenth century   remain without a name !
<unk> § 10 .
some account of parts ii , iii. in part ii .
<name> be found some of the matters mentioned in this appendix , viz. , the " <unk> import " of propositions , the use of a negative <unk> , and the theory that " two negative premisses prove nothing . "
i shall also extend the range of syllogisms , by introducing propositions containing <unk> ( such as " <unk> x are y " ) , propositions containing 3 or more terms ( such as " all ab are c " , which , taken along with " some bc ' are d " , would prove " some d are a ' " ) , & c. i shall also discuss sorites containing <unk> , and the very puzzling subjects of <unk> and <unk> .
i <name> , in the course of part ii. , to go over all the ground usually traversed in the text-books used in our schools and universities , and to enable my readers to solve problems of the same kind as , and far harder than , those that are at present set in their examinations .
in part iii .
i <name> to deal with many curious and out-of-the-way subjects , some of which are not even alluded to in any of the treatises i have met with .
in this part <name> be found such matters as the analysis of propositions into their elements ( let the reader , who has never gone into this branch of the subject , try to make out for himself what additional proposition would be needed to convert " some a are b " into " some a are bc " ) , the treatment of numerical and geometrical problems , the construction of problems , and the solution of syllogisms and sorites containing propositions more complex than any that i have used in part ii .
i <name> conclude with eight problems , as a taste of what is coming in part ii .
i shall be very glad to receive , from any reader , who thinks he has solved any one of them ( more especially if he has done so without using any method of symbols ) , what he <unk> to be its complete conclusion .
it may be well to explain what i mean by the complete conclusion of a syllogism or a sorites .
i distinguish their terms as being of two kinds   those which can be eliminated ( <unk> .
the middle term of a syllogism ) , which i call the " eliminands , " and those which cannot , which i call the " <unk> " ; and i do not call the conclusion complete , unless it states all the relations among the <unk> only , which can be deduced from the premisses .
<unk> 1 .
all the boys , in a certain school , sit together in one large room every evening .

one of the <unk> ( who is a great reader of <unk> collins ' novels ) is very <unk> , and takes ms. notes of almost everything that happens , with the view of being a good sensational witness , in case any conspiracy to commit a murder should be on foot .
the following are some of his notes :  ( 1 ) whenever some of the english boys are singing " rule <unk> " , and some not , some of the <unk> are wide-awake ; ( 2 ) whenever some of the scotch are dancing reels , and some of the <name> fighting , some of the welsh are eating toasted cheese ; ( 3 ) whenever all the germans are playing chess , some of the eleven are not oiling their bats ; ( 4 ) whenever some of the <unk> are asleep , and some not , some of the <name> are fighting ; ( 5 ) whenever some of the germans are playing chess , and none of the scotch are dancing reels , some of the welsh are not eating toasted cheese ; ( 6 ) whenever some of the scotch are not dancing reels , and some of the <name> not fighting , some of the germans are playing chess ; ( 7 ) whenever some of the <unk> are awake , and some of the welsh are eating toasted cheese , none of the scotch are dancing reels ; ( 8 ) whenever some of the germans are not playing chess , and some of the welsh are not eating toasted cheese , none of the <name> are fighting ; <unk> ( 9 ) whenever all the english are singing " rule <unk> , " and some of the scotch are not dancing reels , none of the germans are playing chess ; ( 10 ) whenever some of the english are singing " rule <unk> " , and some of the <unk> are asleep , some of the <name> are not fighting ; ( 11 ) whenever some of the <unk> are awake , and some of the eleven are not oiling their bats , some of the scotch are dancing reels ; ( 12 ) whenever some of the english are singing " rule <unk> " , and some of the scotch are not dancing reels , * * * * here the ms. breaks off suddenly .
the problem is to complete the sentence , if possible .

in solving this problem , it is necessary to remember that the proposition " all x are y " is a double proposition , and is equivalent to " some x are y , and none are y ' . "

six friends , and their six wives , are staying in the same hotel ; and they all walk out daily , in parties of various size and composition .
to ensure variety in these daily walks , they have agree to observe the following rules :  ( 1 ) if acres is with ( i.e .
is in the same party with ) his wife , and <name> with his , and <name> with mrs. hall , <name> must be with mrs. dix ; ( 2 ) if acres is with his wife , and hall with his , and <name> with mrs. <name> , dix must not be with mrs. <name> ; ( 3 ) if <name> and dix and their wives are all in the same party , and acres not with mrs. <name> , <name> must not be with mrs. hall ; ( 4 ) if acres is with his wife , and dix with his , and <name> not with mrs. <name> , <name> must be with mrs. hall ; ( 5 ) if <name> is with his wife , and hall with his , and <name> with mrs. dix , acres must not be with mrs. <name> ; ( 6 ) if <name> and <name> and their wives are all in the same party , and <name> not with mrs. hall , dix must be with mrs. <name> .
the problem is to prove that there must be , every day , at least one married couple who are not in the same party .

after the six friends , named in problem 5 , had returned from their tour , three of them , <name> , <name> , and dix , agreed , with two other friends of theirs , <name> and mill , that the five should meet , every day , at a certain table d'hôte .
remembering how much amusement they had derived from their code of rules for <unk> , they devised the following rules to be observed whenever beef appeared on the table :  ( 1 ) if <name> takes salt , then either <name> or <name> takes one only of the two <unk> , salt and mustard : if he takes mustard , then either dix takes neither <unk> , or mill takes both .
( 2 ) if <name> takes salt , then either <name> takes only one <unk> , or mill takes neither : if he takes mustard , then either dix or <name> takes both .
( 3 ) if dix takes salt , then either <name> takes neither <unk> or <name> take both : if he takes mustard , then either <name> or mill takes neither .
( 4 ) if <name> takes salt , then <name> or dix takes only one <unk> : if he takes mustard , then either <name> or mill takes neither .
( 5 ) if mill takes salt , then either <name> or <name> takes both <unk> : if he takes mustard , then either <name> or dix takes only one .
the problem is to discover whether these rules are compatible ; and , if so , what arrangements are possible .
[ n.b .
in this problem , it is assumed that the phrase " if <name> takes salt " allows of two possible cases , viz .
( 1 ) " he takes salt only " ; ( 2 ) " he takes both <unk> " .
and so with all similar phrases .
it is also assumed that the phrase " either <name> or <name> takes one only of the two <unk> " allows three possible cases , viz .
( 1 ) " <name> takes one only , <name> takes both or neither " ; ( 2 ) " <name> takes both or neither , <name> takes one only " ; ( 3 ) " <name> takes one only , <name> takes one only " .
and so with all similar phrases .
it is also assumed that every rule is to be understood as implying the words " and vice <unk> . "
thus the first rule would imply the addition " and , if either <name> or <name> takes only one <unk> , then <name> takes salt . " ]

the problem is to deduce some fact about <unk> .
[ n.b .
in this problem , it is assumed that all the men , here referred to , live in the same town , and that every pair of them are either " friends " or " enemies , " that every pair are related as " senior and <name> " , " superior and inferior " , and that certain pairs are related as " <unk> and debtor " , " father and son " , " master and servant " , " <unk> and victim " , " uncle and nephew " . ]

" <name> <unk> could eat no fat : his wife could eat no <name> : and so , between them both , they licked the platter clean . "
solve this as a <unk> , taking lines 3 and 4 as the conclusion to be proved .
it is permitted to use , as premisses , not only all that is here asserted , but also all that we may reasonably understand to be implied .
<unk> notes to appendix .
( a ) [ see p. 167 , line 6 . ]
it may , perhaps , occur to the reader , who has studied formal logic that the argument , here applied to the propositions i and e , <name> apply equally well to the propositions i and a ( since , in the ordinary text-books , the propositions " all xy are z " and " some xy are not z " are regarded as <unk> ) .
hence it may appear to him that the argument might have been put as follows :  " we now have i and a <unk> . '
hence , if the proposition 'all xy are z ' be true , some things exist with the attributes x and y : i.e .
'some x are y . '
" also we know that , if the proposition 'some xy are <unk> ' be true the same result follows .
" but these two propositions are <unk> , so that one or other of them must be true .
hence this result is always true : i.e .
the proposition 'some x are y ' is always true !
" <unk> est <unk> hence i cannot assert . "
this matter <name> be discussed in part ii ; but i may as well give here what seems to me to be an <unk> proof that this view ( that a and i are <unk> ) , though adopted in the ordinary text-books , is untenable .
the proof is as follows :  with regard to the relationship existing between the class <unk> ' and the two classes <unk> ' and <unk> ' , there are four conceivable states of things , viz .
( 1 ) some xy are z , and some are <unk> ; ( 2 ) " " none " ( 3 ) no xy " some " ( 4 ) " " none " of these four , no .
( 2 ) is equivalent to " all xy are z " , no .
( 3 ) is equivalent to " all xy are <unk> " , and no .
( 4 ) is equivalent to " no xy exist . "
now it is quite undeniable that , of these four states of things , each is , a priori , possible , some one must be true , and the other three must be false .
hence the contradictory to ( 2 ) is " either ( 1 ) or ( 3 ) or ( 4 ) is true . "
now the assertion " either ( 1 ) or ( 3 ) is true " is equivalent to " some xy are <unk> " ; and the assertion " ( 4 ) is true " is equivalent to " no xy exist . "
hence the contradictory to " all xy are z " may be expressed as the alternative proposition " either some xy are <unk> , or no xy exist , " but not as the <unk> proposition " some y are <unk> . "
<unk> ( b ) [ see p. 171 , at end of section 2 . ]
there are yet other views current among " the logicians " , as to the " <unk> import " of propositions , which have not been mentioned in this section .
one is , that the proposition " some x are y " is to be interpreted , neither as " some x exist and are y " , nor yet as " if there were any x in existence , some of them would be y " , but merely as " some x can be y ; i.e .
the attributes x and y are compatible " .
on this theory , there would be nothing offensive in my telling my friend jones " some of your brothers are swindlers " ; since , if he indignantly retorted " what do you mean by such insulting language , you scoundrel ?
" , i should calmly reply " i merely mean that the thing is conceivable   that some of your brothers might possibly be swindlers " .
but it may well be doubted whether such an explanation would entirely appease the wrath of jones !
another view is , that the proposition " all x are y " sometimes implies the actual existence of x , and sometimes does not imply it ; and that we can not tell , without having it in concrete form , which interpretation we are to give to it .
this view is , i think , strongly supported by common usage ; and it <name> be fully discussed in part ii : but the difficulties , which it introduces , seem to me too formidable to be even alluded to in part i , which i am trying to make , as far as possible , easily intelligible to mere beginners .

this game requires nine counters  four of one colour and five of another : say four red and five grey .
besides the nine counters , it also requires one player , at least .
i am not aware of any game that can be played with less than this number : while there are several that require more : take cricket , for instance , which requires twenty-two .
how much easier it is , when you want to play a game , to find one player than twenty-two .
at the same time , though one player is enough , a good deal more amusement may be got by two working at it together , and correcting each other 's mistakes .
a second advantage , possessed by this game , is that , besides being an endless source of amusement ( the number of arguments , that may be worked by it , being infinite ) , it <name> give the players a little instruction as well .
but is there any great harm in that , so long as you get plenty of amusement ?

propositions .
" some new cakes are nice . "
" no new cakes are nice . "
" all new cakes are nice . "
there are three <unk> ' for you  the only three kinds we are going to use in this game : and the first thing to be done is to learn how to express them on the board .
let us begin with " some new cakes are nice . "
but before doing so , a remark has to be made  one that is rather important , and by no means easy to understand all in a moment : so please to read this very carefully .
the world contains many things ( such as " buns " , " babies " , " beetles " .
" <unk> " .
& c. ) ; and these things possess many attributes ( such as " baked " , " beautiful " , " black " , " broken " , & c. : in fact , whatever can be " attributed to " , that is " said to belong to " , any thing , is an attribute ) .
whenever we wish to mention a thing , we use a substantive : when we wish to mention an attribute , we use an adjective .
people have asked the question " can a thing exist without any attributes belonging to it ? "
it is a very puzzling question , and i 'm not going to try to answer it : let us turn up our noses , and treat it with contemptuous silence , as if it really was n't worth noticing .
but , if they put it the other way , and ask " can an attribute exist without any thing for it to belong to ?
" , we may say at once " no : no more than a baby could go a <unk> with no one to take care of it ! "
you never saw " beautiful " floating about in the air , or littered about on the floor , without any thing to be beautiful , now did you ?
and now what am i driving at , in all this long <unk> ?
it is this .
you may put " is " or " are " between names of two things ( for example , " some pigs are fat animals " ) , or between the names of two attributes ( for example , " pink is <unk> " ) , and in each case it <name> make good sense .
but , if you put " is " or " are " between the name of a thing and the name of an attribute ( for example , " some pigs are pink " ) , you do not make good sense ( for how can a thing be an attribute ? )
unless you have an understanding with the person to whom you are speaking .
and the simplest understanding would , i think , be this  that the substantive shall be supposed to be repeated at the end of the sentence , so that the sentence , if written out in full , would be " some pigs are pink ( pigs ) " .
and now the word " are " makes quite good sense .
thus , in order to make good sense of the proposition " some new cakes are nice " , we must suppose it to be written out in full , in the form " some new cakes are nice ( cakes ) " .
now this contains two <unk> '  " new cakes " being one of them , and " nice ( cakes ) " the other .
" new cakes , " being the one we are talking about , is called the <unk> ' of the proposition , and " nice ( cakes ) " the <unk> ' .
also this proposition is said to be a <unk> ' one , since it does not speak of the whole of its subject , but only of a part of it .
the other two kinds are said to be <unk> ' , because they speak of the whole of their subjects  the one denying <unk> , and the other asserting it , of the whole class of " new cakes " .
lastly , if you would like to have a definition of the word <unk> itself , you may take this :  " a sentence stating that some , or none , or all , of the things belonging to a certain class , called its <unk> ' , are also things belonging to a certain other class , called its <unk> ' " .
you <name> find these seven words  proposition , attribute , term , subject , predicate , particular , universal  charmingly useful , if any friend should happen to ask if you have ever studied logic .
mind you bring all seven words into your answer , and you friend <name> go away deeply impressed  'a sadder and a wiser man ' .
now please to look at the smaller diagram on the board , and suppose it to be a cupboard , intended for all the cakes in the world ( it would have to be a good large one , of course ) .
and let us suppose all the new ones to be put into the upper half ( marked <unk> ' ) , and all the rest ( that is , the <unk> ones ) into the lower half ( marked <unk> " ) .
thus the lower half would contain elderly cakes , aged cakes , <unk> cakes  if there are any : i have n't seen many , myself  and so on .
let us also suppose all the nice cakes to be put into the left-hand half ( marked <unk> ' ) , and all the rest ( that is , the not-nice ones ) into the right-hand half ( marked <unk> " ) .
at present , then , we must understand x to mean " new " , x ' " <unk> " , y " nice " , and y ' " not-nice . "
and now what kind of cakes would you expect to find in compartment no .
5 ?
it is part of the upper half , you see ; so that , if it has any cakes in it , they must be new : and it is part of the left-hand half ; so that they must be nice .
hence if there are any cakes in this compartment , they must have the double <unk> ' " new and nice " : or , if we use letters , the must be " x y . "
observe that the letters x , y are written on two of the edges of this compartment .
this you <name> find a very convenient rule for knowing what attributes belong to the things in any compartment .
take no .
7 , for instance .
if there are any cakes there , they must be " x ' y " , that is , they must be " <unk> and nice . "
now let us make another agreement  that a red counter in a compartment shall mean that it is <unk> ' , that is , that there are some cakes in it .
( the word 'some , ' in logic , means 'one or more ' so that a single cake in a compartment would be quite enough reason for saying " there are some cakes here " ) .
also let us agree that a grey counter in a compartment shall mean that it is <unk> ' , that is that there are no cakes in it .
in the following diagrams , i shall put <unk> ' ( meaning 'one or more ' ) where you are to put a red counter , and <unk> ' ( meaning 'none ' ) where you are to put a grey one .
as the subject of our proposition is to be " new cakes " , we are only concerned , at present , with the upper half of the cupboard , where all the cakes have the attribute x , that is , " new . "
now , fixing our attention on this upper half , suppose we found it marked like this ,       | | | | 1 | | | | |       that is , with a red counter in no .
5 .
what would this tell us , with regard to the class of " new cakes " ?
would it not tell us that there are some of them in the x <unk> ?
that is , that some of them ( besides having the attribute x , which belongs to both compartments ) have the attribute y ( that is , " nice " ) .
this we might express by saying " some <unk> are y ( cakes ) " , or , putting words instead of letters , " some new cakes are nice ( cakes ) " , or , in a shorter form , " some new cakes are nice " .
at last we have found out how to represent the first proposition of this section .
if you have not clearly understood all i have said , go no further , but read it over and over again , till you do understand it .
after that is once mastered , you <name> find all the rest quite easy .
it <name> save a little trouble , in doing the other propositions , if we agree to leave out the word " cakes " altogether .
i find it convenient to call the whole class of things , for which the cupboard is intended , the <unk> . '
thus we might have begun this business by saying " let us take a universe of cakes . "
( sounds nice , doesn't it ? )
of course any other things would have done just as well as cakes .
we might make propositions about " a universe of lizards " , or even " a universe of hornets " .
( would n't that be a charming universe to live in ? )
so far , then , we have learned that       | | | | 1 | | | | |       means " some x and y , " i.e .
" some new are nice . "
i think you <name> see without further explanation , that       | | | | | 1 | | | |       means " some x are y ' , " i.e .
" some new are not-nice . "
now let us put a grey counter into no .
5 , and ask ourselves the meaning of       | | | | 0 | | | | |       this tells us that the x <unk> is empty , which we may express by " no x are y " , or , " no new cakes are nice " .
this is the second of the three propositions at the head of this section .
in the same way ,       | | | | | 0 | | | |       would mean " no x are y ' , " or , " no new cakes are not-nice . "
what would you make of this , i wonder ?
      | | | | 1 | 1 | | | |       i <name> you <name> not have much trouble in making out that this represents a double proposition : namely , " some x are y , and some are y ' , " i.e .
" some new are nice , and some are not-nice . "
the following is a little harder , perhaps :       | | | | 0 | 0 | | | |       this means " no x are y , and none are y ' , " i.e .
" no new are nice , and none are not-nice " : which leads to the rather curious result that " no new exist , " i.e .
" no cakes are new . "
this is because " nice " and " not-nice " make what we call an <unk> ' division of the class " new cakes " : i.e .
between them , they exhaust the whole class , so that all the new cakes , that exist , must be found in one or the other of them .
and now suppose you had to represent , with counters the contradictory to " no cakes are new " , which would be " some cakes are new " , or , putting letters for words , " some cakes are x " , how would you do it ?
this <name> puzzle you a little , i expect .
evidently you must put a red counter somewhere in the <unk> of the cupboard , since you know there are some new cakes .
but you must not put it into the left-hand compartment , since you do not know them to be nice : nor may you put it into the right-hand one , since you do not know them to be not-nice .
what , then , are you to do ?
i think the best way out of the difficulty is to place the red counter on the <unk> between the <unk> and the <unk> .
this i shall represent ( as i always put <unk> ' where you are to put a red counter ) by the diagram       | | | | 1 | | | |       our ingenious american cousins have invented a phrase to express the position of a man who wants to join one or the other of two parties  such as their two parties <unk> ' and <unk> '  but ca n't make up his mind which .
such a man is said to be " sitting on the fence . "
now that is exactly the position of the red counter you have just placed on the <unk> .
he likes the look of no .
5 , and he likes the look of no .
6 , and he does n't know which to jump down into .
so there he sits astride , silly fellow , dangling his legs , one on each side of the fence !
now i am going to give you a much harder one to make out .
what does this mean ?
      | | | | 1 | 0 | | | |       this is clearly a double proposition .
it tells us not only that " some x are y , " but also the " no x are not y . "
hence the result is " all x are y , " i.e .
" all new cakes are nice " , which is the last of the three propositions at the head of this section .
we see , then , that the universal proposition " all new cakes are nice " consists of two propositions taken together , namely , " some new cakes are nice , " and " no new cakes are not-nice . "
in the same way       | | | | 0 | 1 | | | |       would mean " all x are y ' " , that is , " all new cakes are not-nice . "
now what would you make of such a proposition as " the cake you have given me is nice " ?
is it particular or universal ?
" particular , of course , " you readily reply .
" one single cake is hardly worth calling 'some , ' even . "
no , my dear impulsive reader , it is <unk> ' .
remember that , few as they are ( and i <name> you they could n't well be fewer ) , they are ( or rather 'it is ' ) all that you have given me !
thus , if ( leaving <unk> ' out of the question ) i divide my universe of cakes into two classes  the cakes you have given me ( to which i assign the upper half of the cupboard ) , and those you have n't given me ( which are to go below )  i find the lower half fairly full , and the upper one as nearly as possible empty .
and then , when i am told to put an upright division into each half , keeping the nice cakes to the left , and the not-nice ones to the right , i begin by carefully collecting all the cakes you have given me ( saying to myself , from time to time , " generous creature !
how shall i ever repay such kindness ?
" ) , and piling them up in the left-hand compartment .
and it does n't take long to do it !
here is another universal proposition for you .
" <unk> <unk> is an honest man . "
that means " all the <unk> <unk> , that i am now considering , are honest men . "
( you think i invented that name , now do n't you ?
but i did n't .
it 's on a carrier 's cart , somewhere down in cornwall . )
this kind of universal proposition ( where the subject is a single thing ) is called an <unk> ' proposition .
now let us take " nice cakes " as the subject of proposition : that is , let us fix our thoughts on the left-hand half of the cupboard , where all the cakes have attribute y , that is , " nice . "
   suppose we find it marked like this :  | | | 1 | what would that tell us ?
| |    | | | | | |    i <name> that it is not necessary , after explaining the horizontal oblong so fully , to spend much time over the upright one .
i <name> you <name> see , for yourself , that this means " some y are x " , that is , " some nice cakes are new . "
" but , " you <name> say , " we have had this case before .
you put a red counter into no .
5 , and you told us it meant 'some new cakes are nice ' ; and now you tell us that it means 'some nice cakes are new ' !
can it mean both ? "
the question is a very thoughtful one , and does you great credit , dear reader !
it does mean both .
if you choose to take x ( that is , " new cakes " ) as your subject , and to regard no .
5 as part of a horizontal oblong , you may read it " some x are y " , that is , " some new cakes are nice " : but , if you choose to take y ( that is , " nice cake " ) as your subject , and to regard no .
5 as part of an upright oblong , then you may read it " some y are x " , that is , " some nice cakes are new " .
they are merely two different ways of expressing the very same truth .
without more words , i <name> simply set down the other ways in which this upright oblong might be marked , adding the meaning in each case .
by comparing them with the various cases of the horizontal oblong , you <name> , i <name> , be able to understand them clearly .
you <name> find it a good plan to examine yourself on this table , by covering up first one column and then the other , and <unk> about ' , as the children say .
also you <name> do well to write out for yourself two other tables  one for the lower half of the cupboard , and the other for its right-hand half .
and now i think we have said all we need to say about the smaller diagram , and may go on to the larger one .
 | symbols .
| meanings .
|    | | | | | | | some y are x ' ; | | | i.e .
some nice are <unk> .
   | | | | | 1 | | | | |    | |    | | | | no y are x ; | 0 | | i.e .
no nice are new .
| | |    | [ observe that this is merely another way of | | | expressing " no new are nice . " ]
| | | | | |    | |    | | | | | | | no y are x ' ; | | | i.e .
no nice are <unk> .
   | | | | | 0 | | | | |    | |    | | | | | 1 | | some y are x , and some are x ' ; | | | i.e .
some nice are new , and some are    | <unk> .
| | | | 1 | | | | |    | |    | | | | | 0 | | no y are x , and none are x ' ; i.e .
no y | | | exist ;    | i.e .
no cakes are nice .
| | | | 0 | | | | |    | |    | | | | | 1 | | all y are x ; | | | i.e .
all nice are new .
   | | | | | 0 | | | | |    | |    | | | | | 0 | | all y are x ' ; | | | i.e .
all nice are <unk> .
   | | | | | 1 | | | | |    | | this may be taken to be a cupboard divided in the same way as the last , but also divided into two portions , for the attribute m. let us give to m the meaning " wholesome " : and let us suppose that all wholesome cakes are placed inside the central square , and all the unwholesome ones outside it , that is , in one or other of the four <unk> outer compartments .
we see that , just as , in the smaller diagram , the cakes in each compartment had two attributes , so , here , the cakes in each compartment have three attributes : and , just as the letters , representing the two attributes , were written on the edges of the compartment , so , here , they are written at the corners .
( observe that m ' is supposed to be written at each of the four outer corners . )
so that we can tell in a moment , by looking at a compartment , what three attributes belong to the things in it .
for instance , take no .
12 .
here we find x , y ' , m , at the corners : so we know that the cakes in it , if there are any , have the triple attribute , <unk> 'm ' , that is , " new , not-nice , and wholesome . "
again , take no .
16 .
here we find , at the corners , x ' , y ' , m ' : so the cakes in it are " <unk> , not-nice , and unwholesome . "
( remarkably <unk> cakes ! )
it would take far too long to go through all the propositions , containing x and y , x and m , and y and m which can be represented on this diagram ( there are ninety-six altogether , so i am sure you <name> excuse me ! )
and i must content myself with doing two or three , as specimens .
you <name> do well to work out a lot more for yourself .
taking the upper half by itself , so that our subject is " new cakes " , how are we to represent " no new cakes are wholesome " ?
this is , writing letters for words , " no x are m. " now this tells us that none of the cakes , belonging to the upper half of the cupboard , are to be found inside the central square : that is , the two compartments , no .
11 and no .
12 , are empty .
and this , of course , is represented by           | | | | | | | | | | | | | 0 | 0 | | | | | | |           and now how are we to represent the contradictory proposition " some x are m " ?
this is a difficulty i have already considered .
i think the best way is to place a red counter on the <unk> between no .
11 and no .
12 , and to understand this to mean that one of the two compartments is <unk> , ' but that we do not at present know which .
this i shall represent thus :            | | | | | | | | | | | | | 1 | | | | | | |           now let us express " all x are m. " this consists , we know , of two propositions , " some x are m , " and " no x are m ' . "
let us express the negative part first .
this tells us that none of the cakes , belonging to the upper half of the cupboard , are to be found outside the central square : that is , the two compartments , no .
9 and no .
10 , are empty .
this , of course , is represented by           | 0 | 0 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |           but we have yet to represent " some x are m. " this tells us that there are some cakes in the oblong consisting of no .
11 and no .
12 : so we place our red counter , as in the previous example , on the <unk> between no .
11 and no .
12 , and the result is           | 0 | 0 | | | | | | | | | | | 1 | | | | | | |           now let us try one or two interpretations .
what are we to make of this , with regard to x and y ?
          | | 0 | | | | | | | | | | | 1 | 0 | | | | | | |           this tells us , with regard to the <unk> , that it is wholly <unk> ' , since both compartments are so marked .
with regard to the <unk> , it tells us that it is <unk> ' .
true , it is only one compartment of it that is so marked ; but that is quite enough , whether the other be <unk> ' or <unk> ' , to settle the fact that there is something in the square .
if , then , we transfer our marks to the smaller diagram , so as to get rid of the <unk> , we have a right to <name> it       | | | | 1 | 0 | | | |       which means , you know , " all x are y . "
the result would have been exactly the same , if the given oblong had been marked thus :            | 1 | 0 | | | | | | | | | | | | 0 | | | | | | |           once more : how shall we interpret this , with regard to x and y ?
          | 0 | 1 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |           this tells us , as to the <unk> , that one of its compartments is <unk> ' .
but this information is quite useless , as there is no <name> in the other compartment .
if the other compartment happened to be <unk> ' too , the square would be <unk> ' : and , if it happened to be <unk> ' , the square would be <unk> ' .
so , as we do not know which is the case , we can say nothing about this square .
the other square , the <unk> , we know ( as in the previous example ) to be <unk> ' .
if , then , we transfer our marks to the smaller diagram , we get merely this :        | | | | | 1 | | | |       which means , you know , " some x are y ' . "
these principles may be applied to all the other <unk> .
for instance , to represent " all y ' are m ' " we should <name> the     right-hand upright oblong ( the one | | that has the attribute y ' ) thus :  |   | | 0 | | |  <unk> | 0 | | |   | | |     and , if we were told to interpret the lower half of the cupboard , marked as follows , with regard to x and y ,           | | | | | | | | 0 | | | | | | | |   |    | | 1 | 0 |           we should transfer it to the smaller diagram thus ,       | | | | 1 | 0 | | | |       and read it " all x ' are y . "
two more remarks about propositions need to be made .
one is that , in every proposition beginning with " some " or " all " , the actual existence of the <unk> ' is asserted .
if , for instance , i say " all misers are selfish , " i mean that misers actually exist .
if i wished to avoid making this assertion , and merely to state the law that <unk> necessarily involves selfishness , i should say " no misers are unselfish " which does not assert that any misers exist at all , but merely that , if any did exist , they would be selfish .
the other is that , when a proposition begins with " some " or " no " , and contains more that two attributes , these attributes may be <unk> , and shifted from one term to the other , " ad <unk> . "
for example , " some <unk> are <unk> " may be <unk> as " some <unk> are <unk> , " each being equivalent to " some things are <unk> " .
again " no wise old men are rash and reckless gamblers " may be <unk> as " no rash old gamblers are wise and reckless , " each being equivalent to " no men are wise old rash reckless gamblers . "
2 .
syllogisms now suppose we divide our universe of things in three ways , with regard to three different attributes .
out of these three attributes , we may make up three different couples ( for instance , if they were a , b , c , we might make up the three couples ab , ac , bc ) .
also suppose we have two propositions given us , containing two of these three couples , and that from them we can prove a third proposition containing the third couple .
( for example , if we divide our universe for m , x , and y ; and if we have the two propositions given us , " no m are x ' " and " all m ' are y " , containing the two couples mx and my , it might be possible to prove from them a third proposition , containing x and y . )
in such a case we call the given propositions 'the premisses ' , the third one 'the conclusion ' and the whole set 'a syllogism ' .
evidently , one of the attributes must occur in both premisses ; or else one must occur in one premiss , and its contradictory in the other .
in the first case ( when , for example , the premisses are " some m are x " and " no m are y ' " ) the term , which occurs twice , is called 'the middle term ' , because it serves as a sort of link between the other two terms .
in the second case ( when , for example , the premisses are " no m are x ' " and " all m ' are y " ) the two terms , which contain these contradictory attributes , may be called 'the middle terms ' .
thus , in the first case , the class of " <unk> " is the middle term ; and , in the second case , the two classes of " <unk> " and " <unk> " are the middle terms .
the attribute , which occurs in the middle term or terms , disappears in the conclusion , and is said to be " eliminated " , which literally means " turned out of doors " .
now let us try to draw a conclusion from the two premisses  " some new cakes are unwholesome ; no nice cakes are unwholesome . "
in order to express them with counters , we need to divide cakes in three different ways , with regard to newness , to <unk> , and to <unk> .
for this we must use the larger diagram , making x mean " new " , y " nice " , and m " wholesome " .
( everything inside the central square is supposed to have the attribute m , and everything outside it the attribute m ' , i.e .
" <unk> " . )
you had better adopt the rule to make m mean the attribute which occurs in the middle term or terms .
( i have chosen m as the symbol , because <unk> ' begins with 'm ' . )
now , in representing the two premisses , i prefer to begin with the negative one ( the one beginning with " no " ) , because grey counters can always be placed with certainty , and <name> then help to fix the position of the red counters , which are sometimes a little uncertain where they <name> be most welcome .
let us express , the " no nice cakes are unwholesome ( cakes ) " , i.e .
" no <unk> are m' ( cakes ) " .
this tells us that none of the cakes belonging to the <unk> of the cupboard are in its <unk> ( i.e .
the ones outside the central square ) .
hence the two compartments , no .
9 and no .
15 , are both <unk> ' ; and we must place a grey counter in each of them , thus :        |0 | | |  |  | | | | | | |  |   |  | | | | | | |  |  | |0 | |       we have now to express the other premiss , namely , " some new cakes are unwholesome ( cakes ) " , i.e .
" some <unk> are m' ( cakes ) " .
this tells us that some of the cakes in the <unk> of the cupboard are in its <unk> .
hence one of the two compartments , no .
9 and no .
10 , is <unk> ' : and , as we are not told in which of these two compartments to place the red counter , the usual rule would be to lay it on the <unk> between them : but , in this case , the other premiss has settled the matter for us , by declaring no .
9 to be empty .
hence the red counter has no choice , and must go into no .
10 , thus :        |0 | <unk> |  |  | | | | | | |  |   |  | | | | | | |  |  | |0 | |       and now what counters <name> this information enable us to place in the smaller diagram , so as to get some proposition involving x and y only , leaving out m ?
let us take its four compartments , one by one .
first , no .
5 .
all we know about this is that its outer portion is empty : but we know nothing about its inner portion .
thus the square may be empty , or it may have something in it .
who can tell ?
so we dare not place any counter in this square .
secondly , what of no .
6 ?
here we are a little better off .
we know that there is something in it , for there is a red counter in its outer portion .
it is true we do not know whether its inner portion is empty or occupied : but what does that matter ?
one solitary cake , in one corner of the square , is quite sufficient excuse for saying " this square is occupied " , and for marking it with a red counter .
as to no .
7 , we are in the same condition as with no .
5  we find it partly <unk> ' , but we do not know whether the other part is empty or occupied : so we dare not <name> this square .
and as to no .
8 , we have simply no information at all .
the result is     | | 1 | |  |  | | | |     our <unk> ' , then , must be got out of the rather meager piece of information that there is a red counter in the <unk> .
hence our conclusion is " some x are y ' " , i.e .
" some new cakes are not-nice ( cakes ) " : or , if you prefer to take y ' as your subject , " some not-nice cakes are new ( cakes ) " ; but the other looks <unk> .
we <name> now write out the whole syllogism , putting the symbol & there4 [ * ] for " therefore " , and omitting " cakes " , for the sake of brevity , at the end of each proposition .
[ * ] [ note from <name> : the use of " & there4 " is a rather arbitrary selection .
there is no font available in general practice which renders the " therefore " symbol correction ( three dots in a triangular formation ) .
this can be done , however , in <unk> , so if this document is read in a <unk> , then the symbol <name> be properly recognized .
this is a poor man 's excuse . ]
" some new cakes are unwholesome ; no nice cakes are unwholesome & there4 some new cakes are not-nice . "
and you have now worked out , successfully , your first <unk> ' .
permit me to congratulate you , and to express the <name> that it is but the beginning of a long and glorious series of similar victories !
we <name> work out one other syllogism  a rather harder one than the last  and then , i think , you may be safely left to play the game by yourself , or ( better ) with any friend whom you can find , that is able and willing to take a share in the sport .
let us see what we can make of the two premisses  " all dragons are uncanny ; all scotchmen are canny . "
remember , i do n't guarantee the premisses to be facts .
in the first place , i never even saw a dragon : and , in the second place , it is n't of the slightest consequence to us , as logicians , whether our premisses are true or false : all we have to do is to make out whether they lead logically to the conclusion , so that , if they were true , it would be true also .
you see , we must give up the " cakes " now , or our cupboard <name> be of no use to us .
we must take , as our <unk> ' , some class of things which <name> include dragons and scotchmen : shall we say <unk> ' ?
and , as " canny " is evidently the attribute belonging to the <unk> terms ' , we <name> let m stand for " canny " , x for " dragons " , and y for " scotchmen " .
so that our two premisses are , in full , " all <unk> are uncanny ( animals ) ; all <unk> are canny ( animals ) . "
and these may be expressed , using letters for words , thus :  " all x are m ' ; all y are m. " the first premiss consists , as you already know , of two parts :  " some x are m ' , " and " no x are m. " and the second also consists of two parts :  " some y are m , " and " no y are m ' . "
let us take the negative portions first .
we have , then , to <name> , on the larger diagram , first , " no x are m " , and secondly , " no y are m ' " .
i think you <name> see , without further explanation , that the two results , separately , are             | | | |0 | | |  |  | |  |  | | |0 | <unk> | | | | | | |  |  |  |  | |  |  |  |  | | | | | | | | | | | |  |  | |  |  | | | | |0 | |             and that these two , when combined , give us       |0 | | |  |  | | |0 | <unk> | |  |  |  |  | | | | | | |  |  | |0 | |       we have now to <name> the two positive portions , " some x are m ' " and " some y are m " .
the only two compartments , available for things which are xm ' , are no .
9 and no .
10 .
of these , no .
9 is already marked as <unk> ' ; so our red counter must go into no .
10 .
similarly , the only two , available for ym , are no .
11 and no .
13 .
of these , no .
11 is already marked as <unk> ' ; so our red counter must go into no .
13 .
the final result is       |0 | <unk> |  |  | | |0 | <unk> | |  |  |  |  | | <unk> | | | |  |  | |0 | |       and now how much of this information can <unk> be transferred to the smaller diagram ?
let us take its four compartments , one by one .
as to no .
5 ?
this , we see , is wholly <unk> ' .
( so <name> it with a grey counter . )
as to no .
6 ?
this , we see , is <unk> ' .
( so <name> it with a red counter . )
as to no .
7 ?
ditto , ditto .
as to no .
8 ?
no information .
the smaller diagram is now pretty liberally marked :      | 0 | 1 | |  |  | | 1 | |     and now what conclusion can we read off from this ?
well , it is impossible to pack such abundant information into one proposition : we shall have to indulge in two , this time .
first , by taking x as subject , we get " all x are y ' " , that is , " all dragons are <unk> " : secondly , by taking y as subject , we get " all y are x ' " , that is , " all scotchmen are <unk> " .
let us now write out , all together , our two premisses and our brace of conclusions .
" all dragons are uncanny ; all scotchmen are canny .
& there4 all dragons are <unk> ; all scotchmen are <unk> . "
let me mention , in conclusion , that you may perhaps meet with logical treatises in which it is not assumed that any thing exists at all , by " some x are y " is understood to mean " the attributes x , y are compatible , so that a thing can have both at once " , and " no x are y " to mean " the attributes x , y are incompatible , so that nothing can have both at once " .
in such treatises , propositions have quite different meanings from what they have in our <unk> of logic ' , and it <name> be well to understand exactly what the difference is .
first take " some x are y " .
here we understand " are " to mean " are , as an actual fact "  which of course implies that some <unk> exist .
but they ( the writers of these other treatises ) only understand " are " to mean " can be " , which does not at all imply that any exist .
so they mean less than we do : our meaning includes theirs ( for of course " some x are y " includes " some x can be y " ) , but theirs does not include ours .
for example , " some welsh <unk> are heavy " would be true , according to these writers ( since the attributes " welsh " and " heavy " are quite compatible in a hippopotamus ) , but it would be false in our game ( since there are no welsh <unk> to be heavy ) .
secondly , take " no x are y " .
here we only understand " are " to mean " are , as an actual fact "  which does not at all imply that no x can be y .
but they understand the proposition to mean , not only that none are y , but that none can possibly be y .
so they mean more than we do : their meaning includes ours ( for of course " no x can be y " includes " no x are y " ) , but ours does not include theirs .
for example , " no policemen are eight feet high " would be true in our game ( since , as an actual fact , no such splendid specimens are ever found ) , but it would be false , according to these writers ( since the attributes " belonging to the police force " and " eight feet high " are quite compatible : there is nothing to prevent a policeman from growing to that height , if sufficiently rubbed with <unk> 's <unk> oil  which said to make hair grow , when rubbed on hair , and so of course <name> make a policeman grow , when rubbed on a policeman ) .
thirdly , take " all x are y " , which consists of the two partial propositions " some x are y " and " no x are y ' " .
here , of course , the treatises mean less than we do in the first part , and more than we do in the second .
but the two operations do n't balance each other  any more than you can console a man , for having knocked down one of his chimneys , by giving him an extra door-step .
if you meet with syllogisms of this kind , you may work them , quite easily , by the system i have given you : you have only to make 'are ' mean 'are capable of being ' , and all <name> go smoothly .
for " some x are y " <name> become " some x are capable of being y " , that is , " the attributes x , y are compatible " .
and " no x are y " <name> become " no x are capable of being y " , that is , " the attributes x , y are incompatible " .
and , of course , " all x are y " <name> become " some x are capable of being y , and none are capable of being y ' " , that is , " the attributes x , y are compatible , and the attributes x , y ' are incompatible . "
in using the diagrams for this system , you must understand a red counter to mean " there may possibly be something in this compartment , " and a grey one to mean " there can not possibly be anything in this compartment . "
3 .
<unk> .
and so you think , do you , that the chief use of logic , in real life , is to deduce conclusions from <unk> premisses , and to satisfy yourself that the conclusions , deduced by other people , are correct ?
i only wish it were !
society would be much less liable to <unk> and other delusions , and political life , especially , would be a totally different thing , if even a majority of the arguments , that scattered <unk> over the world , were correct !
but it is all the other way , i fear .
for one <unk> pair of premisses ( i mean a pair that lead to a logical conclusion ) that you meet with in reading your newspaper or magazine , you <name> probably find five that lead to no conclusion at all : and , even when the premisses are <unk> , for one instance , where the writer draws a correct conclusion , there are probably ten where he draws an incorrect one .
in the first case , you may say " the premisses are <unk> " : in the second , " the conclusion is <unk> . "
the chief use you <name> find , in such logical skill as this game may teach you , <name> be in detecting <unk> ' of these two kinds .
the first kind of fallacy  <unk> premisses '  you <name> detect when , after marking them on the larger diagram , you try to transfer the marks to the smaller .
you <name> take its four compartments , one by one , and ask , for each in turn , " what <name> can i place here ?
" ; and in every one the answer <name> be " no information !
" , showing that there is no conclusion at all .
for instance , " all soldiers are brave ; some englishmen are brave .
& there4 some englishmen are soldiers . "
looks uncommonly like a syllogism , and might easily take in a less experienced <unk> .
but you are not to be caught by such a trick !
you would simply set out the premisses , and would then calmly remark " <unk> premisses !
" : you would n't condescend to ask what conclusion the writer professed to draw  knowing that , whatever it is , it must be wrong .
you would be just as safe as that wise mother was , who said " <name> , just go up to the nursery , and see what baby 's doing , and tell him not to do it ! "
the other kind of fallacy  <unk> conclusion '  you <name> not detect till you have marked both diagrams , and have read off the correct conclusion , and have compared it with the conclusion which the writer has drawn .
but mind , you must n't say " <unk> conclusion , " simply because it is not identical with the correct one : it may be a part of the correct conclusion , and so be quite correct , as far as it goes .
in this case you would merely remark , with a pitying smile , " defective conclusion ! "
suppose , of example , you were to meet with this syllogism :  " all unselfish people are generous ; no misers are generous .
& there4 no misers are unselfish . "
the premisses of which might be thus expressed in letters :  " all x ' are m ; no y are m. " here the correct conclusion would be " all x ' are y ' " ( that is , " all unselfish people are not misers " ) , while the conclusion , drawn by the writer , is " no y are x ' , " ( which is the same as " no x ' are y , " and so is part of " all x ' are y ' . " )
here you would simply say " defective conclusion ! "
the same thing would happen , if you were in a <unk> 's shop , and if a little boy were to come in , put down twopence , and march off triumphantly with a single <unk> .
you would shake your head mournfully , and would remark " defective conclusion !
poor little chap ! "
and perhaps you would ask the young <name> behind the counter whether she would let you eat the bun , which the little boy had paid for and left behind him : and perhaps she would reply " sha'n't ! "
but if , in the above example , the writer had drawn the conclusion " all misers are selfish " ( that is , " all y are x " ) , this would be going beyond his legitimate rights ( since it would assert the existence of y , which is not contained in the premisses ) , and you would very properly say " <unk> conclusion ! "
now , when you read other treatises on logic , you <name> meet with various kinds of ( so-called ) <unk> ' which are by no means always so .
for example , if you were to put before one of these logicians the pair of premisses " no honest men cheat ; no dishonest men are trustworthy . "
and were to ask him what conclusion followed , he would probably say " none at all !
your premisses offend against two distinct rules , and are as <unk> as they can well be ! "
then suppose you were bold enough to say " the conclusion is 'no men who cheat are trustworthy ' , " i fear your logical friend would turn away hastily  perhaps angry , perhaps only scornful : in any case , the result would be unpleasant .
i advise you not to try the experiment !
" but why is this ? "
you <name> say .
" do you mean to tell us that all these logicians are wrong ? "
far from it , dear reader !
from their point of view , they are perfectly right .
but they do not include , in their system , anything like all the possible forms of syllogisms .
they have a sort of nervous dread of attributes beginning with a negative particle .
for example , such propositions as " all not-x are y , " " no x are not-y , " are quite outside their system .
and thus , having ( from sheer nervousness ) excluded a quantity of very useful forms , they have made rules which , though quite applicable to the few forms which they allow of , are no use at all when you consider all possible forms .
let us not quarrel with them , dear reader !
there is room enough in the world for both of us .
let us quietly take our broader system : and , if they choose to shut their eyes to all these useful forms , and to say " they are not syllogisms at all ! "
we can but stand aside , and let them rush upon their fate !
there is scarcely anything of yours , upon which it is so dangerous to rush , as your fate .
you may rush upon your <unk> , or your <unk> , without doing much harm : you may even rush upon your balcony ( unless it is a new house , built by contract , and with no clerk of the works ) and may survive the foolhardy enterprise : but if you once rush upon your fate  why , you must take the consequences !

elementary .
1 .
whatever can be " attributed to " , that is " said to belong to " , a thing , is called an <unk> ' .
for example , " baked " , which can ( frequently ) be attributed to " buns " , and " beautiful " , which can ( seldom ) be attributed to " babies " .
2 .
when they are the names of two things ( for example , " these pigs are fat animals " ) , or of two attributes ( for example , " pink is light red " ) .
3 .
when one is the name of a thing , and the other the name of an attribute ( for example , " these pigs are pink " ) , since a thing can not actually be an attribute .
4 .
that the substantive shall be supposed to be repeated at the end of the sentence ( for example , " these pigs are pink ( pigs ) " ) .
5 .
a <unk> ' is a sentence stating that some , or none , or all , of the things belonging to a certain class , called the <unk> ' , are also things belonging to a certain other class , called the <unk> ' .
for example , " some new cakes are not nice " , that is ( written in full ) " some new cakes are not nice cakes " ; where the class " new cakes " is the subject , and the class " not-nice cakes " is the predicate .
6 .
a proposition , stating that some of the things belonging to its subject are so-and-so , is called <unk> ' .
for example , " some new cakes are nice " , " some new cakes are not nice . "
a proposition , stating that none of the things belonging to its subject , or that all of them , are so-and-so , is called <unk> ' .
for example , " no new cakes are nice " , " all new cakes are not nice " .
7 .
the things in each compartment possess two attributes , whose symbols <name> be found written on two of the edges of that compartment .
8 .
" one or more . "
9 .
as a name of the class of things to which the whole diagram is assigned .
10 .
a proposition containing two statements .
for example , " some new cakes are nice and some are not-nice . "
11 .
when the whole class , thus divided , is " exhausted " among the sets into which it is divided , there being no member of it which does not belong to some one of them .
for example , the class " new cakes " is " exhaustively " divided into " nice " and " not-nice " since every new cake must be one or the other .
12 .
when a man can not make up his mind which of two parties he <name> join , he is said to be " sitting on the fence "  not being able to decide on which side he <name> jump down .
13 .
" some x are y " and " no x are y ' " .
14 .
a proposition , whose subject is a single thing , is called <unk> ' .
for example , " i am happy " , " <name> is not at home " .
these are universal propositions , being the same as " all the <unk> that exist are happy " , " all the <unk> , that i am now considering , are not at home " .
15 .
propositions beginning with " some " or " all " .
16 .
when they begin with " some " or " no " .
for example , " some <unk> are <unk> " may be <unk> as " some <unk> are <unk> " , each being equivalent to " some <unk> exist " .
17 .
some tigers are fierce , no tigers are <unk> .
18 .
some hard-boiled eggs are unwholesome , no hard-boiled eggs are wholesome .
19 .
some i 's are happy , no i 's are unhappy .
20 .
some <unk> are not at home , no <unk> are at home .
21 .
the things , in each compartment of the larger diagram , possess three attributes , whose symbols <name> be found written at three of the corners of the compartment ( except in the case of m ' , which is not actually inserted in the diagram , but is supposed to stand at each of its four outer corners ) .
22 .
if the universe of things be divided with regard to three different attributes ; and if two propositions be given , containing two different couples of these attributes ; and if from these we can prove a third proposition , containing the two attributes that have not yet occurred together ; the given propositions are called 'the premisses ' , the third one 'the conclusion ' , and the whole set 'a syllogism ' .
for example , the premisses might be " no m are x ' " and " all m ' are y " ; and it might be possible to prove from them a conclusion containing x and y .
23 .
if an attribute occurs in both premisses , the term containing it is called 'the middle term ' .
for example , if the premisses are " some m are x " and " no m are y ' " , the class of " <unk> " is 'the middle term . '
if an attribute occurs in one premiss , and its contradictory in the other , the terms containing them may be called 'the middle terms ' .
for example , if the premisses are " no m are x ' " and " all m ' are y " , the two classes of " <unk> " and " <unk> " may be called 'the middle terms ' .
24 .
because they can be marked with certainty : whereas affirmative propositions ( that is , those that begin with " some " or " all " ) sometimes require us to place a red counter <unk> on a fence ' .
25 .
because the only question we are concerned with is whether the conclusion follows logically from the premisses , so that , if they were true , it also would be true .
26 .
by understanding a red counter to mean " this compartment can be occupied " , and a grey one to mean " this compartment can not be occupied " or " this compartment must be empty " .
27 .
<unk> premisses ' and <unk> conclusion ' .
28 .
by finding , when we try to transfer marks from the larger diagram to the smaller , that there is 'no information ' for any of its four compartments .
29 .
by finding the correct conclusion , and then observing that the conclusion , offered to us , is neither identical with it nor a part of it .
30 .
when the offered conclusion is part of the correct conclusion .
in this case , we may call it a <unk> conclusion ' .

these are not legitimate premisses , since the conclusion is really part of the second premiss , so that the first premiss is superfluous .
this may be shown , in letters , thus :  " all xm are y " contains " some xm are y " , which contains " some x are y " .
or , in words , " all rainy days are tiresome " contains " some rainy days are tiresome " , which contains " some rainy periods are tiresome " .
moreover , the first premiss , besides being superfluous , is actually contained in the second ; since it is equivalent to " some rainy days exist " , which , as we know , is implied in the proposition " all rainy days are tiresome " .
altogether , a most unsatisfactory pair of premisses !

you might have known , if you had had any sense , that no old sailors ever like <unk> ! "

stuff ! "
" you may call it stuff , if you like .
all i know is , my uncles are all old men : and they like <unk> like anything ! "
" well , then your uncles are  " 94 .
" do come away !
i ca n't stand this squeezing any more .
no crowded shops are comfortable , you know very well . "
" well , who expects to be comfortable , out shopping ? "
" why , i do , of course !
and i 'm sure there are some shops , further down the street , that are not crowded .
so  " 95 .
" they say no doctors are metaphysical <unk> : and that lets me into a little fact about you , you know . "
" why , how do you make that out ?
you never heard me play the organ . "
" no , doctor , but i 've heard you talk about browning 's poetry : and that showed me that you 're metaphysical , at any rate .
so  "  extract a syllogism out of each of the following : and test its correctness :  96 .
" do n't talk to me !
i 've known more <name> merchants than you have : and i can tell you not one of them was ever an old miser since the world began ! "
" and what has that got to do with old mr .
brown ? "
" why , is n't he very <name> ? "
" yes , of course he is .
and what then ? "
" why , do n't you see that it 's absurd to call him a miserly merchant ?
either he 's not a merchant , or he 's not a miser ! "
97 .
" it is so kind of you to enquire !
i 'm really feeling a great deal better to-day . "
" and is it nature , or <name> , that is to have the credit of this happy change ? "
" <name> , i think .
the doctor has given me some of that patent medicine of his . "
" well , i 'll never call him a humbug again .
there 's somebody , at any rate , that feels better after taking his medicine ! "
98 .
" no , i do n't like you one bit .
and i 'll go and play with my doll .
dolls are never unkind . "
" so you like a doll better than a cousin ?
oh you little silly ! "
" of course i do !
cousins are never kind  at least no cousins i've ever seen . "
" well , and what does that prove , i 'd like to know !
if you mean that cousins are n't dolls , who ever said they were ? "
99 .
" what are you talking about geraniums for ?
you ca n't tell one flower from another , at this distance !
i <name> you they're all red flowers : it does n't need a telescope to know that . "
" well , some geraniums are red , are n't they ? "
" i do n't deny it .
and what then ?
i suppose you 'll be telling me some of those flowers are geraniums ! "
" of course that 's what i should tell you , if you 'd the sense to follow an argument !
but what 's the good of proving anything to you , i should like to know ? "
100 .
" boys , you 've passed a fairly good examination , all things considered .
now let me give you a word of advice before i go .
remember that all , who are really anxious to learn , work hard . "
" i thank you , sir , in the name of my scholars !
and proud am i to think there are some of them , at least , that are really anxious to learn . "
" very glad to hear it : and how do you make it out to be so ? "
" why , sir , i know how hard they work  some of them , that is .
who should know better ? "
 extract from the following speech a series of syllogisms , or arguments having the form of syllogisms : and test their correctness .
it is supposed to be spoken by a fond mother , in answer to a <unk> cautious suggestion that she is perhaps a little <unk> it , in the way of lessons , with her children .
101 .
" well , they 've got their own way to make in the world .
we ca n't leave them a fortune apiece .
and money 's not to be had , as you know , without money 's worth : they must work if they want to live .
and how are they to work , if they do n't know anything ?
take my word for it , there 's no place for ignorance in these times !
and all authorities agree that the time to learn is when you 're young .
one 's got no memory afterwards , worth speaking of .
a child <name> learn more in an hour than a grown man in five .
so those , that have to learn , must learn when they 're young , if ever they 're to learn at all .
of course that does n't do unless children are healthy : i quite allow that .
well , the doctor tells me no children are healthy unless they 've got a good colour in their cheeks .
and only just look at my darlings !
why , their cheeks bloom like <unk> !
well , now , they tell me that , to keep children in health , you should never give them more than six hours altogether at lessons in the day , and at least two <unk> in the week .
and that's exactly our plan i can assure you !
we never go beyond six hours , and every wednesday and saturday , as ever is , not one syllable of lessons do they do after their one o'clock dinner !
so how you can imagine i 'm running any risk in the education of my precious pets is more than i can understand , i promise you ! "
the end .
the hunting of the snark <name> <name> the <unk> <unk> edition <unk> the hunting of the snark an agony in eight fits by <name> <name> preface if  and the thing is wildly possible  the charge of writing nonsense were ever brought against the author of this brief but instructive poem , it would be based , i feel convinced , on the line ( in <unk> ) " then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes . "
in view of this painful possibility , i <name> not ( as i might ) appeal indignantly to my other writings as a proof that i am incapable of such a deed : i <name> not ( as i might ) point to the strong moral purpose of this poem itself , to the arithmetical principles so cautiously inculcated in it , or to its <name> teachings in natural history  i <name> take the more <unk> course of simply explaining how it happened .
the bellman , who was almost <unk> sensitive about appearances , used to have the bowsprit <unk> once or twice a week to be <unk> , and it more than once happened , when the time came for replacing it , that no one on board could remember which end of the ship it belonged to .
they knew it was not of the slightest use to appeal to the bellman about it  he would only refer to his naval code , and read out in pathetic tones admiralty instructions which none of them had ever been able to understand  so it generally ended in its being fastened on , anyhow , across the rudder .
the helmsman used to stand by with tears in his eyes ; he knew it was all wrong , but alas !
rule 42 of the code , " no one shall speak to the man at the helm , " had been completed by the bellman himself with the words " and the man at the helm shall speak to no one . "
so remonstrance was impossible , and no steering could be done till the next <unk> day .
during these bewildering intervals the ship usually sailed backwards .
as this poem is to some extent connected with the lay of the <unk> , let me take this opportunity of answering a question that has often been asked me , how to pronounce " <unk> <unk> . "
the " i " in " <unk> " is long , as in " writhe " ; and " <unk> " is pronounced so as to rhyme with " groves . "
again , the first " o " in " <unk> " is pronounced like the " o " in " borrow . "
i have heard people try to give it the sound of the " o " in " worry " .
such is human perversity .
this also seems a fitting occasion to notice the other hard works in that poem .
<unk> 's theory , of two meanings packed into one word like a <unk> , seems to me the right explanation for all .
for instance , take the two words " fuming " and " furious . "
make up your mind that you <name> say both words , but leave it unsettled which you <name> first .
now open your mouth and speak .
if your thoughts incline ever so little towards " fuming , " you <name> say " <unk> ; " if they turn , by even a hair 's breadth , towards " furious , " you <name> say " <unk> ; " but if you have the rarest of gifts , a perfectly balanced mind , you <name> say " <unk> . "
supposing that , when pistol uttered the well-known words  " under which king , <unk> ?
speak or die ! "
justice shallow had felt certain that it was either <name> or <name> , but had not been able to settle which , so that he could not possibly say either name before the other , can it be doubted that , rather than die , he would have gasped out " <unk> ! "
fit the first the landing " just the place for a snark ! "
the bellman cried , as he landed his crew with care ; supporting each man on the top of the tide by a finger <unk> in his hair .
" just the place for a snark !
i have said it twice : that alone should encourage the crew .
just the place for a snark !
i have said it thrice : what i tell you three times is true . "
the crew was complete : it included a boots  a maker of bonnets and <unk>  a barrister , brought to arrange their disputes  and a broker , to value their goods .
a <unk> , whose skill was immense , might perhaps have won more than his share  but a banker , engaged at enormous expense , had the whole of their cash in his care .
there was also a beaver , that paced on the deck , or would sit making lace in the bow : and had often ( the bellman said ) saved them from wreck , though none of the sailors knew how .
there was one who was famed for the number of things he forgot when he entered the ship : his umbrella , his watch , all his jewels and rings , and the clothes he had bought for the trip .
he had forty-two boxes , all carefully packed , with his name painted clearly on each : but , since he omitted to mention the fact , they were all left behind on the beach .
the loss of his clothes hardly mattered , because he had seven coats on when he came , with three pairs of boots  but the worst of it was , he had wholly forgotten his name .
he would answer to " hi ! "
or to any loud cry , such as " fry me ! "
or " <unk> my wig ! "
to " <unk> ! "
or " <unk> ! "
but especially " <unk> ! "
while , for those who preferred a more forcible word , he had different names from these : his intimate friends called him " <unk> , " and his enemies " <unk> . "
" his form is ungainly  his intellect small  " ( so the bellman would often remark ) " but his courage is perfect !
and that , after all , is the thing that one needs with a snark . "
he would joke with <unk> , returning their stare with an impudent wag of the head : and he once went a walk , <unk> , with a bear , " just to keep up its spirits , " he said .
he came as a baker : but owned , when too late  and it drove the poor bellman <unk>  he could only bake <unk>  for which , i may state , no materials were to be had .
the last of the crew needs especial remark , though he looked an incredible dunce : he had just one idea  but , that one being " snark , " the good bellman engaged him at once .
he came as a butcher : but gravely declared , when the ship had been sailing a week , he could only kill beavers .
the bellman looked scared , and was almost too frightened to speak : but at length he explained , in a tremulous tone , there was only one beaver on board ; and that was a tame one he had of his own , whose death would be deeply deplored .
the beaver , who happened to hear the remark , protested , with tears in its eyes , that not even the rapture of hunting the snark could atone for that dismal surprise !
it strongly advised that the butcher should be conveyed in a separate ship : but the bellman declared that would never agree with the plans he had made for the trip : navigation was always a difficult <name> , though with only one ship and one <name> : and he feared he must really decline , for his part , undertaking another as well .
the beaver 's best course was , no doubt , to procure a second-hand <unk> coat  so the baker advised it  and next , to insure its life in some office of note : this the banker suggested , and offered for hire ( on moderate terms ) , or for sale , two excellent policies , one against fire , and one against damage from hail .
yet still , ever after that sorrowful day , whenever the butcher was by , the beaver kept looking the opposite way , and appeared unaccountably shy .
fit the second the bellman 's speech the bellman himself they all praised to the skies  such a carriage , such ease and such <name> !
such solemnity , too !
one could see he was wise , the moment one looked in his face !
he had bought a large map representing the sea , without the least vestige of land : and the crew were much pleased when they found it to be a map they could all understand .
" what 's the good of <unk> 's north poles and <unk> , tropics , zones , and meridian lines ? "
so the bellman would cry : and the crew would reply " they are merely conventional signs !
" other maps are such shapes , with their islands and capes !
but we 've got our brave captain to thank : " ( so the crew would protest ) " that he 's bought us the best  a perfect and absolute blank ! "
this was charming , no doubt ; but they shortly found out that the captain they trusted so well had only one notion for crossing the ocean , and that was to tingle his <name> .
he was thoughtful and grave  but the orders he gave were enough to bewilder a crew .
when he cried " steer to starboard , but keep her head larboard ! "
what on earth was the helmsman to do ?
then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes : a thing , as the bellman remarked , that frequently happens in tropical climes , when a vessel is , so to speak , " <unk> . "
but the principal failing occurred in the sailing , and the bellman , perplexed and distressed , said he had hoped , at least , when the wind blew due east , that the ship would not travel due west !
but the danger was past  they had landed at last , with their boxes , <unk> , and bags : yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view , which consisted of chasms and crags .
the bellman perceived that their spirits were low , and repeated in musical tone some jokes he had kept for a season of woe  but the crew would do nothing but groan .
he served out some <unk> with a liberal hand , and bade them sit down on the beach : and they could not but own that their captain looked grand , as he stood and delivered his speech .
" friends , romans , and countrymen , lend me your ears ! "
( they were all of them fond of quotations : so they drank to his health , and they gave him three cheers , while he served out additional rations ) .
" we have sailed many months , we have sailed many weeks , ( four weeks to the month you may <name> ) , but never as yet ( 't is your captain who speaks ) have we caught the least glimpse of a snark !
" we have sailed many weeks , we have sailed many days , ( seven days to the week i allow ) , but a snark , on the which we might lovingly gaze , we have never beheld till now !
" come , listen , my men , while i tell you again the five unmistakable marks by which you may know , <unk> you go , the warranted genuine <unk> .
" let us take them in order .
the first is the taste , which is meagre and hollow , but crisp : like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist , with a flavour of <unk> .
" its habit of getting up late you 'll agree that it carries too far , when i say that it frequently breakfasts at <unk> tea , and <unk> on the following day .
" the third is its slowness in taking a jest .
should you happen to venture on one , it <name> sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed : and it always looks grave at a pun .
" the fourth is its fondness for <unk> , which is constantly carries about , and believes that they add to the beauty of scenes  a sentiment open to doubt .
" the fifth is ambition .
it next <name> be right to describe each particular batch : distinguishing those that have feathers , and bite , and those that have whiskers , and scratch .
" for , although common <unk> do no manner of harm , yet , i feel it my duty to say , some are <unk>  " the bellman broke off in alarm , for the baker had fainted away .
fit the third the baker 's tale they roused him with muffins  they roused him with ice  they roused him with mustard and <unk>  they roused him with jam and judicious advice  they set him <unk> to guess .
when at length he sat up and was able to speak , his sad story he offered to tell ; and the bellman cried " silence !
not even a shriek ! "
and excitedly tingled his <name> .
there was silence supreme !
not a shriek , not a scream , scarcely even a howl or a groan , as the man they called " ho ! "
told his story of woe in an <unk> tone .
" my father and mother were honest , though poor  " " skip all that ! "
cried the bellman in haste .
" if it once becomes dark , there 's no chance of a snark  we have hardly a minute to waste ! "
" i skip forty years , " said the baker , in tears , " and proceed without further remark to the day when you took me aboard of your ship to help you in hunting the snark .
" a dear uncle of mine ( after whom i was named ) remarked , when i bade him farewell  " " oh , skip your dear uncle ! "
the bellman exclaimed , as he angrily tingled his <name> .
" he remarked to me then , " said that <unk> of men , " 'if your snark be a snark , that is right : fetch it home by all means  you may serve it with greens , and it 's handy for striking a light .
" 'you may seek it with <unk>  and seek it with care ; you may hunt it with forks and <name> ; you may threaten its life with a <unk> ; you may charm it with smiles and soap  ' " ( " that 's exactly the method , " the bellman bold in a hasty parenthesis cried , " that 's exactly the way i have always been told that the capture of <unk> should be tried ! " )
" 'but oh , <unk> nephew , beware of the day , if your snark be a <unk> !
for then you <name> softly and suddenly vanish away , and never be met with again ! '
" it is this , it is this that <unk> my soul , when i think of my uncle 's last words : and my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl brimming over with quivering <unk> !
" it is this , it is this  " " we have had that before ! "
the bellman indignantly said .
and the baker replied " let me say it once more .
it is this , it is this that i dread !
" i engage with the snark  every night after dark  in a dreamy delirious fight : i serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes , and i use it for striking a light : " but if ever i meet with a <unk> , that day , in a moment ( of this i am sure ) , i shall softly and suddenly vanish away  and the notion i can not endure ! "
fit the fourth the hunting the bellman looked <unk> , and wrinkled his brow .
" if only you 'd spoken before !
it 's excessively awkward to mention it now , with the snark , so to speak , at the door !
" we should all of us grieve , as you well may believe , if you never were met with again  but surely , my man , when the voyage began , you might have suggested it then ?
" it 's excessively awkward to mention it now  as i think i 've already remarked . "
and the man they called " hi ! "
replied , with a sigh , " i informed you the day we embarked .
" you may charge me with murder  or want of sense  ( we are all of us weak at times ) : but the slightest approach to a false pretence was never among my crimes !
" i said it in hebrew  i said it in dutch  i said it in <name> and greek : but i wholly forgot ( and it <unk> me much ) that english is what you speak ! "
" 't is a pitiful tale , " said the bellman , whose face had grown longer at every word : " but , now that you 've stated the whole of your case , more debate would be simply absurd .
" the rest of my speech " ( he explained to his men ) " you shall hear when i 've leisure to speak it .
but the snark is at hand , let me tell you again !
't is your glorious duty to seek it !
" to seek it with <unk> , to seek it with care ; to pursue it with forks and <name> ; to threaten its life with a <unk> ; to charm it with smiles and soap !
" for the snark 's a peculiar creature , that won't be caught in a commonplace way .
do all that you know , and try all that you do n't : not a chance must be wasted to-day !
" for england expects  i forbear to proceed : 't is a maxim tremendous , but <unk> : and you 'd best be <unk> the things that you need to rig yourselves out for the fight . "
then the banker <unk> a blank cheque ( which he crossed ) , and changed his loose silver for notes .
the baker with care combed his whiskers and hair , and shook the dust out of his coats .
the boots and the broker were sharpening a spade  each working the grindstone in turn : but the beaver went on making lace , and displayed no interest in the concern : though the barrister tried to appeal to its pride , and vainly proceeded to cite a number of cases , in which making laces had been proved an <unk> of right .
the maker of bonnets ferociously planned a novel arrangement of bows : while the <unk> with quivering hand was <unk> the tip of his nose .
but the butcher turned nervous , and dressed himself fine , with yellow kid gloves and a ruff  said he felt it exactly like going to dine , which the bellman declared was all " stuff . "
" introduce me , now there 's a good fellow , " he said , " if we happen to meet it together ! "
and the bellman , sagaciously nodding his head , said " that must depend on the weather . "
the beaver went simply <unk> about , at seeing the butcher so shy : and even the baker , though stupid and stout , made an effort to wink with one eye .
" be a man ! "
said the bellman in wrath , as he heard the butcher beginning to sob .
" should we meet with a <unk> , that desperate bird , we shall need all our strength for the job ! "
fit the fifth the beaver 's lesson they sought it with <unk> , they sought it with care ; they pursued it with forks and <name> ; they threatened its life with a <unk> ; they charmed it with smiles and soap .
then the butcher contrived an ingenious plan for making a separate <name> ; and had fixed on a spot unfrequented by man , a dismal and desolate valley .
but the very same plan to the beaver occurred : it had chosen the very same place : yet neither betrayed , by a sign or a word , the disgust that appeared in his face .
each thought he was thinking of nothing but " snark " and the glorious work of the day ; and each tried to pretend that he did not remark that the other was going that way .
but the valley grew narrow and narrower still , and the evening got darker and colder , till ( merely from nervousness , not from goodwill ) they marched along shoulder to shoulder .
then a scream , shrill and high , rent the shuddering sky , and they knew that some danger was near : the beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail , and even the butcher felt queer .
he thought of his childhood , left far far behind  that blissful and innocent state  the sound so exactly recalled to his mind a pencil that <unk> on a slate !
" 't is the voice of the <unk> ! "
he suddenly cried .
( this man , that they used to call " dunce . " )
" as the bellman would tell you , " he added with pride , " i have uttered that sentiment once .
" 't is the note of the <unk> !
keep count , i entreat ; you <name> find i have told it you twice .
't is the song of the <unk> !
the proof is complete , if only i 've stated it thrice . "
the beaver had counted with scrupulous care , attending to every word : but it fairly lost heart , and <unk> in despair , when the third repetition occurred .
it felt that , in spite of all possible pains , it had somehow contrived to lose count , and the only thing now was to rack its poor brains by reckoning up the amount .
" two added to one  if that could but be done , " it said , " with one 's fingers and thumbs ! "
<unk> with tears how , in earlier years , it had taken no pains with its sums .
" the thing can be done , " said the butcher , " i think .
the thing must be done , i am sure .
the thing shall be done !
bring me paper and ink , the best there is time to procure . "
the beaver brought paper , portfolio , pens , and ink in unfailing supplies : while strange creepy creatures came out of their dens , and watched them with wondering eyes .
so engrossed was the butcher , he heeded them not , as he wrote with a pen in each hand , and explained all the while in a popular style which the beaver could well understand .
" taking three as the subject to reason about  a convenient number to state  we add seven , and ten , and then multiply out by one thousand diminished by eight .
" the result we proceed to divide , as you see , by nine hundred and ninety two : then <unk> seventeen , and the answer must be exactly and perfectly true .
" the method employed i would gladly explain , while i have it so clear in my head , if i had but the time and you had but the <name>  but much yet remains to be said .
" in one moment i 've seen what has hitherto been enveloped in absolute mystery , and without extra charge i <name> give you at large a lesson in natural history . "
in his genial way he proceeded to say ( forgetting all laws of propriety , and that giving instruction , without introduction , would have caused quite a thrill in society ) , " as to temper the <unk> 's a desperate bird , since it lives in perpetual passion : its taste in costume is entirely absurd  it is ages ahead of the fashion : " but it knows any friend it has met once before : it never <name> look at a bribe : and in <unk> it stands at the door , and collects  though it does not subscribe .
" its ' flavour when cooked is more exquisite far than mutton , or oysters , or eggs : ( some think it keeps best in an <name> jar , and some , in mahogany <unk> : ) " you boil it in sawdust : you salt it in glue : you condense it with locusts and tape : still keeping one principal object in view  to preserve its symmetrical shape . "
the butcher would gladly have talked till next day , but he felt that the lesson must end , and he wept with delight in attempting to say he considered the beaver his friend .
while the beaver confessed , with affectionate looks more eloquent even than tears , it had learned in ten minutes far more than all books would have taught it in seventy years .
they returned <unk> , and the bellman , <unk> ( for a moment ) with <name> emotion , said " this amply <unk> all the wearisome days we have spent on the billowy ocean ! "
such friends , as the beaver and butcher became , have seldom if ever been known ; in <name> or summer , 't was always the same  you could never meet either alone .
and when quarrels arose  as one frequently finds quarrels <name> , spite of every endeavour  the song of the <unk> recurred to their minds , and cemented their friendship for ever !
fit the sixth the barrister 's dream they sought it with <unk> , they sought it with care ; they pursued it with forks and <name> ; they threatened its life with a <unk> ; they charmed it with smiles and soap .
but the barrister , weary of proving in vain that the beaver 's <unk> was wrong , fell asleep , and in dreams saw the creature quite plain that his fancy had dwelt on so long .
he dreamed that he stood in a shadowy court , where the snark , with a glass in its eye , dressed in gown , bands , and wig , was defending a pig on the charge of deserting its sty .
the witnesses proved , without error or flaw , that the sty was deserted when found : and the judge kept explaining the state of the law in a soft <unk> of sound .
the indictment had never been clearly expressed , and it seemed that the snark had begun , and had spoken three hours , before any one guessed what the pig was supposed to have done .
the jury had each formed a different view ( long before the indictment was read ) , and they all spoke at once , so that none of them knew one word that the others had said .
" you must know  " said the judge : but the snark exclaimed " <unk> ! "
that statute is obsolete quite !
let me tell you , my friends , the whole question depends on an ancient <unk> right .
" in the matter of treason the pig would appear to have aided , but scarcely <unk> : while the charge of <unk> fails , it is clear , if you <name> the plea 'never indebted . '
" the fact of desertion i <name> not dispute ; but its guilt , as i trust , is removed ( so far as related to the costs of this suit ) by the <unk> which has been proved .
" my poor client 's fate now depends on your votes . "
here the speaker sat down in his place , and directed the judge to refer to his notes and briefly to sum up the case .
but the judge said he never had summed up before ; so the snark undertook it instead , and summed it so well that it came to far more than the witnesses ever had said !
when the verdict was called for , the jury declined , as the word was so puzzling to spell ; but they ventured to <name> that the snark would n't mind undertaking that duty as well .
so the snark found the verdict , although , as it owned , it was spent with the toils of the day : when it said the word " guilty ! "
the jury all groaned , and some of them fainted away .
then the snark pronounced sentence , the judge being quite too nervous to utter a word : when it rose to its feet , there was silence like night , and the fall of a pin might be heard .
" transportation for life " was the sentence it gave , " and then to be fined forty pound . "
the jury all cheered , though the judge said he feared that the phrase was not legally sound .
but their wild exultation was suddenly checked when the jailer informed them , with tears , such a sentence would have not the slightest effect , as the pig had been dead for some years .
the judge left the court , looking deeply disgusted : but the snark , though a little aghast , as the lawyer to whom the defense was entrusted , went bellowing on to the last .
thus the barrister dreamed , while the bellowing seemed to grow every moment more clear : till he woke to the knell of a furious <name> , which the bellman rang close at his ear .
fit the seventh the banker 's fate they sought it with <unk> , they sought it with care ; they pursued it with forks and <name> ; they threatened its life with a <unk> ; they charmed it with smiles and soap .
and the banker , inspired with a courage so new it was matter for general remark , rushed madly ahead and was lost to their view in his zeal to discover the snark but while he was seeking with <unk> and care , a <unk> swiftly <name> nigh and grabbed at the banker , who shrieked in despair , for he knew it was useless to fly .
he offered large discount  he offered a cheque ( drawn " to bearer " ) for <unk> : but the <unk> merely extended its neck and grabbed at the banker again .
without rest or pause  while those <unk> jaws went savagely snapping around  he skipped and he hopped , and he floundered and flopped , till fainting he fell to the ground .
the <unk> fled as the others appeared led on by that <unk> yell : and the bellman remarked " it is just as i feared ! "
and solemnly <unk> on his <name> .
he was black in the face , and they scarcely could trace the least likeness to what he had been : while so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white  a wonderful thing to be seen !
to the horror of all who were present that day .
he <unk> in full evening dress , and with senseless grimaces endeavoured to say what his tongue could no longer express .
down he sank in a chair  ran his hands through his hair  and chanted in <unk> tones words whose utter <unk> proved his insanity , while he rattled a couple of bones .
" leave him here to his fate  it is getting so late ! "
the bellman exclaimed in a fright .
" we have lost half the day .
any further delay , and we <unk> catch a snark before night ! "
fit the eighth the vanishing they sought it with <unk> , they sought it with care ; they pursued it with forks and <name> ; they threatened its life with a <unk> ; they charmed it with smiles and soap .
they shuddered to think that the <name> might fail , and the beaver , excited at last , went bounding along on the tip of its tail , for the daylight was nearly past .
" there is <unk> shouting ! "
the bellman said , " he is shouting like mad , only hark !
he is waving his hands , he is wagging his head , he has certainly found a snark ! "
they gazed in delight , while the butcher exclaimed " he was always a desperate wag ! "
they beheld him  their baker  their hero unnamed  on the top of a neighboring crag .
erect and sublime , for one moment of time .
in the next , that wild figure they saw ( as if stung by a spasm ) plunge into a chasm , while they waited and listened in awe .
" it 's a snark ! "
was the sound that first came to their ears , and seemed almost too good to be true .
then followed a torrent of laughter and cheers : then the ominous words " it 's a <unk> " then , silence .
some fancied they heard in the air a weary and wandering sigh then sounded like " <unk> ! "
but the others declare it was only a breeze that went by .
they hunted till darkness came on , but they found not a button , or feather , or <name> , by which they could tell that they stood on the ground where the baker had met with the snark .
in the midst of the word he was trying to say , in the midst of his laughter and glee , he had softly and suddenly vanished away   for the snark was a <unk> , you see .

preface .
nearly the whole of this volume is a reprint of the serious portion of <unk> and other poems , which was first published in 1869 and has long been out of print .
" the path of roses " was written soon after the <unk> war , when the name of <name> nightingale had already become a <unk> .
" only a woman 's hair " was suggested by a circumstance mentioned in the life of <name> swift , viz. , that , after his death , a small packet was found among his papers , containing a single lock of hair and inscribed with those words .
" after three days " was written after seeing <unk> hunt 's picture , the finding of christ in the <name> .
the two poems , " far away " and " a song of love " , are reprinted from <name> and <name> and <name> and <name> concluded , books whose high price ( made necessary by the great cost of production ) has , i fear , put them out of the reach of most of my readers .
" a lesson in latin " is reprinted from the <unk> , a magazine got up among the members of " the girls ' latin school , boston , <unk> " the only poems , here printed for the first time , are put together under the title of " puck lost and found , " having been inscribed in two books  fairies , a poem by <unk> , illustrated by miss e. <name> thomson , and <name> <unk> , a <unk> , by whom written i do not know , illustrated by c. o. <name>  which were presented to a little girl and boy , as a sort of memento of a visit paid by them to the author one day , on which occasion he taught them the pastime  dear to the hearts of children  of folding paper " pistols , " which can be made to imitate , fairly well , the noise of a real one .

he saw her once , and in the glance , a moment 's glance of meeting eyes , his heart stood still in sudden trance : he trembled with a sweet surprise  all in the waning light she stood , the <name> of perfect womanhood .
that <unk> his heart was light : with lighter step he trod the ground : and life was fairer in his sight , and music was in every sound : he blessed the world where there could be so beautiful a thing as she .
there once again , as evening fell and stars were peering overhead , two lovers met to bid farewell : the western sun gleamed faint and red , lost in a drift of purple cloud that wrapped him like a <unk> .
long time the memory of that night  the hand that clasped , the lips that kissed , the form that faded from his sight slow sinking through the tearful mist  in dreamy music seemed to roll through the dark chambers of his soul .
so after many years he came a wanderer from a distant shore : the street , the house , were still the same , but those he sought were there no more : his burning words , his hopes and fears , unheeded fell on alien ears .
only the children from their play would pause the mournful tale to hear , shrinking in <unk> away , or , step by step , would venture near to touch with timid curious hands that strange wild man from other lands .
he sat beside the busy street , there , where he last had seen her face : and thronging memories , <unk> , seemed yet to haunt the ancient place : her footfall ever floated near : her voice was ever in his ear .
he sometimes , as the daylight waned and evening mists began to roll , in <unk> complained of that black shadow on his soul , and blindly fanned , with cruel care , the ashes of a vain despair .
the summer fled : the lonely man still lingered out the lessening days ; still , as the night <name> on , would scan each passing face with closer gaze  till , sick at heart , he turned away , and sighed " she <name> not come to-day . "
so by degrees his spirit bent to mock its own despairing cry , in stern <unk> to invent new luxuries of agony , and people all the vacant space with visions of her perfect face .
then for a moment she was nigh , he heard no step , but she was there ; as if an <name> suddenly were <unk> from the <unk> air , and all her fine ethereal frame should fade as swiftly as it came .
so , half in fancy 's <name> trance , and half in misery 's aching void with set and stony countenance his bitter being he enjoyed , and thrust for ever from his mind the happiness he could not find .
as when the wretch , in lonely room , to selfish death is madly hurled , the glamour of that fatal fume shuts out the wholesome living world  so all his manhood 's strength and pride one sickly dream had swept aside .
yea , brother , and we passed him there , but yesterday , in <name> mood , and marveled at the lordly air that shamed his beggar 's attitude , nor heeded that ourselves might be wretches as desperate as he ; who let the thought of bliss denied make havoc of our life and powers , and pine , in solitary pride , for peace that never shall be ours , because we <name> not work and wait in <unk> <name> for our fate .
and so it chanced once more that she came by the old familiar spot : the face he would have died to see bent o'er him , and he knew it not ; too rapt in selfish grief to hear , even when happiness was near .
and pity filled her gentle breast for him that would not stir nor speak the dying crimson of the west , that faintly tinged his haggard cheek , fell on her as she stood , and shed a <name> round the patient head .
ah , let him wake !
the moments fly : this awful <unk> may be the last .
and see , the tear , that dimmed her eye , had fallen on him ere she passed  she passed : the crimson paled to gray : and <name> departed with the day .
the heavy hours of night went by , and silence quickened into sound , and light slid up the eastern sky , and life began its daily round  but light and life for him were fled : his name was numbered with the dead .
nov. , <unk> [ illustration ] the path of roses .
in the dark silence of an ancient room , whose one tall window fronted to the west , where , through laced tendrils of a hanging vine , the <unk> was fading into night , sat a pale <name> , resting weary hands upon a great clasped volume , and her face within her hands .
not as in rest she bowed , but large hot tears were coursing down her cheek , and her <unk> sobs broke <unk> upon the sleeping echoes of the night .
soon she <unk> 'd the volume once again , and read the words in tone of agony , as in <unk> , weeping as she read :   " he crowns the <name> of his race : he <unk> but in some fit place to meet his <unk> face to face : " and , battling for the true , the right , from ruddy <name> to purple night , to perish in the <unk> fight : " where hearts are fierce and hands are strong , where peals the bugle loud and long , where blood is dropping in the throng : " still , with a dim and <unk> eye , to watch the tide of victory , to hear in death the <unk> : " then , gathered grandly to his grave , to rest among the true and brave , in holy ground , where <unk> wave : " where , from <unk> sculptured fair , float out upon the evening air the note of praise , the voice of prayer : " where no vain marble mockery insults with loud and <unk> lie the simple soldier 's memory : " where sometimes little children go , and read , in whisper 'd accent slow , the name of him who sleeps below .
"  her voice died out : like one in dreams she sat .
" alas ! "
she sighed .
" for what can woman do ?
her life is aimless , and her death unknown : hemmed in by social forms she pines in vain .
man has his work , but what can woman do ? "
and answer came there from the creeping gloom , the creeping gloom that settled into night : " peace !
for thy lot is other than a man 's : his is a path of thorns : he beats them down : he faces death : he <unk> with despair .
thine is of roses , to adorn and cheer his lonely life , and hide the thorns in flowers . "
she spake again : in bitter tone she spake : " aye , as a toy , the <unk> of an hour , or a fair <unk> , newly plucked at morn , but flung aside and withered ere the night . "
and answer came there from the creeping gloom , the creeping gloom that blackened into night : " so shalt thou be the lamp to light his path , what time the shades of sorrow close around . "
and , so it seemed to her , an awful light pierced slowly through the darkness , <unk> , and grew , until all passed away  the ancient room  the sunlight dying through the <unk> vine  the one tall window  all had passed away , and she was standing on the mighty hills .
beneath , around , and far as eye could see , squadron on squadron , stretched opposing hosts , ranked as for battle , mute and motionless .
anon a distant thunder shook the ground , the tramp of horses , and a troop shot by  plunged headlong in that living sea of men  plunged to their death : back from that fatal field a scattered handful , fighting hard for life , broke through the <unk> lines ; but , as she gazed , they shrank and melted , and their forms grew thin  grew pale as ghosts when the first morning <name> <unk> from the east  the trumpet 's brazen blare died into silence  and the vision passed  passed to a room where sick and dying lay in long , sad line  there brooded fear and pain  darkness was there , the shade of <unk> 's wing .
but there was one that ever , to and fro , moved with light footfall : purely calm her face , and those deep steadfast eyes that starred the gloom : still , as she went , she <unk> to each comfort and counsel ; cooled the fevered brow with softest touch , and in the listening ear of the pale sufferer whispered words of peace .
the dying warrior , gazing as she passed , clasped his thin hands and blessed her .
bless her too , thou , who didst bless the merciful of old !
so prayed the <name> , watching tearfully her gentle moving onward , till the night had veiled her wholly , and the vision passed .
then once again the solemn whisper came : " so in the darkest path of man 's despair , where war and terror shake the troubled earth , lies woman 's mission ; with <unk> brow to pass through scenes of horror and affright where men grow sick and tremble : unto her all things are sanctified , for all are good .
nothing so mean , but shall deserve her care : nothing so great , but she may bear her part .
no life is vain : each hath his place assigned : do thou thy task , and leave the rest to god . "
and there was silence , but the <name> made no answer , save one <unk> " amen . "
and she arose , and in that darkening room stood lonely as a spirit of the night  stood calm and fearless in the gathered night  and raised her eyes to heaven .
there were tears upon her face , but in her heart was peace , peace that the world nor gives nor takes away !
<name> 10 , <unk> [ illustration ] the valley of the shadow of death .
hark , said the dying man , and sighed , to that complaining tone  like sprite condemned , each eventide , to walk the world alone .
at sunset , when the air is still , i hear it creep from yonder hill : it breathes upon me , dead and chill , a moment , and is gone .
my son , it minds me of a day left half a life behind , that i have prayed to put away for ever from my mind .
but bitter memory <name> not die : it haunts my soul when none is nigh : i hear its whisper in the sigh of that complaining wind .
and now in death my soul is fain to tell the tale of fear that hidden in my breast hath lain through many a weary year : yet time would fail to utter all  the evil spells that held me thrall , and thrust my life from fall to fall , thou <unk> not to hear .
the spells that bound me with a chain , sin 's stern <unk> to do , till pleasure 's self , invoked in vain , a heavy burden grew  till from my spirit 's fevered eye , a hunted thing , i seemed to fly through the dark woods that <unk> <name> <unk> of blue .
deep in those woods i found a vale no sunlight <unk> , nor <name> , nor wandering <unk> pale ; where never comes the breath of <unk>  there in mine ear , even as i lingered half in fear , i heard a whisper , cold and clear , " this is the gate of death .
" o bitter is it to abide in weariness alway : at <name> to sigh for eventide , at eventide for day .
thy noon hath fled : thy sun hath shone .
the brightness of thy day is gone : what need to <unk> and linger on till life be cold and gray ?
" o well , " it said , " beneath <name> pool , in some still cavern deep , the fevered <name> might slumber cool , the eyes forget to weep : within that <unk> 's mystic rim are draughts of healing , stored for him whose heart is sick , whose sight is dim , who <unk> but to sleep ! "
the <unk> went moaning by , like mourner for the dead , and stirred , with shrill complaining sigh , the tree-tops overhead : my <unk> seemed to stand and mutely wave a warning hand  with sudden terror all <unk> , i turned myself and fled !
a <unk> stood open wide : soft fell the dying <name> on two fair children , side by side , that rested from their play  together bent the <name> head , as ever and anon they read from one dear book : the words they said come back to me to-day .
like twin cascades on <unk> together wandered down the ripples of the golden hair , the ripples of the brown : while , through the tangled silken haze , blue eyes looked forth in eager gaze , more <unk> than the gems that blaze about a monarch 's crown .
my son , there comes to each an hour when sinks the spirit 's pride  when weary hands forget their power the strokes of death to guide : in such a moment , warriors say , a word the <unk> may stay , a sudden charge redeem the day and turn the living tide .
i could not see , for blinding tears , the glories of the west : a heavenly music filled mine ears , a heavenly peace my breast .
" come unto me , come unto me  all ye that labour , unto me  ye <unk> , come to me  and i <name> give you rest . "
the night <name> onward : thin and blue the evening mists arise to bathe the thirsty land in dew , as <unk> in paradise  while , over silent field and town , the deep blue vault of heaven looked down ; not , as of old , in angry frown , but bright with angels ' eyes .
blest day !
then first i heard the voice that since hath oft beguiled these eyes from tears , and bid rejoice this heart with anguish wild  thy mother , boy , thou hast not known ; so soon she left me here to moan  left me to weep and watch , alone , our one beloved child .
though , parted from my aching sight , like <unk> dove , she passed into the perfect light that floods the world above ; yet our twin spirits , well i know  though one abide in pain below  love , as in summers long ago , and evermore shall love .
so with a glad and patient heart i move toward mine end : the streams , that flow awhile apart , shall both in ocean blend .
i dare not weep : i can but bless the love that pitied my distress , and lent me , in life 's wilderness , so sweet and true a friend .
but if there be  o if there be a truth in what they say , that <unk> we can not see go with us on our way ; then surely she is with me here , i dimly feel her spirit near  the <unk> grow thin and clear , and death brings in the day .
<name> , <unk> [ illustration ] solitude .
i love the stillness of the wood : i love the music of the rill : i love to couch in pensive mood upon some silent hill .
scarce heard , beneath <name> arching trees , the <unk> ripples pass ; and , like a mimic <name> , the breeze whispers among the grass .
here from the world i win release , nor scorn of men , nor footstep rude , break in to mar the holy peace of this great solitude .
here may the silent tears i weep lull the vexed spirit into rest , as infants sob themselves to sleep upon a mother 's breast .
but when the bitter hour is gone , and the keen throbbing pangs are still , oh sweetest then to couch alone upon some silent hill !
to live in joys that once have been , to put the cold world out of sight , and deck life 's drear and barren scene with hues of <unk> .
for what to man the gift of breath , if sorrow be his lot below ; if all the day that ends in death be dark with clouds of woe ?
shall the poor transport of an hour repay long years of sore distress  the fragrance of a lonely flower make glad the wilderness ?
ye golden hours of life 's young spring , of innocence , of love and truth !
bright , beyond all imagining , thou <unk> of youth !
i 'd give all wealth that years have piled , the slow result of life 's decay , to be once more a little child for one bright <unk> .
march 16 , <unk> far away .
he <unk> so lightly to the land , all in his manly pride : he kissed her cheek , he clasped her hand ; yet still she glanced aside .
" too <name> he seems , " she darkly dreams , " too gallant and too <name> , to think of me  poor simple me  when he is far away ! "
" i bring my love this goodly <name> across the seas , " he said : " a gem to deck the dearest girl that ever sailor wed ! "
she holds it tight : her eyes are bright : her throbbing heart would say " he thought of me  he thought of me  when he was far away ! "
the ship has sailed into the west : her <unk> is flown : a dull dead pain is in her breast , and she is weak and lone : but there 's a smile upon her face , a smile that seems to say " he 'll think of me  he 'll think of me  when he is far away !
" though waters wide between us glide , our lives are warm and near : no distance parts two faithful hearts  two hearts that love so dear : and i <name> trust my <unk> , for ever and a day , to think of me  to think of me  when he is far away ! "
[ illustration ] <name> .
in her eyes is the living light of a wanderer to earth from a far celestial height : summers five are all the span  summers five since time began to veil in mists of human night a shining <unk> .
does an <name> look from her eyes ?
<name> she suddenly spring away , and soar to her home in the skies ?
<name> !
blessing and blessed to be !
<name> !
still , as i gaze on thee , visions of two sweet maids arise , whose life was of yesterday : of a <name> pale and stern , with the lips of a dumb despair , with the innocent eyes that yearn  yearn for the young sweet hours of life , far from sorrow and far from strife , for the happy summers , that never return , when the world seemed good and fair : of a <name> glorious , bright  of a sainted , ethereal maid , whose blue eyes are deep fountains of light , cheering the poet that <unk> apart , filling with gladness his desolate heart , like the moon when she shines thro ' a cloudless night on a world of silence and shade .
and the visions waver and faint , and the visions vanish away that my fancy delighted to paint  she is here at my side , a living child , with the glowing cheek and the tresses wild , nor <unk> martyr , nor radiant saint , yet <unk> and bright as they .
for i think , if a grim wild beast were to come from his <unk> , from his <unk> in the east  stealthily creeping with bated breath , stealthily creeping with eyes of death  he would all forget his dream of the feast , and crouch at her feet a slave .
she would twine her hand in his mane : she would <unk> in silvery tone , like the tinkle of <unk>  questioning him with her laughing eyes , questioning him with a glad surprise , till she caught from those fierce eyes again the love that lit her own .
and be sure , if a savage heart , in a mask of human guise , were to come on her here apart  bound for a dark and a deadly deed , hurrying past with pitiless speed  he would suddenly falter and <unk> start at the glance of her pure blue eyes .
nay , be sure , if an <name> fair , a bright seraph <unk> , were to stoop from the trackless air , fain would she linger in glad <unk>  lovingly linger to ponder and gaze , with a sister 's love and a sister 's care , on the happy , innocent child .
dec .
4 , <unk> [ illustration ] stolen waters .
the light was faint , and soft the air that breathed around the place ; and she was lithe , and tall , and fair , and with a wayward <name> her queenly head she bare .
with glowing cheek , with gleaming eye , she met me on the way : my spirit owned the witchery within her smile that lay : i followed her , i knew not why .
the trees were thick with many a fruit , the grass with many a flower : my soul was dead , my tongue was mute , in that <unk> hour .
and , in my dream , with silvery voice , she said , or seemed to say , " youth is the season to rejoice  " i could not choose but stay : i could not say her nay .
she plucked a branch above her head , with rarest <unk> laden : " drink of the juice , sir knight , " she said : " 't is good for knight and maiden . "
oh , blind mine eye that would not trace  oh , deaf mine ear that would not heed  the mocking smile upon her face , the mocking voice of greed !
i drank the juice ; and straightway felt a fire within my <name> : my soul within me seemed to melt in sweet delirious pain .
" sweet is the stolen draught , " she said : " hath sweetness stint or measure ?
pleasant the secret hoard of bread : what bars us from our pleasure ? "
" yea , take we pleasure while we may , " i heard myself replying .
in the red sunset , far away , my happier life was dying : my heart was sad , my voice was <name> .
and unawares , i knew not how , i kissed her dainty <unk> , i kissed her on the <name> brow , i kissed her on the false , false lips  that burning kiss , i feel it now !
" true love gives true love of the best : then take , " i cried , " my heart to thee ! "
the very heart from out my breast i plucked , i gave it willingly : her very heart she gave to me  then died the <name> from the west .
in the gray light i saw her face , and it was withered , old , and gray ; the flowers were fading in their place , were fading with the fading day .
forth from her , like a hunted deer , through all that ghastly night i fled , and still behind me seemed to hear her fierce <unk> tread ; and scarce <name> breath for fear .
yet marked i well how strangely seemed the heart within my breast to sleep : silent it lay , or so i dreamed , with never a throb or leap .
for hers was now my heart , she said , the heart that once had been mine own : and in my breast i bore instead a cold , cold heart of stone .
so grew the morning overhead .
the sun shot downward through the trees his old familiar flame : all ancient sounds upon the breeze from <unk> and meadow came  but i was not the same .
they call me mad : i smile , i weep , <unk> how or why : yea , when one 's heart is laid asleep , what better than to die ?
so that the grave be dark and deep .
to die !
to die ?
and yet , methinks , i drink of life , to-day , deep as the thirsty traveler drinks of fountain by the way : my voice is sad , my heart is <name> .
when <unk> was on the <unk> , i heard a clear voice singing so sweetly that , like <unk> , my happy tears came springing : my human heart returned again .
 " a <name> child , sitting and singing , in a garden fair , the <name> of hearing , seeing , the simple <name> of being  or twining <unk> in the golden hair that ripples free and wild .
" a sweet pale child  wearily looking to the purple west  waiting the great <unk> that suddenly shall sever the cruel chains that hold her from her rest  by <unk> <unk> .
" an <unk>  gazing with living eyes on a dead face : the mortal form forsaken , that none may now awaken , that lieth <unk> , <unk> in her place , as though in death she smiled !
" be as a child  so shalt thou sing for very <name> of breath  so shalt thou wait thy dying , in holy transport lying  so pass rejoicing through the gate of death , in garment <unk> .
"  then call me what they <name> , i know that now my soul is glad : if this be madness , better so , far better to be mad , weeping or smiling as i go .
for if i weep , it is that now i see how deep a loss is mine , and feel how brightly round my brow the <unk> might shine , had i but kept mine early vow : and if i smile , it is that now i see the promise of the years  the <name> waiting for my brow , that must be won with tears , with pain  with death  i care not how .
may 9 , <unk> [ illustration ] the <unk> .
the morn was bright , the steeds were light , the wedding guests were <name> : young <name> stood within the wood and watched them pass away .
she scarcely saw the gallant train : the <unk> dimmed her <unk> : unheard the maiden did complain beneath the <unk> .
" oh <name> , thou didst love me well , till , on a bitter day , she came , the <name> <name> , and stole thy heart away .
my tears are vain : i live again in days that used to be , when i could meet thy welcome feet beneath the <unk> .
" oh <name> gray , i may not stay till spring renew thy leaf ; but i <name> hide myself away , and nurse a lonely grief .
it shall not dim life 's <name> for him : my tears he shall not see : while he is by , i 'll come not nigh my weeping <unk> .
" but when i die , oh let me lie beneath thy loving shade , that he may <unk> careless by , where i am lowly laid .
and let the white white marble tell , if he should stoop to see , 'here lies a maid that loved thee well , beneath the <unk> . ' "

only a woman 's hair .
'only a woman 's hair ' !
fling it aside !
a bubble on life 's mighty stream : heed it not , man , but watch the <unk> tide bright with the western beam .
nay !
in those words there rings from other years the <name> of a long low cry , where a proud spirit <unk> with its tears in <unk> agony .
and , as i touch that lock , strange visions throng upon my soul with dreamy <name>  of woman 's hair , the theme of poet 's song in every time and place .
a child 's bright tresses , by the breezes kissed to sweet disorder as she flies , <unk> , beneath a cloud of golden mist , flushed cheek and laughing eyes  or fringing , like a shadow , <unk> , the <name> of a <unk> face  or from a gipsy 's <name> brow tossed back in wild and wanton <name>  or <unk> on the hoary head of age , whose tale of life is well-nigh told  or , last , in dreams i make my pilgrimage to <name> of old .
i see the feast  the purple and the gold  the gathering crowd of pharisees , whose scornful eyes are centred to behold <name> woman on her knees .
the stifled sob rings strangely on mine ears , wrung from the depth of sin 's despair : and still she <unk> the sacred feet with tears , and <unk> them with her hair .
he scorned not then the simple loving deed of her , the lowest and the last ; then scorn not thou , but use with <name> heed this relic of the past .
the eyes that loved it once no longer wake : so lay it by with reverent care  touching it tenderly for sorrow 's sake  it is a woman 's hair .
<unk> .
17 , <unk> [ illustration ] the sailor 's wife .
see !
there are tears upon her face  tears newly shed , and scarcely dried : close , in an <unk> embrace , she <unk> the infant at her side .
peace dwells in those <unk> eyes , those parted lips that faintly smile  peace , the <unk> of paradise , in heart too young for care or <unk> .
no peace that mother 's features wear ; but quivering lip , and knotted brow , and broken mutterings , all declare the fearful dream that haunts her now .
the <unk> , rushing through the sky , wails from the depths of cloudy space ; shrill , piercing as the seaman 's cry when death and he are face to face .
familiar tones are in the <name> : they ring upon her startled ear : and quick and low she pants the tale that tells of agony and fear : " still that <unk> is nigh  with a vexed and <unk> motion , all beneath an angry sky , rocking on an angry ocean .
" round the straining mast and shrouds throng the spirits of the storm : darkly seen through driving clouds , bends each gaunt and ghastly form .
" see !
the good ship yields at last !
<unk> yields , and fights no more ; driving , in the frantic blast , headlong on the fatal shore .
" hark !
i hear her battered side , with a low and sullen shock , dashed , amid the foaming tide , full upon a sunken rock .
" his face shines out against the sky , like a ghost , so cold and white ; with a dead despairing eye gazing through the gathered night .
" is he watching , through the dark where a mocking ghostly hand points a faint and feeble spark glimmering from the distant land ?
" sees he , in this hour of dread , hearth and home and wife and child ?
loved ones who , in summers fled , clung to him and wept and smiled ?
" reeling sinks the fated bark to her tomb beneath the wave : must he perish in the dark  not a hand stretched out to save ?
" see the spirits , how they crowd !
watching death with eyes that burn !
waves rush in   " she shrieks aloud , ere her waking sense return .
the storm is gone : the skies are clear : hush 'd is that bitter cry of pain : the only sound , that meets her ear , the heaving of the sullen main .
though <unk> endure the night , yet <name> shall come with break of day : she <unk> with a strange delight  the fearful dream is pass 'd away .
she wakes : the grey <name> streaks the dark : with early song the <unk> ring : far off she hears the <unk> bark a joyful bark of welcoming !
<unk> .
23 , <unk> [ illustration ] after three days .
i stood within the gate of a great <name> , 'mid the living stream of <unk> that thronged its regal state <unk> in my dream .
jewels and gold were there ; and floors of marble lent a <name> sheen to body forth , as in a lower air , the wonders of the scene .
such wild and lavish <name> had whispers in it of a coming doom ; as richest flowers lie <unk> about the face of her that waits the tomb .
the wisest of the land had gathered there , three solemn <unk> , for high debate : men stood on either hand to listen and to gaze .
the aged brows were bent , bent to a frown , half thought , and half annoy , that all their stores of <unk> argument were baffled by a boy .
in each averted face i marked but scorn and loathing , till mine eyes fell upon one that stirred not in his place , <unk> in a dumb surprise .
surely within his mind strange thoughts are born , until he doubts the <name> of those old men , blind leaders of the blind , whose kingdom is no more .
surely he sees afar a day of death the <name> future brings ; the crimson setting of the <unk> that led the eastern kings .
thus , as a <unk> deep mirrors the shining heights that crown the bay , so did my soul create anew in sleep the picture seen by day .
<unk> came and went  a restless hum of voices marked the spot  in varying shades of critic discontent <unk> they knew not what .
" where is the comely limb , the form <unk> in every perfect part , the beauty that we should <name> in him ? "
ah !
fools and slow of heart !
look into those deep eyes , deep as the grave , and strong with love divine ; those tender , pure , and <unk> mysteries , that seem to pierce through thine .
look into those deep eyes , stirred to unrest by breath of coming strife , until a longing in thy soul arise that this indeed were life : that thou couldst find him there , bend at his sacred feet thy willing knee , and from thy heart pour out the passionate prayer " lord , let me follow thee ! "
but see the crowd divide : mother and sire have found their lost one now : the gentle voice , that fain would seem to chide whispers " son , why hast thou "  in tone of sad <unk>  " thus dealt with us , that <name> our dearest thing ?
behold , thy sire and i , three weary days , have sought thee sorrowing . "
and i had stayed to hear the loving words " how is it that ye sought ? "
 but that the sudden lark , with <unk> clear , severed the links of thought .
then over all there fell shadow and silence ; and my dream was fled , as fade the phantoms of a wizard 's cell when the dark charm is said .
yet , in the gathering light , i lay with half-shut eyes that would not wake , lovingly clinging to the skirts of night for that sweet vision 's sake .
<unk> .
16 , <unk> [ illustration ] faces in the fire .
the night creeps onward , sad and slow : in these red embers ' dying glow the forms of fancy come and go .
an <unk>  broad seas of corn stirred by the wandering breath of morn  the happy spot where i was born .
the picture <unk> in its place : amid the glow i seem to trace the shifting semblance of a face .
't is now a little childish form  red lips for kisses pouted warm  and <unk> tangled in the storm .
't is now a grave and gentle maid , at her own beauty half afraid , shrinking , and willing to be stayed .
oh , time was young , and life was warm , when first i saw that <unk> , her dark hair tossing in the storm .
and fast and free these pulses played , when last i met that gentle maid  when last her hand in mine was laid .
those locks of jet are turned to gray , and she is strange and far away that might have been mine own to-day  that might have been mine own , my dear , through many and many a happy year  that might have sat beside me here .
ay , <unk> through the changing scene , the ghostly whisper rings between , the dark refrain of 'might have been . '
the race is o'er i might have run : the deeds are past i might have done ; and sere the wreath i might have won .
sunk is the last faint flickering blaze : the vision of departed days is vanished even as i gaze .
the pictures , with their ruddy light , are changed to dust and ashes white , and i am left alone with night .

so , hour by hour , from flower to flower , we sip the sweets of life : till , all too soon , the clouds arise , and flaming cheeks and flashing eyes proclaim the <name> of strife : with half a smile and half a sigh , " <unk> !
bitter one !  " we cry .
last night we owned , with looks forlorn , " too well the scholar knows there is no rose without a thorn "  but peace is made !

our latin lesson is complete : we 've learned that love is <unk> !

through the looking-glass by <name> <name> the <unk> <unk> edition <unk> chapter i. looking-glass house one thing was certain , that the white kitten had had nothing to do with it :  it was the black kitten 's fault entirely .
for the white kitten had been having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of an hour ( and bearing it pretty well , considering ) ; so you see that it could n't have had any hand in the mischief .
the way <name> washed her children 's faces was this : first she held the poor thing down by its ear with one paw , and then with the other paw she rubbed its face all over , the wrong way , beginning at the nose : and just now , as i said , she was hard at work on the white kitten , which was lying quite still and trying to purr  no doubt feeling that it was all meant for its good .
but the black kitten had been finished with earlier in the afternoon , and so , while <name> was sitting curled up in a corner of the great arm-chair , half talking to herself and half asleep , the kitten had been having a grand game of <unk> with the ball of worsted <name> had been trying to wind up , and had been rolling it up and down till it had all come undone again ; and there it was , spread over the hearth-rug , all knots and <unk> , with the kitten running after its own tail in the middle .
'oh , you wicked little thing ! '
cried <name> , catching up the kitten , and giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace .
<unk> , <name> ought to have taught you better manners !
you ought , <name> , you know you ought ! '
she added , looking reproachfully at the old cat , and speaking in as cross a voice as she could manage  and then she scrambled back into the arm-chair , taking the kitten and the worsted with her , and began winding up the ball again .
but she did n't get on very fast , as she was talking all the time , sometimes to the kitten , and sometimes to herself .
<name> sat very demurely on her knee , pretending to watch the progress of the winding , and now and then putting out one paw and gently touching the ball , as if it would be glad to help , if it might .
'do you know what to-morrow is , <name> ? '
<name> began .
'you 'd have guessed if you 'd been up in the window with me  only <name> was making you tidy , so you could n't .
i was watching the boys getting in sticks for the bonfire  and it wants plenty of sticks , <name> !
only it got so cold , and it snowed so , they had to leave off .
never mind , <name> , we 'll go and see the bonfire to-morrow . '
here <name> wound two or three turns of the worsted round the kitten 's neck , just to see how it would look : this led to a scramble , in which the ball rolled down upon the floor , and yards and yards of it got unwound again .
'do you know , i was so angry , <name> , ' <name> went on as soon as they were comfortably settled again , 'when i saw all the mischief you had been doing , i was very nearly opening the window , and putting you out into the snow !
and you 'd have deserved it , you little mischievous darling !
what have you got to say for yourself ?
now do n't interrupt me ! '
she went on , holding up one finger .
'i 'm going to tell you all your faults .
number one : you squeaked twice while <name> was washing your face this morning .
now you ca n't deny it , <name> : i heard you !
what 's that you say ? '
( pretending that the kitten was speaking . )
'her paw went into your eye ?
well , that 's your fault , for keeping your eyes open  if you'd shut them tight up , it would n't have happened .
now do n't make any more excuses , but listen !
number two : you pulled <unk> away by the tail just as i had put down the saucer of milk before her !
what , you were thirsty , were you ?
how do you know she was n't thirsty too ?
now for number three : you unwound every bit of the worsted while i wasn't looking !
'that 's three faults , <name> , and you 've not been punished for any of them yet .
you know i 'm saving up all your punishments for wednesday week  suppose they had saved up all my punishments ! '
she went on , talking more to herself than the kitten .
'what would they do at the end of a year ?
i should be sent to prison , i suppose , when the day came .
or  let me see  suppose each punishment was to be going without a dinner : then , when the miserable day came , i should have to go without fifty dinners at once !
well , i should n't mind that much !
i 'd far rather go without them than eat them !
'do you hear the snow against the <unk> , <name> ?
how nice and soft it sounds !
just as if some one was kissing the window all over outside .
i wonder if the snow loves the trees and fields , that it kisses them so gently ?
and then it covers them up snug , you know , with a white quilt ; and perhaps it says , " go to sleep , darlings , till the summer comes again . "
and when they wake up in the summer , <name> , they dress themselves all in green , and dance about  whenever the wind blows  oh , that 's very pretty ! '
cried <name> , dropping the ball of worsted to clap her hands .
'and i do so wish it was true !
i 'm sure the woods look sleepy in the autumn , when the leaves are getting brown .
<unk> , can you play chess ?
now , do n't smile , my dear , i 'm asking it seriously .
because , when we were playing just now , you watched just as if you understood it : and when i said " check ! "
you purred !
well , it was a nice check , <name> , and really i might have won , if it had n't been for that nasty knight , that came <unk> down among my pieces .
<name> , dear , let 's pretend  ' and here i wish i could tell you half the things <name> used to say , beginning with her favourite phrase 'let 's pretend . '
she had had quite a long argument with her sister only the day before  all because <name> had begun with 'let 's pretend we 're kings and queens ; ' and her sister , who liked being very exact , had argued that they could n't , because there were only two of them , and <name> had been reduced at last to say , 'well , you can be one of them then , and i 'll be all the rest . '
and once she had really frightened her old nurse by shouting suddenly in her ear , <unk> !
do let 's pretend that i 'm a hungry <unk> , and you 're a bone . '
but this is taking us away from <name> 's speech to the kitten .
<unk> pretend that you 're the red <name> , <name> !
do you know , i think if you sat up and folded your arms , you 'd look exactly like her .
now do try , there 's a dear ! '
and <name> got the red <name> off the table , and set it up before the kitten as a model for it to imitate : however , the thing did n't succeed , principally , <name> said , because the kitten wouldn't fold its arms properly .
so , to punish it , she held it up to the looking-glass , that it might see how sulky it was  'and if you 're not good directly , ' she added , 'i 'll put you through into looking-glass house .
how would you like that ? '
'now , if you 'll only attend , <name> , and not talk so much , i 'll tell you all my ideas about looking-glass house .
first , there 's the room you can see through the glass  that 's just the same as our drawing room , only the things go the other way .
i can see all of it when i get upon a chair  all but the bit behind the fireplace .
oh !
i do so wish i could see that bit !
i want so much to know whether they 've a fire in the <name> : you never can tell , you know , unless our fire smokes , and then smoke comes up in that room too  but that may be only pretence , just to make it look as if they had a fire .
well then , the books are something like our books , only the words go the wrong way ; i know that , because i 've held up one of our books to the glass , and then they hold up one in the other room .
'how would you like to live in looking-glass house , <name> ?
i wonder if they 'd give you milk in there ?
perhaps looking-glass milk is n't good to drink  but oh , <name> !
now we come to the passage .
you can just see a little peep of the passage in looking-glass house , if you leave the door of our drawing-room wide open : and it 's very like our passage as far as you can see , only you know it may be quite different on beyond .
oh , <name> !
how nice it would be if we could only get through into looking-glass house !
i 'm sure it 's got , oh !
such beautiful things in it !
let 's pretend there 's a way of getting through into it , somehow , <name> .
let 's pretend the glass has got all soft like gauze , so that we can get through .
why , it 's turning into a sort of mist now , i declare !
it 'll be easy enough to get through  ' she was up on the <unk> while she said this , though she hardly knew how she had got there .
and certainly the glass was beginning to melt away , just like a bright silvery mist .
in another moment <name> was through the glass , and had jumped lightly down into the looking-glass room .
the very first thing she did was to look whether there was a fire in the fireplace , and she was quite pleased to find that there was a real one , blazing away as brightly as the one she had left behind .
'so i shall be as warm here as i was in the old room , ' thought <name> : <unk> , in fact , because there 'll be no one here to scold me away from the fire .
oh , what fun it 'll be , when they see me through the glass in here , and ca n't get at me ! '
then she began looking about , and noticed that what could be seen from the old room was quite common and uninteresting , but that all the rest was as different as possible .
for instance , the pictures on the wall next the fire seemed to be all alive , and the very clock on the <unk> ( you know you can only see the back of it in the looking-glass ) had got the face of a little old man , and grinned at her .
'they do n't keep this room so tidy as the other , ' <name> thought to herself , as she noticed several of the <unk> down in the hearth among the cinders : but in another moment , with a little 'oh ! '
of surprise , she was down on her hands and knees watching them .
the <unk> were walking about , two and two !
'here are the red king and the red <name> , ' <name> said ( in a whisper , for fear of frightening them ) , 'and there are the white king and the white <name> sitting on the edge of the shovel  and here are two castles walking arm in arm  i do n't think they can hear me , ' she went on , as she put her head closer down , 'and i 'm nearly sure they ca n't see me .
i feel somehow as if i were invisible  ' here something began squeaking on the table behind <name> , and made her turn her head just in time to see one of the white <unk> roll over and begin kicking : she watched it with great curiosity to see what would happen next .
'it is the voice of my child ! '
the white <name> cried out as she rushed past the king , so violently that she knocked him over among the cinders .
'my precious <name> !
my imperial kitten ! '
and she began scrambling wildly up the side of the fender .
<unk> <unk> ! '
said the king , rubbing his nose , which had been hurt by the fall .
he had a right to be a little annoyed with the <name> , for he was covered with ashes from head to foot .
<name> was very anxious to be of use , and , as the poor little <name> was nearly screaming herself into a fit , she hastily picked up the <name> and set her on the table by the side of her noisy little daughter .
the <name> gasped , and sat down : the rapid journey through the air had quite taken away her breath and for a minute or two she could do nothing but hug the little <name> in silence .
as soon as she had recovered her breath a little , she called out to the white king , who was sitting sulkily among the ashes , <unk> the volcano ! '
'what volcano ? '
said the king , looking up anxiously into the fire , as if he thought that was the most likely place to find one .
<unk>  me  up , ' panted the <name> , who was still a little out of breath .
<unk> you come up  the regular way  do n't get blown up ! '
<name> watched the white king as he slowly struggled up from bar to bar , till at last she said , 'why , you 'll be hours and hours getting to the table , at that rate .
i 'd far better help you , had n't i ? '
but the king took no notice of the question : it was quite clear that he could neither hear her nor see her .
so <name> picked him up very gently , and lifted him across more slowly than she had lifted the <name> , that she might n't take his breath away : but , before she put him on the table , she thought she might as well dust him a little , he was so covered with ashes .
she said afterwards that she had never seen in all her life such a face as the king made , when he found himself held in the air by an invisible hand , and being dusted : he was far too much astonished to cry out , but his eyes and his mouth went on getting larger and larger , and <unk> and <unk> , till her hand shook so with laughing that she nearly let him drop upon the floor .
'oh !
please do n't make such faces , my dear ! '
she cried out , quite forgetting that the king could n't hear her .
'you make me laugh so that i can hardly hold you !
and do n't keep your mouth so wide open !
all the ashes <name> get into it  there , now i think you 're tidy enough ! '
she added , as she smoothed his hair , and set him upon the table near the <name> .
the king immediately fell flat on his back , and lay perfectly still : and <name> was a little alarmed at what she had done , and went round the room to see if she could find any water to throw over him .
however , she could find nothing but a bottle of ink , and when she got back with it she found he had recovered , and he and the <name> were talking together in a frightened whisper  so low , that <name> could hardly hear what they said .
the king was saying , 'i assure , you my dear , i turned cold to the very ends of my whiskers ! '
to which the <name> replied , 'you have n't got any whiskers . '
'the horror of that moment , ' the king went on , 'i shall never , never forget ! '
'you <name> , though , ' the <name> said , 'if you do n't make a memorandum of it . '
<name> looked on with great interest as the king took an enormous <unk> out of his pocket , and began writing .
a sudden thought struck her , and she took hold of the end of the pencil , which came some way over his shoulder , and began writing for him .
the poor king looked puzzled and unhappy , and struggled with the pencil for some time without saying anything ; but <name> was too strong for him , and at last he panted out , 'my dear !
i really must get a thinner pencil .
i ca n't manage this one a bit ; it writes all manner of things that i do n't intend  ' 'what manner of things ? '
said the <name> , looking over the book ( in which <name> had put 'the white knight is sliding down the poker .
he balances very badly ' ) 'that 's not a memorandum of your feelings ! '
there was a book lying near <name> on the table , and while she sat watching the white king ( for she was still a little anxious about him , and had the ink all ready to throw over him , in case he fainted again ) , she turned over the leaves , to find some part that she could read , '  for it 's all in some language i do n't know , ' she said to herself .
it was like this .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> did , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> she puzzled over this for some time , but at last a bright thought struck her .
'why , it 's a looking-glass book , of course !
and if i hold it up to a glass , the words <name> all go the right way again . '
this was the poem that <name> read .
<unk> 't was <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> did <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> ; all <unk> were the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> the <unk> , my son !
the jaws that bite , the claws that catch !
beware the <unk> bird , and shun the <unk> <unk> ! '
he took his <unk> sword in hand : long time the <unk> foe he sought  so rested he by the <unk> tree , and stood awhile in thought .
and as in <unk> thought he stood , the <unk> , with eyes of flame , came <unk> through the <unk> wood , and <unk> as it came !
one , two !
one , two !
and through and through the <unk> blade went <unk> !
he left it dead , and with its head he went <unk> back .
'and hast thou slain the <unk> ?
come to my arms , my <unk> boy !
o <unk> day !
<unk> !
<unk> ! '
he <unk> in his <name> .
't was <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> did <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> ; all <unk> were the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
'it seems very pretty , ' she said when she had finished it , 'but it's rather hard to understand ! '
( you see she did n't like to confess , even to herself , that she could n't make it out at all . )
<unk> it seems to fill my head with ideas  only i do n't exactly know what they are !
however , somebody killed something : that 's clear , at any rate  ' 'but oh ! '
thought <name> , suddenly jumping up , 'if i do n't make haste i shall have to go back through the looking-glass , before i 've seen what the rest of the house is like !
let 's have a look at the garden first ! '
she was out of the room in a moment , and ran down stairs  or , at least , it was n't exactly running , but a new invention of hers for getting down stairs quickly and easily , as <name> said to herself .
she just kept the tips of her fingers on the <unk> , and floated gently down without even touching the stairs with her feet ; then she floated on through the hall , and would have gone straight out at the door in the same way , if she had n't caught hold of the door-post .
she was getting a little giddy with so much floating in the air , and was rather glad to find herself walking again in the natural way .
chapter ii .
the garden of live flowers 'i should see the garden far better , ' said <name> to herself , 'if i could get to the top of that hill : and here 's a path that leads straight to it  at least , no , it does n't do that  ' ( after going a few yards along the path , and turning several sharp corners ) , 'but i suppose it <name> at last .
but how curiously it twists !
it 's more like a corkscrew than a path !
well , this turn goes to the hill , i suppose  no , it does n't !
this goes straight back to the house !
well then , i 'll try it the other way . '
and so she did : wandering up and down , and trying turn after turn , but always coming back to the house , do what she would .
indeed , once , when she turned a corner rather more quickly than usual , she ran against it before she could stop herself .
'it 's no use talking about it , ' <name> said , looking up at the house and pretending it was arguing with her .
'i 'm not going in again yet .
i know i should have to get through the looking-glass again  back into the old room  and there 'd be an end of all my adventures ! '
so , resolutely turning her back upon the house , she set out once more down the path , determined to keep straight on till she got to the hill .
for a few minutes all went on well , and she was just saying , 'i really shall do it this time  ' when the path gave a sudden twist and shook itself ( as she described it afterwards ) , and the next moment she found herself actually walking in at the door .
'oh , it 's too bad ! '
she cried .
'i never saw such a house for getting in the way !
never ! '
however , there was the hill full in sight , so there was nothing to be done but start again .
this time she came upon a large <unk> , with a border of <unk> , and a <unk> growing in the middle .
'o <unk> , ' said <name> , addressing herself to one that was waving gracefully about in the wind , 'i wish you could talk ! '
'we can talk , ' said the <unk> : 'when there 's anybody worth talking to . '
<name> was so astonished that she could not speak for a minute : it quite seemed to take her breath away .
at length , as the <unk> only went on waving about , she spoke again , in a timid voice  almost in a whisper .
'and can all the flowers talk ? '
'as well as you can , ' said the <unk> .
'and a great deal louder . '
'it is n't manners for us to begin , you know , ' said the rose , 'and i really was wondering when you 'd speak !
said i to myself , " her face has got some sense in it , though it 's not a clever one ! "
still , you 're the right colour , and that goes a long way . '
'i do n't care about the colour , ' the <unk> remarked .
'if only her petals curled up a little more , she 'd be all right . '
<name> did n't like being criticised , so she began asking questions .
'are n't you sometimes frightened at being planted out here , with nobody to take care of you ? '
'there 's the tree in the middle , ' said the rose : 'what else is it good for ? '
'but what could it do , if any danger came ? '
<name> asked .
'it says " <unk> ! " '
cried a <name> : 'that 's why its branches are called boughs ! '
'did n't you know that ? '
cried another <name> , and here they all began shouting together , till the air seemed quite full of little shrill voices .
<unk> , every one of you ! '
cried the <unk> , waving itself passionately from side to side , and trembling with excitement .
'they know i ca n't get at them ! '
it panted , bending its quivering head towards <name> , 'or they would n't dare to do it ! '
'never mind ! '
<name> said in a soothing tone , and stooping down to the <unk> , who were just beginning again , she whispered , 'if you don't hold your tongues , i 'll pick you ! '
there was silence in a moment , and several of the pink <unk> turned white .
'that 's right ! '
said the <unk> .
'the <unk> are worst of all .
when one speaks , they all begin together , and it 's enough to make one wither to hear the way they go on ! '
'how is it you can all talk so nicely ? '
<name> said , hoping to get it into a better temper by a compliment .
'i 've been in many gardens before , but none of the flowers could talk . '
'put your hand down , and feel the ground , ' said the <unk> .
'then you 'll know why . '
<name> did so .
'it 's very hard , ' she said , 'but i do n't see what that has to do with it . '
'in most gardens , ' the <unk> said , 'they make the beds too soft  so that the flowers are always asleep . '
this sounded a very good reason , and <name> was quite pleased to know it .
'i never thought of that before ! '
she said .
'it 's my opinion that you never think at all , ' the rose said in a rather severe tone .
'i never saw anybody that looked <unk> , ' a <name> said , so suddenly , that <name> quite jumped ; for it had n't spoken before .
'hold your tongue ! '
cried the <unk> .
'as if you ever saw anybody !
you keep your head under the leaves , and snore away there , till you know no more what 's going on in the world , than if you were a <name> ! '
'are there any more people in the garden besides me ? '
<name> said , not choosing to notice the rose 's last remark .
'there 's one other flower in the garden that can move about like you , ' said the rose .
'i wonder how you do it  ' ( 'you 're always wondering , ' said the <unk> ) , 'but she 's more bushy than you are . '
'is she like me ? '
<name> asked eagerly , for the thought crossed her mind , 'there 's another little girl in the garden , somewhere ! '
'well , she has the same awkward shape as you , ' the rose said , 'but she's redder  and her petals are shorter , i think . '
'her petals are done up close , almost like a <name> , ' the <unk> interrupted : 'not tumbled about anyhow , like yours . '
'but that 's not your fault , ' the rose added kindly : 'you 're beginning to fade , you know  and then one ca n't help one 's petals getting a little untidy . '
<name> did n't like this idea at all : so , to change the subject , she asked 'does she ever come out here ? '
'i daresay you 'll see her soon , ' said the rose .
'she 's one of the thorny kind . '
'where does she wear the thorns ? '
<name> asked with some curiosity .
'why all round her head , of course , ' the rose replied .
'i was wondering you had n't got some too .
i thought it was the regular rule . '
'she 's coming ! '
cried the larkspur .
'i hear her footstep , thump , thump , thump , along the <unk> ! '
<name> looked round eagerly , and found that it was the red <name> .
<unk> grown a good deal ! '
was her first remark .
she had indeed : when <name> first found her in the ashes , she had been only three inches high  and here she was , half a head taller than <name> herself !
'it 's the fresh air that does it , ' said the rose : <unk> fine air it is , out here . '
'i think i 'll go and meet her , ' said <name> , for , though the flowers were interesting enough , she felt that it would be far grander to have a talk with a real <name> .
'you ca n't possibly do that , ' said the rose : '_i should advise you to walk the other way . '
this sounded nonsense to <name> , so she said nothing , but set off at once towards the red <name> .
to her surprise , she lost sight of her in a moment , and found herself walking in at the <unk> again .
a little provoked , she <name> back , and after looking everywhere for the <name> ( whom she spied out at last , a long way off ) , she thought she would try the plan , this time , of walking in the opposite direction .
it succeeded beautifully .
she had not been walking a minute before she found herself face to face with the red <name> , and full in sight of the hill she had been so long aiming at .
'where do you come from ? '
said the red <name> .
'and where are you going ?
look up , speak nicely , and do n't <unk> your fingers all the time . '
<name> attended to all these directions , and explained , as well as she could , that she had lost her way .
'i do n't know what you mean by your way , ' said the <name> : 'all the ways about here belong to me  but why did you come out here at all ? '
she added in a kinder tone .
<unk> while you 're thinking what to say , it saves time . '
<name> wondered a little at this , but she was too much in awe of the <name> to disbelieve it .
'i 'll try it when i go home , ' she thought to herself , 'the next time i 'm a little late for dinner . '
'it 's time for you to answer now , ' the <name> said , looking at her watch : <unk> your mouth a little wider when you speak , and always say " your majesty . " '
'i only wanted to see what the garden was like , your majesty  ' 'that 's right , ' said the <name> , patting her on the head , which <name> did n't like at all , 'though , when you say " garden , "  i 've seen gardens , compared with which this would be a wilderness . '
<name> did n't dare to argue the point , but went on : '  and i thought i'd try and find my way to the top of that hill  ' 'when you say " hill , " ' the <name> interrupted , '_i could show you hills , in comparison with which you 'd call that a valley . '
'no , i should n't , ' said <name> , surprised into <unk> her at last : 'a hill ca n't be a valley , you know .
that would be nonsense  ' the red <name> shook her head , 'you may call it " nonsense " if you like , ' she said , 'but i 've heard nonsense , compared with which that would be as sensible as a dictionary ! '
<name> <unk> again , as she was afraid from the <name> 's tone that she was a little offended : and they walked on in silence till they got to the top of the little hill .
for some minutes <name> stood without speaking , looking out in all directions over the country  and a most curious country it was .
there were a number of <name> little <name> running straight across it from side to side , and the ground between was divided up into squares by a number of little green hedges , that reached from <name> to <name> .
'i declare it 's marked out just like a large <unk> ! '
<name> said at last .
'there ought to be some men moving about somewhere  and so there are ! '
she added in a tone of delight , and her heart began to beat quick with excitement as she went on .
'it 's a great huge game of chess that's being played  all over the world  if this is the world at all , you know .
oh , what fun it is !
how i wish i was one of them !
i would n't mind being a pawn , if only i might join  though of course i should like to be a <name> , best . '
she glanced rather shyly at the real <name> as she said this , but her companion only smiled pleasantly , and said , 'that 's easily managed .
you can be the white <name> 's pawn , if you like , as <name> 's too young to play ; and you 're in the second square to begin with : when you get to the eighth square you 'll be a <name>  ' just at this moment , somehow or other , they began to run .
<name> never could quite make out , in thinking it over afterwards , how it was that they began : all she remembers is , that they were running hand in hand , and the <name> went so fast that it was all she could do to keep up with her : and still the <name> kept crying <unk> !
faster ! '
but <name> felt she could not go faster , though she had not breath left to say so .
the most curious part of the thing was , that the trees and the other things round them never changed their places at all : however fast they went , they never seemed to pass anything .
'i wonder if all the things move along with us ? '
thought poor puzzled <name> .
and the <name> seemed to guess her thoughts , for she cried , <unk> !
do n't try to talk ! '
not that <name> had any idea of doing that .
she felt as if she would never be able to talk again , she was getting so much out of breath : and still the <name> cried <unk> !
faster ! '
and dragged her along .
'are we nearly there ? '
<name> managed to pant out at last .
<unk> there ! '
the <name> repeated .
'why , we passed it ten minutes ago !
faster ! '
and they ran on for a time in silence , with the wind whistling in <name> 's ears , and almost blowing her hair off her head , she fancied .
'now !
now ! '
cried the <name> .
<unk> !
faster ! '
and they went so fast that at last they seemed to skim through the air , hardly touching the ground with their feet , till suddenly , just as <name> was getting quite exhausted , they stopped , and she found herself sitting on the ground , breathless and giddy .
the <name> propped her up against a tree , and said kindly , 'you may rest a little now . '
<name> looked round her in great surprise .
'why , i do believe we 've been under this tree the whole time !
everything 's just as it was ! '
'of course it is , ' said the <name> , 'what would you have it ? '
'well , in our country , ' said <name> , still panting a little , <unk> generally get to somewhere else  if you ran very fast for a long time , as we 've been doing . '
'a slow sort of country ! '
said the <name> .
'now , here , you see , it takes all the running you can do , to keep in the same place .
if you want to get somewhere else , you must run at least twice as fast as that ! '
'i 'd rather not try , please ! '
said <name> .
'i 'm quite content to stay here  only i am so hot and thirsty ! '
'i know what you 'd like ! '
the <name> said good-naturedly , taking a little box out of her pocket .
'have a biscuit ? '
<name> thought it would not be civil to say 'no , ' though it was n't at all what she wanted .
so she took it , and ate it as well as she could : and it was very dry ; and she thought she had never been so nearly choked in all her life .
<unk> you 're refreshing yourself , ' said the <name> , 'i 'll just take the measurements . '
and she took a ribbon out of her pocket , marked in inches , and began measuring the ground , and sticking little pegs in here and there .
'at the end of two yards , ' she said , putting in a <name> to <name> the distance , 'i shall give you your directions  have another biscuit ? '
'no , thank you , ' said <name> : 'one 's quite enough ! '
<unk> quenched , i <name> ? '
said the <name> .
<name> did not know what to say to this , but luckily the <name> did not wait for an answer , but went on .
'at the end of three yards i shall repeat them  for fear of your forgetting them .
at the end of four , i shall say good-bye .
and at the end of five , i shall go ! '
she had got all the pegs put in by this time , and <name> looked on with great interest as she returned to the tree , and then began slowly walking down the row .
at the <unk> <name> she faced round , and said , 'a pawn goes two squares in its first move , you know .
so you 'll go very quickly through the third square  by railway , i should think  and you 'll find yourself in the fourth square in no time .
well , that square belongs to tweedledum and tweedledee  the fifth is mostly water  the sixth belongs to humpty dumpty  but you make no remark ? '
'i  i did n't know i had to make one  just then , ' <name> faltered out .
'you should have said , " it 's extremely kind of you to tell me all this "  however , we 'll suppose it said  the seventh square is all forest  however , one of the knights <name> show you the way  and in the eighth square we shall be queens together , and it 's all feasting and fun ! '
<name> got up and <unk> , and sat down again .
at the next <name> the <name> turned again , and this time she said , 'speak in french when you ca n't think of the english for a thing  turn out your toes as you walk  and remember who you are ! '
she did not wait for <name> to curtsey this time , but walked on quickly to the next <name> , where she turned for a moment to say 'good-bye , ' and then hurried on to the last .
how it happened , <name> never knew , but exactly as she came to the last <name> , she was gone .
whether she vanished into the air , or whether she ran quickly into the wood ( 'and she can run very fast ! '
thought <name> ) , there was no way of guessing , but she was gone , and <name> began to remember that she was a pawn , and that it would soon be time for her to move .
chapter iii .
looking-glass insects of course the first thing to do was to make a grand survey of the country she was going to travel through .
'it 's something very like learning geography , ' thought <name> , as she stood on tiptoe in hopes of being able to see a little further .
<unk> rivers  there are none .
principal mountains  i 'm on the only one , but i do n't think it 's got any name .
principal towns  why , what are those creatures , making <name> down there ?
they ca n't be bees  nobody ever saw bees a mile off , you know  ' and for some time she stood silent , watching one of them that was bustling about among the flowers , poking its proboscis into them , 'just as if it was a regular <name> , ' thought <name> .
however , this was anything but a regular <name> : in fact it was an elephant  as <name> soon found out , though the idea quite took her breath away at first .
'and what enormous flowers they must be ! '
was her next idea .
<unk> like cottages with the roofs taken off , and stalks put to them  and what quantities of <name> they must make !
i think i 'll go down and  no , i wo n't just yet , ' she went on , checking herself just as she was beginning to run down the hill , and trying to find some excuse for turning shy so suddenly .
'it 'll never do to go down among them without a good long branch to brush them away  and what fun it 'll be when they ask me how i like my walk .
i shall say  " oh , i like it well enough  " ' ( here came the favourite little toss of the head ) , ' " only it was so <name> and hot , and the elephants did tease so ! " '
'i think i 'll go down the other way , ' she said after a pause : 'and perhaps i may visit the elephants later on .
besides , i do so want to get into the third square ! '
so with this excuse she ran down the hill and jumped over the first of the six little <name> .
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * <unk> , please ! '
said the guard , putting his head in at the window .
in a moment everybody was holding out a ticket : they were about the same size as the people , and quite seemed to fill the carriage .
'now then !
show your ticket , child ! '
the guard went on , looking angrily at <name> .
and a great many voices all said together ( 'like the chorus of a song , ' thought <name> ) , 'do n't keep him waiting , child !
why , his time is worth a thousand pounds a minute ! '
'i 'm afraid i have n't got one , ' <name> said in a frightened tone : 'there was n't a <unk> where i came from . '
and again the chorus of voices went on .
'there was n't room for one where she came from .
the land there is worth a thousand pounds an inch ! '
'do n't make excuses , ' said the guard : 'you should have bought one from the <unk> . '
and once more the chorus of voices went on with 'the man that drives the engine .
why , the smoke alone is worth a thousand pounds a puff ! '
<name> thought to herself , 'then there 's no use in speaking . '
the voices did n't join in this time , as she had n't spoken , but to her great surprise , they all thought in chorus ( i <name> you understand what thinking in chorus means  for i must confess that i do n't ) , 'better say nothing at all .
language is worth a thousand pounds a word ! '
'i shall dream about a thousand pounds tonight , i know i shall ! '
thought <name> .
all this time the guard was looking at her , first through a telescope , then through a microscope , and then through an <unk> .
at last he said , 'you 're travelling the wrong way , ' and shut up the window and went away .
'so young a child , ' said the gentleman sitting opposite to her ( he was dressed in white paper ) , <unk> to know which way she 's going , even if she does n't know her own name ! '
a goat , that was sitting next to the gentleman in white , shut his eyes and said in a loud voice , 'she ought to know her way to the <unk> , even if she does n't know her alphabet ! '
there was a beetle sitting next to the goat ( it was a very queer <unk> of passengers altogether ) , and , as the rule seemed to be that they should all speak in turn , he went on with 'she 'll have to go back from here as luggage ! '
<name> could n't see who was sitting beyond the beetle , but a hoarse voice spoke next .
<unk> engines  ' it said , and was obliged to leave off .
'it sounds like a horse , ' <name> thought to herself .
and an extremely small voice , close to her ear , said , 'you might make a joke on that  something about " horse " and " hoarse , " you know . '
then a very gentle voice in the distance said , 'she must be labelled " lass , with care , " you know  ' and after that other voices went on ( 'what a number of people there are in the carriage ! '
thought <name> ) , saying , 'she must go by post , as she's got a head on her  ' 'she must be sent as a message by the telegraph  ' 'she must draw the train herself the rest of the way  ' and so on .
but the gentleman dressed in white paper leaned forwards and whispered in her ear , 'never mind what they all say , my dear , but take a <unk> every time the train stops . '
'indeed i <name> n't ! '
<name> said rather impatiently .
'i do n't belong to this railway journey at all  i was in a wood just now  and i wish i could get back there . '
'you might make a joke on that , ' said the little voice close to her ear : <unk> about " you would if you could , " you know . '
'do n't tease so , ' said <name> , looking about in vain to see where the voice came from ; 'if you 're so anxious to have a joke made , why don't you make one yourself ? '
the little voice sighed deeply : it was very unhappy , evidently , and <name> would have said something pitying to comfort it , 'if it would only sigh like other people ! '
she thought .
but this was such a wonderfully small sigh , that she would n't have heard it at all , if it had n't come quite close to her ear .
the consequence of this was that it tickled her ear very much , and quite took off her thoughts from the unhappiness of the poor little creature .
'i know you are a friend , ' the little voice went on ; 'a dear friend , and an old friend .
and you wo n't hurt me , though i am an insect . '
'what kind of insect ? '
<name> inquired a little anxiously .
what she really wanted to know was , whether it could sting or not , but she thought this would n't be quite a civil question to ask .
'what , then you do n't  ' the little voice began , when it was drowned by a shrill scream from the engine , and everybody jumped up in alarm , <name> among the rest .
the horse , who had put his head out of the window , quietly <name> it in and said , 'it 's only a <name> we have to jump over . '
everybody seemed satisfied with this , though <name> felt a little nervous at the idea of trains jumping at all .
<unk> , it 'll take us into the fourth square , that 's some comfort ! '
she said to herself .
in another moment she felt the carriage rise straight up into the air , and in her fright she caught at the thing nearest to her hand , which happened to be the goat 's beard .
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * but the beard seemed to melt away as she touched it , and she found herself sitting quietly under a tree  while the gnat ( for that was the insect she had been talking to ) was balancing itself on a twig just over her head , and fanning her with its wings .
it certainly was a very large gnat : <unk> the size of a chicken , ' <name> thought .
still , she could n't feel nervous with it , after they had been talking together so <unk> '
 then you do n't like all insects ? '
the gnat went on , as quietly as if nothing had happened .
'i like them when they can talk , ' <name> said .
'none of them ever talk , where i come from . '
'what sort of insects do you rejoice in , where you come from ? '
the gnat inquired .
'i do n't rejoice in insects at all , ' <name> explained , 'because i'm rather afraid of them  at least the large kinds .
but i can tell you the names of some of them . '
'of course they answer to their names ? '
the gnat remarked carelessly .
'i never knew them to do it . '
'what 's the use of their having names , ' the gnat said , 'if they won't answer to them ? '
'no use to them , ' said <name> ; 'but it 's useful to the people who name them , i suppose .
if not , why do things have names at all ? '
'i ca n't say , ' the gnat replied .
<unk> on , in the wood down there , they 've got no names  however , go on with your list of insects : you're wasting time . '
'well , there 's the <unk> , ' <name> began , counting off the names on her fingers .
'all right , ' said the gnat : <unk> way up that bush , you 'll see a <unk> , if you look .
it 's made entirely of wood , and gets about by swinging itself from branch to branch . '
'what does it live on ? '
<name> asked , with great curiosity .
<unk> and sawdust , ' said the gnat .
'go on with the list . '
<name> looked up at the <unk> with great interest , and made up her mind that it must have been just <unk> , it looked so bright and sticky ; and then she went on .
'and there 's the <unk> . '
'look on the branch above your head , ' said the gnat , 'and there you'll find a <unk> .
its body is made of <unk> , its wings of <unk> , and its head is a <unk> burning in <name> . '
'and what does it live on ? '
<unk> and mince pie , ' the gnat replied ; 'and it makes its nest in a christmas box . '
'and then there 's the butterfly , ' <name> went on , after she had taken a good look at the insect with its head on fire , and had thought to herself , 'i wonder if that 's the reason insects are so fond of flying into candles  because they want to turn into <unk> ! '
<unk> at your feet , ' said the gnat ( <name> <name> her feet back in some alarm ) , 'you may observe a <unk> .
its wings are thin slices of bread-and-butter , its body is a crust , and its head is a lump of sugar . '
'and what does it live on ? '
<unk> tea with cream in it . '
a new difficulty came into <name> 's head .
<unk> it could n't find any ? '
she suggested .
'then it would die , of course . '
'but that must happen very often , ' <name> remarked thoughtfully .
'it always happens , ' said the gnat .
after this , <name> was silent for a minute or two , pondering .
the gnat amused itself meanwhile by humming round and round her head : at last it settled again and remarked , 'i suppose you do n't want to lose your name ? '
'no , indeed , ' <name> said , a little anxiously .
'and yet i do n't know , ' the gnat went on in a careless tone : 'only think how convenient it would be if you could manage to go home without it !
for instance , if the governess wanted to call you to your lessons , she would call out " come here  , " and there she would have to leave off , because there would n't be any name for her to call , and of course you would n't have to go , you know . '
'that would never do , i 'm sure , ' said <name> : 'the governess would never think of <unk> me lessons for that .
if she could n't remember my name , she 'd call me " miss ! "
as the servants do . '
'well , if she said " miss , " and did n't say anything more , ' the gnat remarked , 'of course you 'd miss your lessons .
that 's a joke .
i wish you had made it . '
'why do you wish i had made it ? '
<name> asked .
'it 's a very bad one . '
but the gnat only sighed deeply , while two large tears came rolling down its cheeks .
'you should n't make jokes , ' <name> said , 'if it makes you so unhappy . '
then came another of those melancholy little sighs , and this time the poor gnat really seemed to have sighed itself away , for , when <name> looked up , there was nothing whatever to be seen on the twig , and , as she was getting quite chilly with sitting still so long , she got up and walked on .
she very soon came to an open field , with a wood on the other side of it : it looked much darker than the last wood , and <name> felt a little timid about going into it .
however , on second thoughts , she made up her mind to go on : 'for i certainly wo n't go back , ' she thought to herself , and this was the only way to the eighth square .
'this must be the wood , ' she said thoughtfully to herself , 'where things have no names .
i wonder what 'll become of my name when i go in ?
i should n't like to lose it at all  because they 'd have to give me another , and it would be almost certain to be an ugly one .
but then the fun would be trying to find the creature that had got my old name !
that 's just like the advertisements , you know , when people lose dogs  " answers to the name of <unk> : ' had on a brass collar "  just fancy calling everything you met " <name> , " till one of them answered !
only they would n't answer at all , if they were wise . '
she was rambling on in this way when she reached the wood : it looked very cool and shady .
'well , at any rate it 's a great comfort , ' she said as she stepped under the trees , 'after being so hot , to get into the  into what ? '
she went on , rather surprised at not being able to think of the word .
'i mean to get under the  under the  under this , you know ! '
putting her hand on the trunk of the tree .
'what does it call itself , i wonder ?
i do believe it 's got no name  why , to be sure it has n't ! '
she stood silent for a minute , thinking : then she suddenly began again .
'then it really has happened , after all !
and now , who am i ?
i <name> remember , if i can !
i 'm determined to do it ! '
but being determined did n't help much , and all she could say , after a great deal of puzzling , was , <unk> , i know it begins with l ! '
just then a <name> came wandering by : it looked at <name> with its large gentle eyes , but did n't seem at all frightened .
'here then !
here then ! '
<name> said , as she held out her hand and tried to stroke it ; but it only started back a little , and then stood looking at her again .
'what do you call yourself ? '
the <name> said at last .
such a soft sweet voice it had !
'i wish i knew ! '
thought poor <name> .
she answered , rather sadly , 'nothing , just now . '
'think again , ' it said : 'that wo n't do . '
<name> thought , but nothing came of it .
'please , would you tell me what you call yourself ? '
she said timidly .
'i think that might help a little . '
'i 'll tell you , if you 'll move a little further on , ' the <name> said .
'i ca n't remember here . '
so they walked on together though the wood , <name> with her arms clasped lovingly round the soft neck of the <name> , till they came out into another open field , and here the <name> gave a sudden bound into the air , and shook itself free from <name> 's arms .
'i 'm a <name> ! '
it cried out in a voice of delight , 'and , dear me !
you 're a human child ! '
a sudden look of alarm came into its beautiful brown eyes , and in another moment it had darted away at full speed .
<name> stood looking after it , almost ready to cry with vexation at having lost her dear little <unk> so suddenly .
<unk> , i know my name now . '
she said , 'that 's some comfort .
<name>  <name>  i won't forget it again .
and now , which of these <unk> ought i to follow , i wonder ? '
it was not a very difficult question to answer , as there was only one road through the wood , and the two <unk> both pointed along it .
'i 'll settle it , ' <name> said to herself , 'when the road divides and they point different ways . '
but this did not seem likely to happen .
she went on and on , a long way , but wherever the road divided there were sure to be two <unk> pointing the same way , one marked 'to tweedledum 's house ' and the other 'to the house of tweedledee . '
'i do believe , ' said <name> at last , 'that they live in the same house !
i wonder i never thought of that before  but i ca n't stay there long .
i'll just call and say " how d'you do ? "
and ask them the way out of the wood .
if i could only get to the eighth square before it gets dark ! '
so she wandered on , talking to herself as she went , till , on turning a sharp corner , she came upon two fat little men , so suddenly that she could not help starting back , but in another moment she recovered herself , feeling sure that they must be .
chapter iv .
tweedledum and tweedledee they were standing under a tree , each with an arm round the other's neck , and <name> knew which was which in a moment , because one of them had <unk> ' embroidered on his collar , and the other <unk> . '
'i suppose they 've each got " <unk> " round at the back of the collar , ' she said to herself .
they stood so still that she quite forgot they were alive , and she was just looking round to see if the word " <unk> " was written at the back of each collar , when she was startled by a voice coming from the one marked <unk> . '
'if you think we 're <unk> , ' he said , 'you ought to pay , you know .
<unk> were n't made to be looked at for nothing , nohow ! '
<unk> , ' added the one marked <unk> , ' 'if you think we 're alive , you ought to speak . '
'i 'm sure i 'm very sorry , ' was all <name> could say ; for the words of the old song kept ringing through her head like the ticking of a clock , and she could hardly help saying them out loud :  <unk> and tweedledee agreed to have a battle ; for tweedledum said tweedledee had spoiled his nice new rattle .
just then flew down a monstrous crow , as black as a <unk> ; which frightened both the heroes so , they quite forgot their quarrel . '
'i know what you 're thinking about , ' said tweedledum : 'but it is n't so , nohow . '
<unk> , ' continued tweedledee , 'if it was so , it might be ; and if it were so , it would be ; but as it is n't , it ai n't .
that 's logic . '
'i was thinking , ' <name> said very politely , 'which is the best way out of this wood : it 's getting so dark .
would you tell me , please ? '
but the little men only looked at each other and grinned .
they looked so exactly like a couple of great schoolboys , that <name> could n't help pointing her finger at tweedledum , and saying 'first boy ! '
<unk> ! '
tweedledum cried out briskly , and shut his mouth up again with a snap .
'next boy ! '
said <name> , passing on to tweedledee , though she felt quite certain he would only shout out <unk> ! '
and so he did .
'you 've been wrong ! '
cried tweedledum .
'the first thing in a visit is to say " how d 'ye do ? "
and shake hands ! '
and here the two brothers gave each other a hug , and then they held out the two hands that were free , to shake hands with her .
<name> did not like shaking hands with either of them first , for fear of hurting the other one 's feelings ; so , as the best way out of the difficulty , she took hold of both hands at once : the next moment they were dancing round in a ring .
this seemed quite natural ( she remembered afterwards ) , and she was not even surprised to hear music playing : it seemed to come from the tree under which they were dancing , and it was done ( as well as she could make it out ) by the branches rubbing one across the other , like <unk> and <unk> .
'but it certainly was funny , ' ( <name> said afterwards , when she was telling her sister the history of all this , ) 'to find myself singing " here we go round the mulberry bush . "
i do n't know when i began it , but somehow i felt as if i 'd been singing it a long long time ! '
the other two dancers were fat , and very soon out of breath .
<unk> times round is enough for one dance , ' tweedledum panted out , and they left off dancing as suddenly as they had begun : the music stopped at the same moment .
then they let go of <name> 's hands , and stood looking at her for a minute : there was a rather awkward pause , as <name> did n't know how to begin a conversation with people she had just been dancing with .
'it would never do to say " how d 'ye do ? "
now , ' she said to herself : 'we seem to have got beyond that , somehow ! '
'i <name> you 're not much tired ? '
she said at last .
<unk> .
and thank you very much for asking , ' said tweedledum .
'so much obliged ! '
added tweedledee .
'you like poetry ? '
<unk> , pretty well  some poetry , ' <name> said doubtfully .
'would you tell me which road leads out of the wood ? '
'what shall i repeat to her ? '
said tweedledee , looking round at tweedledum with great solemn eyes , and not noticing <name> 's question .
' " the walrus and the carpenter " is the longest , ' tweedledum replied , giving his brother an affectionate hug .
tweedledee began instantly : 'the sun was shining  ' here <name> ventured to interrupt him .
'if it 's very long , ' she said , as politely as she could , 'would you please tell me first which road  ' tweedledee smiled gently , and began again : 'the sun was shining on the sea , shining with all his might : he did his very best to make the billows smooth and bright  and this was odd , because it was the middle of the night .
the moon was shining sulkily , because she thought the sun had got no business to be there after the day was done  " it 's very rude of him , " she said , " to come and spoil the fun ! "
the sea was wet as wet could be , the sands were dry as dry .
you could not see a cloud , because no cloud was in the sky : no birds were flying over head  there were no birds to fly .
the walrus and the carpenter were walking close at hand ; they wept like anything to see such quantities of sand : " if this were only cleared away , " they said , " it would be grand ! "
" if seven maids with seven <unk> swept it for half a year , do you suppose , " the walrus said , " that they could get it clear ? "
" i doubt it , " said the carpenter , and shed a bitter tear .
" o oysters , come and walk with us ! "
the walrus did beseech .
" a pleasant walk , a pleasant talk , along the <unk> beach : we can not do with more than four , to give a hand to each . "
the eldest oyster looked at him .
but never a word he said : the eldest oyster winked his eye , and shook his heavy head  meaning to say he did not choose to leave the <unk> .
but four young oysters hurried up , all eager for the treat : their coats were brushed , their faces washed , their shoes were clean and neat  and this was odd , because , you know , they had n't any feet .
four other oysters followed them , and yet another four ; and thick and fast they came at last , and more , and more , and more  all hopping through the <unk> waves , and scrambling to the shore .
the walrus and the carpenter walked on a mile or so , and then they rested on a rock conveniently low : and all the little oysters stood and waited in a row .
" the time has come , " the walrus said , " to talk of many things : of shoes  and ships  and <unk>  of cabbages  and kings  and why the sea is boiling hot  and whether pigs have wings . "
" but wait a bit , " the oysters cried , " before we have our chat ; for some of us are out of breath , and all of us are fat ! "
" no hurry ! "
said the carpenter .
they thanked him much for that .
" a loaf of bread , " the walrus said , " is what we chiefly need : pepper and vinegar besides are very good indeed  now if you 're ready oysters dear , we can begin to feed . "
" but not on us ! "
the oysters cried , turning a little blue , " after such kindness , that would be a dismal thing to do ! "
" the night is fine , " the walrus said " do you admire the view ?
" it was so kind of you to come !
and you are very nice ! "
the carpenter said nothing but " cut us another slice : i wish you were not quite so deaf  i 've had to ask you twice ! "
" it seems a shame , " the walrus said , " to play them such a trick , after we 've brought them out so far , and made them trot so quick ! "
the carpenter said nothing but " the butter 's spread too thick ! "
" i weep for you , " the walrus said .
" i deeply sympathize . "
with sobs and tears he sorted out those of the largest size .
holding his pocket handkerchief before his streaming eyes .
" o oysters , " said the carpenter .
" you 've had a pleasant run !
shall we be trotting home again ? "
but answer came there none  and that was scarcely odd , because they 'd eaten every one . '
'i like the walrus best , ' said <name> : 'because you see he was a little sorry for the poor oysters . '
'he ate more than the carpenter , though , ' said tweedledee .
'you see he held his handkerchief in front , so that the carpenter could n't count how many he took : <unk> . '
'that was mean ! '
<name> said indignantly .
'then i like the carpenter best  if he did n't eat so many as the walrus . '
'but he ate as many as he could get , ' said tweedledum .
this was a <unk> .
after a pause , <name> began , 'well !
they were both very unpleasant characters  ' here she checked herself in some alarm , at hearing something that sounded to her like the puffing of a large steam-engine in the wood near them , though she feared it was more likely to be a wild beast .
'are there any lions or tigers about here ? '
she asked timidly .
'it 's only the red king snoring , ' said tweedledee .
'come and look at him ! '
the brothers cried , and they each took one of <name> 's hands , and led her up to where the king was sleeping .
'is n't he a lovely sight ? '
said tweedledum .
<name> could n't say honestly that he was .
he had a tall red <unk> on , with a <unk> , and he was lying crumpled up into a sort of untidy heap , and snoring loud  <unk> to snore his head off ! '
as tweedledum remarked .
'i 'm afraid he 'll catch cold with lying on the damp grass , ' said <name> , who was a very thoughtful little girl .
'he 's dreaming now , ' said tweedledee : 'and what do you think he's dreaming about ? '
<name> said <unk> can guess that . '
'why , about you ! '
tweedledee exclaimed , clapping his hands triumphantly .
'and if he left off dreaming about you , where do you suppose you 'd be ? '
'where i am now , of course , ' said <name> .
'not you ! '
tweedledee retorted contemptuously .
'you 'd be nowhere .
why , you 're only a sort of thing in his dream ! '
'if that there king was to wake , ' added tweedledum , 'you 'd go out  bang !  just like a candle ! '
'i should n't ! '
<name> exclaimed indignantly .
<unk> , if i 'm only a sort of thing in his dream , what are you , i should like to know ? '
<unk> ' said tweedledum .
<unk> , ditto ' cried tweedledee .
he shouted this so loud that <name> could n't help saying , <unk> !
you'll be waking him , i 'm afraid , if you make so much noise . '
'well , it no use your talking about waking him , ' said tweedledum , 'when you 're only one of the things in his dream .
you know very well you're not real . '
'i am real ! '
said <name> and began to cry .
'you wo n't make yourself a bit <unk> by crying , ' tweedledee remarked : 'there 's nothing to cry about . '
'if i was n't real , ' <name> said  <unk> through her tears , it all seemed so ridiculous  'i should n't be able to cry . '
'i <name> you do n't suppose those are real tears ? '
tweedledum interrupted in a tone of great contempt .
'i know they 're talking nonsense , ' <name> thought to herself : 'and it's foolish to cry about it . '
so she brushed away her tears , and went on as cheerfully as she could .
'at any rate i 'd better be getting out of the wood , for really it 's coming on very dark .
do you think it 's going to rain ? '
tweedledum spread a large umbrella over himself and his brother , and looked up into it .
'no , i do n't think it is , ' he said : 'at least  not under here .
nohow . '
'but it may rain outside ? '
'it may  if it chooses , ' said tweedledee : 'we 've no objection .
<unk> . '
<unk> things ! '
thought <name> , and she was just going to say <unk> ' and leave them , when tweedledum sprang out from under the umbrella and seized her by the wrist .
'do you see that ? '
he said , in a voice choking with passion , and his eyes grew large and yellow all in a moment , as he pointed with a trembling finger at a small white thing lying under the tree .
'it 's only a rattle , ' <name> said , after a careful examination of the little white thing .
'not a rattlesnake , you know , ' she added hastily , thinking that he was frightened : 'only an old rattle  quite old and broken . '
'i knew it was ! '
cried tweedledum , beginning to stamp about wildly and tear his hair .
'it 's spoilt , of course ! '
here he looked at tweedledee , who immediately sat down on the ground , and tried to hide himself under the umbrella .
<name> laid her hand upon his arm , and said in a soothing tone , 'you need n't be so angry about an old rattle . '
'but it is n't old ! '
tweedledum cried , in a greater fury than ever .
<unk> new , i tell you  i bought it yesterday  my nice new rattle ! '
and his voice rose to a perfect scream .
all this time tweedledee was trying his best to fold up the umbrella , with himself in it : which was such an extraordinary thing to do , that it quite took off <name> 's attention from the angry brother .
but he couldn't quite succeed , and it ended in his rolling over , bundled up in the umbrella , with only his head out : and there he lay , opening and shutting his mouth and his large eyes  <unk> more like a fish than anything else , ' <name> thought .
'of course you agree to have a battle ? '
tweedledum said in a calmer tone .
'i suppose so , ' the other sulkily replied , as he crawled out of the umbrella : 'only she must help us to dress up , you know . '
so the two brothers went off <unk> into the wood , and returned in a minute with their arms full of things  such as <unk> , blankets , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
'i <name> you're a good hand at pinning and tying strings ? '
tweedledum remarked .
'every one of these things has got to go on , somehow or other . '
<name> said afterwards she had never seen such a fuss made about anything in all her life  the way those two bustled about  and the quantity of things they put on  and the trouble they gave her in tying strings and fastening buttons  <unk> they 'll be more like bundles of old clothes than anything else , by the time they 're ready ! '
she said to herself , as she arranged a <unk> round the neck of tweedledee , 'to keep his head from being cut off , ' as he said .
'you know , ' he added very gravely , 'it 's one of the most serious things that can possibly happen to one in a battle  to get one 's head cut off . '
<name> laughed aloud : but she managed to turn it into a cough , for fear of hurting his feelings .
'do i look very pale ? '
said tweedledum , coming up to have his helmet tied on .
( he called it a helmet , though it certainly looked much more like a <unk> . )
'well  yes  a little , ' <name> replied gently .
'i 'm very brave generally , ' he went on in a low voice : 'only to-day i happen to have a headache . '
'and i 've got a toothache ! '
said tweedledee , who had overheard the remark .
'i 'm far worse off than you ! '
'then you 'd better not fight to-day , ' said <name> , thinking it a good opportunity to make peace .
'we must have a bit of a fight , but i do n't care about going on long , ' said tweedledum .
'what 's the time now ? '
tweedledee looked at his watch , and said <unk> four . '
'let 's fight till six , and then have dinner , ' said tweedledum .
'very well , ' the other said , rather sadly : 'and she can watch us  only you 'd better not come very close , ' he added : 'i generally hit everything i can see  when i get really excited . '
'and i hit everything within reach , ' cried tweedledum , <unk> i can see it or not ! '
<name> laughed .
'you must hit the trees pretty often , i should think , ' she said .
tweedledum looked round him with a satisfied smile .
'i do n't suppose , ' he said , 'there 'll be a tree left standing , for ever so far round , by the time we 've finished ! '
'and all about a rattle ! '
said <name> , still hoping to make them a little ashamed of fighting for such a trifle .
'i should n't have minded it so much , ' said tweedledum , 'if it hadn't been a new one . '
'i wish the monstrous crow would come ! '
thought <name> .
'there 's only one sword , you know , ' tweedledum said to his brother : 'but you can have the umbrella  it 's quite as sharp .
only we must begin quick .
it 's getting as dark as it can . '
'and darker , ' said tweedledee .
it was getting dark so suddenly that <name> thought there must be a thunderstorm coming on .
'what a thick black cloud that is ! '
she said .
'and how fast it comes !
why , i do believe it 's got wings ! '
'it 's the crow ! '
tweedledum cried out in a shrill voice of alarm : and the two brothers took to their heels and were out of sight in a moment .
<name> ran a little way into the wood , and stopped under a large tree .
'it can never get at me here , ' she thought : 'it 's far too large to squeeze itself in among the trees .
but i wish it would n't flap its wings so  it makes quite a hurricane in the wood  here 's somebody 's shawl being blown away ! '
chapter v. wool and water she caught the shawl as she spoke , and looked about for the owner : in another moment the white <name> came running wildly through the wood , with both arms stretched out wide , as if she were flying , and <name> very civilly went to meet her with the shawl .
'i 'm very glad i happened to be in the way , ' <name> said , as she helped her to put on her shawl again .
the white <name> only looked at her in a helpless frightened sort of way , and kept repeating something in a whisper to herself that sounded like <unk> , bread-and-butter , ' and <name> felt that if there was to be any conversation at all , she must manage it herself .
so she began rather timidly : 'am i addressing the white <name> ? '
'well , yes , if you call that <unk> , ' the <name> said .
'it is n't my notion of the thing , at all . '
<name> thought it would never do to have an argument at the very beginning of their conversation , so she smiled and said , 'if your majesty <name> only tell me the right way to begin , i 'll do it as well as i can . '
'but i do n't want it done at all ! '
groaned the poor <name> .
'i 've been <unk> myself for the last two hours . '
it would have been all the better , as it seemed to <name> , if she had got some one else to dress her , she was so dreadfully untidy .
'every single thing 's crooked , ' <name> thought to herself , 'and she 's all over pins !  may i put your shawl straight for you ? '
she added aloud .
'i do n't know what 's the matter with it ! '
the <name> said , in a melancholy voice .
'it 's out of temper , i think .
i 've pinned it here , and i 've pinned it there , but there 's no pleasing it ! '
'it ca n't go straight , you know , if you pin it all on one side , ' <name> said , as she gently put it right for her ; 'and , dear me , what a state your hair is in ! '
'the brush has got entangled in it ! '
the <name> said with a sigh .
'and i lost the comb yesterday . '
<name> carefully released the brush , and did her best to get the hair into order .
'come , you look rather better now ! '
she said , after altering most of the pins .
'but really you should have a <name> 's maid ! '
'i 'm sure i 'll take you with pleasure ! '
the <name> said .
<unk> a week , and jam every other day . '
<name> could n't help laughing , as she said , 'i do n't want you to hire me  and i do n't care for jam . '
'it 's very good jam , ' said the <name> .
'well , i do n't want any to-day , at any rate . '
'you could n't have it if you did want it , ' the <name> said .
'the rule is , jam to-morrow and jam yesterday  but never jam to-day . '
'it must come sometimes to " jam to-day , " ' <name> objected .
'no , it ca n't , ' said the <name> .
'it 's jam every other day : to-day isn't any other day , you know . '
'i do n't understand you , ' said <name> .
'it 's dreadfully confusing ! '
'that 's the effect of living backwards , ' the <name> said kindly : 'it always makes one a little giddy at first  ' <unk> backwards ! '
<name> repeated in great astonishment .
'i never heard of such a thing ! '
'  but there 's one great advantage in it , that one 's memory works both ways . '
'i 'm sure mine only works one way , ' <name> remarked .
'i ca n't remember things before they happen . '
'it 's a poor sort of memory that only works backwards , ' the <name> remarked .
'what sort of things do you remember best ? '
<name> ventured to ask .
'oh , things that happened the week after next , ' the <name> replied in a careless tone .
'for instance , now , ' she went on , sticking a large piece of plaster [ <unk> ] on her finger as she spoke , 'there 's the king's messenger .
he 's in prison now , being punished : and the trial doesn't even begin till next wednesday : and of course the crime comes last of all . '
<unk> he never commits the crime ? '
said <name> .
'that would be all the better , would n't it ? '
the <name> said , as she bound the plaster round her finger with a bit of ribbon .
<name> felt there was no denying that .
'of course it would be all the better , ' she said : 'but it would n't be all the better his being punished . '
'you 're wrong there , at any rate , ' said the <name> : 'were you ever punished ? '
'only for faults , ' said <name> .
'and you were all the better for it , i know ! '
the <name> said triumphantly .
'yes , but then i had done the things i was punished for , ' said <name> : 'that makes all the difference . '
'but if you had n't done them , ' the <name> said , 'that would have been better still ; better , and better , and better ! '
her voice went higher with each 'better , ' till it got quite to a squeak at last .
<name> was just beginning to say 'there 's a mistake somewhere  , ' when the <name> began screaming so loud that she had to leave the sentence unfinished .
'oh , oh , oh ! '
shouted the <name> , shaking her hand about as if she wanted to shake it off .
'my finger 's bleeding !
oh , oh , oh , oh ! '
her screams were so exactly like the whistle of a steam-engine , that <name> had to hold both her hands over her ears .
'what is the matter ? '
she said , as soon as there was a chance of making herself heard .
'have you pricked your finger ? '
'i have n't pricked it yet , ' the <name> said , 'but i soon shall  oh , oh , oh ! '
'when do you expect to do it ? '
<name> asked , feeling very much inclined to laugh .
'when i fasten my shawl again , ' the poor <name> groaned out : 'the brooch <name> come undone directly .
oh , oh ! '
as she said the words the brooch flew open , and the <name> clutched wildly at it , and tried to clasp it again .
'take care ! '
cried <name> .
'you 're holding it all crooked ! '
and she caught at the brooch ; but it was too late : the pin had slipped , and the <name> had pricked her finger .
'that accounts for the bleeding , you see , ' she said to <name> with a smile .
'now you understand the way things happen here . '
'but why do n't you scream now ? '
<name> asked , holding her hands ready to put over her ears again .
'why , i 've done all the screaming already , ' said the <name> .
'what would be the good of having it all over again ? '
by this time it was getting light .
'the crow must have flown away , i think , ' said <name> : 'i 'm so glad it 's gone .
i thought it was the night coming on . '
'i wish i could manage to be glad ! '
the <name> said .
'only i never can remember the rule .
you must be very happy , living in this wood , and being glad whenever you like ! '
'only it is so very lonely here ! '
<name> said in a melancholy voice ; and at the thought of her loneliness two large tears came rolling down her cheeks .
'oh , do n't go on like that ! '
cried the poor <name> , wringing her hands in despair .
<unk> what a great girl you are .
consider what a long way you 've come to-day .
consider what o'clock it is .
consider anything , only do n't cry ! '
<name> could not help laughing at this , even in the midst of her tears .
'can you keep from crying by considering things ? '
she asked .
'that 's the way it 's done , ' the <name> said with great decision : <unk> can do two things at once , you know .
let 's consider your age to begin with  how old are you ? '
'i 'm seven and a half exactly . '
'you need n't say " <unk> , " ' the <name> remarked : 'i can believe it without that .
now i 'll give you something to believe .
i 'm just one hundred and one , five months and a day . '
'i ca n't believe that ! '
said <name> .
'ca n't you ? '
the <name> said in a pitying tone .
<unk> again : draw a long breath , and shut your eyes . '
<name> laughed .
'there 's no use trying , ' she said : 'one ca n't believe impossible things . '
'i daresay you have n't had much practice , ' said the <name> .
'when i was your age , i always did it for half-an-hour a day .
why , sometimes i've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast .
there goes the shawl again ! '
the brooch had come undone as she spoke , and a sudden gust of wind blew the <name> 's shawl across a little <name> .
the <name> spread out her arms again , and went flying after it , and this time she succeeded in catching it for herself .
'i 've got it ! '
she cried in a triumphant tone .
'now you shall see me pin it on again , all by myself ! '
'then i <name> your finger is better now ? '
<name> said very politely , as she crossed the little <name> after the <name> .
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 'oh , much better ! '
cried the <name> , her voice rising to a squeak as she went on .
<unk> <unk> !
<unk> !
<unk> !
<unk> ! '
the last word ended in a long <unk> , so like a sheep that <name> quite started .
she looked at the <name> , who seemed to have suddenly wrapped herself up in wool .
<name> rubbed her eyes , and looked again .
she could n't make out what had happened at all .
was she in a shop ?
and was that really  was it really a sheep that was sitting on the other side of the counter ?
rub as she could , she could make nothing more of it : she was in a little dark shop , leaning with her elbows on the counter , and opposite to her was an old sheep , sitting in an arm-chair knitting , and every now and then leaving off to look at her through a great pair of spectacles .
'what is it you want to buy ? '
the sheep said at last , looking up for a moment from her knitting .
'i do n't quite know yet , ' <name> said , very gently .
'i should like to look all round me first , if i might . '
'you may look in front of you , and on both sides , if you like , ' said the sheep : 'but you ca n't look all round you  unless you 've got eyes at the back of your head . '
but these , as it happened , <name> had not got : so she contented herself with turning round , looking at the shelves as she came to them .
the shop seemed to be full of all manner of curious things  but the <unk> part of it all was , that whenever she looked hard at any shelf , to make out exactly what it had on it , that particular shelf was always quite empty : though the others round it were crowded as full as they could hold .
<unk> flow about so here ! '
she said at last in a plaintive tone , after she had spent a minute or so in vainly pursuing a large bright thing , that looked sometimes like a doll and sometimes like a <unk> , and was always in the shelf next above the one she was looking at .
'and this one is the most provoking of all  but i 'll tell you what  ' she added , as a sudden thought struck her , 'i 'll follow it up to the very top shelf of all .
it 'll puzzle it to go through the ceiling , i expect ! '
but even this plan failed : the <unk> ' went through the ceiling as quietly as possible , as if it were quite used to it .
'are you a child or a <unk> ? '
the sheep said , as she took up another pair of needles .
'you 'll make me giddy soon , if you go on turning round like that . '
she was now working with fourteen pairs at once , and <name> could n't help looking at her in great astonishment .
'how can she knit with so many ? '
the puzzled child thought to herself .
'she gets more and more like a porcupine every minute ! '
'can you row ? '
the sheep asked , handing her a pair of <unk> as she spoke .
'yes , a little  but not on land  and not with needles  ' <name> was beginning to say , when suddenly the needles turned into oars in her hands , and she found they were in a little boat , gliding along between banks : so there was nothing for it but to do her best .
<unk> ! '
cried the sheep , as she took up another pair of needles .
this did n't sound like a remark that needed any answer , so <name> said nothing , but pulled away .
there was something very queer about the water , she thought , as every now and then the oars got fast in it , and would hardly come out again .
<unk> !
feather ! '
the sheep cried again , taking more needles .
<unk> be catching a crab directly . '
'a dear little crab ! '
thought <name> .
'i should like that . '
'did n't you hear me say " feather " ? '
the sheep cried angrily , taking up quite a bunch of needles .
'indeed i did , ' said <name> : 'you 've said it very often  and very loud .
please , where are the crabs ? '
'in the water , of course ! '
said the sheep , sticking some of the needles into her hair , as her hands were full .
<unk> , i say ! '
'why do you say " feather " so often ? '
<name> asked at last , rather vexed .
'i 'm not a bird ! '
'you are , ' said the sheep : 'you 're a little goose . '
this offended <name> a little , so there was no more conversation for a minute or two , while the boat glided gently on , sometimes among beds of weeds ( which made the oars stick fast in the water , worse then ever ) , and sometimes under trees , but always with the same tall <unk> frowning over their heads .
'oh , please !
there are some scented rushes ! '
<name> cried in a sudden transport of delight .
'there really are  and such beauties ! '
'you need n't say " please " to me about 'em , ' the sheep said , without looking up from her knitting : 'i did n't put 'em there , and i 'm not going to take 'em away . '
'no , but i meant  please , may we wait and pick some ? '
<name> pleaded .
'if you do n't mind stopping the boat for a minute . '
'how am i to stop it ? '
said the sheep .
'if you leave off rowing , <unk> stop of itself . '
so the boat was left to drift down the stream as it would , till it glided gently in among the waving rushes .
and then the little sleeves were carefully rolled up , and the little arms were plunged in <unk> to get the rushes a good long way down before breaking them off  and for a while <name> forgot all about the sheep and the knitting , as she bent over the side of the boat , with just the ends of her tangled hair dipping into the water  while with bright eager eyes she caught at one bunch after another of the darling scented rushes .
'i only <name> the boat wo n't <unk> over ! '
she said to herself .
'oh , what a lovely one !
only i could n't quite reach it . '
'and it certainly did seem a little provoking ( <unk> as if it happened on purpose , ' she thought ) that , though she managed to pick plenty of beautiful rushes as the boat glided by , there was always a more lovely one that she couldn't reach .
'the prettiest are always further ! '
she said at last , with a sigh at the obstinacy of the rushes in growing so far off , as , with flushed cheeks and dripping hair and hands , she scrambled back into her place , and began to arrange her new-found treasures .
what mattered it to her just then that the rushes had begun to fade , and to lose all their scent and beauty , from the very moment that she picked them ?
even real scented rushes , you know , last only a very little while  and these , being <unk> , melted away almost like snow , as they lay in heaps at her feet  but <name> hardly noticed this , there were so many other curious things to think about .
they had n't gone much farther before the blade of one of the oars got fast in the water and would n't come out again ( so <name> explained it afterwards ) , and the consequence was that the handle of it caught her under the <name> , and , in spite of a series of little shrieks of 'oh , oh , oh ! '
from poor <name> , it swept her straight off the seat , and down among the heap of rushes .
however , she was n't hurt , and was soon up again : the sheep went on with her knitting all the while , just as if nothing had happened .
'that was a nice crab you caught ! '
she remarked , as <name> got back into her place , very much relieved to find herself still in the boat .
'was it ?
i did n't see it , ' said <name> , peeping cautiously over the side of the boat into the dark water .
'i wish it had n't let go  i should so like to see a little crab to take home with me ! '
but the sheep only laughed scornfully , and went on with her knitting .
'are there many crabs here ? '
said <name> .
<unk> , and all sorts of things , ' said the sheep : <unk> of choice , only make up your mind .
now , what do you want to buy ? '
'to buy ! '
<name> echoed in a tone that was half astonished and half frightened  for the oars , and the boat , and the river , had vanished all in a moment , and she was back again in the little dark shop .
'i should like to buy an egg , please , ' she said timidly .
'how do you sell them ? '
<unk> farthing for one  twopence for two , ' the sheep replied .
'then two are cheaper than one ? '
<name> said in a surprised tone , taking out her purse .
'only you must eat them both , if you buy two , ' said the sheep .
'then i 'll have one , please , ' said <name> , as she put the money down on the counter .
for she thought to herself , 'they might n't be at all nice , you know . '
the sheep took the money , and put it away in a box : then she said 'i never put things into people 's hands  that would never do  you must get it for yourself . '
and so saying , she went off to the other end of the shop , and set the egg upright on a shelf .
'i wonder why it would n't do ? '
thought <name> , as she groped her way among the tables and chairs , for the shop was very dark towards the end .
'the egg seems to get further away the more i walk towards it .
let me see , is this a chair ?
why , it 's got branches , i declare !
how very odd to find trees growing here !
and actually here 's a little <name> !
well , this is the very queerest shop i ever saw ! '
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * so she went on , wondering more and more at every step , as everything turned into a tree the moment she came up to it , and she quite expected the egg to do the same .
chapter <name> .
humpty dumpty however , the egg only got larger and larger , and more and more human : when she had come within a few yards of it , she saw that it had eyes and a nose and mouth ; and when she had come close to it , she saw clearly that it was humpty dumpty himself .
'it ca n't be anybody else ! '
she said to herself .
'i 'm as certain of it , as if his name were written all over his face . '
it might have been written a hundred times , easily , on that enormous face .
humpty dumpty was sitting with his legs crossed , like a turk , on the top of a high wall  such a narrow one that <name> quite wondered how he could keep his balance  and , as his eyes were steadily fixed in the opposite direction , and he did n't take the least notice of her , she thought he must be a stuffed figure after all .
'and how exactly like an egg he is ! '
she said aloud , standing with her hands ready to catch him , for she was every moment expecting him to fall .
'it 's very provoking , ' humpty dumpty said after a long silence , looking away from <name> as he spoke , 'to be called an egg  very ! '
'i said you looked like an egg , sir , ' <name> gently explained .
'and some eggs are very pretty , you know ' she added , hoping to turn her remark into a sort of a compliment .
'some people , ' said humpty dumpty , looking away from her as usual , 'have no more sense than a baby ! '
<name> did n't know what to say to this : it was n't at all like conversation , she thought , as he never said anything to her ; in fact , his last remark was evidently addressed to a tree  so she stood and softly repeated to herself :  <unk> dumpty sat on a wall : humpty dumpty had a great fall .
all the king 's horses and all the king 's men could n't put humpty dumpty in his place again . '
'that last line is much too long for the poetry , ' she added , almost out loud , forgetting that humpty dumpty would hear her .
