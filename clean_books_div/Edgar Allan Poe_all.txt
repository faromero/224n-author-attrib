the complete poetical works of <name> <name> poe by <name> h. <unk> preface .
in placing before the public this collection of <name> poe 's poetical works , it is requisite to point out in what respects it differs from , and is superior to , the numerous collections which have preceded it .
until recently , all editions , whether american or english , of <unk> poems have been <unk> ' <unk> of the first <unk> collection , published at new york in 1850 .
in 1874 i began drawing attention to the fact that unknown and <unk> poetry by <name> poe was in existence .
most , if not all , of the specimens issued in my articles have since been reprinted by different editors and publishers , but the present is the first occasion on which all the pieces referred to have been garnered into one sheaf .
besides the poems thus alluded to , this volume <name> be found to contain many additional pieces and extra stanzas , nowhere else published or included in poe 's works .
such verses have been gathered from printed or manuscript sources during a research extending over many years .
in addition to the new poetical matter included in this volume , attention should , also , be <unk> on behalf of the notes , which <name> be found to contain much matter , interesting both from biographical and <unk> points of view .

during the last few years every incident in the life of <name> poe has been subjected to microscopic investigation .
the result has not been altogether satisfactory .
on the one hand , envy and prejudice have magnified every blemish of his character into crime , whilst on the other , blind admiration would <unk> him as far " too good for human nature 's daily food . "
let us endeavor to judge him impartially , granting that he was as a mortal subject to the ordinary weaknesses of mortality , but that he was tempted sorely , treated badly , and suffered deeply .
the poet 's ancestry and parentage are chiefly interesting as explaining some of the <unk> of his character .
his father , <name> poe , was of <unk> extraction .
educated for the bar , he elected to abandon it for the stage .
in one of his tours through the chief towns of the united states he met and married a young actress , <name> <name> , member of an english family distinguished for its musical talents .
as an actress , <name> poe acquired some reputation , but became even better known for her domestic virtues .
in those days the united states afforded little scope for dramatic energy , so it is not surprising to find that when her husband died , after a few years of married life , the young widow had a vain struggle to maintain herself and three little ones , <name> <name> , <name> , and <name> .
before her premature death , in december , 1811 , the poet 's mother had been reduced to the dire necessity of living on the <name> of her neighbors .
<name> , the second child of <name> and <name> poe , was born at boston , in the united states , on the 19th of <name> , 1809 .
upon his mother's death at richmond , <name> , <name> was adopted by a wealthy scotch merchant , <name> <name> .
mr. <name> , who had married an american <name> and settled in <name> , was childless .
he therefore took naturally to the brilliant and beautiful little boy , treated him as his son , and made him take his own <unk> .
<name> <name> , as he was now styled , after some elementary tuition in richmond , was taken to england by his adopted parents , and , in <unk> , placed at the manor house school , <unk> .
under the rev .
dr. <unk> , the future poet spent a <unk> of his life neither <unk> nor , apparently , <unk> .
dr. <unk> , who is himself so quaintly portrayed in poe 's tale of <unk> <name> ' , described " <name> <name> , " by which name only he knew the lad , as " a quick and clever boy , " who " would have been a very good boy had he not been spoilt by his parents , " meaning , of course , the <unk> .
they " allowed him an extravagant amount of <unk> , which enabled him to get into all manner of mischief .
still i liked the boy , " added the tutor , " but , poor fellow , his parents spoiled him . "
poe has described some aspects of his school days in his oft cited story of <unk> <name> ' .
probably there is the usual amount of poetic exaggeration in these reminiscences , but they are almost the only record we have of that portion of his career and , therefore , apart from their literary merits , are on that account deeply interesting .
the description of the sleepy old london suburb , as it was in those days , is remarkably accurate , but the <unk> which the story of <unk> <name> ' went through before it reached its present perfect state caused many of the author 's details to deviate widely from their original correctness .
his schoolhouse in the earliest draft was truthfully described as an " old , irregular , and <unk> " dwelling , and so it remained until its destruction a few years ago .
the <unk> ' <name> <name> , referring to those bygone happy days spent in the english academy , says , " the teeming <name> of childhood requires no external world of incident to occupy or amuse it .
the morning 's awakening , the nightly summons to bed ; the <unk> , the recitations , the periodical <unk> and <unk> , the playground , with its <unk> , its <unk> , its intrigues  these , by a mental sorcery long forgotten , were made to involve a wilderness of sensation , a world of <name> incident , a universe of varied emotion , of excitement the most passionate and <unk> , 'oh , <name> bon <unk> , que ce <unk> de fer !
' "  from this world of boyish imagination poe was called to his adopted parents ' home in the united states .
he returned to <name> in 1821 , and was speedily placed in an academy in richmond , <name> , in which city the <unk> continued to reside .
already well grounded in the elementary processes of education , not without reputation on account of his european residence , handsome , proud , and regarded as the heir of a wealthy man , poe must have been looked up to with no little respect by his fellow pupils .
he speedily made himself a prominent position in the school , not only by his classical attainments , but by his athletic feats  accomplishments calculated to render him a leader among lads .
" in the simple school athletics of those days , when a gymnasium had not been heard of , he was <unk> <unk> ' , " is the reminiscence of his fellow pupil , colonel t. l. <name> .
poe he remembers as " a swift runner , a wonderful <unk> , and , what was more rare , a boxer , with some slight training ... .
he would allow the strongest boy in the school to strike him with full force in the chest .
he taught me the secret , and i imitated him , after my measure .
it was to <unk> the lungs to the uttermost , and at the moment of receiving the blow to <unk> the air .
it looked surprising , and was , indeed , a little rough ; but with a good <unk> , and some resolution , it was not difficult to stand it .
for swimming he was noted , being in many of his athletic <unk> surprisingly like <name> in his youth . "
in one of his feats poe only came off second best .
" a challenge to a foot race , " says colonel <name> , " had been passed between the two classical schools of the city ; we selected poe as our champion .
the race came off one bright may morning at sunrise , in the capitol square .
historical truth compels me to add that on this occasion our school was beaten , and we had to pay up our small bets .
poe ran well , but his competitor was a long-legged , <unk> fellow , who would have <unk> <unk> without the help of the golden apples . "
" in our latin exercises in school , " continues the colonel , " poe was among the first  not first without dispute .
we had competitors who fairly disputed the palm , especially one , nat <name> , afterwards known as one of the <unk> scholars in <name> , and distinguished also as a profound lawyer .
if <name> was less brilliant than poe , he was far more studious ; for even then the germs of <unk> were developing in the nascent poet , and even then no inconsiderable portion of his time was given to <unk> .
but if i put <name> as a <unk> on a level with poe , i do him full justice . "
" poe , " says the colonel , " was very fond of the odes of <name> , and repeated them so often in my hearing that i learned by sound the words of many before i understood their meaning .
in the <unk> rhythm of the <unk> and <unk> , his ear , as yet <unk> in more complicated harmonies , took special delight .
two odes , in particular , have been humming in my ear all my life since , set to the tune of his recitation : <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> pater , et <unk> , ' and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> ,  ' etc .
" i remember that poe was also a very fine french scholar .
yet , with all his <unk> , he was not the master spirit nor even the favorite of the school .
i assign , from my recollection , this place to <name> .
poe , as i recall my impressions now , was <unk> , capricious , inclined to be imperious , and , though of generous impulses , not steadily kind , nor even amiable ; and so what he would exact was refused to him .
i add another thing which had its influence , i am sure .
at the time of which i speak , richmond was one of the most aristocratic cities on this side of the atlantic ... . a school is , of its nature , democratic ; but still boys <name> unconsciously bear about the odor of their fathers ' notions , good or bad .
of <name> poe , " who had then resumed his parental <unk> , " it was known that his parents had been players , and that he was dependent upon the bounty that is bestowed upon an adopted son .
all this had the effect of making the boys decline his leadership ; and , on looking back on it since , i fancy it gave him a fierceness he would otherwise not have had . "
this last paragraph of colonel <name> 's recollections cast a suggestive light upon the causes which rendered unhappy the lad 's early life and tended to blight his prospective hopes .
although mixing with members of the best families of the province , and naturally endowed with hereditary and native pride ,  <unk> by the indulgence of wealth and the consciousness of intellectual superiority ,  <name> poe was made to feel that his parentage was obscure , and that he himself was dependent upon the <name> and <name> of an alien by blood .
for many lads these things would have had but little meaning , but to one of poe 's proud temperament it must have been a source of constant torment , and all allusions to it gall and <unk> .
and mr. <name> was not the man to <unk> poe from such <unk> fancies : as a rule he was proud of the handsome and talented boy , and indulged him in all that wealth could purchase , but at other times he treated him with <unk> , and made him feel the bitterness of his position .
still poe did maintain his leading position among the scholars at that virginian academy , and several still living have favored us with reminiscences of him .
his feats in swimming to which colonel <name> has alluded , are quite a feature of his youthful career .
colonel mayo records one daring performance in <unk> which is thoroughly characteristic of the lad .
one day in <unk> , when standing on the banks of the <name> river , poe dared his comrade into jumping in , in order to swim to a certain point with him .
after floundering about in the nearly frozen stream for some time , they reached the piles upon which mayo 's bridge was then supported , and there attempted to rest and try to gain the shore by climbing up the log <unk> to the bridge .
upon reaching the bridge , however , they were dismayed to find that its plank flooring <unk> the <unk> by several feet , and that it was impossible to ascend it .
nothing remained for them but to let go their slippery hold and swim back to the shore .
poe reached the bank in an exhausted and benumbed condition , whilst mayo was rescued by a boat just as he was <unk> .
on getting ashore poe was seized with a violent attack of vomiting , and both lads were ill for several weeks .
alluding to another quite famous swimming feat of his own , the poet remarked , " any <unk> in the falls ' in my days would have swum the hellespont , and thought nothing of the matter .
i swam from <unk> wharf to warwick ( six miles ) , in a hot <name> sun , against one of the strongest tides ever known in the river .
it would have been a feat comparatively easy to swim twenty miles in still water .
i would not think much , " poe added in a strain of exaggeration not unusual with him , " of attempting to swim the british channel from dover to calais . "
colonel mayo , who had tried to accompany him in this performance , had to stop on the way , and says that poe , when he reached the goal , emerged from the water with neck , face , and back blistered .
the facts of this feat , which was undertaken for a wager , having been questioned , poe , ever <unk> of contradiction , obtained and published the <unk> of several gentlemen who had witnessed it .
they also certified that poe did not seem at all fatigued , and that he walked back to richmond immediately after the performance .
the poet is generally remembered at this part of his career to have been slight in figure and person , but to have been well made , active , <unk> , and graceful .
despite the fact that he was thus noted among his <unk> and indulged at home , he does not appear to have been in sympathy with his surroundings .
already <unk> with the " hate of hate , the scorn of scorn , " he appears to have made foes both among those who envied him and those whom , in the pride of <unk> , he treated with pugnacious contempt .
beneath the haughty exterior , however , was a warm and passionate heart , which only needed circumstance to call forth an almost <unk> intensity of affection .
a <unk> instance of this is thus related by mrs. <unk> : " while at the academy in richmond , he one day accompanied a schoolmate to his home , where he saw , for the first time , mrs. <name> <unk> , the mother of his young friend .
this <name> , on entering the room , took his hands and spoke some gentle and gracious words of welcome , which so penetrated the sensitive heart of the orphan boy as to deprive him of the power of speech , and for a time almost of consciousness itself .
he returned home in a dream , with but one thought , one <name> in life  to hear again the sweet and gracious words that had made the desolate world so beautiful to him , and filled his lonely heart with the oppression of a new <name> .
this <name> afterwards became the confidant of all his boyish sorrows , and hers was the one <unk> influence that saved and guided him in the earlier days of his turbulent and passionate youth . "
when <name> was unhappy at home , which , says his aunt , mrs. <unk> , " was very often the case , he went to mrs. <unk> for sympathy , for consolation , and for advice . "
unfortunately , the sad fortune which so frequently thwarted his hopes ended this friendship .
the <name> was overwhelmed by a terrible calamity , and at the period when her guiding voice was most requisite , she fell a prey to mental <unk> .
she died , and was entombed in a neighboring cemetery , but her poor boyish admirer could not endure to think of her lying lonely and forsaken in her vaulted home , so he would leave the house at night and visit her tomb .
when the nights were drear , " when the autumnal rains fell , and the winds wailed mournfully over the graves , he lingered longest , and came away most regretfully . "
the memory of this <name> , of this " one idolatrous and purely ideal love " of his boyhood , was cherished to the last .
the name of <name> frequently <unk> in his youthful verses , " the <unk> , " now first included in his poetical works , refers to her ; and to her he inscribed the classic and exquisitely beautiful stanzas beginning " <name> , thy beauty is to me . "
another important item to be noted in this epoch of his life is that he was already a poet .
among his <unk> he appears to have acquired some little reputation as a writer of <unk> verses ; but of his poetry , of that which , as he declared , had been with him " not a purpose , but a passion , " he probably preserved the secret , especially as we know that at his <unk> home <unk> was a forbidden thing .
as early as 1821 he appears to have essayed various pieces , and some of these were ultimately included in his first volume .
with poe poetry was a personal matter  a channel through which the turbulent passions of his heart found an outlet .
with feelings such as were his , it came to pass , as a matter of course , that the youthful poet fell in love .
his first affair of the heart is , doubtless , <unk> portrayed in what he says of his boyish ideal , <name> .
this passion , he remarks , " if passion it can properly be called , was of the most thoroughly romantic , shadowy , and imaginative character .
it was born of the hour , and of the youthful necessity to love .
it had no peculiar regard to the person , or to the character , or to the <unk> affection ... any maiden , not immediately and positively repulsive , " he <unk> would have suited the occasion of frequent and <unk> intercourse with such an imaginative and poetic youth .
" the result , " he <unk> , " was not merely natural , or merely probable ; it was as inevitable as <name> itself . "
between the lines may be read the history of his own love .
" the <unk> of his dreams  the <name> aphrodite that sprang in full and <unk> loveliness from the bright foam upon the <unk> ocean of his thoughts , " was a little girl , <name> <unk> , who lived with her father in a house opposite to the <unk> in richmond .
the young people met again and again , and the <name> , who has only recently passed away , recalled <name> as " a beautiful boy , " passionately fond of music , enthusiastic and impulsive , but with prejudices already strongly developed .
a certain amount of <unk> took place between the young people , and poe , with his usual passionate energy , ere he left home for the university had persuaded his fair <unk> to engage herself to him .
poe left home for the university of <name> , <unk> , in the beginning of <unk> lie wrote frequently to miss <unk> , but her father did not approve of the affair , and , so the story runs , intercepted the correspondence , until it ceased .
at seventeen , <name> became the bride of a mr. <name> , and it was not until some time afterwards that poe discovered how it was his passionate appeals had failed to <unk> any response from the object of his youthful affection .
poe 's short university career was in many respects a repetition of his course at the richmond academy .
he became noted at <unk> both for his athletic feats and his <unk> successes .
he entered as a student on february <unk> , and remained till the close of the second session in december of that year .
" he entered the schools of ancient and modern languages , attending the lectures on latin , greek , french , spanish , and italian .
i was a member of the last three classes , " says mr. <name> <unk> , the recently deceased librarian , " and can testify that he was tolerably regular in his attendance , and a successful student , having obtained distinction at the final examination in latin and french , and this was at that time the highest honor a student could obtain .
the present regulations in regard to degrees had not then been adopted .
under existing regulations , he would have graduated in the two languages above-named , and have been entitled to <unk> . "
these statements of poe 's <unk> are confirmed by dr. <name> , chairman of the faculty , who remarks that the poet was a great favorite with his <unk> , and was noted for the remarkable rapidity with which he prepared his recitations and for their accuracy , his translations from the modern languages being especially noteworthy .
several of poe 's classmates at <unk> have testified to his " <name> qualities " and other good endowments , but they remember that his " disposition was rather retiring , and that he had few intimate associates . "
mr. <name> boiling , one of his <unk> who has favored us with reminiscences of him , says : " i was <unk> ' , with him , but that is about all .
my impression was , and is , that no one could say that he <unk> ' him .
he wore a melancholy face always , and even his smile  for i do not ever remember to have seen him laugh  seemed to be forced .
when he engaged sometimes with others in athletic exercises , in which , so far as high or long jumping , i believe he excelled all the rest , poe , with the same ever sad face , appeared to participate in what was amusement to the others more as a task than sport . "
poe had no little talent for drawing , and mr. <name> <name> states that the walls of his college rooms were covered with his <unk> sketches , whilst mr. boiling mentions , in connection with the poet 's artistic facility , some interesting incidents .
the two young men had purchased copies of a <unk> edition of <name> 's poems , and upon visiting poe a few days after this purchase , mr. <unk> found him engaged in copying one of the engravings with <unk> upon his dormitory ceiling .
he continued to amuse himself in this way from time to time until he had filled all the space in his room with <unk> figures which , it is remembered by those who saw them , were highly ornamental and well executed .
as mr. <unk> talked with his associate , poe would continue to <unk> away with his pencil , as if writing , and when his visitor <unk> remonstrated with him on his want of politeness , he replied that he had been all attention , and proved that he had by suitable comment , assigning as a reason for his apparent want of courtesy that he was trying 'to divide his mind , ' to <name> on a conversation and write sensibly upon a totally different subject at the same time .
mr. <unk> , in his interesting reminiscences of the poet , says : " as librarian i had frequent official intercourse with poe , but it was at or near the close of the session before i met him in the social circle .
after spending an evening together at a private house he invited me , on our return , into his room .
it was a cold night in december , and his fire having gone pretty nearly out , by the aid of some tallow candles , and the fragments of a small table which he broke up for the purpose , he soon <unk> it , and by its comfortable blaze i spent a very pleasant hour with him .
on this occasion he spoke with regret of the large amount of money he had wasted , and of the debts he had contracted during the session .
if my memory be not at fault , he estimated his indebtedness at $ 2,000 and , though they were gaming debts , he was <name> and emphatic in the declaration that he was bound by honor to pay them at the earliest opportunity . "
this appears to have been poe 's last night at the university .
he left it never to return , yet , short as was his sojourn there , he left behind him such honorable memories that his <unk> <unk> ' is now only too proud to <unk> his name among her most respected sons .
poe 's adopted father , however , did not regard his <unk> 's ' <unk> career with equal pleasure : whatever view he may have entertained of the lad 's <unk> successes , he resolutely refused to discharge the gambling debts which , like too many of his classmates , he had incurred .
a violent altercation took place between mr. <name> and the youth , and poe hastily quitted the shelter of home to try and make his way in the world alone .
taking with him such poems as he had ready , poe made his way to boston , and there looked up some of his mother 's old theatrical friends .
whether he thought of adopting the stage as a profession , or whether he thought of getting their assistance towards helping him to put a drama of his own upon the stage ,  that dream of all young authors ,  is now unknown .
he appears to have wandered about for some time , and by some means or the other succeeded in getting a little volume of poems printed " for private circulation only . "
this was towards the end of 1827 , when he was nearing nineteen .
doubtless poe expected to dispose of his volume by subscription among his friends , but copies did not go off , and ultimately the book was suppressed , and the remainder of the edition , for " reasons of a private nature , " destroyed .
what happened to the young poet , and how he contrived to exist for the next year or so , is a mystery still <unk> .
it has always been believed that he found his way to europe and met with some curious adventures there , and poe himself certainly alleged that such was the case .
<name> of <unk> stories have been invented to account for this chasm in the poet 's life , and most of them <unk> fabulous .
in a recent biography of poe an attempt had been made to prove that he enlisted in the army under an assumed name , and served for about eighteen months in the artillery in a highly creditable manner , receiving an honorable discharge at the instance of mr. <name> .
this account is plausible , but <name> need further explanation of its many <unk> of dates , and <unk> of the different documents cited in proof of it , before the public can receive it as fact .
so many fables have been published about poe , and even many fictitious documents quoted , that it <unk> the <unk> to be wary in accepting any new statements concerning him that are not thoroughly authenticated .
on the 28th february , 1829 , mrs. <name> died , and with her death the final thread that had bound poe to her husband was broken .
the adopted son arrived too late to take a last farewell of her whose influence had given the <name> residence its only claim upon the poet 's heart .
a kind of truce was patched up over the grave of the deceased <name> , but , for the future , poe found that home was home no longer .
again the young man turned to poetry , not only as a solace but as a means of earning a livelihood .
again he printed a little volume of poems , which included his longest piece , " <name> aaraaf , " and several others now deemed classic .
the book was a great advance upon his previous collection , but failed to obtain any amount of public praise or personal profit for its author .
feeling the difficulty of living by literature at the same time that he saw he might have to rely largely upon his own exertions for a livelihood , poe expressed a wish to enter the army .
after no little difficulty a <unk> was obtained for him at the west point military academy , a military school in many respects equal to the best in europe for the education of officers for the army .
at the time poe entered the academy it possessed anything but an attractive character , the discipline having been of the most severe character , and the accommodation in many respects unsuitable for growing lads .
the poet appears to have entered upon this new course of life with his usual enthusiasm , and for a time to have borne the rigid rules of the place with unusual steadiness .
he entered the institution on the 1st july , 1830 , and by the following march had been expelled for determined disobedience .
whatever view may be taken of poe 's conduct upon this occasion , it must be seen that the expulsion from west point was of his own seeking .
<unk> pictures have been drawn of his eccentric behavior at the academy , but the fact remains that he wilfully , or at any rate purposely , flung away his <unk> .
it is surmised with plausibility that the second marriage of mr. <name> , and his expressed intention of withdrawing his help and of not <unk> or <unk> this adopted son any of his property , was the <unk> of <unk> action .
believing it impossible to continue without aid in a profession so expensive as was a military life , he determined to relinquish it and return to his long cherished attempt to become an author .
expelled from the institution that afforded board and shelter , and discarded by his former protector , the unfortunate and penniless young man yet a third time attempted to get a start in the world of letters by means of a volume of poetry .
if it be true , as alleged , that several of his brother cadets aided his efforts by <unk> for his little work , there is some possibility that a few dollars rewarded this latest venture .
whatever may have resulted from the alleged aid , it is certain that in a short time after leaving the military academy poe was reduced to sad straits .
he disappeared for nearly two years from public notice , and how he lived during that period has never been satisfactorily explained .
in 1833 he returns to history in the character of a winner of a <unk> award offered by a newspaper for the best story .
the prize was unanimously <unk> to poe by the <unk> , and mr. kennedy , an author of some little repute , having become interested by the young man 's evident genius , generously assisted him towards obtaining a livelihood by literary labor .
through his new <unk> introduction to the proprietor of the <unk> literary messenger ' , a <unk> magazine published at irregular intervals , poe became first a paid <unk> , and eventually the editor of the publication , which ultimately he rendered one of the most respected and profitable periodicals of the day .
this success was entirely due to the brilliancy and power of poe 's own contributions to the magazine .
in march , 1834 , mr. <name> died , and if our poet had maintained any hopes of further assistance from him , all doubt was settled by the <name> , by which the whole property of the deceased was left to his second wife and her three sons .
poe was not named .
on the 6th may , 1836 , poe , who now had nothing but his pen to trust to , married his cousin , <name> <unk> , a child of only fourteen , and with her mother as housekeeper , started a home of his own .
in the meantime his various writings in the <unk> ' began to attract attention and to extend his reputation into literary circles , but beyond his editorial salary of about $ 520 brought him no pecuniary reward .
in <name> , 1837 , for reasons never thoroughly explained , poe severed his connection with the <unk> ' , and moved with all his household goods from richmond to new york .
southern friends state that poe was desirous of either being admitted into partnership with his employer , or of being allowed a larger share of the profits which his own labors procured .
in new york his earnings seem to have been small and irregular , his most important work having been a <unk> from the <unk> ' in book form of his <unk> romance entitled <unk> <name> <unk> ' .
the truthful air of " the narrative , " as well as its other merits , excited public curiosity both in england and <name> ; but <unk> <unk> does not appear to have been proportionate to its success , nor did he receive anything from the numerous european editions the work rapidly passed through .
in 1838 poe was induced by a literary friend to break up his new york home and remove with his wife and aunt ( her mother ) to philadelphia .
the quaker city was at that time quite a <unk> for magazine projects , and among the many new periodicals poe was enabled to earn some kind of a living .
to <name> 's <unk> 's magazine ' for 1837 he had contributed a few articles , but in 1840 he arranged with its proprietor to take up the <unk> .
poe had long sought to start a magazine of his own , and it was probably with a view to such an <unk> that one of his conditions for accepting the <unk> of the <unk> 's <unk> was that his name should appear upon the title-page .
poe worked hard at the <unk> 's ' for some time , contributing to its columns much of his best work ; ultimately , however , he came to <unk> with its proprietor , <name> , who disposed of the magazine to a mr. <name> , a rival publisher .
at this period poe collected into two volumes , and got them published as <unk> of the grotesque and <unk> ' , twenty-five of his stories , but he never received any <unk> , save a few copies of the volumes , for the work .
for some time the poet strove most earnestly to start a magazine of his own , but all his efforts failed owing to his want of capital .
the purchaser of <name> 's magazine , having amalgamated it with another , issued the two under the title of <unk> 's magazine ' .
poe became a <unk> to the new venture , and in november of the year 1840 consented to assume the post of editor .
under poe 's management , assisted by the liberality of mr. <name> , <unk> 's magazine ' became a grand success .
to its pages poe contributed some of his finest and most popular tales , and attracted to the publication the pens of many of the best contemporary authors .
the public was not slow in showing its appreciation of <unk> ' put before it , and , so its directors <unk> , in less than two years the circulation rose from five to fifty-two thousand copies .
a great deal of this success was due to poe 's weird and wonderful stories ; still more , perhaps , to his <unk> <unk> and his startling theories <unk> <unk> .
as regards the tales now issued in <unk> 's ' , attention may especially be drawn to the <unk> " murders in the rue morgue , " the first of a series  ' " une <unk> de <unk> , " ' as <unk> styles them  illustrative of an <unk> phase of poe 's peculiar mind .
this <unk> ' of tales , of which the later two were " the <unk> letter " and " the mystery of <name> <unk> , " was <unk> written to prove the capability of solving the puzzling riddles of life by identifying another person 's mind by our own .
by trying to follow the processes by which a person would reason out a certain thing , poe propounded the theory that another person might ultimately arrive , as it were , at that person 's conclusions , indeed , penetrate the innermost <unk> of his <name> and read his most secret thoughts .
whilst the public was still pondering over the startling proposition , and enjoying perusal of its apparent proofs , poe still further increased his popularity and <name> attention to his works by putting forward the attractive but less dangerous <unk> that " human ingenuity could not construct a cipher which human ingenuity could not solve . "
this <unk> assertion was made in connection with what the public deemed a challenge , and poe was <unk> with <unk> more or less abstruse , demanding solution .
in the correspondence which ensued in <unk> 's magazine ' and other publications , poe was universally acknowledged to have proved his case , so far as his own personal ability to <unk> such mysteries was concerned .
although he had never offered to undertake such a task , he triumphantly solved every <unk> sent to him , with one exception , and that exception he proved conclusively was only an imposture , for which no solution was possible .
the outcome of this exhaustive and unprofitable labor was the fascinating story of " the gold bug , " a story in which the discovery of hidden treasure is brought about by the <unk> of an intricate cipher .
the year 1841 may be deemed the brightest of poe 's checkered career .
on every side acknowledged to be a new and brilliant literary light , chief editor of a powerful magazine , admired , feared , and envied , with a reputation already spreading rapidly in europe as well as in his native continent , the poet might well have hoped for prosperity and happiness .
but dark <unk> were gnawing his heart .
his pecuniary position was still embarrassing .
his writings , which were the result of slow and careful labor , were poorly paid , and his <unk> as joint editor of <unk> 's ' was small .
he was not permitted to have undivided control , and but a slight share of the profits of the magazine he had rendered <unk> , whilst a fearful domestic calamity wrecked all his hopes , and caused him to resort to that refuge of the broken-hearted  to that drink which finally destroyed his prospects and his life .
<name> poe 's own account of this terrible malady and its cause was made towards the end of his career .
its truth has never been <unk> , and in its most important points it has been thoroughly <unk> .
to a correspondent he writes in <name> 1848 : " you say , 'can you hint to me what was " that terrible evil " which caused the " irregularities " so profoundly lamented ? '
yes , i can do more than hint .
this evil was the greatest which can befall a man .
six years ago , a wife whom i loved as no man ever loved before , ruptured a <unk> in singing .
her life was despaired of .
i took leave of her forever , and underwent all the agonies of her death .
she recovered partially , and i again hoped .
at the end of a year , the vessel broke again .
i went through precisely the same scene ... . then again  again  and even once again at varying intervals .
each time i felt all the agonies of her death  and at each accession of the disorder i loved her more dearly and clung to her life with more desperate pertinacity .
but i am <unk> sensitive  nervous in a very unusual degree .
i became insane , with long intervals of horrible sanity .
during these fits of absolute unconsciousness , i drank  god only knows how often or how much .
as a matter of course , my enemies referred the insanity to the drink rather than the drink to the insanity .
i had , indeed , nearly abandoned all <name> of a permanent cure , when i found one in the death of my wife .
this i can and do endure as becomes a man .
it was the horrible <unk> oscillation between <name> and despair which i could not longer have endured , without total loss of reason . "
the poet at this period was residing in a small but elegant little home , superintended by his <unk> guardian , his wife 's mother  his own aunt , mrs. <unk> , the <name> whom he so gratefully addressed in after years in the well-known sonnet , as " more than mother unto me . "
but a change came o'er the spirit of his dream !
his <unk> from <unk> 's ' , owing to we know not what causes , took place , and his fragile schemes of happiness faded as fast as the sunset .
his means melted away , and he became <unk> by mental trouble and <unk> to earn more .
the terrible straits to which he and his unfortunate beloved ones were reduced may be comprehended after perusal of these words from mr. a .
b. <name> 's reminiscences .
referring to the poet 's residence in spring gardens , philadelphia , this writer says : " it was during their stay there that mrs. poe , while singing one evening , ruptured a <unk> , and after that she suffered a hundred deaths .
she could not bear the slightest exposure , and needed the utmost care ; and all those conveniences as to apartment and surroundings which are so important in the case of an invalid were almost matters of life and death to her .
and yet the room where she lay for weeks , hardly able to breathe , except as she was fanned , was a little narrow place , with the ceiling so low over the narrow bed that her head almost touched it .
but no one dared to speak , mr. poe was so sensitive and irritable ; <unk> as steel and flint , ' said one who knew him in those days .
and he would not allow a word about the danger of her dying : the mention of it drove him wild . "
is it to be wondered at , should it not indeed be forgiven him , if , impelled by the anxieties and privations at home , the unfortunate poet , driven to the brink of madness , plunged still deeper into the slough of <unk> ?
unable to provide for the pressing necessities of his beloved wife , the distracted man " would steal out of the house at night , and go off and wander about the street for hours , proud , <unk> , despairing , not knowing which way to turn , or what to do , while mrs. <unk> would endure the anxiety at home as long as she could , and then start off in search of him . "
during his calmer moments poe exerted all his efforts to proceed with his literary labors .
he continued to contribute to <unk> 's magazine , ' the proprietor of which periodical remained his friend to the end of his life , and also to some other leading publications of philadelphia and new york .
a suggestion having been made to him by n. p. <name> , of the latter city , he determined to once more wander back to it , as he found it impossible to live upon his literary earnings where he was .
accordingly , about the middle of 1845 , poe removed to new york , and shortly afterwards was engaged by <name> and his partner <name> as <unk> on the <unk> mirror ' .
he was , says <name> , " employed by us for several months as critic and <unk> ... .
he resided with his wife and mother at fordham , a few miles out of town , but was at his desk in the office from nine in the morning till the evening paper went to press .
with the highest admiration for his genius , and a willingness to let it atone for more than ordinary irregularity , we were led by common report to expect a very capricious attention to his duties , and occasionally a scene of violence and difficulty .
time went on , however , and he was invariably punctual and industrious .
with his pale , beautiful , and intellectual face , as a reminder of what genius was in him , it was impossible , of course , not to treat him always with deferential <unk> ... . with a prospect of taking the lead in another periodical , he at last voluntarily gave up his employment with us . "
a few weeks before poe relinquished his laborious and <unk> work on the <unk> mirror ' , his marvellous poem of " the <name> " was published .
the effect was magical .
never before , nor , indeed , ever since , has a single short poem produced such a great and immediate enthusiasm .
it did more to render its author famous than all his other writings put together .
it made him the literary lion of the season ; called into existence innumerable <unk> ; was translated into various languages , and , indeed , created quite a literature of its own .
poe was naturally delighted with the success his poem had attained , and from time to time read it in his musical manner in public halls or at literary receptions .
nevertheless he affected to regard it as a work of <name> only , and wrote his essay entitled the " philosophy of composition , " to prove that it was merely a mechanical production made in accordance with certain set rules .
although our poet 's reputation was now well established , he found it still a difficult matter to live by his pen .
even when in good health , he wrote slowly and with fastidious care , and when his work was done had great difficulty in getting publishers to accept it .
since his death it has been proved that many months often elapsed before he could get either his most admired poems or tales published .
poe left the <unk> mirror ' in order to take part in the <unk> journal ' , wherein he <unk> from time to time nearly the whole of his prose and poetry .
ultimately he acquired possession of this periodical , but , having no funds to <name> it on , after a few months of <unk> labor he had to relinquish it .
exhausted in body and mind , the unfortunate man now retreated with his dying wife and her mother to a quaint little cottage at fordham , outside new york .
here after a time the unfortunate household was reduced to the utmost need , not even having wherewith to purchase the necessities of life .
at this dire moment , some friendly hand , much to the indignation and dismay of poe himself , made an appeal to the public on behalf of the hapless family .
the appeal had the desired effect .
old friends and new came to the rescue , and , thanks to them , and especially to mrs. shew , the " <name> <name> " of poe 's later poems , his wife 's dying moments were soothed , and the poet 's own immediate wants provided for .
in <name> , 1846 , <name> poe died ; and for some time after her death the poet remained in an <unk> stupor , and , indeed , it may be truly said that never again did his mental faculties appear to regain their former power .
for another year or so poe lived quietly at fordham , guarded by the watchful care of mrs. <unk> ,  writing little , but thinking out his philosophical prose poem of " eureka , " which he deemed the crowning work of his life .
his life was as <unk> and regular as his means were small .
gradually , however , as intercourse with fellow <unk> <unk> his dormant energies , he began to meditate a fresh start in the world .
his old and never thoroughly abandoned project of starting a magazine of his own , for the enunciation of his own views on literature , now absorbed all his thoughts .
in order to get the necessary funds for establishing his publication on a solid footing , he determined to give a series of lectures in various parts of the states .
his <unk> into public life only involved him in a series of misfortunes .
at one time he was engaged to be married to mrs. <unk> , a widow <name> of considerable intellectual and literary attainments ; but , after several incidents of a highly romantic character , the match was broken off .
in 1849 poe <unk> the south , and , amid the scenes and friends of his early life , passed some not altogether <unk> time .
at richmond , <name> , he again met his first love , <name> , now a wealthy widow , and , after a short renewed acquaintance , was once more engaged to marry her .
but misfortune continued to dog his steps .
a publishing affair recalled him to new york .
he left richmond by boat for baltimore , at which city he arrived on the 3d october , and handed his trunk to a <name> to <name> to the train for philadelphia .
what now happened has never been clearly explained .
previous to starting on his journey , poe had complained of <unk> ,  of <unk> and of exhaustion ,  and it is not improbable that an increase or continuance of these symptoms had tempted him to drink , or to resort to some of those <unk> he is known to have indulged in towards the close of his life .
whatever the cause of his delay , the consequences were fatal .
whilst in a state of temporary mania or insensibility , he fell into the hands of a band of ruffians , who were scouring the streets in search of accomplices or victims .
what followed is given on undoubted authority .
his captors carried the unfortunate poet into an <unk> den , where they drugged him with whisky .
it was election day for a member of congress , and poe with other victims , was dragged from <unk> station to station , and forced to vote the ticket placed in his hand .
incredible as it may appear , the superintending officials of those days registered the proffered vote , quite regardless of the condition of the person <unk> a <unk> .
the election over , the dying poet was left in the streets to perish , but , being found ere life was extinct , he was carried to the washington university hospital , where he expired on the 7th of october , 1849 , in the <unk> year of his age .
<name> poe was buried in the family grave of his grandfather , general poe , in the presence of a few friends and relatives .
on the 17th november , 1875 , his remains were removed from their first resting-place and , in the presence of a large number of people , were placed under a marble monument subscribed for by some of his many admirers .
his <unk> body has recently been placed by his side .
the story of that " fitful fever " which constituted the life of <name> poe leaves upon the reader 's mind the conviction that he was , indeed , truly <unk> by that : " unhappy master , whom <unk> disaster followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore  till the <unk> of his <name> that melancholy burden bore of 'never  nevermore . ' "

* * * * * preface .
these trifles are collected and republished chiefly with a view to their redemption from the many improvements to which they have been subjected while going at random the " rounds of the press . "
i am naturally anxious that what i have written should circulate as i wrote it , if it circulate at all .
in defence of my own taste , nevertheless , it is incumbent upon me to say that i think nothing in this volume of much value to the public , or very creditable to myself .
events not to be controlled have prevented me from making , at any time , any serious effort in what , under happier circumstances , would have been the field of my choice .
with me poetry has been not a purpose , but a passion ; and the passions should be held in reverence : they must not  they can not at <name> be excited , with an eye to the paltry compensations , or the more paltry <unk> , of mankind .

* * * * * the <name> .
once upon a midnight dreary , while i pondered , weak and weary , over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten <name>  while i nodded , nearly napping , suddenly there came a tapping , as of some one gently rapping  rapping at my chamber door .
" 't is some visitor , " i muttered , " tapping at my chamber door  only this and nothing more . "
ah , distinctly i remember , it was in the bleak december , and each separate dying <unk> wrought its ghost upon the floor .
eagerly i wished the morrow ;  vainly i had sought to borrow from my books <unk> of sorrow  sorrow for the lost <name>  for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name <name>  nameless here for evermore .
and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled me  filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before ; so that now , to still the beating of my heart , i stood repeating " 't is some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door  some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door ;  this it is and nothing more . "
presently my soul grew stronger ; hesitating then no longer , " sir , " said i , " or madam , truly your forgiveness i implore ; but the fact is i was napping , and so gently you came rapping , and so faintly you came tapping  tapping at my chamber door , that i scarce was sure i heard you "  here i opened wide the door :  darkness there and nothing more .
deep into that darkness peering , long i stood there wondering , fearing , doubting , dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before ; but the silence was unbroken , and the darkness gave no token , and the only word there spoken was the whispered word , " <name> ! "
this i whispered , and an <name> murmured back the word , " <name> ! "
merely this and nothing more .
back into the chamber turning , all my soul within me burning , soon i heard again a tapping , somewhat louder than before .
" surely , " said i , " surely that is something at my window lattice ; let me see , then , what <unk> is , and this mystery explore  let my heart be still a moment , and this mystery explore ;  't is the wind and nothing more . "
open here i flung the shutter , when , with many a flirt and flutter , in there stepped a stately <name> of the saintly days of yore ; not the least obeisance made he : not an instant stopped or stayed he ; but , with mien of lord or <name> , perched above my chamber door  perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door  perched , and sat , and nothing more .
then this <name> bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling , by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore , " though thy crest be shorn and shaven , thou , " i said , " <name> sure no craven , ghastly grim and ancient <name> wandering from the nightly shore  tell me what thy lordly name is on the night 's <unk> shore ! "
quoth the <name> , " nevermore . "
much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly , though its answer little meaning  little relevancy bore ; for we can not help agreeing that no living human being ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door  bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door , with such name as " nevermore . "
but the <name> , sitting lonely on that placid bust , spoke only that one word , as if his soul in that one word he did <unk> .
nothing further then he uttered  not a feather then he fluttered  till i scarcely more than muttered , " other friends have flown before  on the morrow he <name> leave me , as my hopes have flown before . "
then the bird said , " nevermore . "
startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken , " doubtless , " said i , " what it utters is its only stock and store , caught from some unhappy master whom <unk> disaster followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore  till the <unk> of his <name> the melancholy burden bore of 'never  nevermore . ' "
but the <name> still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling , straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door ; then , upon the <name> sinking , i betook myself to linking fancy unto fancy , thinking what this ominous bird of yore  what this grim , ungainly , ghastly , gaunt , and ominous bird of yore meant in croaking " nevermore . "
this i sat engaged in guessing , but no syllable expressing to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom 's core ; this and more i sat <unk> , with my head at ease reclining on the cushion 's <name> lining that the <unk> <unk> o'er , but whose <name> <name> lining with the <unk> <unk> o'er , she shall press , ah , nevermore !
then , methought , the air grew denser , perfumed from an unseen censer swung by <unk> whose <unk> <unk> on the tufted floor .
" wretch , " i cried , " thy god hath lent thee  by these angels he hath sent thee respite  respite <unk> <unk> from thy memories of <name> !
<unk> , oh <unk> this kind <unk> , and forget this lost <name> ! "
quoth the <name> , " nevermore . "
" prophet ! "
said i , " thing of evil !  prophet still , if bird or devil !  whether <unk> sent , or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore , desolate yet all undaunted , on this desert land enchanted  on this home by horror haunted  tell me truly , i implore  is there  is there balm in <unk> ?  tell me  tell me , i implore ! "
quoth the <name> , " nevermore . "
" prophet ! "
said i , " thing of evil !  prophet still , if bird or devil !
by that heaven that bends above us  by that god we both adore  tell this soul with sorrow laden if , within the distant aidenn , it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name <name>  clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name <name> . "
quoth the <name> , " nevermore . "
" be that word our sign of parting , bird or fiend ! "
i shrieked , <unk>  " get thee back into the tempest and the night 's <unk> shore !
leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken !
leave my loneliness unbroken !  quit the bust above my door !
take thy beak from out my heart , and take thy form from off my door ! "
quoth the <name> , " nevermore . "
and the <name> , never flitting , still is sitting , still is sitting on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door ; and his eyes have all the seeming of a demon 's that is dreaming , and the <unk> o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor ; and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted  nevermore !

the skies they were ashen and sober ; the leaves they were <unk> and sere  the leaves they were withering and sere ; it was night in the lonesome october of my most immemorial year ; it was hard by the dim lake of <unk> , in the <name> mid region of weir  it was down by the dank tarn of <unk> , in the <unk> woodland of weir .
here once , through an alley <unk> .
of cypress , i roamed with my soul  of cypress , with psyche , my soul .
these were days when my heart was volcanic as the <unk> rivers that roll  as the lavas that restlessly roll their sulphurous currents down <unk> in the ultimate climes of the pole  that groan as they roll down mount <unk> in the realms of the <unk> pole .
our talk had been serious and sober , but our thoughts they were <unk> and sere  our memories were treacherous and sere  for we knew not the month was october , and we marked not the night of the year  ( ah , night of all nights in the year ! )
we noted not the dim lake of <unk>  ( though once we had journeyed down here )  remembered not the dank tarn of <unk> , nor the <unk> woodland of weir .
and now as the night was <unk> and <unk> pointed to morn  as the <unk> hinted of morn  at the end of our path a <unk> and nebulous lustre was born , out of which a miraculous crescent arose with a duplicate horn  <unk> 's <unk> crescent distinct with its duplicate horn .
and i said  " she is warmer than <name> : she rolls through an ether of sighs  she revels in a region of sighs : she has seen that the tears are not dry on these cheeks , where the worm never dies , and has come past the stars of the lion to point us the path to the skies  to the <unk> peace of the skies  come up , in despite of the lion , to shine on us with her bright eyes  come up through the lair of the lion , with love in her luminous eyes . "
but psyche , uplifting her finger , said  " sadly this <name> i mistrust  her pallor i strangely mistrust :  oh , hasten !  oh , let us not linger !
oh , fly !  let us fly !  for we must . "
in terror she spoke , letting sink her wings till they trailed in the dust  in agony sobbed , letting sink her plumes till they trailed in the dust  till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust .
i replied  " this is nothing but dreaming : let us on by this tremulous light !
let us bathe in this crystalline light !
its <unk> splendor is beaming with <name> and in beauty to-night :  see !  it flickers up the sky through the night !
ah , we safely may trust to its gleaming , and be sure it <name> lead us aright  we safely may trust to a gleaming that can not but guide us aright , since it flickers up to heaven through the night . "
thus i pacified psyche and kissed her , and tempted her out of her gloom  and conquered her scruples and gloom ; and we passed to the end of a vista , but were stopped by the door of a tomb  by the door of a <unk> tomb ; and i said  " what is written , sweet sister , on the door of this <unk> tomb ? "
she replied  " <unk>  <unk>  't is the vault of thy lost <unk> ! "
then my heart it grew ashen and sober as the leaves that were <unk> and sere  as the leaves that were withering and sere ; and i cried  " it was surely october on this very night of last year that i journeyed  i journeyed down here  that i brought a dread burden down here !
on this night of all nights in the year , ah , what demon has tempted me here ?
well i know , now , this dim lake of <unk>  this <name> mid region of weir  well i know , now , this dank tarn of <unk> ,  this <unk> woodland of weir . "

i saw thee once  once only  years ago : i must not say how many  but not many .
it was a july midnight ; and from out a <unk> moon , that , like thine own soul , soaring , sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven , there fell a <unk> veil of light , with <unk> , and <unk> and slumber , upon the <unk> 'd faces of a thousand roses that grew in an enchanted garden , where no wind dared to stir , unless on tiptoe  fell on the <unk> 'd faces of these roses that gave out , in return for the <unk> , their odorous souls in an ecstatic death  fell on the <unk> 'd faces of these roses that smiled and died in this <unk> , enchanted by thee , and by the poetry of thy presence .
clad all in white , upon a <name> bank i saw thee <unk> ; while the moon fell on the <unk> 'd faces of the roses , and on thine own , <unk> 'd  alas , in sorrow !
was it not fate , that , on this july midnight  was it not fate ( whose name is also sorrow ) , that bade me pause before that <unk> , to breathe the incense of those slumbering roses ?
no footstep stirred : the hated world all slept , save only thee and me  ( o heaven !  o god !
how my heart beats in <unk> those two words ! )
 save only thee and me .
i paused  i looked  and in an instant all things disappeared .
( ah , bear in mind this garden was enchanted ! )
the <name> lustre of the moon went out : the mossy banks and the meandering paths , the happy flowers and the <unk> trees , were seen no more : the very roses ' odors died in the arms of the adoring airs .
all  all expired save thee  save less than thou : save only the divine light in thine eyes  save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes .
i saw but them  they were the world to me .
i saw but them  saw only them for hours  saw only them until the moon went down .
what wild <unk> seemed to lie unwritten upon those crystalline , celestial spheres !
how dark a woe !
yet how sublime a <name> !
how silently serene a sea of pride !
how daring an ambition !
yet how deep  how <unk> a capacity for love !
but now , at length , dear <name> sank from sight , into a western couch of <unk> ; and thou , a ghost , amid the <unk> trees didst glide away .
only thine eyes <unk> they would not go  they never yet have gone .
lighting my lonely pathway home that night , they have not left me ( as my hopes have ) since .
they follow me  they lead me through the years .
they are my ministers  yet i their slave .
their office is to <unk> and <unk>  my duty , to be saved by their bright light , and purified in their electric fire , and sanctified in their elysian fire .
they fill my soul with beauty ( which is <name> ) , and are far up in heaven  the stars i kneel to in the sad , silent watches of my night ; while even in the meridian glare of day i see them still  two sweetly <unk> <unk> , <unk> by the sun !

i was a child and she was a child , in this kingdom by the sea : but we loved with a love that was more than love  i and my <name> <name> ; with a love that the winged <unk> of heaven coveted her and me .
and this was the reason that , long ago , in this kingdom by the sea , a wind blew out of a cloud , chilling my beautiful <name> <name> ; so that her <unk> kinsmen came and bore her away from me , to shut her up in a sepulchre in this kingdom by the sea .
the angels , not half so happy in heaven , went <unk> her and me  yes !  that was the reason ( as all men know , in this kingdom by the sea ) that the wind came out of the cloud by night , chilling and killing my <name> <name> .
but our love it was stronger by far than the love of those who were older than we  of many far wiser than we  and neither the angels in heaven above , nor the demons down under the sea , can ever <unk> my soul from the soul of the beautiful <name> <name> .
for the moon never beams without bringing me dreams of the beautiful <name> <name> ; and the stars never rise but i see the bright eyes of the beautiful <name> <name> ; and so , all the <unk> , i lie down by the side of my darling , my darling , my life and my bride , in her sepulchre there by the sea  in her tomb by the side of the sea .

for her this rhyme is penned , whose luminous eyes , brightly expressive as the twins of <name> , shall find her own sweet name , that , nestling lies upon the <name> , <unk> from every reader .
search narrowly the lines !  they hold a treasure divine  a <unk>  an amulet that must be worn at heart .
search well the measure  the words  the syllables !
do not forget the <unk> point , or you may lose your labor !
and yet there is in this no <unk> knot which one might not undo without a sabre , if one could merely comprehend the plot .
<unk> upon the leaf where now are peering eyes <unk> soul , there lie <unk> three eloquent words oft uttered in the hearing of poets by poets  as the name is a poet 's , too .
its letters , although naturally lying like the knight <unk>  <unk> <unk>  still form a <unk> for truth  cease trying !
you <name> not read the riddle , though you do the best you can do .

" seldom we find , " says <name> <name> dunce , " half an idea in the profoundest sonnet .
through all the flimsy things we see at once as easily as through a naples bonnet  trash of all trash !  how can a <name> <name> it ?
yet heavier far than your <unk> stuff  <unk> nonsense that the faintest puff <unk> into <unk> the while you con it . "
and , <unk> , <name> is right enough .
the general <unk> are <unk> bubbles  <unk> and so transparent  but this is , now  you may depend upon it  stable , opaque , immortal  all by dint of the dear names that lie concealed <unk> n't .

* * * * * to my mother .
because i feel that , in the heavens above , the angels , whispering to one another , can find , among their burning terms of love , none so devotional as that of " mother , " therefore by that dear name i long have called you  you who are more than mother unto me , and fill my heart of hearts , where death installed you , in setting my <name> 's spirit free .
my mother  my own mother , who died early , was but the mother of myself ; but you are mother to the one i loved so dearly , and thus are dearer than the mother i knew by that infinity with which my wife was dearer to my soul than its <unk> .

* * * * * for <name> .
thank heaven !
the crisis  the danger is past , and the lingering illness is over at last  and the fever called " living " is conquered at last .
sadly , i know , i am shorn of my strength , and no muscle i move as i lie at full length  but no matter !  i feel i am better at length .
and i rest so composedly , now in my bed , that any beholder might fancy me dead  might start at beholding me thinking me dead .
the moaning and groaning , the sighing and sobbing , are quieted now , with that horrible throbbing at heart :  ah , that horrible , horrible throbbing !
the sickness  the nausea  the pitiless pain  have ceased , with the fever that maddened my <name>  with the fever called " living " that burned in my <name> .
and oh !
of all tortures that torture the worst has abated  the terrible torture of thirst , for the <unk> river of passion <unk> :  i have drank of a water that <unk> all thirst :  of a water that flows , with a <unk> sound , from a spring but a very few feet under ground  from a cavern not very far down under ground .
and ah !
let it never be foolishly said that my room it is gloomy and narrow my bed  for man never slept in a different bed ; and , to sleep , you must slumber in just such a bed .
my <unk> spirit here blandly <unk> , forgetting , or never <unk> its roses  its old agitations of <unk> and roses : for now , while so quietly lying , it fancies a <unk> odor about it , of pansies  a <name> odor , commingled with pansies  with rue and the beautiful puritan pansies .
and so it lies happily , bathing in many a dream of the truth and the beauty of <name>  drowned in a bath of the tresses of <name> .
she tenderly kissed me , she fondly caressed , and then i fell gently to sleep on her breast  deeply to sleep from the heaven of her breast .
when the light was extinguished , she covered me warm , and she prayed to the angels to keep me from harm  to the <name> of the angels to shield me from harm .
and i lie so composedly , now in my bed ( knowing her love ) that you fancy me dead  and i rest so contentedly , now in my bed , ( with her love at my breast ) that you fancy me dead  that you shudder to look at me .
thinking me dead .
but my heart it is brighter than all of the many stars in the sky , for it sparkles with <name>  it glows with the light of the love of my <name>  with the thought of the light of the eyes of my <name> .
1849 .
* * * * * to f  beloved !
amid the <name> woes that crowd around my earthly path  ( drear path , alas !
where grows not even one lonely rose )  my soul at least a solace hath in dreams of thee , and therein knows an <name> of bland repose .
and thus thy memory is to me like some enchanted far-off isle in some tumultuous sea  some ocean throbbing far and free with storm  but where meanwhile <unk> skies continually just o'er that one bright inland smile .
1845 .
* * * * * to <name> s. osgood .
thou wouldst be loved ?  then let thy heart from its present pathway part not ; being everything which now thou <name> , be nothing which thou <name> not .
so with the world thy gentle ways , thy <name> , thy more than beauty , shall be an endless theme of praise .
and love a simple duty .
1845 .
* * * * * eldorado .
gaily <unk> , a gallant knight , in <name> and in shadow , had journeyed long , singing a song , in search of eldorado .
but he grew old  this knight so bold  and o'er his heart a shadow fell as he found no spot of ground that looked like eldorado .
and , as his strength failed him at length , he met a pilgrim shadow  " shadow , " said he , " where can it be  this land of eldorado ? "
" over the mountains of the moon , down the valley of the shadow , ride , boldly ride , " the shade replied , " if you seek for eldorado ! "

* * * * * eulalie .
i dwelt alone in a world of moan , and my soul was a stagnant tide , till the fair and gentle eulalie became my blushing bride  till the <unk> young eulalie became my smiling bride .
ah , less  less bright the stars of the night than the eyes of the radiant girl !
and never a <unk> that the vapor can make with the <unk> of purple and <name> , can vie with the modest eulalie 's most <unk> curl  can compare with the <unk> eulalie 's most humble and careless curl .
now doubt  now pain come never again , for her soul gives me sigh for sigh , and all day long shines , bright and strong , <unk> within the sky , while ever to her dear eulalie <unk> her matron eye  while ever to her young eulalie <unk> her <name> eye .

* * * * * a dream within a dream .

and , in parting from you now , thus much let me <unk>  you are not wrong , who deem that my days have been a dream : yet if <name> has flown away in a night , or in a day , in a vision or in none , is it therefore the less gone ?
all that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream .
i stand amid the roar of a <unk> shore , and i hold within my hand grains of the golden sand  how few !
yet how they creep through my fingers to the deep while i weep  while i weep !
o god !
can i not grasp them with a tighter clasp ?
o god !
can i not save one from the pitiless wave ?
is all that we see or seem but a dream within a dream ?

* * * * * to <name> <name> ( shew ) .
not long ago , the writer of these lines , in the mad pride of <unk> , maintained " the power of words "  denied that ever a thought arose within the human <name> beyond the utterance of the human tongue : and now , as if in mockery of that boast , two words  two foreign soft <unk>  italian tones , made only to be murmured by angels dreaming in the moonlit " dew that hangs like chains of <name> on hermon hill , "  have stirred from out the abysses of his heart , <unk> thoughts that are the souls of thought , richer , far wilder , far <unk> visions than even the seraph harper , <unk> , ( who has " the sweetest voice of all god 's creatures , " ) could <name> to utter .
and i !
my spells are broken .
the pen falls powerless from my shivering hand .
with thy dear name as text , though hidden by thee , i can not write  i can not speak or think  alas , i can not feel ; for 't is not feeling , this standing motionless upon the golden threshold of the wide-open gate of dreams , gazing , entranced , <unk> the gorgeous vista , and thrilling as i see , upon the right , upon the left , and all the way along , amid <unk> <unk> , far away to where the prospect terminates  thee only !
* * * * * the city in the sea .
lo !
death has reared himself a throne in a strange city lying alone far down within the dim west , where the good and the bad and the worst and the best have gone to their eternal rest .
there shrines and palaces and towers ( <unk> towers and tremble not ! )
resemble nothing that is ours .
around , by lifting winds forgot , resignedly beneath the sky the melancholy waters lie .
no rays from the holy heaven come down on the long <unk> of that town ; but light from out the lurid sea streams up the turrets silently  gleams up the pinnacles far and free  up domes  up spires  up kingly halls  up <unk>  up <unk> walls  up shadowy long-forgotten bowers of sculptured <name> and stone flowers  up many and many a marvellous shrine whose wreathed <unk> <unk> the <unk> , the <name> , and the vine .
resignedly beneath the sky the melancholy waters lie .
so blend the turrets and shadows there that all seem pendulous in air , while from a proud tower in the town death looks <unk> down .
there open <unk> and gaping graves yawn level with the luminous waves ; but not the riches there that lie in each idol 's <name> eye  not the <unk> dead tempt the waters from their bed ; for no ripples curl , alas !
along that wilderness of glass  no <unk> tell that winds may be upon some far-off happier sea  no <unk> hint that winds have been on seas less hideously serene .
but lo , a stir is in the air !
the wave  there is a movement there !
as if the towers had thrust aside , in slightly sinking , the dull tide  as if their tops had feebly given a void within the filmy heaven .
the waves have now a redder glow  the hours are breathing faint and low  and when , amid no earthly moans , down , down that town shall settle hence , hell , rising from a thousand thrones , shall do it reverence .

* * * * * the sleeper at midnight , in the month of <name> , i stand beneath the mystic moon .
an <unk> vapor , dewy , dim , <unk> from out her golden rim , and , softly dripping , drop by drop , upon the quiet mountain top , steals drowsily and musically into the universal valley .
the <name> nods upon the grave ; the <name> <unk> upon the wave ; wrapping the fog about its breast , the ruin <unk> into rest ; looking like <unk> , see !
the lake a conscious slumber seems to take , and would not , for the world , awake .
all beauty sleeps !  and lo !
where lies ( her casement open to the skies ) <name> , with her destinies !
oh , <name> bright !
can it be right  this window open to the night !
the wanton airs , from the <unk> , laughingly through the <unk>  the <unk> airs , a wizard rout , flit through thy chamber in and out , and wave the curtain canopy so fitfully  so fearfully  above the closed and fringed lid 'neath which thy <unk> soul lies hid , that , o'er the floor and down the wall , like ghosts the shadows rise and fall !
oh , <name> dear , hast thou no fear ?
why and what <name> thou dreaming here ?
sure thou <name> come o'er far-off seas , a wonder to these garden trees !
strange is thy pallor !
strange thy dress !
strange , above all , thy length of <unk> , and this <unk> <unk> !
the <name> sleeps !
oh , may her sleep which is enduring , so be deep !
heaven have her in its sacred keep !
this chamber changed for one more holy , this bed for one more melancholy , i pray to god that she may lie for ever with unopened eye , while the dim sheeted ghosts go by !
my love , she sleeps !
oh , may her sleep , as it is lasting , so be deep ; soft may the worms about her creep !
far in the forest , dim and old , for her may some tall vault unfold  some vault that oft hath flung its black and winged panels fluttering back , triumphant , o'er the crested <unk> , of her grand family funerals  some sepulchre , remote , alone , against whose portal she hath thrown , in childhood many an idle stone  some tomb from out whose sounding door she ne'er shall force an <name> more , thrilling to think , poor child of sin !
it was the dead who groaned within .

* * * * * bridal ballad .
the ring is on my hand , and the wreath is on my brow ; <unk> and jewels grand are all at my command .
and i am happy now .
and my lord he loves me well ; but , when first he breathed his vow , i felt my bosom swell  for the words rang as a knell , and the voice seemed his who fell in the battle down the <name> , and who is happy now .
but he spoke to reassure me , and he kissed my pallid brow , while a reverie came o'er me , and to the churchyard bore me , and i sighed to him before me , thinking him dead <unk> , " oh , i am happy now ! "
and thus the words were spoken , and thus the <unk> vow , and , though my <name> be broken , and , though my heart be broken , behold the golden keys that proves me happy now !
would to god i could awaken for i dream i know not how , and my soul is sorely shaken lest an evil step be taken ,  lest the dead who is forsaken may not be happy now .

the <name> " the <name> " was first published on the 29th <name> , 1845 , in the new york <unk> mirror '  a paper its author was then assistant editor of .
it was <unk> by the following words , understood to have been written by n. p. <name> : " we are permitted to copy ( in advance of publication ) from the second number of the 'american review ' , the following remarkable poem by <name> poe .
in our opinion , it is the most effective single example of <unk> poetry ' ever published in this country , and <unk> in english poetry for subtle <name> , masterly ingenuity of versification , and consistent sustaining of imaginative lift and <unk> . '
it is one of those <unk> bred in a book ' which we feed on .
it <name> stick to the memory of everybody who reads it . "
in the february number of the 'american review ' the poem was published as by " <unk> , " and it was introduced by the following note , evidently suggested if not written by poe himself .
[ " the following lines from a correspondent  besides the deep , quaint strain of the sentiment , and the curious introduction of some ludicrous touches amidst the serious and impressive , as was doubtless intended by the author  appears to us one of the most felicitous specimens of unique <unk> which has for some time met our eye .
the resources of english rhythm for varieties of <name> , measure , and sound , producing corresponding diversities of effect , have been thoroughly studied , much more perceived , by very few poets in the language .
while the classic tongues , especially the greek , possess , by power of accent , several advantages for versification over our own , chiefly through greater abundance of <unk> feet , we have other and very great advantages of sound by the modern usage of rhyme .
<unk> is nearly the only effect of that kind which the ancients had in common with us .
it <name> be seen that much of the <name> of 'the <name> ' arises from <unk> and the studious use of similar sounds in unusual places .
in regard to its measure , it may be noted that if all the verses were like the second , they might properly be placed merely in short lines , producing a not uncommon form : but the presence in all the others of one line  mostly the second in the verse " ( stanza ? )
 " which flows continuously , with only an <unk> pause in the middle , like that before the short line in the <unk> <unk> , while the fifth has at the middle pause no similarity of sound with any part beside , gives the versification an entirely different effect .
we could wish the capacities of our <name> language in <unk> were better understood . "

the bells the <unk> history of " the bells " is curious .
the subject , and some lines of the original version , having been suggested by the <unk> friend , mrs. shew , poe , when he wrote out the first draft of the poem , headed it , " the bells .
by mrs. m. a .
shew . "
this draft , now the <unk> property , consists of only seventeen lines , and reads thus : i .
the bells !  ah the bells !
the little silver bells !
how <unk> a <name> there floats from their throats  from their <name> little throats  from the silver , tinkling throats of the bells , bells , bells  of the bells !
ii .
the bells !  ah , the bells !
the heavy iron bells !
how horrible a <unk> there floats from their throats  from their <unk> throats  from their melancholy throats how i shudder at the notes of the bells , bells , bells  of the bells !
in the autumn of 1848 poe added another line to this poem , and sent it to the editor of the <unk> magazine ' .
it was not published .
so , in the following february , the poet forwarded to the same periodical a much enlarged and altered <unk> .
three months having elapsed without publication , another revision of the poem , similar to the current version , was sent , and in the following october was published in the <unk> magazine ' .

being reprinted immediately in the <unk> journal ' , it was copied into various publications with the name of the editor , n. p. <name> , appended , and was ascribed to him .
when first published , it contained the following additional stanza which poe subsequently , at the suggestion of mrs. <unk> wisely suppressed : said we then  the two , then  " ah , can it have been that the <unk> <unk>  the pitiful , the merciful <unk>  to bar up our path and to ban it from the secret that lies in these <unk>  had drawn up the spectre of a planet from the <unk> of <unk> souls  this <unk> <unk> planet from the hell of the <unk> souls ?

wanderers in that happy valley , through two luminous windows , saw spirits moving musically , to a <unk> 's <unk> law , bound about a throne where , sitting ( <unk> ! )
in state his <name> well <unk> , the ruler of the realm was seen .
and all with <name> and <name> glowing was the fair palace door , through which came flowing , flowing , flowing , and sparkling evermore , a troop of echoes , whose sweet duty was but to sing , in voices of surpassing beauty , the wit and wisdom of their king .
but evil things , in robes of sorrow , assailed the monarch 's high estate .
( ah , let us mourn !  for never morrow shall <name> upon him desolate ! )
and round about his home the <name> that blushed and bloomed , is but a <unk> story of the old time entombed .
and travellers , now , within that valley , through the <unk> windows see vast forms , that move fantastically to a discordant <name> , while , like a ghastly rapid river , through the pale door a hideous throng rush out forever and laugh  but smile no more .
1838 .
* * * * * the conqueror worm .
lo !
't is a <name> night within the lonesome latter years !
an <name> throng , <unk> , <unk> in veils , and drowned in tears , sit in a theatre , to see a play of hopes and fears , while the orchestra breathes fitfully the music of the spheres .
<unk> , in the form of god on high , mutter and mumble low , and hither and thither fly  mere <unk> they , who come and go at bidding of vast formless things that shift the scenery to and fro , flapping from out their condor wings invisible wo !
that motley drama  oh , be sure it shall not be forgot !
with its phantom chased for evermore , by a crowd that seize it not , through a circle that ever <unk> in to the self-same spot , and much of madness , and more of sin , and horror the soul of the plot .
but see , amid the mimic rout a crawling shape intrude !
a blood-red thing that <unk> from out the <unk> solitude !
it <unk> !  it <unk> !  with mortal pangs the <unk> become its food , and the angels sob at vermin fangs in human gore imbued .
out  out are the lights  out all !
and , over each quivering form , the curtain , a funeral pall , comes down with the rush of a storm , and the angels , all pallid and <name> , uprising , <unk> , affirm that the play is the tragedy , " man , " and its hero the conqueror worm .
1838 * * * * * silence .
there are some qualities  some <unk> things , that have a double life , which thus is made a type of that twin entity which springs from matter and light , evinced in solid and shade .
there is a twofold silence  sea and shore  body and soul .
one dwells in lonely places , newly with grass <unk> ; some solemn graces , some human memories and tearful <name> , render him <unk> : his name 's " no more . "
he is the <unk> silence : dread him not !
no power hath he of evil in himself ; but should some urgent fate ( untimely lot ! )
bring thee to meet his shadow ( nameless <unk> , that <unk> the lone regions where hath trod no foot of man ) , commend thyself to god !
1840 * * * * * dreamland .
by a route obscure and lonely , haunted by ill angels only , where an <unk> , named night , on a black throne reigns upright , i have reached these lands but newly from an ultimate dim <unk>  from a wild weird clime that lieth , sublime , out of space  out of time .
bottomless <unk> and boundless floods , and chasms , and caves , and <unk> woods , with forms that no man can discover for the dews that drip all over ; mountains <unk> evermore into seas without a shore ; seas that restlessly aspire , surging , unto skies of fire ; lakes that <unk> <unk> their lone waters  lone and dead , their still waters  still and chilly with the snows of the lolling <name> .
by the lakes that thus <unk> their lone waters , lone and dead ,  their sad waters , sad and chilly with the snows of the lolling <name> ,  by the mountains  near the river murmuring lowly , murmuring ever ,  by the gray woods ,  by the swamp where the toad and the <unk> encamp ,  by the dismal <unk> and pools where dwell the <unk> ,  by each spot the most unholy  in each nook most melancholy ,  there the traveller meets aghast sheeted memories of the past  shrouded forms that start and sigh as they pass the wanderer by  <unk> forms of friends long given , in agony , to the earth  and heaven .
for the heart whose woes are legion 't is a peaceful , soothing region  for the spirit that walks in shadow 't is  oh , 't is an eldorado !
but the traveller , travelling through it , may not  dare not openly view it ; never its mysteries are exposed to the weak human eye <unk> ; so wills its king , who hath forbid the uplifting of the fringed lid ; and thus the sad soul that here passes beholds it but through darkened glasses .
by a route obscure and lonely , haunted by ill angels only .
where an <unk> , named night , on a black throne reigns upright , i have wandered home but newly from this ultimate dim <unk> .
1844 * * * * * to <unk> .
fair isle , that from the fairest of all flowers , thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take !
how many memories of what radiant hours at sight of thee and thine at once awake !
how many scenes of what departed bliss !
how many thoughts of what entombed hopes !
how many visions of a maiden that is no more  no more upon thy verdant slopes !
no more !  alas , that magical sad sound transforming all !
thy charms shall please no more  thy memory no more !  accursed ground henceforward i hold thy <unk> shore , o <unk> isle !
o purple <unk> !
" <unk> <unk> !
<unk> di <unk> ! "

methinks thou hast a singular way of showing thy happiness  what ails thee , cousin of mine ?
why didst thou sigh so deeply ?
cas .
did i sigh ?
i was not conscious of it .
it is a fashion , a silly  a most silly fashion i have when i am very happy .
did i sigh ?

thou didst .
thou <name> not well .
thou hast indulged too much of late , and i am vexed to see it .
late hours and wine , castiglione ,  these <name> ruin thee !
thou <name> already altered  thy looks are haggard  nothing so wears away the constitution as late hours and wine .

( musing ) .
nothing , fair cousin , nothing  not even deep sorrow  wears it away like evil hours and wine .
i <name> amend .
aless .
do it !
i would have thee drop thy riotous company , too  fellows low born ill suit the like of old di <unk> 's heir and <name> 's husband .
cas .
i <name> drop them .
aless .
thou wilt  thou must .
attend thou also more to thy dress and equipage  they are over plain for thy lofty rank and fashion  much depends upon appearances .
cas .
i 'll see to it .
aless .

di <unk> .
the same , my love .
we 'll have him at the wedding .
a man quite young in years , but gray in fame .
i have not seen him , but rumor speaks of him as of a prodigy <unk> in arts , and arms , and wealth , and high descent .
we 'll have him at the wedding .
aless .
i have heard much of this politian .
<name> , volatile and giddy  is he not , and little given to thinking ?
di <unk> .
far from it , love .
no branch , they say , of all philosophy so deep abstruse he has not mastered it .
learned as few are learned .
aless .
't is very strange !
i have known men have seen politian and sought his company .
they speak of him as of one who entered madly into life , drinking the cup of pleasure to the <unk> .
cas .
ridiculous !
now i have seen politian and know him well  nor learned nor mirthful he .
he is a dreamer , and shut out from common passions .
di <unk> .
children , we disagree .
let us go forth and taste the fragrant air of the garden .
did i dream , or did i hear politian was a melancholy man ?
( <unk> ) ii .
rome.  a <name> 's apartment , with a window open and looking into a garden .
lalage , in deep mourning , reading at a table on which lie some books and a <unk> .
in the background <name> ( a servant maid ) leans carelessly upon a chair .
lalage .
<name> !
is it thou ?
<name> ( <unk> ) .
yes , ma'am , i 'm here .
lal .
i did not know , <name> , you were in waiting .
sit down !  let not my presence trouble you  sit down !  for i am humble , most humble .

( aside ) .
't is time .
( <name> seats herself in a <unk> manner upon the chair , resting her elbows upon the back , and regarding her mistress with a contemptuous look .
lalage continues to <unk> ) lal .
" it in another climate , so he said , bore a bright golden flower , but not i ' this soil ! "
( pauses  turns over some leaves and resumes . )
" no lingering winters there , nor snow , nor shower  but ocean ever to refresh mankind breathes the shrill spirit of the western wind " oh , beautiful !  most beautiful !  how like to what my fevered soul doth dream of heaven !
o happy land !
( pauses ) she died !  the maiden died !
o still more happy maiden who couldst die !
<name> !
( <name> returns no answer , and lalage presently resumes . )
again !  a similar tale told of a <unk> dame beyond the sea !
thus <unk> one <name> in the words of the play  " she died full young "  one <unk> answers him  " i think not so  her <unk> seemed to have years too many "  ah , luckless <name> !
<name> !
( still no answer . )
here 's a far sterner story  but like  oh , very like in its despair  of that egyptian <name> , winning so easily a thousand hearts  losing at length her own .
she died .
thus <unk> the history  and her maids <name> over her and keep  two gentle maids with gentle names  eiros and charmion !
rainbow and dove !  <name> !
<unk> .
( <unk> ) .
madam , what is it ?
lal .
wilt thou , my good <name> , be so kind as go down in the library and bring me the holy <unk> ?
<unk> .
pshaw !
( exit ) lal .
if there be balm for the wounded spirit in <unk> , it is there !
dew in the night time of my bitter trouble <name> there be found  " dew sweeter far than that which hangs like chains of <name> on hermon hill . "
( <unk> <name> , and throws a volume on the table . )
there , ma'am , 's the book .
( aside . )
indeed she is very troublesome .
lal .
( astonished ) .
what didst thou say , <name> ?
have i done aught to grieve thee or to vex thee ?  i am sorry .
for thou hast served me long and ever been trustworthy and respectful .
( resumes her reading . )
<unk> .
( aside . )
i ca n't believe she has any more jewels  no  no  she gave me all .
lal .
what didst thou say , <name> ?
now i <unk> me thou hast not spoken lately of thy wedding .
how fares good <unk> ?  and when is it to be ?
can i do aught ?  is there no further aid thou <unk> , <name> ?
<unk> .
( aside . )
is there no further aid !
that 's meant for me .
i 'm sure , madam , you need not be always throwing those jewels in my teeth .
lal .
jewels !
<name> ,  now indeed , <name> , i thought not of the jewels .
<unk> .
oh , perhaps not !
but then i might have sworn it .
after all , there 's <unk> says the ring is only paste , for he 's sure the count castiglione never would have given a real <name> to such as you ; and at the best i 'm certain , madam , you can not have use for jewels now .
but i might have sworn it .
( exit ) ( lalage bursts into tears and leans her head upon the table  after a short pause raises it . )
lal .
poor lalage !  and is it come to this ?
thy servant maid !  but courage !  't is but a viper whom thou hast cherished to sting thee to the soul !
( taking up the mirror ) <name> !
here at least 's a friend  too much a friend in earlier days  a friend <name> not deceive thee .
fair mirror and true !
now tell me ( for thou canst ) a tale  a pretty tale  and heed thou not though it be rife with woe .
it answers me .
it speaks of sunken eyes , and wasted cheeks , and beauty long deceased  remembers me , of <name> departed  <name> , the seraph <name> , <unk> and entombed !  now , in a tone low , sad , and solemn , but most audible , whispers of early grave untimely yawning for ruined maid .
fair mirror and true !  thou <unk> not !
thou hast no end to gain  no heart to break  castiglione lied who said he loved   thou true  he false !  false !  false !
( while she speaks , a monk enters her apartment and approaches unobserved ) monk .
refuge thou hast , sweet daughter !
in heaven .
think of eternal things !
give up thy soul to penitence , and pray !
lal .
( arising hurriedly ) .
i cannot pray !  my soul is at war with god !
the frightful sounds of merriment below ; disturb my senses  go !
i can not pray  the sweet airs from the garden worry me !
thy presence grieves me  go !  thy <unk> raiment fills me with dread  thy <name> crucifix with horror and awe !
monk .
think of thy precious soul !
lal .
think of my early days !  think of my father and mother in heaven !
think of our quiet home , and the rivulet that ran before the door !
think of my little sisters !  think of them !
and think of me !  think of my trusting love and confidence  his vows  my ruin  think  think of my unspeakable misery !   begone !
yet stay !
yet stay !  what was it thou <unk> of prayer and penitence ?
didst thou not speak of <name> and vows before the throne ?
monk .
i did .
lal .
't is well .
there is a vow 'twere fitting should be made  a sacred vow , imperative and urgent , a solemn vow !
monk .
daughter , this zeal is well !
lal .
father , this zeal is anything but well !
hast thou a crucifix fit for this thing ?
a crucifix whereon to register this sacred vow ?
( he hands her his own . )
not that  oh !
no !  no !  no ( shuddering . )
not that !
not that !  i tell thee , holy man , thy <unk> and thy <name> cross affright me !
stand back !
i have a crucifix myself ,  i have a crucifix !
methinks 'twere fitting the deed  the vow  the symbol of the deed  and the deed 's register should tally , father !
( draws a <unk> dagger and raises it on high . )
behold the cross wherewith a vow like mine is written in heaven !
monk .
thy words are madness , daughter , and speak a purpose unholy  thy lips are livid  thine eyes are wild  tempt not the wrath divine !
pause ere too late !  oh , be not  be not rash !
swear not the oath  oh , swear it not !
lal .
't is sworn !

pol .
baldazzar , it doth grieve me to give thee cause for grief , my honored friend .
command me , sir !

command me , sir !
bal .
to the field then  to the field  to the senate or the field .
pol .
alas !
alas !

there is  what voice was that ?
bal .
i heard it not .
i heard not any voice except thine own , and the <name> of thine own .
pol .
then i but dreamed .
bal .
give not thy soul to dreams : the camp  the court <unk> thee  fame awaits thee  <name> calls  and her the <unk> thou wilt not hear in <unk> to imaginary sounds and phantom voices .
pol .
it is a phantom voice !
didst thou not hear it then ?
bal i heard it not .
pol .
thou <unk> it not !  baldazzar , speak no more to me , politian , of thy camps and courts .
oh !
i am sick , sick , sick , even unto death , of the hollow and <unk> vanities of the populous earth !

bal .
thou <unk> a fearful riddle i <name> not understand .
pol .
yet now as fate approaches , and the hours are breathing low , the sands of time are changed to golden grains , and dazzle me , baldazzar .
alas !
alas !
i cannot die , having within my heart so keen a relish for the beautiful as hath been kindled within it .
methinks the air is <unk> now than it was wont to be  <name> melodies are floating in the winds  a rarer loveliness <unk> the earth  and with a <unk> lustre the quiet moon <unk> in <unk>  hist !
hist !
thou canst not say thou <unk> not now , baldazzar ?
bal .

a <name> 's voice !  and sorrow in the tone !
baldazzar , it <unk> me like a spell !
again !  again !  how solemnly it falls into my heart of hearts !
that eloquent voice surely i never heard  yet it were well had i but heard it with its thrilling tones in earlier days !
bal .
i myself hear it now .
be still !  the voice , if i mistake not greatly , proceeds from <unk> lattice  which you may see very plainly through the window  it belongs , does it not ?
unto this palace of the duke .
the singer is undoubtedly beneath the roof of his excellency  and perhaps is even that <name> of whom he spoke as the betrothed of castiglione , his son and heir .
pol .
be still !  it comes again !
voice ( very faintly ) .
" and is thy heart so strong [ 1 ] as for to leave me thus , that have loved thee so long , in wealth and woe among ?
and is thy heart so strong as for to leave me thus ?
say nay !
say nay ! "
bal .
the song is english , and i oft have heard it in <name> england  never so plaintively  hist !

the hour is growing late  the duke awaits us ,  thy presence is expected in the hall below .

i know  i know it all , and still i speak of love .
look at me , brightest , and beautiful lalage !  turn here thine eyes !
thou <unk> me if i could speak of love , knowing what i know , and seeing what i have seen thou <unk> me that  and thus i answer thee  thus on my bended knee i answer thee .
( kneeling . )
sweet lalage , i love thee  love thee  love thee ; thro ' good and ill  thro ' weal and woe , i love thee .
not mother , with her first-born on her knee , thrills with <unk> love than i for thee .
not on god 's altar , in any time or clime , burned there a <unk> fire than <unk> now within my spirit for thee .
and do i love ?
( arising . )
even for thy woes i love thee  even for thy woes  thy beauty and thy woes .
lal .
alas , proud <name> , thou dost forget thyself , remembering me !
how , in thy father 's halls , among the maidens pure and <unk> of thy princely line , could the <unk> lalage abide ?
thy wife , and with a tainted memory  my seared and blighted name , how would it tally with the ancestral honors of thy house , and with thy <name> ?
pol .
speak not to me of <name> !
i hate  i <unk> the name ; i do abhor the unsatisfactory and ideal thing .
<name> thou not lalage , and i politian ?
do i not love  <name> thou not beautiful  what need we more ?
<name> !
<name> !
now speak not of it : by all i hold most sacred and most solemn  by all my wishes now  my fears hereafter  by all i scorn on earth and <name> in heaven  there is no deed i would more <name> in , than in thy cause to scoff at this same <name> and trample it under foot .
what matters it  what matters it , my fairest , and my best , that we go down <unk> and forgotten into the dust  so we descend together ?
descend together  and then  and then perchance  lal .
why dost thou pause , politian ?
pol .
and then perchance arise together , lalage , and roam the starry and quiet dwellings of the blest , and still  lal .
why dost thou pause , politian ?
pol .
and still together  together .

thou <unk> me , and in my heart of hearts i feel thou <unk> me truly .
pol .
o lalage !
( throwing himself upon his knee . )
and <unk> thou me ?
lal .
hist !
hush !
within the gloom of yonder trees methought a figure passed  a spectral figure , solemn , and slow , and noiseless  like the grim shadow conscience , solemn and noiseless .
( walks across and returns . )
i was mistaken  't was but a giant bough stirred by the autumn wind .
politian !
pol .
my lalage  my love !
why <name> thou moved ?
why dost thou turn so pale ?
not conscience self , far less a shadow which thou <unk> to it , should shake the firm spirit thus .
but the night wind is chilly  and these melancholy boughs throw over all things a gloom .
lal .
politian !
thou <unk> to me of love .
knowest thou the land with which all tongues are busy  a land new found  miraculously found by one of genoa  a thousand leagues within the golden west ?
a <name> land of flowers , and fruit , and <name> ,  and <name> lakes , and <unk> forests , and mountains , around whose towering summits the winds of heaven <unk> flow  which air to breathe is happiness now , and <name> be freedom hereafter in days that are to come ?
pol .
oh , wilt thou  wilt thou fly to that paradise  my lalage , wilt thou fly thither with me ?
there care shall be forgotten , and sorrow shall be no more , and eros be all .
and life shall then be mine , for i <name> live for thee , and in thine eyes  and thou shalt be no more a mourner  but the radiant joys shall wait upon thee , and the <name> <name> attend thee ever ; and i <name> kneel to thee and worship thee , and call thee my beloved , my own , my beautiful , my love , my wife , my all ;  oh , wilt thou  wilt thou , lalage , fly thither with me ?
lal .
a deed is to be done  castiglione lives !

and he shall die !

with what excessive fragrance the <unk> comes laden from yonder bowers !  a fairer day , or one more worthy italy , methinks no mortal eyes have seen !  what said the count ?
bal .
that he , castiglione , not being aware of any feud existing , or any cause of quarrel between your lordship and himself , can not accept the challenge .
pol .
it is most true  all this is very true .
when saw you , sir , when saw you now , baldazzar , in the frigid <unk> britain which we left so lately , a heaven so calm as this  so utterly free from the evil taint of clouds ?  and he did say ?

* * * * * note on politian 20 .
such portions of " politian " as are known to the public first saw the light of publicity in the <unk> literary messenger ' for december 1835 and <name> 1836 , being styled " scenes from politian ; an unpublished drama . "
these scenes were included , unaltered , in the 1845 collection of poems by poe .
the larger portion of the original draft subsequently became the property of the present editor , but it is not considered just to the poet 's memory to publish it .
the work is a hasty and <unk> production of its author 's earlier days of literary labor ; and , beyond the scenes already known , scarcely calculated to enhance his reputation .
as a specimen , however , of the parts unpublished , the following fragment from the first scene of act ii .
may be offered .
the duke , it should be <unk> , is uncle to <name> , and father of castiglione her betrothed .
duke .
why do you laugh ?
castiglione .
indeed .
i hardly know myself .
stay !
was it not on yesterday we were speaking of the <name> ?
of the <name> politian ?
yes !
it was yesterday .
<name> , you and i , you must remember !
we were walking in the garden .
duke .
perfectly .
i do remember it  what of it  what then ?
cas .
o nothing  nothing at all .
duke .
nothing at all !
it is most singular that you should laugh at nothing at all !
cas .
most singular  singular !
duke .
look <name> , castiglione , be so kind as tell me , sir , at once what 't is you mean .
what are you talking of ?
cas .
was it not so ?
we differed in opinion touching him .
duke .
him !  whom ?
cas .
why , sir , the <name> politian .
duke .
the <name> of leicester !
yes !  is it he you mean ?
we differed , indeed .
if i now recollect the words you used were that the <name> you knew was neither learned nor mirthful .
cas .
<name> !
<name> !  now did i ?
duke .
that did you , sir , and well i knew at the time you were wrong , it being not the character of the <name>  whom all the world allows to be a most hilarious man .
be not , my son , too positive again .
cas .
't is singular !
most singular !
i could not think it possible so little time could so much alter one !
to say the truth about an hour ago , as i was walking with the count san <unk> , all arm in arm , we met this very man the <name>  he , with his friend baldazzar , having just arrived in rome .
<name> !
<name> !
he is altered !
such an account he gave me of his journey !
'twould have made you die with laughter  such tales he told of his caprices and his <name> freaks along the road  such oddity  such humor  such wit  such whim  such flashes of wild merriment set off too in such full relief by the grave demeanor of his friend  who , to speak the truth was gravity itself  duke .
did i not tell you ?
cas .
you did  and yet 't is strange !
but true , as strange , how much i was mistaken !
i always thought the <name> a gloomy man .
duke .
so , so , you see !
be not too positive .
whom have we here ?
it can not be the <name> ?
cas .
the <name> !
oh no !
tis not the <name>  but yet it is  and leaning upon his friend baldazzar .
ah !
welcome , sir !
( enter politian and baldazzar . )
my lord , a second welcome let me give you to rome  his <name> the duke of <unk> .
father !
this is the <name> politian , <name> of leicester in great britain .
[ politian bows haughtily . ]
that , his friend baldazzar , duke of surrey .
the <name> has letters , so please you , for your <name> .
duke .
<name> !
<name> !
most welcome to rome and to our palace , <name> politian !
and you , most <name> duke !
i am glad to see you !
i knew your father well , my lord politian .
castiglione !
call your cousin hither , and let me make the <name> <name> acquainted with your betrothed .
you come , sir , at a time most <unk> .
the wedding  politian .
touching those letters , sir , your son made mention of  your son , is he not ?  touching those letters , sir , i wot not of them .
if such there be , my friend baldazzar here  baldazzar !
ah !  my friend baldazzar here <name> hand them to your <name> .
i would retire .
duke .
retire !  so soon ?
cas .
what ho !
<name> !
<name> !
his lordship 's chambers  show his lordship to them !
his lordship is unwell .
( enter <name> . )
<name> .
this way , my lord !
( exit , followed by politian . )
duke .
retire !
unwell !
bal .
so please you , sir .
i fear me 't is as you say  his lordship is unwell .
the damp air of the evening  the fatigue of a long journey  the  indeed i had better follow his lordship .
he must be unwell .
i <name> return anon .
duke .
return anon !
now this is very strange !
castiglione !
this way , my son , i wish to speak with thee .
you surely were mistaken in what you said of the <name> , mirthful , indeed !  which of us said politian was a melancholy man ?
( <unk> . )
* * * * * poems of youth * * * * * introduction to <unk>  1831 .
letter to mr. b  .
" west point , 1831 " dear b  ...
believing only a portion of my former volume to be worthy a second edition  that small portion i thought it as well to include in the present book as to <unk> by itself .
i have therefore herein combined <unk> aaraaf ' and <unk> ' with other poems hitherto <unk> .
nor have i hesitated to insert from the <unk> poems , ' now omitted , whole lines , and even passages , to the end that being placed in a fairer light , and the trash shaken from them in which they were imbedded , they may have some chance of being seen by posterity .
" it has been said that a good <unk> on a poem may be written by one who is no poet himself .
this , according to your idea and mine of poetry , i feel to be false  the less poetical the critic , the less just the <unk> , and the converse .
on this account , and because there are but few b   s in the world , i would be as much ashamed of the world's good opinion as proud of your own .
another than yourself might here observe , <unk> is in possession of the world 's good opinion , and yet shakespeare is the greatest of poets .
it appears then that the world judge correctly , why should you be ashamed of their favorable judgment ? '
the difficulty lies in the interpretation of the word <unk> ' or <unk> . '
the opinion is the world 's , truly , but it may be called theirs as a man would call a book his , having bought it ; he did not write the book , but it is his ; they did not originate the opinion , but it is theirs .
a fool , for example , thinks shakespeare a great poet  yet the fool has never read shakespeare .
but the fool 's neighbor , who is a step higher on the andes of the mind , whose head ( that is to say , his more exalted thought ) is too far above the fool to be seen or understood , but whose feet ( by which i mean his every-day actions ) are sufficiently near to be discerned , and by means of which that superiority is ascertained , which but for them would never have been discovered  this neighbor asserts that shakespeare is a great poet  the fool believes him , and it is henceforward his opinion .
this <unk> own opinion has , in like manner , been adopted from one above him , and so , <unk> , to a few gifted individuals who kneel around the summit , beholding , face to face , the master spirit who stands upon the pinnacle .
" you are aware of the great barrier in the path of an american writer .
he is read , if at all , in preference to the combined and established wit of the world .
i say established ; for it is with literature as with law or empire  an established name is an estate in tenure , or a throne in possession .
besides , one might suppose that books , like their authors , improve by travel  their having crossed the sea is , with us , so great a distinction .
our <unk> abandon time for distance ; our very <unk> glance from the binding to the bottom of the title-page , where the mystic characters which spell london , <name> , or genoa , are precisely so many letters of recommendation .
" i mentioned just now a vulgar error as regards criticism .
i think the notion that no poet can form a correct estimate of his own writings is another .
i remarked before that in proportion to the poetical talent would be the justice of a <unk> upon poetry .
therefore a bad poet would , i <name> , make a false <unk> , and his <unk> would infallibly bias his little judgment in his favor ; but a poet , who is indeed a poet , could not , i think , fail of making a just <unk> ; whatever should be <unk> on the score of <unk> might be replaced on account of his intimate acquaintance with the subject ; in short , we have more instances of false criticism than of just where one 's own writings are the test , simply because we have more bad poets than good .
there are , of course , many objections to what i say : <name> is a great example of the contrary ; but his opinion with respect to the <unk> regained ' is by no means fairly ascertained .
by what trivial circumstances men are often led to assert what they do not really believe !
perhaps an <unk> word has descended to posterity .
but , in fact , the <unk> regained ' is little , if at all , inferior to the <unk> lost , ' and is only supposed so to be because men do not like <unk> , whatever they may say to the contrary , and reading those of <name> in their natural order , are too much wearied with the first to derive any pleasure from the second .
" i dare say <name> preferred <unk> ' to either  if so  justly .
" as i am speaking of poetry , it <name> not be amiss to touch slightly upon the most singular heresy in its modern history  the heresy of what is called , very foolishly , the lake school .
some years ago i might have been induced , by an occasion like the present , to attempt a formal refutation of their doctrine ; at present it would be a work of <unk> .
the wise must bow to the wisdom of such men as coleridge and <unk> , but being wise , have laughed at poetical theories so <unk> exemplified .
" aristotle , with singular assurance , has declared poetry the most philosophical of all writings  but it required a wordsworth to pronounce it the most metaphysical .
he seems to think that the end of poetry is , or should be , instruction ; yet it is a <unk> that the end of our existence is happiness ; if so , the end of every separate part of our existence , everything connected with our existence , should be still happiness .
therefore the end of instruction should be happiness ; and happiness is another name for pleasure ;  therefore the end of instruction should be pleasure : yet we see the above-mentioned opinion implies precisely the reverse .
" to proceed : <unk> <unk> , he who pleases is of more importance to his fellow-men than he who <unk> , since utility is happiness , and pleasure is the end already obtained which instruction is merely the means of obtaining .
" i see no reason , then , why our metaphysical poets should plume themselves so much on the utility of their works , unless indeed they refer to instruction with eternity in view ; in which case , sincere respect for their piety would not allow me to express my contempt for their judgment ; contempt which it would be difficult to conceal , since their writings are <unk> to be understood by the few , and it is the many who stand in need of salvation .
in such case i should no doubt be tempted to think of the devil in <unk> , ' who labors <unk> , through three octavo volumes , to accomplish the destruction of one or two souls , while any common devil would have demolished one or two thousand .
" against the <unk> which would make poetry a study  not a passion  it becomes the metaphysician to reason  but the poet to protest .
yet wordsworth and coleridge are men in years ; the one imbued in contemplation from his childhood ; the other a giant in intellect and learning .
the diffidence , then , with which i venture to dispute their authority would be overwhelming did i not feel , from the bottom of my heart , that learning has little to do with the imagination  intellect with the passions  or age with poetry .
" <unk> , like straws , upon the surface flow ; he who would search for pearls must dive below , ' " are lines which have done much mischief .
as regards the greater truths , men oftener err by seeking them at the bottom than at the top ; truth lies in the huge abysses where wisdom is sought  not in the palpable palaces where she is found .
the ancients were not always right in hiding the goddess in a well ; witness the light which bacon has thrown upon philosophy ; witness the principles of our divine <name>  that moral mechanism by which the simplicity of a child may <unk> the wisdom of a man .
" we see an instance of coleridge 's liability to err , in his <unk> <unk> '  <unk> his literary life and opinions , but , in fact , a treatise 'de <unk> <unk> et <unk> <unk> ' .
he goes wrong by reason of his very profundity , and of his error we have a natural type in the contemplation of a <name> .
he who regards it directly and intensely sees , it is true , the <name> , but it is the <name> without a <name>  while he who surveys it less <unk> is conscious of all for which the <name> is useful to us below  its brilliancy and its beauty .
" as to wordsworth , i have no <name> in him .
that he had in youth the feelings of a poet i believe  for there are glimpses of extreme delicacy in his writings  ( and delicacy is the poet 's own kingdom  his <unk> <unk> ' )  but they have the appearance of a better day recollected ; and glimpses , at best , are little evidence of present poetic fire ; we know that a few straggling flowers spring up daily in the crevices of the glacier .
" he was to blame in wearing away his youth in contemplation with the end of <unk> in his manhood .
with the increase of his judgment the light which should make it apparent has faded away .
his judgment consequently is too correct .
this may not be understood ,  but the old <unk> of germany would have understood it , who used to debate matters of importance to their state twice , once when drunk , and once when sober  sober that they might not be deficient in formality  drunk lest they should be destitute of vigor .
" the long wordy discussions by which he tries to reason us into admiration of his poetry , speak very little in his favor : they are full of such assertions as this ( i have opened one of his volumes at random )  'of genius the only proof is the act of doing well what is worthy to be done , and what was never done before ; '  indeed ?
then it follows that in doing what is <unk> to be done , or what 'has ' been done before , no genius can be evinced ; yet the picking of pockets is an unworthy act , pockets have been picked time immemorial , and barrington , the <unk> , in point of genius , would have thought hard of a comparison with <name> wordsworth , the poet .
" again , in estimating the merit of certain poems , whether they be <unk> 's or <unk> 's can surely be of little consequence , yet , in order to prove their <unk> , mr. w. has expended many pages in the controversy .
<unk> <unk> ? '
can great minds descend to such absurdity ?
but worse still : that he may bear down every argument in favor of these poems , he triumphantly drags forward a passage , in his <unk> with which he expects the reader to sympathise .
it is the beginning of the epic poem <unk> . '
'the blue waves of <unk> roll in light ; the green hills are covered with day ; trees shake their <name> heads in the breeze . '
and this  this gorgeous , yet simple imagery , where all is alive and panting with immortality  this , <name> wordsworth , the author of <unk> <name> , ' has <unk> ' for his contempt .
we shall see what better he , in his own person , has to offer .
<unk> : " 'and now she 's at the pony 's tail , and now she 's at the pony 's head , on that side now , and now on this ; and , almost stifled with her bliss , a few sad tears does <name> shed ... . she <unk> the pony , where or when she knows not ... happy <name> <unk> !
oh , <name> , never mind the doctor ! '
" secondly : " 'the dew was falling fast , the  stars began to blink ; i heard a voice : it said ,  " drink , pretty creature , drink ! "
and , looking o'er the hedge , before me i espied a snow-white mountain lamb , with a maiden at its side .
no other sheep was near , the lamb was all alone , and by a slender cord was <unk> 'd to a stone . '
" now , we have no doubt this is all true : we <name> believe it , indeed we <name> , mr , w. is it sympathy for the sheep you wish to excite ?
i love a sheep from the bottom of my heart .
" but there are occasions , dear b   , there are occasions when even wordsworth is reasonable .
even <unk> , it is said , shall have an end , and the most unlucky blunders must come to a conclusion .
here is an extract from his preface : " 'those who have been accustomed to the phraseology of modern writers , if they persist in reading this book to a conclusion ( impossible !  ) <name> , no doubt , have to struggle with feelings of awkwardness ; ( <name> !
<name> !
<name> ! )
they <name> look round for poetry ( <name> !
<name> !
<name> !
<name> !
) , and <name> be induced to inquire by what species of courtesy these attempts have been permitted to assume that title . '
<name> !
<name> !
<name> !
<name> !
<name> !
" yet , let not mr. w. despair ; he has given immortality to a wagon , and the <name> sophocles has transmitted to eternity a sore toe , and dignified a tragedy with a chorus of turkeys .
" of coleridge , i can not speak but with reverence .
his towering intellect !
his gigantic power !
to use an author quoted by himself , <unk> <unk> <unk> que la <unk> des <unk> <unk> <unk> dans une <unk> <unk> de ce <unk> <unk> , mais non pas en ce <unk> <unk> ; ' and to employ his own language , he has imprisoned his own conceptions by the barrier he has erected against those of others .
it is lamentable to think that such a mind should be buried in metaphysics , and , like the <unk> , waste its perfume upon the night alone .
in reading that man 's poetry , i tremble like one who stands upon a volcano , conscious from the very darkness bursting from the crater , of the fire and the light that are weltering below .
" what is poetry ?  poetry !
that <unk> idea , with as many <unk> as the <unk> <unk> !
'give me , ' i demanded of a scholar some time ago , 'give me a definition of poetry . '
<unk> ;  ' and he proceeded to his library , brought me a dr. <name> , and overwhelmed me with a definition .
shade of the immortal shakespeare !
i imagine to myself the scowl of your spiritual eye upon the profanity of that <unk> <unk> <name> .
think of poetry , dear b   , think of poetry , and then think of dr. <name> <name> !
think of all that is airy and <unk> , and then of all that is hideous and unwieldy ; think of his huge bulk , the elephant !
and then  and then think of the <unk> '  the <unk> night 's dream '  <unk>  <unk>  and <unk> !
" a poem , in my opinion , is opposed to a work of science by having , for its immediate object , pleasure , not truth ; to romance , by having , for its object , an indefinite instead of a definite pleasure , being a poem only so far as this object is attained ; romance presenting perceptible images with definite , poetry with <unk> sensations , to which end music is an essential , since the comprehension of sweet sound is our most indefinite <name> .
music , when combined with a pleasurable idea , is poetry ; music , without the idea , is simply music ; the idea , without the music , is prose , from its very <unk> .
" what was meant by the <unk> against him who had no music in his soul ?
" to sum up this long <unk> , i have , dear b   , what you , no doubt , perceive , for the metaphysical poets as poets , the most sovereign contempt .
that they have followers proves nothing : " 'no indian <name> has to his palace more followers than a thief to the gallows . ' "

true daughter of old time thou <name> !
who <unk> all things with thy peering eyes .
why <unk> thou thus upon the poet 's heart , vulture , whose wings are dull realities how should he love thee ?
or how deem thee wise , who wouldst not leave him in his wandering to seek for treasure in the jewelled skies , albeit he soared with an undaunted wing !
hast thou not dragged <name> from her car ?
and driven the <unk> from the wood to seek a shelter in some happier <name> ?
hast thou not torn the <unk> from her flood , the <unk> from the green grass , and from me the summer dream beneath the <unk> tree ?

of molten stars their pavement , such as fall [ 16 ] thro ' the <unk> air , <unk> the pall of their own dissolution , while they die  adorning then the dwellings of the sky .
a dome , by linked light from heaven let down , sat gently on these columns as a crown  a window of one circular <name> , there , look 'd out above into the purple air and rays from god shot down that meteor chain and <unk> 'd all the beauty twice again , save when , between th ' <unk> and that ring , some eager spirit flapp 'd his dusky wing .
but on the pillars seraph eyes have seen the dimness of this world : that <unk> green that nature loves the best for beauty 's grave <unk> 'd in each cornice , round each <unk>  and every sculptured cherub <unk> that from his marble dwelling peered out , seem 'd earthly in the shadow of his niche  <unk> statues in a world so <name> ?

oh , the wave [ 18 ] is now upon thee  but too late to save !
sound loves to revel in a summer night : witness the murmur of the gray twilight that stole upon the ear , in <unk> [ 19 ] , of many a wild <unk> long ago  that <unk> ever on the ear of him who , musing , <unk> on the distance dim , and sees the darkness coming as a cloud  is not its form  its voice  most palpable and loud ?
[ 20 ] but what is this ?  it cometh  and it brings a music with it  't is the rush of wings  a pause  and then a sweeping , falling strain , and <unk> is in her halls again .
from the wild energy of wanton haste her cheeks were flushing , and her lips apart ; the zone that clung around her gentle waist had burst beneath the heaving of her heart .
within the centre of that hall to breathe she <unk> 'd and panted , <unk> !
all beneath , the <name> light that kiss 'd her golden hair and long 'd to rest , yet could but <name> there !
young flowers were whispering in <name> [ 21 ] to happy flowers that night  and tree to tree ; fountains were gushing music as they fell in many a <unk> grove , or <unk> <name> ; yet silence came upon material things  fair flowers , bright waterfalls and <name> wings  and sound alone that from the spirit sprang bore burthen to the charm the maiden sang : " <unk> <unk> or <unk>  or tufted wild spray that keeps , from the dreamer , the <unk> away  [ 22 ] bright beings !

wherever thy image may be , no magic shall sever thy music from thee .
thou hast bound many eyes in a dreamy sleep  but the strains still arise which thy vigilance keep  the sound of the rain which leaps down to the flower , and dances again in the rhythm of the shower  the murmur that springs [ 24 ] from the growing of grass are the music of things  but are <unk> 'd , alas !

spirits in wing , and angels to the view , a thousand <unk> burst th ' <unk> thro ' , young dreams still hovering on their drowsy flight  <unk> in all but " knowledge , " the keen light that fell , <unk> , thro ' thy bounds afar , o death !

may my weary spirit dwell  apart from heaven 's eternity  and yet how far from hell !
[ 26 ] what guilty spirit , in what shrubbery dim heard not the stirring summons of that hymn ?
but two : they fell : for heaven no <name> imparts to those who hear not for their beating hearts .
a <unk> and her <unk>  o !
where ( and ye may seek the wide skies over ) was love , the blind , near sober duty known ?
<unk> love hath fallen  'mid " tears of perfect moan . "
[ 27 ] he was a goodly spirit  he who fell : a wanderer by <unk> well  a <unk> on the lights that shine above  a dreamer in the <unk> by his love : what wonder ?
for each <name> is <unk> there , and looks so sweetly down on beauty 's hair  and they , and ev'ry mossy spring were holy to his <unk> heart and melancholy .
the night had found ( to him a night of wo ) upon a mountain crag , young <name>  <unk> it bends athwart the solemn sky , and <unk> on starry worlds that down beneath it lie .
here sate he with his love  his dark eye bent with eagle gaze along the firmament : now turn 'd it upon her  but ever then it trembled to the orb of earth again .
" <unk> , dearest , see !
how dim that <name> !
how lovely 't is to look so far away !
she seemed not thus upon that autumn <name> i left her gorgeous halls  nor mourned to leave , that <name>  that <name>  i should remember well  the <unk> dropped , in <unk> with a spell on th ' <unk> carving of a gilded hall wherein i sate , and on the <unk> wall  and on my eyelids  o , the heavy light !
how drowsily it weighed them into night !
on flowers , before , and mist , and love they ran with persian saadi in his <unk> : but o , that light !  i slumbered  death , the while , stole o'er my senses in that lovely isle so softly that no single silken hair awoke that slept  or knew that he was there .
" the last spot of earth 's orb i trod upon was a proud <name> called the parthenon ; [ 28 ] more beauty clung around her <unk> wall then even thy glowing bosom beats withal , [ 29 ] and when old time my wing did <unk> thence sprang i  as the eagle from his tower , and years i left behind me in an hour .
what time upon her airy bounds i <name> , one half the garden of her globe was flung <unk> as a chart unto my view  <unk> cities of the desert too !
<unk> , beauty crowded on me then , and half i wished to be again of men . "
" my <name> !
and why of them to be ?
a brighter <unk> is here for thee  and greener fields than in <name> world above , and woman 's loveliness  and passionate love . "
" but list , <unk> !
when the air so soft failed , as my <unk> spirit <unk> aloft , [ 30 ] perhaps my <name> grew dizzy  but the world i left so late was into chaos hurled , sprang from her station , on the winds apart , and rolled a flame , the fiery heaven athwart .
methought , my sweet one , then i ceased to soar , and fell  not swiftly as i rose before , but with a downward , tremulous motion <unk> light , brazen rays , this golden <name> unto !
nor long the measure of my falling hours , for nearest of all stars was thine to ours  dread <name> !
that came , amid a night of mirth , a red <unk> on the timid earth . "
" we came  and to thy earth  but not to us be given our <name> 's bidding to discuss : we came , my love ; around , above , below , <name> <unk> of the night we come and go , nor ask a reason save the <unk> she grants to us as granted by her god  but , <name> , than thine gray time <unk> never his <name> wing o'er fairer world !
dim was its little disk , and <name> eyes alone could see the phantom in the skies , when first <name> aaraaf knew her course to be headlong <unk> o'er the starry sea  but when its <name> swelled upon the sky , as glowing beauty 's bust beneath man 's eye , we paused before the heritage of men , and thy <name> trembled  as doth beauty then ! "
thus in discourse , the lovers <unk> away the night that waned and waned and brought no day .
they fell : for heaven to them no <name> imparts who hear not for the beating of their hearts .

kind solace in a dying hour !
such , father , is not ( now ) my theme  i <name> not madly deem that power of earth may <unk> me of the sin unearthly pride hath revelled in  i have no time to <unk> or dream : you call it <name>  that fire of fire !
it is but agony of <name> : if i can <name>  o god !
i can  its <unk> is <unk>  more divine  i would not call thee fool , old man , but such is not a gift of thine .
know thou the secret of a spirit bowed from its wild pride into shame o yearning heart !
i did inherit thy withering portion with the fame , the <unk> <name> which hath shone amid the jewels of my throne , halo of hell !
and with a pain not hell shall make me fear again  o craving heart , for the lost flowers and <name> of my summer hours !
the undying voice of that dead time , with its interminable chime , rings , in the spirit of a spell , upon thy emptiness  a knell .
i have not always been as now : the fevered <unk> on my brow i claimed and won <unk>  hath not the same fierce <unk> given rome to the cæsar  this to me ?
the heritage of a kingly mind , and a proud spirit which hath striven triumphantly with human kind .
on mountain soil i first <name> life : the mists of the <unk> have shed nightly their dews upon my head , and , i believe , the winged strife and tumult of the headlong air have nestled in my very hair .
so late from heaven  that dew  it fell ( 'mid dreams of an unholy night ) upon me with the touch of hell , while the red flashing of the light from clouds that <name> , like banners , o'er , appeared to my <unk> eye the pageantry of monarchy ; and the deep <unk> 's roar came hurriedly upon me , telling of human battle , where my voice , my own voice , silly child !  was swelling ( o !
how my spirit would rejoice , and leap within me at the cry ) the <unk> of victory !
the rain came down upon my head <unk>  and the heavy wind rendered me mad and deaf and blind .
it was but man , i thought , who shed laurels upon me : and the rush  the torrent of the chilly air gurgled within my ear the crush of empires  with the captive 's prayer  the hum of suitors  and the tone of flattery 'round a sovereign 's throne .
my passions , from that hapless hour , usurped a tyranny which men have deemed since i have reached to power , my innate nature  be it so : but , father , there lived one who , then , then  in my boyhood  when their fire burned with a still <unk> glow ( for passion must , with youth , expire ) e'en then who knew this iron heart in woman 's weakness had a part .
i have no words  alas !  to tell the loveliness of loving well !
nor would i now attempt to trace the more than beauty of a face whose <unk> , upon my mind , are  shadows on th ' unstable wind : thus i remember having dwelt some <name> of early <name> upon , with loitering eye , till i have felt the letters  with their meaning  melt to <unk>  with none .
o , she was worthy of all love !
love as in infancy was mine  't was such as <name> minds above might envy ; her young heart the shrine on which my every <name> and thought were incense  then a goodly gift , for they were childish and upright  pure  as her young example taught : why did i leave it , and , adrift , trust to the fire within , for light ?
we grew in age  and love  together  roaming the forest , and the wild ; my breast her shield in wintry weather  and , when the friendly <name> smiled .
and she would <name> the opening skies , i saw no heaven  but in her eyes .
young love 's first lesson is   the heart : for 'mid that <name> , and those smiles , when , from our little cares apart , and laughing at her girlish wiles , i 'd throw me on her throbbing breast , and pour my spirit out in tears  there was no need to speak the rest  no need to quiet any fears of her  who asked no reason why , but turned on me her quiet eye !
yet more than worthy of the love my spirit struggled with , and strove when , on the mountain peak , alone , ambition lent it a new tone  i had no being  but in thee : the world , and all it did contain in the earth  the air  the sea  its <name>  its little lot of pain that was new pleasure  the ideal , dim , vanities of dreams by night  and <unk> <unk> which were real  ( shadows  and a more shadowy light ! )
parted upon their <name> wings , and , so , confusedly , became thine image and  a name  a name !
two separate  yet most intimate things .
i was ambitious  have you known the passion , father ?
you have not : a <unk> , i marked a throne of half the world as all my own , and murmured at such lowly lot  but , just like any other dream , upon the vapor of the dew my own had past , did not the beam of beauty which did while it <unk> the minute  the hour  the day  oppress my mind with double loveliness .
we walked together on the crown of a high mountain which looked down afar from its proud natural towers of rock and forest , on the hills  the dwindled hills !
<unk> with bowers and shouting with a thousand <unk> .
i spoke to her of power and pride , but <unk>  in such guise that she might deem it nought beside the moment 's converse ; in her eyes i read , perhaps too carelessly  a mingled feeling with my own  the flush on her bright cheek , to me seemed to become a queenly throne too well that i should let it be light in the wilderness alone .
i wrapped myself in grandeur then , and donned a visionary crown  yet it was not that <unk> had thrown her mantle over me  but that , among the rabble  men , lion ambition is chained down  and <unk> to a keeper 's hand  not so in deserts where the grand  the wild  the terrible conspire with their own breath to fan his fire .
look 'round thee now on <unk> !  is she not <name> of earth ?
her pride above all cities ?
in her hand their destinies ?
in all beside of <name> which the world hath known stands she not nobly and alone ?
falling  her veriest <unk> shall form the pedestal of a throne  and who her sovereign ?
<unk>  he whom the astonished people saw striding o'er empires haughtily a <unk> outlaw !
o , human love !
thou spirit given , on earth , of all we <name> in heaven !
which <unk> into the soul like rain upon the <unk> plain , and , failing in thy power to bless , but <unk> the heart a wilderness !
idea !
which <unk> life around with music of so strange a sound and beauty of so wild a birth  farewell !
for i have won the earth .
when <name> , the eagle that towered , could see no <name> beyond him in the sky , his pinions were bent <unk>  and homeward turned his softened eye .
't was sunset : when the sun <name> part there comes a <unk> of heart to him who still would look upon the <name> of the summer sun .
that soul <name> hate the <unk> mist so often lovely , and <name> list to the sound of the coming darkness ( known to those whose spirits hearken ) as one who , in a dream of night , would fly , but cannot , from a danger nigh .
what tho ' the moon  tho ' the white moon shed all the splendor of her noon , her smile is chilly  and her beam , in that time of <unk> , <name> seem ( so like you gather in your breath ) a portrait taken after death .
and boyhood is a summer sun whose waning is the <unk> one  for all we live to know is known , and all we seek to keep hath flown  let life , then , as the <unk> , fall with the <unk> beauty  which is all .
i reached my home  my home no more  for all had flown who made it so .
i passed from out its mossy door , and , tho ' my tread was soft and low , a voice came from the threshold stone of one whom i had earlier known  o , i defy thee , hell , to show on beds of fire that burn below , an humbler heart  a deeper woe .
father , i firmly do believe  i know  for death who comes for me from regions of the blest afar , where there is nothing to deceive , hath left his iron gate ajar .
and rays of truth you can not see are flashing thro ' eternity   i do believe that eblis hath a snare in every human path  else how , when in the holy grove i wandered of the idol , love ,  who daily scents his snowy wings with incense of <unk> from the most <unk> things , whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven above with <unk> rays from heaven no <unk> may shun  no <unk> fly  the <unk> of his eagle eye  how was it that ambition crept , unseen , amid the revels there , till growing bold , he laughed and <unk> in the <unk> of love 's very hair !

ah , by no wind those clouds are driven that rustle through the unquiet heaven unceasingly , from morn till even , over the violets there that lie in myriad types of the human eye  over the lilies that wave and weep above a nameless grave !

yes , heaven is thine ; but this is a world of sweets and <unk> ; our flowers are merely  flowers , and the shadow of thy perfect bliss is the <name> of ours .

that blush , perhaps , was maiden shame  as such it well may pass  though its glow hath raised a fiercer flame in the breast of him , alas !

thy soul shall find itself alone 'mid dark thoughts of the gray tombstone not one , of all the crowd , to pry into thine hour of secrecy .
be silent in that solitude which is not loneliness  for then the spirits of the dead who stood in life before thee are again in death around thee  and their <name> shall <unk> thee : be still .
the night  tho ' clear  shall frown  and the stars shall not look down from their high thrones in the heaven , with light like <name> to mortals given  but their red orbs , without beam , to thy weariness shall seem as a burning and a fever which would cling to thee forever .
now are thoughts thou shalt not banish  now are visions ne'er to vanish  from thy spirit shall they pass no more  like <unk> from the grass .

that holy dream  that holy dream , while all the world were <unk> , hath cheered me as a lovely beam , a lonely spirit guiding .

of late , eternal condor years so shake the very heaven on high with tumult as they thunder by , i have no time for idle cares though gazing on the unquiet sky .

* * * * * fairyland .
dim <unk>  and shadowy floods  and <unk> woods , whose forms we ca n't discover for the tears that drip all over huge moons there wax and <unk>  again  again  again  every moment of the night  forever changing places  and they put out the <unk> with the breath from their pale faces .
about twelve by the <unk> one more filmy than the rest ( a kind which , upon trial , they have found to be the best ) comes down  still down  and down with its centre on the crown of a mountain 's eminence , while its wide circumference in easy drapery falls over hamlets , over halls , wherever they may be  o'er the strange woods  o'er the sea  over spirits on the wing  over every drowsy thing  and buries them up quite in a labyrinth of light  and then , how deep !  o , deep !
is the passion of their sleep .
in the morning they arise , and their <unk> covering is soaring in the skies , with the tempests as they toss , like  almost any thing  or a yellow albatross .
they use that moon no more for the same end as before  <unk> a tent  which i think extravagant : its <unk> , however , into a shower <unk> , of which those butterflies , of earth , who seek the skies , and so come down again ( <unk> thing ! )
have brought a specimen upon their quivering wings .
1831 * * * * * the lake .
in spring of youth it was my lot to haunt of the wide world a spot the which i could not love the less  so lovely was the loneliness of a wild lake , with black rock bound , and the tall pines that towered around .
but when the night had thrown her pall upon the spot , as upon all , and the mystic wind went by murmuring in <name>  then  ah , then , i would awake to the terror of the lone lake .
yet that terror was not fright , but a tremulous delight  a feeling not the jewelled mine could teach or bribe me to define  nor love  although the love were thine .
death was in that poisonous wave , and in its gulf a fitting grave for him who thence could solace bring to his lone imagining  whose solitary soul could make an <name> of that dim lake .

i gazed awhile on her cold smile ; too cold  too cold for me  there passed , as a shroud , a fleecy cloud , and i turned away to thee , proud evening <name> , in thy <name> afar and dearer thy beam shall be ; for <name> to my heart is the proud part thou <unk> in heaven at night , and more i admire thy distant fire , than that colder , lowly light .

* * * * * imitation .
a dark <unk> tide of interminable pride  a mystery , and a dream , should my early life seem ; i say that dream was fraught with a wild and waking thought of beings that have been , which my spirit hath not seen , had i let them pass me by , with a dreaming eye !
let none of earth inherit that vision on my spirit ; those thoughts i would control , as a spell upon his soul : for that bright <name> at last and that light time have past , and my <unk> rest hath gone with a sigh as it passed on : i care not though it perish with a thought i then did <name> .

oh !
that my young life were a lasting dream !
my spirit not awakening , till the beam of an eternity should bring the morrow .
yes !
though that long dream were of hopeless sorrow , 'twere better than the cold reality of waking life , to him whose heart must be , and hath been still , upon the lovely earth , a chaos of deep passion , from his birth .
but should it be  that dream eternally continuing  as dreams have been to me in my young boyhood  should it thus be given , 'twere folly still to <name> for higher heaven .
for i have revelled when the sun was bright i ' the summer sky , in dreams of living light and loveliness ,  have left my very heart inclines of my imaginary apart [ 1 ] from mine own home , with beings that have been of mine own thought  what more could i have seen ?
't was once  and only once  and the wild hour from my remembrance shall not pass  some power or spell had bound me  't was the chilly wind came o'er me in the night , and left behind its image on my spirit  or the moon shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon too coldly  or the stars  <unk> it was that dream was that that <unk>  let it pass .
i have been happy , though in a dream .
i have been happy  and i love the theme : dreams !
in their vivid coloring of life as in that fleeting , shadowy , <name> strife of semblance with reality which brings to the delirious eye , more lovely things of paradise and love  and all my own !  than young <name> in his <unk> hour hath known .
[ footnote 1 : in climes of mine imagining apart ?  <name> . ]
* * * * * " in youth i have known one . "
how often we forget all time , when lone admiring nature 's universal throne ; her woods  her wilds  her mountains  the intense reply of hers to our intelligence !  i .
in youth i have known one with whom the earth in secret <unk> held  as he with it , in daylight , and in beauty , from his birth : whose <unk> , flickering torch of life was lit from the sun and stars , whence he had drawn forth a passionate light such for his spirit was fit  and yet that spirit knew  not in the hour of its own fervor  what had o'er it power .
ii .
perhaps it may be that my mind is wrought to a <unk> [ 1 ] by the <unk> that hangs o'er , but i <name> half believe that wild light fraught with more of sovereignty than ancient <name> hath ever told  or is it of a thought the <unk> essence , and no more that with a quickening spell doth o'er us pass as dew of the <unk> , o'er the summer grass ?
iii .
doth o'er us pass , when , as th ' expanding eye to the loved object  so the tear to the lid <name> start , which lately slept in apathy ?
and yet it need not be  ( that object ) hid from us in life  but common  which doth lie each hour before us  but then only bid with a strange sound , as of a <unk> broken t ' awake us  't is a symbol and a token  iv .
of what in other worlds shall be  and given in beauty by our god , to those alone who otherwise would fall from life and heaven drawn by their heart 's passion , and that tone , that high tone of the spirit which hath striven though not with <name>  with <unk>  whose throne with desperate energy 't hath beaten down ; wearing its own deep feeling as a crown .

how shall the burial rite be read ?

the <unk> for the loveliest dead , that ever died so young ?
ii .
her friends are gazing on her , and on her gaudy bier , and weep !  oh !
to dishonor dead beauty with a tear !
iii .
they loved her for her wealth  and they hated her for her pride  but she grew in feeble health , and they love her  that she died .
iv .
they tell me ( while they speak of her " costly <unk> 'd pall " ) that my voice is growing weak  that i should not sing at all  v. or that my tone should be <unk> 'd to such solemn song so mournfully  so mournfully , that the dead may feel no wrong .
<name> .
but she is gone above , with young <name> at her side , and i am drunk with love of the dead , who is my <unk>  vii .
of the dead  dead who lies all <unk> 'd there , with the death upon her eyes .
and the life upon her hair .
viii .
thus on the coffin loud and long i strike  the murmur sent through the gray chambers to my song , shall be the accompaniment .

on the " poems written in youth " little comment is needed .
this section includes the pieces printed for the first volume of 1827 ( which was subsequently suppressed ) , such poems from the first and second published volumes of 1829 and 1831 as have not already been given in their revised <unk> , and a few others collected from various sources .
" <name> aaraaf " first appeared , with the sonnet " to silence " <unk> to it , in 1829 , and is , substantially , as originally issued .
in the edition for 1831 , however , this poem , its author 's longest , was introduced by the following twenty-nine lines , which have been omitted in all subsequent collections : <name> aaraaf .
mysterious <name> !
thou wert my dream all a long summer night  be now my theme !
by this clear stream , of thee <name> i write ; meantime from afar bathe me in light !
thy world has not the dross of ours , yet all the beauty  all the flowers that list our love or deck our bowers in dreamy gardens , where do lie dreamy maidens all the day ; while the silver winds of <unk> on <name> couches faint away .
little  oh !
little dwells in thee like unto what on earth we see : beauty 's eye is here the <unk> in the <unk> and <unk>  on the sweetest air doth float the most sad and solemn note  if with thee be broken hearts , <name> so peacefully departs , that its <name> still doth dwell , like the murmur in the shell .
thou !
thy truest type of grief is the gently falling leaf  thou !
thy framing is so holy sorrow is not melancholy .
* * * * * 31 .
the earliest version of " <unk> " was included in the suppressed volume of 1827 , but differs very considerably from the poem as now published .
the present draft , besides innumerable verbal alterations and improvements upon the original , is more carefully <unk> , and , the lines being indented , presents a more pleasing appearance , to the eye at least .
* * * * * 32 .
" to <name> " first appeared in the 1831 volume , as did also " the valley of unrest " ( as " the valley <unk> " ) , " <unk> , " and one or two others of the youthful pieces .
the poem styled " romance " constituted the preface of the 1829 volume , but with the addition of the following lines : succeeding years , too wild for song , then rolled like tropic storms along , where , though the <unk> lights that fly dying along the troubled sky , lay bare , through vistas <unk> , the blackness of the general heaven , that very blackness yet doth fling light on the lightning 's silver wing .
for being an idle boy <name> syne , who read <unk> and drank wine , i early found <unk> rhymes were almost passionate sometimes  and by strange <unk> of <name> his pleasures always turned to pain  his <unk> to wild <name>  his wit to love  his wine to fire  and so , being young and <unk> in folly , i fell in love with melancholy .
and used to throw my earthly rest and quiet all away in jest  i could not love except where death was mingling his with beauty 's breath  or <unk> , time , and <name> , were stalking between her and me .
* * * * * but now my soul hath too much room  gone are the <name> and the gloom  the black hath mellow 'd into gray , and all the fires are fading away .
my draught of passion hath been deep  i <unk> 'd , and i now would sleep  and after drunkenness of soul succeeds the glories of the bowl  an idle longing night and day to dream my very life away .
but dreams  of those who dream as i , <unk> , are damned , and die : yet should i swear i mean alone , by notes so very shrilly blown , to break upon time 's monotone , while yet my <unk> <name> and grief are <unk> of the yellow leaf  why not an imp the <unk> hath , <name> shake his shadow in my path  and e'en the <unk> <name> <unk> <unk> my <unk> .
* * * * * doubtful poems .
* * * * * alone .
from childhood 's hour i have not been as others were  i have not seen as others saw  i could not bring my passions from a common spring  from the same source i have not taken my sorrow  i could not awaken my heart to <name> at the same tone  and all i loved  i loved alone  thou  in my childhood  in the <name> of a most <name> life  was drawn from every depth of good and ill the mystery which binds me still  from the torrent , or the fountain  from the red <name> of the mountain  from the sun that round me <unk> in its autumn tint of gold  from the lightning in the sky as it passed me flying by  from the thunder and the storm  and the cloud that took the form ( when the rest of heaven was blue ) of a demon in my view .

beneath the <unk> eaves , whose shadows fall before thy lowly cottage door  under the lilac 's tremulous leaves  within thy snowy clasped hand the purple flowers it bore .
last <name> in dreams , i saw thee stand , like queenly <unk> from <unk>  <unk> of the flowery wand , most <unk> <unk> !
ii .
and when i bade the dream upon thy spirit flee , thy <name> eyes to me upturned , did overflowing seem with the deep , untold delight of love 's serenity ; thy classic brow , like lilies white and pale as the imperial night upon her throne , with stars <unk> , <unk> my soul to thee !
iii .
ah !
ever i behold thy dreamy , passionate eyes , blue as the languid skies <name> with the sunset 's fringe of gold ; now strangely clear thine image grows , and olden memories are startled from their long repose like shadows on the silent snows when suddenly the <unk> blows where quiet moonlight lies .
iv .
like music heard in dreams , like strains of <unk> unknown , of birds for ever flown ,  audible as the voice of streams that murmur in some leafy <name> , i hear thy gentlest tone , and silence cometh with her spell like that which on my tongue doth dwell , when tremulous in dreams i tell my love to thee alone !
v. in every valley heard , floating from tree to tree , less beautiful to me , the music of the radiant bird , than artless accents such as thine whose echoes never flee !
ah !
how for thy sweet voice i pine :  for uttered in thy tones benign ( <unk> ! )
this rude name of mine doth seem a <name> !
* * * * * the village street .
in these rapid , restless shadows , once i walked at eventide , when a gentle , silent maiden , walked in beauty at my side .
she alone there walked beside me all in beauty , like a bride .
<unk> the moon was shining on the dewy meadows nigh ; on the silvery , silent rivers , on the mountains far and high ,  on the ocean 's <unk> waters , where the winds <unk> die .
slowly , silently we wandered from the open cottage door , underneath the elm 's long branches to the pavement bending o'er ; underneath the mossy <name> and the dying <unk> .
with the myriad stars in beauty all <unk> , the heavens were seen , radiant hopes were bright around me , like the light of stars serene ; like the mellow midnight splendor of the night 's <unk> <name> .
audibly the <unk> whispered peaceful , pleasant melodies , like the distant murmured music of unquiet , lovely seas ; while the winds were hushed in slumber in the fragrant flowers and trees .
wondrous and unwonted beauty still adorning all did seem , while i told my love in fables 'neath the willows by the stream ; would the heart have kept unspoken love that was its rarest dream !
instantly away we wandered in the shadowy twilight tide , she , the silent , scornful maiden , walking calmly at my side , with a step serene and stately , all in beauty , all in pride .
vacantly i walked beside her .
on the earth mine eyes were cast ; swift and keen there came unto me bitter memories of the past  on me , like the rain in autumn on the dead leaves , cold and fast .
underneath the elms we parted , by the lowly cottage door ; one brief word alone was uttered  never on our lips before ; and away i walked <unk> , broken-hearted evermore .
slowly , silently i loitered , homeward , in the night , alone ; sudden anguish bound my spirit , that my youth had never known ; wild unrest , like that which cometh when the night 's first dream hath flown .
now , to me the <unk> whisper mad , discordant melodies , and keen melodies like shadows haunt the moaning <name> trees , and the sycamores with laughter mock me in the nightly breeze .
sad and pale the autumn moonlight through the sighing foliage streams ; and each morning , midnight shadow , shadow of my sorrow seems ; strive , o heart , forget thine idol !
and , o soul , forget thy dreams !
* * * * * the forest reverie .
't is said that when the hands of men tamed this primeval wood , and hoary trees with groans of wo , like warriors by an unknown foe , were in their strength subdued , the virgin earth gave instant birth to springs that ne'er did flow  that in the sun did rivulets run , and all around rare flowers did blow  the wild rose pale perfumed the <name> , and the queenly <name> <unk> the <name> ( whom the sun and the dew and the winds did woo ) , with the gourd and the grape luxuriant grew .
so when in tears the love of years is wasted like the snow , and the fine <unk> of its life by the rude wrong of instant strife are broken at a blow  within the heart do springs upstart of which it doth now know , and strange , sweet dreams , like silent streams that from new fountains overflow , with the earlier tide of rivers glide deep in the heart whose <name> has died  <unk> the fires its ashes hide ,  its ashes , whence <name> spring and grow sweet flowers , ere long ,  the rare and radiant flowers of song !
* * * * * notes .
of the many verses from time to time ascribed to the pen of <name> poe , and not included among his known writings , the lines entitled " alone " have the chief claim to our notice .
<unk> ' copies of this piece had been in possession of the present editor some time previous to its publication in <unk> 's magazine ' for <name> 1875 ; but as proofs of the authorship claimed for it were not forthcoming , he refrained from publishing it as requested .
the desired proofs have not yet been adduced , and there is , at present , nothing but internal evidence to guide us .
" alone " is stated to have been written by poe in the album of a baltimore <name> ( mrs .
<unk> ?
) , on march 17th , 1829 , and the <unk> ' given in <unk> 's ' is alleged to be of his handwriting .
if the <unk> be poe 's , it is different in all essential respects from all the many specimens known to us , and strongly resembles that of the writer of the heading and <unk> of the manuscript , both of which the <unk> of the poem <unk> to have been recently added .
the lines , however , if not by poe , are the most successful imitation of his early <unk> yet made public , and , in the opinion of one well qualified to speak , " are not unworthy on the whole of the parentage claimed for them . "
whilst <name> poe was editor of the <unk> journal ' , some lines " to <unk> " appeared therein , and , like several of his known pieces , bore no signature .
they were at once ascribed to poe , and in order to satisfy <unk> , an editorial paragraph subsequently appeared , saying they were by " a. <unk> , <name> . "
two previous poems had appeared in the <unk> journal ' over the signature of " a. m. <unk> , " and whoever wrote them was also the author of the lines " to <unk> . "
in order , doubtless , to give a show of variety , poe was then publishing some of his known works in his journal over <unk> de plume ' , and as no other writings whatever can be traced to any person bearing the name of " a. m. <unk> , " it is not impossible that the poems now republished in this collection may be by the author of " the <name> . "
having been published without his usual elaborate revision , poe may have wished to hide his hasty work under an assumed name .
the three pieces are included in the present collection , so the reader can judge for himself what pretensions they possess to be by the author of " the <name> . "

" <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> est . "
<unk> .
" la <unk> , " says <unk> , in those " <unk> <unk> " [ 1 ] which in all our translations we have insisted upon calling " moral tales , " as if in mockery of their spirit  " la <unk> est <name> <unk> des <unk> qui <unk> de <unk> : tous <name> <unk> <unk> des <unk> . "
he here <unk> the pleasure <unk> from sweet sounds with the capacity for creating them .
no more than any other talent , is that for music susceptible of complete enjoyment where there is no second party to appreciate its exercise ; and it is only in common with other talents that it produces effects which may be fully enjoyed in solitude .
the idea which the <unk> has either failed to entertain clearly , or has sacrificed in its expression to his national love of point , is doubtless the very <unk> one that the higher order of music is the most thoroughly estimated when we are exclusively alone .
the proposition in this form <name> be admitted at once by those who love the lyre for its own sake and for its spiritual uses .
but there is one pleasure still within the reach of fallen mortality , and perhaps only one , which owes even more than does music to the accessory sentiment of seclusion .
i mean the happiness experienced in the contemplation of natural scenery .
in truth , the man who would behold aright the <name> of god upon earth must in solitude behold that <name> .
to me at least the presence , not of human life only , but of life , in any other form than that of the green things which grow upon the soil and are voiceless , is a stain upon the landscape , is at war with the genius of the scene .
i love , indeed , to regard the dark valleys , and the gray rocks , and the waters that silently smile , and the forests that sigh in uneasy slumbers , and the proud watchful mountains that look down upon all ,  i love to regard these as themselves but the colossal members of one vast animate and <unk> whole  a whole whose form ( that of the sphere ) is the most perfect and most inclusive of all ; whose path is among associate planets ; whose meek <unk> is the moon ; whose <unk> sovereign is the sun ; whose life is eternity ; whose thought is that of a god ; whose enjoyment is knowledge ; whose destinies are lost in immensity ; whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our own cognizance of the <unk> which infest the <name> , a being which we in consequence regard as purely inanimate and material , much in the same manner as these <unk> must thus regard us .
our telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on every hand , notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the <unk> , that space , and therefore that bulk , is an important consideration in the eyes of the almighty .
the cycles in which the stars move are those best adapted for the evolution , without collision , of the greatest possible number of bodies .
the forms of those bodies are accurately such as within a given surface to include the greatest possible amount of matter ; while the surfaces themselves are so disposed as to accommodate a denser population than could be accommodated on the same surfaces otherwise arranged .
nor is it any argument against bulk being an object with god that space itself is infinite ; for there may be an infinity of matter to fill it ; and since we see clearly that the endowment of matter with vitality is a principle  indeed , as far as our judgments extend , the leading principle in the operations of deity , it is scarcely logical to imagine it confined to the regions of the minute , where we daily trace it , and not extending to those of the <name> .
as we find cycle within cycle without end , yet all revolving around one <unk> centre which is the <unk> , may we not <unk> suppose , in the same manner , life within life , the less within the greater , and all within the spirit divine ?
in short , we are madly erring through <unk> in believing man , in either his temporal or future destinies , to be of more moment in the universe than that vast " clod of the valley " which he <unk> and <unk> , and to which he denies a soul , for no more profound reason than that he does not behold it in operation [ 2 ] .
these fancies , and such as these , have always given to my meditations among the mountains and the forests , by the rivers and the ocean , a tinge of what the every-day world would not fail to term the fantastic .
my wanderings amid such scenes have been many and <unk> , and often solitary ; and the interest with which i have strayed through many a dim deep valley , or gazed into the reflected heaven of many a bright lake , has been an interest greatly deepened by the thought that i have strayed and gazed <unk> what flippant frenchman [ 3 ] was it who said , in allusion to the well known work of <unk> , that  " la solitude est une <name> chose ; mais il <unk> <unk> pour vous dire que la solitude est une <name> chose "  ?
the <unk> can not be <unk> ; but the necessity is a thing that does not exist .
it was during one of my lonely <unk> , amid a far distant region of mountain locked within mountain , and sad rivers and melancholy <unk> writhing or sleeping within all , that i chanced upon a certain rivulet and island .
i came upon them suddenly in the leafy <name> , and threw myself upon the turf beneath the branches of an unknown odorous shrub , that i might doze as i contemplated the scene .
i felt that thus only should i look upon it , such was the character of <unk> which it wore .
on all sides , save to the west where the sun was about sinking , arose the verdant walls of the forest .
the little river which turned sharply in its course , and was thus immediately lost to sight , seemed to have no exit from its prison , but to be absorbed by the deep green foliage of the trees to the east ; while in the opposite quarter ( so it appeared to me as i lay at length and glanced upward ) there poured down noiselessly and continuously into the valley a <name> golden and crimson waterfall from the sunset fountains of the sky .
about midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in , one small circular island , profusely <unk> , reposed upon the bosom of the stream .
so blended bank and shadow there , that each seemed pendulous in air  so <unk> was the glassy water , that it was scarcely possible to say at what point upon the slope of the <name> turf its <name> dominion began .
my position enabled me to include in a single view both the eastern and western extremities of the islet , and i observed a <unk> difference in their aspects .
the latter was all one radiant harem of garden beauties .
it glowed and blushed beneath the eye of the slant sunlight , and fairly laughed with flowers .
the grass was short , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
the trees were lithe , mirthful , erect , bright , slender , and graceful , of eastern figure and foliage , with bark smooth , glossy , and <unk> .
there seemed a deep sense of life and <name> about all , and although no airs blew from out the heavens , yet everything had motion through the gentle <unk> to and fro of innumerable butterflies , that might have been mistaken for tulips with wings [ 4 ] .
the other or eastern end of the isle was <unk> in the blackest shade .
a sombre , yet beautiful and peaceful gloom , here pervaded all things .
the trees were dark in color and mournful in form and attitude  <unk> themselves into sad , solemn , and spectral shapes , that conveyed ideas of mortal sorrow and untimely death .
the grass wore the deep tint of the cypress , and the heads of its blades <name> <unk> , and hither and thither among it were many small unsightly hillocks , low and narrow , and not very long , that had the aspect of graves , but were not , although over and all about them the rue and the <name> clambered .
the shades of the trees fell heavily upon the water , and seemed to bury itself therein , <unk> the depths of the element with darkness .
i fancied that each shadow , as the sun descended lower and lower , separated itself sullenly from the trunk that gave it birth , and thus became absorbed by the stream , while other shadows issued momently from the trees , taking the place of their predecessors thus entombed .
this idea having once seized upon my fancy greatly excited it , and i lost myself forthwith in reverie .
" if ever island were enchanted , " said i to myself , " this is it .
this is the haunt of the few gentle <unk> who remain from the wreck of the race .
are these green tombs theirs ?  or do they yield up their sweet lives as mankind yield up their own ?
in dying , do they not rather waste away mournfully , rendering unto god little by little their existence , as these trees render up shadow after shadow , exhausting their substance unto dissolution ?
what the wasting tree is to the water that <unk> its shade , growing thus blacker by what it preys upon , may not the life of the <name> be to the death which <unk> it ? "
as i thus mused , with half-shut eyes , while the sun sank rapidly to rest , and <unk> currents <unk> round and round the island , bearing upon their bosom large dazzling white flakes of the bark of the <unk> , flakes which , in their multiform positions upon the water , a quick imagination might have converted into anything it pleased ; while i thus mused , it appeared to me that the form of one of those very <unk> about whom i had been pondering , made its way slowly into the darkness from out the light at the western end of the island .
she stood erect in a singularly fragile canoe , and urged it with the mere phantom of an oar .
while within the influence of the lingering <unk> , her attitude seemed indicative of <name> , but sorrow deformed it as she passed within the shade .
slowly she glided along , and at length rounded the islet and re-entered the region of light .
" the revolution which has just been made by the <name> , " continued i musingly , " is the cycle of the brief year of her life .
she has floated through her <name> and through her summer .
she is a year nearer unto death : for i did not fail to see that as she came into the shade , her shadow fell from her , and was swallowed up in the dark water , making its blackness more black . "
and again the boat appeared and the <name> , but about the attitude of the latter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of elastic <name> .
she floated again from out the light and into the gloom ( which deepened momently ) , and again her shadow fell from her into the <name> water , and became absorbed into its blackness .
and again and again she made the circuit of the island ( while the sun rushed down to his slumbers ) , and at each issuing into the light there was more sorrow about her person , while it grew feebler and far fainter and more indistinct , and at each passage into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade , which became <unk> in a shadow more black .
but at length , when the sun had utterly departed , the <name> , now the mere ghost of her former self , went disconsolately with her boat into the region of the <name> flood , and that she issued thence at all i can not say , for darkness fell over all things , and i beheld her magical figure no more .

'oinos . '
pardon , agathos , the weakness of a spirit <unk> with immortality !
'agathos . '
you have spoken nothing , my oinos , for which pardon is to be demanded .
not even here is knowledge a thing of intuition .
for wisdom , ask of the angels freely , that it may be given !
'oinos . '
but in this existence i dreamed that i should be at once cognizant of all things , and thus at once happy in being cognizant of all .
'agathos . '
ah , not in knowledge is happiness , but in the acquisition of knowledge !
in forever knowing , we are forever blessed ; but to know all , were the curse of a fiend .
'oinos . '
but does not the most high know all ?
'agathos ' .
that ( since he is the most happy ) must be still the one thing unknown even to him .
'oinos . '
but , since we grow hourly in knowledge , must not at last all things be known ?
'agathos . '
look down into the <unk> distances !  attempt to force the gaze down the multitudinous vistas of the stars , as we sweep slowly through them thus  and thus  and thus !
even the spiritual vision , is it not at all points arrested by the continuous golden walls of the universe ?  the walls of the myriads of the shining bodies that mere number has appeared to blend into unity ?
'oinos ' .
i clearly perceive that the infinity of matter is no dream .
'agathos ' .
there are no dreams in aidenn  but it is here whispered that , of this infinity of matter , the sole purpose is to afford infinite springs at which the soul may allay the thirst to know which is forever <unk> within it  since to <unk> it would be to extinguish the soul 's self .
question me then , my oinos , freely and without fear .
come !
we <name> leave to the left the loud <name> of the <unk> , and swoop outward from the throne into the starry meadows beyond orion , where , for pansies and violets , and <unk> , are the beds of the <unk> and <unk> suns .
'oinos ' .
and now , agathos , as we proceed , instruct me !  speak to me in the earth 's familiar tones !
i understand not what you hinted to me just now of the modes or of the methods of what during mortality , we were accustomed to call creation .
do you mean to say that the creator is not god ?
'agathos ' .
i mean to say that the deity does not create .
'oinos ' .
explain !
'agathos ' .
in the beginning only , he created .
the seeming creatures which are now throughout the universe so perpetually springing into being can only be considered as the <unk> or indirect , not as the direct or immediate results of the divine creative power .
'oinos . '
among men , my agathos , this idea would be considered <unk> in the extreme .
'agathos . '
among the angels , my oinos , it is seen to be simply true .
'oinos . '
i can comprehend you thus far  that certain operations of what we term nature , or the natural laws , <name> , under certain conditions , give rise to that which has all the appearance of creation .
shortly before the final overthrow of the earth , there were , i well remember , many very successful experiments in what some philosophers were weak enough to <unk> the creation of <unk> .
'agathos . '
the cases of which you speak were , in fact , instances of the secondary creation , and of the only species of creation which has ever been since the first word spoke into existence the first law .
'oinos . '
are not the starry worlds that , from the abyss of <unk> , burst hourly forth into the heavens  are not these stars , agathos , the immediate handiwork of the king ?
'agathos . '
let me endeavor , my oinos , to lead you , step by step , to the <name> i intend .
you are well aware that , as no thought can perish , so no act is without infinite result .
we moved our hands , for example , when we were dwellers on the earth , and in so doing we gave vibration to the atmosphere which <unk> it .
this vibration was indefinitely extended till it gave impulse to every particle of the earth 's air , which thenceforward , and forever , was actuated by the one movement of the hand .
this fact the mathematicians of our globe well knew .
they made the special effects , indeed , wrought in the fluid by special impulses , the subject of exact calculation  so that it became easy to determine in what precise period an impulse of given extent would <unk> the orb , and impress ( forever ) every atom of the atmosphere <unk> .
<unk> , they found no difficulty ; from a given effect , under given conditions , in determining the value of the original impulse .
now the mathematicians who saw that the results of any given impulse were absolutely endless  and who saw that a portion of these results were accurately traceable through the agency of <unk> analysis  who saw , too , the facility of the <unk>  these men saw , at the same time , that this species of analysis itself had within itself a capacity for indefinite progress  that there were no bounds conceivable to its advancement and <unk> , except within the intellect of him who advanced or applied it .
but at this point our mathematicians paused .
'oinos . '
and why , agathos , should they have proceeded ?
'agathos . '
because there were some considerations of deep interest beyond .
it was <unk> from what they knew , that to a being of infinite understanding  one to whom the perfection of the <unk> analysis lay unfolded  there could be no difficulty in tracing every impulse given the air  and the ether through the air  to the remotest consequences at any even infinitely remote epoch of time .
it is indeed <unk> that every such impulse given the air , must in the end impress every individual thing that exists within the universe ;   and the being of infinite understanding  the being whom we have imagined  might trace the remote undulations of the impulse  trace them upward and onward in their influences upon all particles of all matter  upward and onward forever in their modifications of old forms  or , in other words , in their creation of new  until he found them reflected  <unk> at last  back from the throne of the <unk> .
and not only could such a being do this , but at any epoch , should a given result be afforded him  should one of these numberless comets , for example , be presented to his inspection  he could have no difficulty in determining , by the <unk> <unk> , to what original impulse it was due .
this power of <unk> in its absolute fulness and perfection  this faculty of referring at all epochs , all effects to all causes  is of course the prerogative of the deity alone  but in every variety of degree , short of the absolute perfection , is the power itself exercised by the whole host of the <name> <unk> .
'oinos ' .
but you speak merely of impulses upon the air .
'agathos ' .
in speaking of the air , i referred only to the earth : but the general proposition has reference to impulses upon the ether  which , since it pervades , and alone pervades all space , is thus the great medium of creation .
'oinos ' .
then all motion , of whatever nature , creates ?
'agathos ' .
it must : but a true philosophy has long taught that the source of all motion is thought  and the source of all thought is  'oinos ' .
god .
'agathos ' .
i have spoken to you , oinos , as to a child , of the fair earth which lately perished  of impulses upon the atmosphere of the earth .
'oinos ' .
you did .
'agathos ' .
and while i thus spoke , did there not cross your mind some thought of the physical power of words ?
is not every word an impulse on the air ?
'oinos ' .
but why , agathos , do you weep  and why , oh , why do your wings droop as we hover above this fair <name>  which is the <unk> and yet most terrible of all we have encountered in our flight ?
its brilliant flowers look like a <name> dream  but its fierce volcanoes like the passions of a turbulent heart .
'agathos ' .
they are !  they are !  this wild <name>  it is now three centuries since , with clasped hands , and with streaming eyes , at the feet of my beloved  i spoke it  with a few passionate sentences  into birth .
its brilliant flowers are the dearest of all <unk> dreams , and its raging volcanoes are the passions of the most turbulent and <unk> of hearts !
* * * * * the colloquy of <unk> and <name> .
[ greek : <unk> <unk> ' ] these things are in the future .
sophocles  <unk> . '
<unk> . '
" born again ? "
<unk> . '
yes , fairest and best beloved <name> , " born again . "
these were the words upon whose <unk> meaning i had so long pondered , rejecting the explanations of the <unk> , until death itself resolved for me the secret .
<unk> . '
death !
<unk> . '
how strangely , sweet <name> , you <name> my words !
i observe , too , a <unk> in your step , a joyous <unk> in your eyes .
you are confused and oppressed by the majestic novelty of the life eternal .
yes , it was of death i spoke .
and here how singularly sounds that word which of old was wont to bring terror to all hearts , throwing a mildew upon all pleasures !
<unk> . '
ah , death , the spectre which sate at all feasts !
how often , <unk> , did we lose ourselves in speculations upon its nature !
how mysteriously did it act as a check to human bliss , saying unto it , " thus far , and no farther ! "
that <name> mutual love , my own <unk> , which burned within our bosoms , how vainly did we flatter ourselves , feeling happy in its first <unk> that our happiness would strengthen with its strength !
alas , as it grew , so grew in our hearts the dread of that evil hour which was hurrying to separate us forever !
thus in time it became painful to love .
hate would have been <name> then .
<unk> ' .
speak not here of these griefs , dear <name>  mine , mine forever now !
<unk> ' .
but the memory of past sorrow , is it not present <name> ?
i have much to say yet of the things which have been .
above all , i burn to know the incidents of your own passage through the dark valley and shadow .
<unk> ' .
and when did the radiant <name> ask anything of her <unk> in vain ?
i <name> be minute in relating all , but at what point shall the weird narrative begin ?
<unk> ' .
at what point ?
<unk> ' .
you have said .
<unk> ' .
<unk> , i comprehend you .
in death we have both learned the propensity of man to define the indefinable .
i <name> not say , then , commence with the moment of life 's cessation  but commence with that sad , sad instant when , the fever having abandoned you , you sank into a breathless and motionless <unk> , and i pressed down your pallid eyelids with the passionate fingers of love .
<unk> ' .
one word first , my <name> , in regard to man 's general condition at this epoch .
you <name> remember that one or two of the wise among our forefathers  wise in fact , although not in the world 's esteem  had ventured to doubt the propriety of the term " improvement , " as applied to the progress of our civilization .
there were periods in each of the five or six centuries immediately preceding our dissolution when arose some vigorous intellect , boldly contending for those principles whose truth appears now , to our <unk> reason , so utterly obvious  principles which should have taught our race to submit to the guidance of the natural laws rather than attempt their control .
at long intervals some <unk> appeared , looking upon each advance in practical science as a <unk> in the true utility .
occasionally the poetic intellect  that intellect which we now feel to have been the most exalted of all  since those truths which to us were of the most enduring importance could only be reached by that analogy which speaks in <unk> to the imagination alone , and to the unaided reason bears no weight  occasionally did this poetic intellect proceed a step farther in the evolving of the vague idea of the philosophic , and find in the mystic parable that tells of the tree of knowledge , and of its forbidden fruit , <unk> , a distinct intimation that knowledge was not meet for man in the infant condition of his soul .
and these men  the poets  living and perishing amid the scorn of the " <unk> "  of rough <unk> , who <unk> to themselves a title which could have been properly applied only to the scorned  these men , the poets , pondered <unk> , yet not <unk> , upon the ancient days when our wants were not more simple than our enjoyments were keen  days when mirth was a word unknown , so solemnly <unk> was happiness  holy , <name> , and blissful days , blue rivers ran <unk> , between hills <unk> , into far forest solitudes , primeval , odorous , and unexplored .
yet these <name> exceptions from the general <unk> served but to strengthen it by opposition .
alas !
we had fallen upon the most evil of all our evil days .
the great " movement "  that was the cant term  went on : a diseased commotion , moral and physical .
<name>  the arts  arose supreme , and once <unk> , cast chains upon the intellect which had elevated them to power .
man , because he could not but acknowledge the majesty of nature , fell into childish exultation at his acquired and <unk> dominion over her elements .
even while he stalked a god in his own fancy , an <unk> imbecility came over him .
as might be supposed from the origin of his disorder , he grew infected with system , and with abstraction .
he <unk> himself in <unk> .
among other odd ideas , that of universal equality gained ground ; and in the face of analogy and of god  in despite of the loud warning voice of the laws of gradation so visibly pervading all things in earth and heaven  wild attempts at an <unk> democracy were made .
yet this evil sprang necessarily from the leading evil , knowledge .
man could not both know and succumb .
meantime huge smoking cities arose , innumerable .
green leaves shrank before the hot breath of furnaces .
the fair face of nature was deformed as with the ravages of some loathsome disease .
and methinks , sweet <name> , even our slumbering sense of the forced and of the <unk> might have arrested us here .
but now it appears that we had worked out our own destruction in the perversion of our taste , or rather in the blind neglect of its culture in the schools .
for , in truth , it was at this crisis that taste alone  that faculty which , holding a middle position between the pure intellect and the moral sense , could never safely have been disregarded  it was now that taste alone could have led us gently back to beauty , to nature , and to life .
but alas for the pure contemplative spirit and majestic intuition of plato !
alas for the [ greek : <unk> ] which he justly regarded as an <unk> education for the soul !
alas for him and for it !  since both were most desperately needed , when both were most entirely forgotten or despised [ 1 ] .
<unk> , a philosopher whom we both love , has said , how truly !  " que tout notre <unk> se <unk> à <unk> au sentiment ;  " and it is not impossible that the sentiment of the natural , had time permitted it , would have regained its old ascendency over the harsh mathematical reason of the schools .
but this thing was not to be .
prematurely induced by intemperance of knowledge , the old age of the world <name> near .
this the mass of mankind saw not , or , living lustily although unhappily , affected not to see .
but , for myself , the earth 's records had taught me to look for widest ruin as the price of highest civilization .
i had imbibed a <unk> of our fate from comparison of <name> the simple and enduring , with <unk> the architect , with egypt the astrologer , with <name> , more crafty than either , the turbulent mother of all arts .
in the history of these regions i met with a <name> from the future .
the individual <unk> of the three latter were local diseases of the earth , and in their individual <unk> we had seen local remedies applied ; but for the infected world at large i could anticipate no regeneration save in death .
that man , as a race , should not become extinct , i saw that he must be " born <unk> " and now it was , fairest and dearest , that we wrapped our spirits , daily , in dreams .
now it was that , in twilight , we discoursed of the days to come , when the <unk> surface of the earth , having undergone that purification which alone could efface its rectangular <unk> , should clothe itself anew in the verdure and the <unk> and the smiling waters of paradise , and be rendered at length a fit <unk> for man :  for man the <unk>  for man to whose now exalted intellect there should be poison in knowledge no more  for the redeemed , <unk> , blissful , and now immortal , but still for the material , man .
<unk> ' .
well do i remember these conversations , dear <unk> ; but the epoch of the fiery overthrow was not so near at hand as we believed , and as the corruption you indicate did surely warrant us in believing .
men lived ; and died individually .
you yourself sickened , and passed into the grave ; and thither your constant <name> speedily followed you .
and though the century which has since elapsed , and whose conclusion brings up together once more , tortured our slumbering senses with no impatience of duration , yet my <unk> , it was a century still .
<unk> ' .
say , rather , a point in the vague infinity .
unquestionably , it was in the earth 's <unk> that i died .
wearied at heart with anxieties which had their origin in the general turmoil and decay , i succumbed to the fierce fever .
after some few days of pain , and many of dreamy delirium replete with ecstasy , the manifestations of which you mistook for pain , while i longed but was impotent to <unk> you  after some days there came upon me , as you have said , a breathless and motionless <unk> ; and this was termed death by those who stood around me .
words are vague things .
my condition did not deprive me of <unk> .
it appeared to me not greatly dissimilar to the extreme quiescence of him , who , having slumbered long and profoundly , lying motionless and fully prostrate in a <unk> noon , begins to steal slowly back into consciousness , through the mere sufficiency of his sleep , and without being awakened by external disturbances .
i breathed no longer .
the pulses were still .
the heart had ceased to beat .
volition had not departed , but was powerless .
the senses were unusually active , although <unk> so  assuming often each other 's functions at random .
the taste and the smell were inextricably confounded , and became one sentiment , abnormal and intense .
the <unk> with which your tenderness had moistened my lips to the last , affected me with sweet fancies of flowers  fantastic flowers , far more lovely than any of the old earth , but whose prototypes we have here blooming around us .
the <unk> , transparent and bloodless , offered no complete impediment to vision .
as volition was in abeyance , the balls could not roll in their sockets  but all objects within the range of the <unk> hemisphere were seen with more or less distinctness ; the rays which fell upon the external retina , or into the corner of the eye , producing a more vivid effect than those which struck the front or interior surface .
yet , in the former instance , this effect was so far anomalous that i appreciated it only as sound  sound sweet or discordant as the matters presenting themselves at my side were light or dark in shade  curved or angular in outline .
the hearing , at the same time , although excited in degree , was not irregular in action  estimating real sounds with an extravagance of precision , not less than of sensibility .
touch had undergone a modification more peculiar .
its impressions were <unk> received , but pertinaciously retained , and resulted always in the highest physical pleasure .
thus the pressure of your sweet fingers upon my eyelids , at first only recognized through vision , at length , long after their removal , filled my whole being with a sensual delight immeasurable .
i say with a sensual delight .
all my perceptions were purely sensual .
the materials furnished the passive <name> by the senses were not in the least degree wrought into shape by the deceased understanding .
of pain there was some little ; of pleasure there was much ; but of moral pain or pleasure none at all .
thus your wild sobs floated into my ear with all their mournful cadences , and were appreciated in their every variation of sad tone ; but they were soft musical sounds and no more ; they conveyed to the extinct reason no intimation of the sorrows which gave them birth ; while large and constant tears which fell upon my face , telling the bystanders of a heart which broke , thrilled every fibre of my frame with ecstasy alone .
and this was in truth the death of which these bystanders spoke reverently , in low whispers  you , sweet <name> , <unk> , with loud cries .
they attired me for the coffin  three or four dark figures which flitted busily to and fro .
as these crossed the direct line of my vision they affected me as forms ;  but upon passing to my side their images impressed me with the idea of shrieks , groans , and , other dismal expressions of terror , of horror , or of woe .
you alone , <unk> in a white robe , passed in all directions musically about .
the day waned ; and , as its light faded away , i became possessed by a vague uneasiness  an anxiety such as the sleeper feels when sad real sounds fall continuously within his ear  low distant <unk> , solemn , at long but equal intervals , and commingling with melancholy dreams .
night arrived ; and with its shadows a heavy discomfort .
it oppressed my limbs with the oppression of some dull weight , and was palpable .
there was also a moaning sound , not unlike the distant <unk> of surf , but more continuous , which , beginning with the first twilight , had grown in strength with the darkness .
suddenly lights were brought into the rooms , and this <unk> became forthwith interrupted into frequent unequal bursts of the same sound , but less dreary and less distinct .
the ponderous oppression was in a great measure relieved ; and , issuing from the flame of each lamp ( for there were many ) , there flowed <unk> into my ears a strain of melodious monotone .
and when now , dear <name> , approaching the bed upon which i lay outstretched , you sat gently by my side , breathing odor from your sweet lips , and pressing them upon my brow , there arose tremulously within my bosom , and mingling with the merely physical sensations which circumstances had called forth , a something akin to sentiment itself  a feeling that , half appreciating , half responded to your <name> love and sorrow ; but this feeling took no root in the <unk> heart , and seemed indeed rather a shadow than a reality , and faded quickly away , first into extreme quiescence , and then into a purely sensual pleasure as before .
and now , from the wreck and the chaos of the usual senses , there appeared to have arisen within me a sixth , all perfect .
in its exercise i found a wild delight  yet a delight still physical , inasmuch as the understanding had in it no part .
motion in the animal frame had fully ceased .
no muscle quivered ; no nerve thrilled ; no artery throbbed .
but there seemed to have sprung up in the <name> that of which no words could convey to the merely human intelligence even an indistinct <name> .
let me term it a mental pendulous <unk> .
it was the moral embodiment of man 's abstract idea of time .
by the absolute <unk> of this movement  or of such as this  had the cycles of the <unk> orbs themselves been adjusted .
by its aid i measured the irregularities of the clock upon the mantel , and of the watches of the attendants .
their <unk> came <unk> to my ears .
the slightest deviations from the true proportion  and these deviations were <unk>  affected me just as <unk> of abstract truth were wont on earth to affect the moral sense .
although no two of the <unk> in the chamber struck the individual seconds accurately together , yet i had no difficulty in holding steadily in mind the tones , and the respective momentary errors of each .
and this  this keen , perfect <unk> sentiment of duration  this sentiment existing ( as man could not possibly have conceived it to exist ) independently of any succession of events  this idea  this sixth sense , <unk> from the ashes of the rest , was the first obvious and certain step of the <unk> soul upon the threshold of the temporal eternity .
it was midnight ; and you still sat by my side .
all others had departed from the chamber of death .
they had deposited me in the coffin .
the lamps burned <unk> ; for this i knew by the <unk> of the monotonous strains .
but suddenly these strains diminished in distinctness and in volume .
finally they ceased .
the perfume in my nostrils died away .
forms affected my vision no longer .
the oppression of the darkness uplifted itself from my bosom .
a dull shot like that of electricity pervaded my frame , and was followed by total loss of the idea of contact .
all of what man has termed sense was merged in the sole consciousness of entity , and in the one abiding sentiment of duration .
the mortal body had been at length stricken with the hand of the deadly decay .
yet had not all of <unk> departed ; for the consciousness and the sentiment remaining supplied some of its functions by a <unk> intuition .
i appreciated the <unk> change now in operation upon the flesh , and , as the dreamer is sometimes aware of the bodily presence of one who leans over him , so , sweet <name> , i still dully felt that you sat by my side .
so , too , when the noon of the second day came , i was not unconscious of those movements which displaced you from my side , which confined me within the coffin , which deposited me within the hearse , which bore me to the grave , which lowered me within it , which heaped heavily the mould upon me , and which thus left me , in blackness and corruption , to my sad and solemn slumbers with the worm .
and here in the <unk> which has few secrets to disclose , there rolled away days and weeks and months ; and the soul watched narrowly each second as it flew , and , without effort , took record of its flight  without effort and without object .
a year passed .
the consciousness of being had grown hourly more indistinct , and that of mere locality had in great measure usurped its position .
the idea of entity was becoming merged in that of place .
the narrow space immediately surrounding what had been the body was now growing to be the body itself .
at length , as often happens to the sleeper ( by sleep and its world alone is death <unk> )  at length , as sometimes happened on earth to the deep <unk> , when some flitting light half startled him into awaking , yet left him half enveloped in dreams  so to me , in the strict embrace of the shadow , came that light which alone might have had power to startle  the light of enduring love .
men toiled at the grave in which i lay <unk> .
they <unk> the damp earth .
upon my mouldering bones there descended the coffin of <name> .
and now again all was void .
that nebulous light had been extinguished .
that feeble thrill had vibrated itself into quiescence .
many <unk> had supervened .
dust had returned to dust .
the worm had food no more .
the sense of being had at length utterly departed , and there reigned in its stead  instead of all things , dominant and perpetual  the <unk> place and <unk> for that which was not  for that which had no form  for that which had no thought  for that which had no <unk>  for that which was <unk> , yet of which matter formed no portion  for all this nothingness , yet for all this immortality , the grave was still a home , and the <unk> hours , <unk> .

it is now ten earthly years since i underwent what you undergo  yet the remembrance of it hangs by me still .
you have now suffered all of pain , however , which you <name> suffer in aidenn .
<unk> ' .
in aidenn ?
<unk> ' .
in aidenn .
<unk> ' .
o god !  pity me , charmion !  i am <unk> with the majesty of all things  of the unknown now known  of the speculative future merged in the <name> and certain present .
<unk> ' .
grapple not now with such thoughts .
to-morrow we <name> speak of this .
your mind <unk> , and its agitation <name> find relief in the exercise of simple memories .
look not around , nor forward  but back .
i am burning with anxiety to hear the details of that stupendous event which threw you among us .
tell me of it .
let us converse of familiar things , in the old familiar language of the world which has so fearfully perished .
<unk> ' .
most fearfully , fearfully !  this is indeed no dream .
<unk> ' .
dreams are no more .
was i much mourned , my eiros ?
<unk> ' .
mourned , charmion ?  oh , deeply .
to that last hour of all there <name> a cloud of intense gloom and devout sorrow over your household .
<unk> ' .
and that last hour  speak of it .
remember that , beyond the naked fact of the catastrophe itself , i know nothing .
when , coming out from among mankind , i passed into night through the grave  at that period , if i remember aright , the calamity which overwhelmed you was utterly <unk> .
but , indeed , i knew little of the speculative philosophy of the day .
<unk> ' .
the individual calamity was , as you say , entirely <unk> ; but analogous misfortunes had been long a subject of discussion with astronomers .
i need scarce tell you , my friend , that , even when you left us , men had agreed to understand those passages in the most holy writings which speak of the final destruction of all things by fire as having reference to the orb of the earth alone , but in regard to the immediate agency of the ruin , speculation had been at fault from that epoch in astronomical knowledge in which the comets were divested of the terrors of flame .
the very moderate density of these bodies had been well established .
they had been observed to pass among the satellites of jupiter without bringing about any sensible alteration either in the masses or in the orbits of these secondary planets .
we had long regarded the wanderers as <unk> creations of inconceivable tenuity , and as altogether incapable of doing injury to our substantial globe , even in the event of contact .
but contact was not in any degree dreaded ; for the elements of all the comets were accurately known .
that among them we should look for the agency of the threatened fiery destruction had been for many years considered an <unk> idea .
but wonders and wild fancies had been of late days strangely rife among mankind ; and , although it was only with a few of the ignorant that actual apprehension prevailed , upon the announcement by astronomers of a new comet , yet this announcement was generally received with i know not what of agitation and mistrust .
the elements of the strange orb were immediately calculated , and it was at once conceded by all observers that its path , at <unk> would bring it into very close proximity with the earth .
there were two or three astronomers of secondary note who resolutely maintained that a contact was inevitable .
i can not very well express to you the effect of this intelligence upon the people .
for a few short days they would not believe an assertion which their intellect , so long employed among worldly considerations , could not in any manner grasp .
but the truth of a <unk> important fact soon makes its way into the understanding of even the most stolid .
finally , all men saw that astronomical knowledge lies not , and they awaited the comet .
its approach was not at first seemingly rapid , nor was its appearance of very unusual character .
it was of a dull red , and had little perceptible train .
for seven or eight days we saw no material increase in its apparent diameter , and but a partial alteration in its color .
meantime , the ordinary affairs of men were discarded , and all interest absorbed in a growing discussion instituted by the philosophic in respect to the <unk> nature .
even the grossly ignorant aroused their sluggish capacities to such considerations .
the learned now gave their intellect  their soul  to no such points as the <unk> of fear , or to the sustenance of loved theory .
they sought  they panted for right views .
they groaned for perfected knowledge .
truth arose in the purity of her strength and exceeding majesty , and the wise bowed down and adored .
that material injury to our globe or to its inhabitants would result from the apprehended contact was an opinion which hourly lost ground among the wise ; and the wise were now freely permitted to rule the reason and the fancy of the crowd .
it was demonstrated that the density of the comet 's nucleus was far less than that of our rarest gas ; and the harmless passage of a similar visitor among the satellites of jupiter was a point strongly insisted upon , and which served greatly to allay terror .
<unk> , with an earnestness <unk> , dwelt upon the biblical prophecies , and expounded them to the people with a directness and simplicity of which no previous instance had been known .
that the final destruction of the earth must be brought about by the agency of fire , was urged with a spirit that enforced everywhere conviction ; and that the comets were of no fiery nature ( as all men now knew ) was a truth which relieved all , in a great measure , from the apprehension of the great calamity foretold .
it is noticeable that the popular prejudices and vulgar errors in regard to <unk> and wars  errors which were wont to prevail upon every appearance of a comet  were now altogether unknown , as if by some sudden convulsive exertion reason had at once hurled superstition from her throne .
the feeblest intellect had derived vigor from excessive interest .
what minor evils might arise from the contact were points of elaborate question .
the learned spoke of slight geological disturbances , of probable alterations in climate , and consequently in vegetation ; of possible magnetic and electric influences .
many held that no visible or perceptible effect would in any manner be produced .
while such discussions were going on , their subject gradually approached , growing larger in apparent diameter , and of a more brilliant lustre .
mankind grew paler as it came .
all human operations were suspended .
there was an epoch in the course of the general sentiment when the comet had attained , at length , a size surpassing that of any previously recorded visitation .
the people now , dismissing any lingering <name> that the astronomers were wrong , experienced all the certainty of evil .
the <unk> aspect of their terror was gone .
the hearts of the stoutest of our race beat violently within their bosoms .
a very few days suffered , however , to <unk> even such feelings in sentiments more unendurable .
we could no longer apply to the strange orb any accustomed thoughts .
its historical attributes had disappeared .
it oppressed us with a hideous novelty of emotion .
we saw it not as an astronomical phenomenon in the heavens , but as an <unk> upon our hearts and a shadow upon our brains .
it had taken , with <unk> rapidity , the character of a gigantic mantle of rare flame , extending from horizon to horizon .
yet a day , and men breathed with greater freedom .
it was clear that we were already within the influence of the comet ; yet we lived .
we even felt an unusual elasticity of frame and vivacity of mind .
the exceeding tenuity of the object of our dread was apparent ; for all heavenly objects were plainly visible through it .
meantime , our vegetation had perceptibly altered ; and we gained <name> , from this predicted circumstance , in the foresight of the wise .
a wild luxuriance of foliage , utterly unknown before , burst out upon every vegetable thing .
yet another day  and the evil was not altogether upon us .
it was now evident that its nucleus would first reach us .
a wild change had come over all men ; and the first sense of pain was the wild signal for general <unk> and horror .
the first sense of pain lay in a rigorous construction of the breast and lungs , and an insufferable dryness of the skin .
it could not be denied that our atmosphere was radically affected ; the conformation of this atmosphere and the possible modifications to which it might be subjected , were now the topics of discussion .
the result of investigation sent an electric thrill of the <unk> terror through the universal heart of man .
it had been long known that the air which encircled us was a compound of oxygen and nitrogen gases , in the proportion of twenty-one measures of oxygen and <unk> of nitrogen in every one hundred of the atmosphere .
oxygen , which was the principle of combustion , and the vehicle of heat , was absolutely necessary to the support of animal life , and was the most powerful and energetic agent in nature .
nitrogen , on the contrary , was incapable of supporting either animal life or flame .
an unnatural excess of oxygen would result , it had been ascertained , in just such an elevation of the animal spirits as we had latterly experienced .
it was the pursuit , the extension of the idea , which had engendered awe .
what would be the result of a total extraction of the nitrogen ?
a combustion irresistible , <unk> , <unk> , immediate ;  the entire fulfilment , in all their minute and terrible details , of the fiery and <unk> denunciations of the prophecies of the holy book .
why need i paint , charmion , the now <unk> frenzy of mankind ?
that tenuity in the comet which had previously inspired us with <name> , was now the source of the bitterness of despair .
in its impalpable gaseous character we clearly perceived the consummation of fate .
meantime a day again passed  bearing away with it the last shadow of <name> .
we gasped in the rapid modification of the air .
the red blood bounded <unk> through its strict channels .
a furious delirium possessed all men ; and with arms rigidly outstretched towards the threatening heavens , they trembled and shrieked aloud .
but the nucleus of the destroyer was now upon us ;  even here in aidenn i shudder while i speak .
let me be brief  brief as the ruin that overwhelmed .
for a moment there was a wild lurid light alone , visiting and penetrating all things .
then  let us bow down , charmion , before the excessive majesty of the great god !  then , there came a shouting and pervading sound , as if from the mouth itself of him ; while the whole incumbent mass of ether in which we existed , burst at once into a species of intense flame , for whose surpassing brilliancy and <unk> heat even the angels in the high heaven of pure knowledge have no name .
thus ended all .
* * * * * <unk>  a parable .
yea !
though i walk through the valley of the shadow .
<unk> of <name> ' .
ye who read are still among the living ; but i who write shall have long since gone my way into the region of shadows .
for indeed strange things shall happen , and secret things be known , and many centuries shall pass away , ere these memorials be seen of men .
and , when seen , there <name> be some to disbelieve and some to doubt , and yet a few who <name> find much to ponder upon in the characters here graven with a <unk> of iron .
the year had been a year of terror , and of feeling more intense than terror for which there is no name upon the earth .
for many prodigies and signs had taken place , and far and wide , over sea and land , the black wings of the pestilence were spread abroad .
to those , nevertheless , cunning in the stars , it was not unknown that the heavens wore an aspect of ill ; and to me , the greek oinos , among others , it was evident that now had arrived the alternation of that seven hundred and <unk> year when , at the entrance of <unk> , the planet jupiter is enjoined with the red ring of the terrible <unk> .
the peculiar spirit of the skies , if i mistake not greatly , made itself manifest , not only in the physical orb of the earth , but in the souls , imaginations , and meditations of mankind .
over some <unk> of the red <unk> wine , within the walls of a <name> hall , in a dim city called <unk> , we sat , at night , a company of seven .
and to our chamber there was no entrance save by a lofty door of brass : and the door was fashioned by the <unk> <unk> , and , being of rare workmanship , was fastened from within .
black draperies , likewise in the gloomy room , shut out from our view the moon , the lurid stars , and the <unk> streets  but the <unk> and the memory of evil , they would not be so excluded .
there were things around us and about of which i can render no distinct account  things material and spiritual  <unk> in the atmosphere  a sense of suffocation  anxiety  and , above all , that terrible state of existence which the nervous experience when the senses are keenly living and awake , and meanwhile the powers of thought lie dormant .
a dead weight <name> upon us .
it <name> upon our limbs  upon the household furniture  upon the <unk> from which we drank ; and all things were depressed , and borne down thereby  all things save only the flames of the seven iron lamps which illumined our revel .
<unk> themselves in tall slender lines of light , they thus remained burning all pallid and motionless ; and in the mirror which their lustre formed upon the round table of <name> at which we sat each of us there assembled beheld the pallor of his own countenance , and the unquiet glare in the downcast eyes of his companions .
yet we laughed and were <name> in our proper way  which was hysterical ; and sang the songs of <unk>  which are madness ; and drank deeply  although the purple wine reminded us of blood .
for there was yet another tenant of our chamber in the person of young <unk> .
dead and at full length he lay , enshrouded ;  the genius and the demon of the scene .
alas !
he bore no portion in our mirth , save that his countenance , distorted with the plague , and his eyes in which death had but half extinguished the fire of the pestilence , seemed to take such an interest in our merriment as the dead may haply take in the merriment of those who are to die .
but although i , oinos , felt that the eyes of the departed were upon me , still i forced myself not to perceive the bitterness of their expression , and gazing down steadily into the depths of the <name> mirror , sang with a loud and sonorous voice the songs of the son of <unk> .
but gradually my songs they ceased , and their echoes , rolling afar off among the sable draperies of the chamber , became weak , and undistinguishable , and so faded away .
and lo !
from among those sable draperies , where the sounds of the song departed , there came forth a dark and <unk> shadow  a shadow such as the moon , when low in heaven , might fashion from the figure of a man : but it was the shadow neither of man nor of god , nor of any familiar thing .
and quivering awhile among the draperies of the room it at length rested in full view upon the surface of the door of brass .
but the shadow was vague , and formless , and indefinite , and was the shadow neither of man nor god  neither god of greece , nor god of <unk> , nor any egyptian god .
and the shadow rested upon the brazen doorway , and under the arch of the <unk> of the door and moved not , nor spoke any word , but there became stationary and remained .
and the door whereupon the shadow rested was , if i remember aright , over against the feet of the young <unk> enshrouded .
but we , the seven there assembled , having seen the shadow as it came out from among the draperies , dared not steadily behold it , but cast down our eyes , and gazed continually into the depths of the mirror of <name> .
and at length i , oinos , speaking some low words , demanded of the shadow its dwelling and its appellation .
and the shadow answered , " i am shadow , and my dwelling is near to the catacombs of <unk> , and hard by those dim plains of <unk> which border upon the foul <unk> canal . "
and then did we , the seven , start from our seats in horror , and stand trembling , and shuddering , and aghast : for the tones in the voice of the shadow were not the tones of any one being , but of a multitude of beings , and varying in their cadences from syllable to syllable , fell <unk> upon our ears in the well remembered and familiar accents of many thousand departed friends .
* * * * * <unk>  a fable .
the mountain pinnacles slumber ; valleys , crags , and caves are silent .
" listen to me , " said the demon , as he placed his hand upon my head .
" the region of which i speak is a dreary region in <unk> , by the borders of the river <unk> .
and there is no quiet there , nor silence .
" the waters of the river have a saffron and sickly <name> ; and they flow not onward to the sea , but <unk> forever and forever beneath the red eye of the sun with a tumultuous and convulsive motion .
for many miles on either side of the river 's <unk> bed is a pale desert of gigantic water-lilies .
they sigh one unto the other in that solitude , and stretch towards the heaven their long and ghastly necks , and nod to and fro their everlasting heads .
and there is an indistinct murmur which cometh out from among them like the rushing of <unk> water .
and they sigh one unto the other .
" but there is a boundary to their realm  the boundary of the dark , horrible , lofty forest .
there , like the waves about the hebrides , the low <unk> is agitated continually .
but there is no wind throughout the heaven .
and the tall primeval trees rock eternally hither and thither with a crashing and mighty sound .
and from their high summits , one by one , drop everlasting dews .
and at the roots , strange poisonous flowers lie writhing in <unk> slumber .
and overhead , with a rustling and loud noise , the gray clouds rush <unk> forever until they roll , a cataract , over the fiery wall of the horizon .
but there is no wind throughout the heaven .
and by the shores of the river <unk> there is neither quiet nor silence .
" it was night , and the rain fell ; and , falling , it was rain , but , having fallen , it was blood .
and i stood in the morass among the tall lilies , and the rain fell upon my head  and the lilies sighed one unto the other in the solemnity of their desolation .
" and , all at once , the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist , and was crimson in color .
and mine eyes fell upon a huge gray rock which stood by the shore of the river and was lighted by the light of the moon .
and the rock was gray and ghastly , and tall ,  and the rock was gray .
upon its front were characters <unk> in the stones ; and i walked through the morass of water-lilies , until i came close unto the shore , that i might read the characters upon the stone .
but i could not <unk> them .
and i was going back into the morass when the moon shone with a fuller red , and i turned and looked again upon the rock and upon the characters ;  and the characters were desolation .
" and i looked upwards , and there stood a man upon the summit of the rock ; and i hid myself among the water-lilies that i might discover the action of the man .
and the man was tall and stately in form , and wrapped up from his shoulders to his feet in the <unk> of old rome .
and the outlines of his figure were indistinct  but his features were the features of a deity ; for the mantle of the night , and of the mist , and of the moon , and of the dew , had left uncovered the features of his face .
and his brow was lofty with thought , and his eye wild with care ; and in the few furrows upon his cheek , i read the fables of sorrow , and weariness , and disgust with mankind , and a longing after solitude .
" and the man sat upon the rock , and leaned his head upon his hand , and looked out upon the desolation .
he looked down into the low unquiet shrubbery , and up into the tall primeval trees , and up higher at the rustling heaven , and into the crimson moon .
and i lay close within shelter of the lilies , and observed the actions of the man .
and the man trembled in the solitude ;  but the night waned , and he sat upon the rock .
" and the man turned his attention from the heaven , and looked out upon the dreary river <unk> , and upon the yellow ghastly waters , and upon the pale legions of the water-lilies .
and the man listened to the sighs of the water-lilies , and to the murmur that came up from among them .
and i lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man .
and the man trembled in the solitude ;  but the night waned , and he sat upon the rock .
" then i went down into the recesses of the morass , and waded afar in among the wilderness of the lilies , and called unto the <unk> which dwelt among the fens in the recesses of the morass .
and the <unk> heard my call , and came , with the <unk> , unto the foot of the rock , and roared loudly and fearfully beneath the moon .
and i lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man .
and the man trembled in the solitude ;  but the night waned , and he sat upon the rock .
" then i cursed the elements with the curse of tumult ; and a frightful tempest gathered in the heaven , where before there had been no wind .
and the heaven became livid with the violence of the tempest  and the rain beat upon the head of the man  and the floods of the river came down  and the river was tormented into foam  and the water-lilies shrieked within their beds  and the forest crumbled before the wind  and the thunder rolled  and the lightning fell  and the rock rocked to its foundation .
and i lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man .
and the man trembled in the solitude ;  but the night waned , and he sat upon the rock .
" then i grew angry and cursed , with the curse of silence , the river , and the lilies , and the wind , and the forest , and the heaven , and the thunder , and the sighs of the water-lilies .
and they became accursed , and were <unk> and the moon ceased to totter up its pathway to heaven  and the thunder died away  and the lightning did not flash  and the clouds <name> motionless  and the waters sunk to their level and remained  and the trees ceased to rock  and the water-lilies sighed no more  and the murmur was heard no longer from among them , nor any shadow of sound throughout the vast illimitable desert .
and i looked upon the characters of the rock , and they were changed ;  and the characters were silence .
" and mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man , and his countenance was <name> with terror .
and , hurriedly , he raised his head from his hand , and stood forth upon the rock and listened .
but there was no voice throughout the vast illimitable desert , and the characters upon the rock were silence .
and the man shuddered , and turned his face away , and fled afar off , in haste , so that i beheld him no more . "
... now there are fine tales in the volumes of the magi  in the <unk> , melancholy volumes of the magi .
therein , i say , are glorious histories of the heaven , and of the earth , and of the mighty sea  and of the genii that overruled the sea , and the earth , and the lofty heaven .
there was much <name> , too , in the sayings which were said by the <unk> ; and holy , holy things were heard of old by the dim leaves that trembled around <unk>  but , as allah <unk> , that fable which the demon told me as he sat by my side in the shadow of the tomb , i hold to be the most wonderful of all !
and as the demon made an end of his story , he fell back within the cavity of the tomb and laughed .
and i could not laugh with the demon , and he cursed me because i could not laugh .
and the lynx which <unk> forever in the tomb , came out therefrom , and lay down at the feet of the demon , and looked at him steadily in the face .
* * * * * essays .
* * * * * the poetic principle .
in speaking of the poetic principle , i have no design to be either thorough or profound .
while discussing very much at random the <unk> of what we call poetry , my principal purpose <name> be to cite for consideration some few of those minor english or american poems which best suit my own taste , or which , upon my own fancy , have left the most definite impression .
by " minor poems " i mean , of course , poems of little length .
and here , in the beginning , permit me to say a few words in regard to a somewhat peculiar principle , which , whether rightfully or <unk> , has always had its influence in my own critical estimate of the poem .
i hold that a long poem does not exist .
i maintain that the phrase , " a long poem , " is simply a flat contradiction in terms .
i need scarcely observe that a poem deserves its title only inasmuch as it excites , by elevating the soul .
the value of the poem is in the ratio of this elevating excitement .
but all excitements are , through a <unk> necessity , transient .
that degree of excitement which would entitle a poem to be so called at all , can not be sustained throughout a composition of any great length .
after the lapse of half an hour , at the very utmost , it flags  fails  a revulsion ensues  and then the poem is , in effect , and in fact , no longer such .
there are , no doubt , many who have found difficulty in <unk> the critical <unk> that the " paradise lost " is to be devoutly admired throughout , with the absolute impossibility of maintaining for it , during perusal , the amount of enthusiasm which that critical <unk> would demand .
this great work , in fact , is to be regarded as poetical only when , losing sight of that vital requisite in all works of <name> , unity , we view it merely as a series of minor poems .
if , to preserve its unity  its <unk> of effect or impression  we read it ( as would be necessary ) at a single sitting , the result is but a constant alternation of excitement and depression .
after a passage of what we feel to be true poetry , there follows , inevitably , a passage of <unk> which no critical <unk> can force us to admire ; but if , upon completing the work , we read it again ; omitting the first book  that is to say , commencing with the second  we shall be surprised at now finding that admirable which we before condemned  that damnable which we had previously so much admired .
it follows from all this that the ultimate , aggregate , or absolute effect of even the best epic under the sun , is a <unk>  and this is precisely the fact .
in regard to the iliad , we have , if not positive proof , at least very good reason , for believing it intended as a series of <unk> ; but , granting the epic intention , i can say only that the work is based in an imperfect sense of <name> .
the modern epic is , of the <unk> ancient model , but an inconsiderate and blindfold imitation .
but the day of these artistic anomalies is over .
if , at any time , any very long poem were popular in reality  which i doubt  it is at least clear that no very long poem <name> ever be popular again .
that the extent of a poetical work is <unk> <unk> , the measure of its merit , seems undoubtedly , when we thus state it , a proposition sufficiently absurd  yet we are indebted for it to the quarterly reviews .
surely there can be nothing in mere size , <unk> considered  there can be nothing in mere bulk , so far as a volume is concerned , which has so continuously elicited admiration from these <unk> pamphlets !
a mountain , to be sure , by the mere sentiment of physical magnitude which it conveys , does impress us with a sense of the sublime  but no man is impressed after this fashion by the material grandeur of even " the <unk> . "
even the <unk> have not instructed us to be so impressed by it .
as yet , they have not insisted on our estimating <unk> by the cubic foot , or pollock by the pound  but what else are we to infer from their continual <unk> about " sustained effort " ?
if , by " sustained effort , " any little gentleman has accomplished an epic , let us frankly commend him for the effort  if this indeed be a thing commendable  but let us forbear praising the epic on the effort 's account .
it is to be hoped <unk> common sense , in the time to come , <name> prefer deciding upon a work of <name> rather by the impression it makes  by the effect it produces  than by the time it took to impress the effect , or by the amount of " sustained effort " which had been found necessary in effecting the impression .
the fact is , that perseverance is one thing and genius quite another  nor can all the <unk> in christendom confound them .
by and by , this proposition , with many which i have been just urging , <name> be received as self-evident .
in the meantime , by being generally condemned as <unk> , they <name> not be essentially damaged as truths .
on the other hand , it is clear that a poem may be <unk> brief .
undue brevity <unk> into mere <unk> .
a very short poem , while now and then producing a brilliant or vivid , never produces a profound or enduring effect .
there must be the steady pressing down of the stamp upon the wax .
de <unk> has wrought innumerable things , pungent and <unk> , but in general they have been too <unk> to stamp themselves deeply into the public attention , and thus , as so many feathers of fancy , have been blown aloft only to be whistled down the wind .
a remarkable instance of the effect of undue brevity in depressing a poem , in keeping it out of the popular view , is afforded by the following exquisite little <unk> : i arise from dreams of thee in the first sweet sleep of night when the winds are breathing low , and the stars are shining bright .
i arise from dreams of thee , and a spirit in my feet has led me  who knows how ?  to thy <unk> , sweet !
the wandering airs they faint on the dark the silent stream  the <unk> odors fail like sweet thoughts in a dream ; the nightingale 's complaint , it dies upon her heart , as i must die on thine , o , beloved as thou <name> !
o , lift me from the grass !
i die , i faint , i fail !
let thy love in kisses rain on my lips and eyelids pale .
my cheek is cold and white , alas !
my heart beats loud and fast : o , press it close to thine again , where it <name> break at last !
very few perhaps are familiar with these lines , yet no less a poet than <name> is their author .
their warm , yet delicate and ethereal imagination <name> be appreciated by all , but by none so thoroughly as by him who has himself arisen from sweet dreams of one beloved to bathe in the <unk> air of a southern midsummer night .
one of the finest poems by <name> , the very best in my opinion which he has ever written , has no doubt , through this same defect of undue brevity , been kept back from its proper position , not less in the critical than in the popular view : the shadows lay along broadway , 't was near the <unk>  and slowly there a <name> fair was walking in her pride .
alone walk 'd she ; but , <unk> walk 'd spirits at her side .
peace charm 'd the street beneath her feet , and honor charm 'd the air ; and all astir looked kind on her , and called her good as fair  for all god ever gave to her she kept with <unk> care .
she kept with care her beauties rare from lovers warm and true  for heart was cold to all but gold , and the <name> came not to woo  but honor 'd well her charms to sell , if priests the selling do .
now walking there was one more fair  a slight girl , <unk> ; and she had unseen company to make the spirit quail  <unk> want and scorn she walk 'd forlorn , and nothing could avail .
no <name> now can clear her brow from this world 's peace to pray , for as love 's wild prayer dissolved in air , her woman 's heart gave way !  but the sin forgiven by christ in heaven , by man is cursed alway !
in this composition we find it difficult to recognise the <name> who has written so many mere " verses of society . "
the lines are not only richly ideal but full of energy , while they breathe an earnestness , an evident sincerity of sentiment , for which we look in vain throughout all the other works of this author .
while the epic mania , while the idea that to merit in poetry <unk> is indispensable , has for some years past been gradually dying out of the public mind , by mere dint of its own absurdity , we find it succeeded by a heresy too palpably false to be long tolerated , but one which , in the brief period it has already endured , may be said to have accomplished more in the corruption of our poetical literature than all its other enemies combined .
i allude to the heresy of the <unk> .
it has been assumed , tacitly and <unk> , directly and indirectly , that the ultimate object of all poetry is truth .
every poem , it is said , should <unk> a moral , and by this moral is the poetical merit of the work to be <unk> .
we americans especially have patronized this happy idea , and we <unk> very especially have developed it in full .
we have taken it into our heads that to write a poem simply for the <unk> sake , and to acknowledge such to have been our design , would be to confess ourselves radically wanting in the true poetic dignity and force :  but the simple fact is that would we but permit ourselves to look into our own souls we should immediately there discover that under the sun there neither exists nor can exist any work more thoroughly dignified , more supremely <name> , than this very poem , this poem per se , this poem which is a poem and nothing more , this poem written solely for the poem 's sake .
with as deep a reverence for the true as ever inspired the bosom of man , i would nevertheless limit , in some measure , its modes of <unk> .
i would limit to enforce them .
i would not <unk> them by dissipation .
the demands of truth are severe .
she has no sympathy with the <unk> .
all that which is so indispensable in song is precisely all that with which she has nothing whatever to do .
it is but making her a <unk> paradox to <unk> her in gems and flowers .
in enforcing a truth we need severity rather than <unk> of language .
we must be simple , precise , terse .
we must be cool , calm , <unk> .
in a word , we must be in that mood which , as nearly as possible , is the exact converse of the poetical .
he must be blind indeed who does not perceive the radical and <unk> difference between the truthful and the poetical modes of <unk> .
he must be <unk> beyond redemption who , in spite of these differences , shall still persist in attempting to reconcile the obstinate oils and waters of poetry and truth .
dividing the world of mind into its three most immediately obvious distinctions , we have the pure intellect , taste , and the moral sense .
i place taste in the middle because it is just this position which in the mind it occupies .
it holds intimate relations with either extreme ; but from the moral sense is separated by so faint a difference that aristotle has not hesitated to place some of its operations among the virtues themselves .
nevertheless we find the offices of the trio marked with a sufficient distinction .
just as the intellect concerns itself with truth , so taste informs us of the beautiful , while the moral sense is <unk> of duty .
of this latter , while conscience teaches the obligation , and reason the expediency , taste contents herself with displaying the charms , waging war upon vice solely on the ground of her deformity , her disproportion , her animosity to the fitting , to the appropriate , to the harmonious , in a word , to beauty .
an immortal instinct deep within the spirit of man is thus plainly a sense of the beautiful .
this it is which <unk> to his delight in the manifold forms , and sounds , and odors , and sentiments amid which he exists .
and just as the <name> is repeated in the lake , or the eyes of <unk> in the mirror , so is the mere oral or written repetition of these forms , and sounds , and colors , and odors , and sentiments a duplicate source of delight .
but this mere repetition is not poetry .
he who shall simply sing , with however glowing enthusiasm , or with however vivid a truth of description , of the sights , and sounds , and odors , and colors , and sentiments which greet him in common with all mankind  he , i say , has yet failed to prove his divine title .
there is still a something in the distance which he has been unable to attain .
we have still a thirst <unk> , to allay which he has not shown us the <name> springs .
this thirst belongs to the immortality of man .
it is at once a consequence and an indication of his perennial existence .
it is the <name> of the moth for the <name> .
it is no mere appreciation of the beauty before us , but a wild effort to reach the beauty above .
inspired by an ecstatic <unk> of the glories beyond the grave , we struggle by multiform combinations among the things and thoughts of time to attain a portion of that loveliness whose very elements perhaps <unk> to eternity alone .
and thus when by poetry , or when by music , the most <unk> of the poetic moods , we find ourselves melted into tears , we weep then , not as the <unk> <unk> supposes , through excess of pleasure , but through a certain <unk> , impatient sorrow at our inability to grasp now , wholly , here on earth , at once and forever , those divine and rapturous joys of which through the poem , or through the music , we attain to but brief and indeterminate glimpses .
the struggle to apprehend the <unk> loveliness  this struggle , on the part of souls <unk> constituted  has given to the world all that which it ( the world ) has ever been enabled at once to understand and to feel as poetic .
the poetic sentiment , of course , may develop itself in various modes  in painting , in sculpture , in architecture , in the dance  very especially in music  and very peculiarly , and with a wide field , in the composition of the landscape garden .
our present theme , however , has regard only to its manifestation in words .
and here let me speak briefly on the topic of rhythm .
contenting myself with the certainty that music , in its various modes of metre , rhythm , and rhyme , is of so vast a moment in poetry as never to be wisely rejected  is so <unk> important an adjunct , that he is simply silly who declines its assistance , i <name> not now pause to maintain its absolute <unk> .
it is in music perhaps that the soul most nearly attains the great end for which , when inspired by the poetic sentiment , it struggles  the creation of <unk> beauty .
it may be , indeed , that here this sublime end is , now and , then , attained in <unk> we are often made to feel , with a shivering delight , that from an earthly harp are stricken notes which cannot have been unfamiliar to the angels .
and thus there can be little doubt that in the union of poetry with music in its popular sense , we shall find the widest field for the poetic development .
the old bards and <unk> had advantages which we do not possess  and <name> moore , singing his own songs , was , in the most legitimate manner , perfecting them as poems .
to recapitulate then :  i would define , in brief , the poetry of words as the <unk> creation of <unk> its sole <unk> is taste .
with the intellect or with the conscience it has only collateral relations .
unless incidentally , it has no concern whatever either with duty or with truth .
a few words , however , in explanation .
that pleasure which is at once the most pure , the most elevating , and the most intense , is derived , i maintain , from the contemplation of the beautiful .
in the contemplation of beauty we alone find it possible to attain that pleasurable elevation , or excitement of the soul , which we recognize as the poetic sentiment , and which is so easily distinguished from truth , which is the satisfaction of the reason , or from passion , which is the excitement of the heart .
i make beauty , therefore  using the word as inclusive of the sublime  i make beauty the province of the poem , simply because it is an obvious rule of <name> that effects should be made to spring as directly as possible from their causes :  no one as yet having been weak enough to deny that the peculiar elevation in question is at least most readily attainable in the poem .
it by no means follows , however , that the <unk> of passion , or the precepts of duty , or even the lessons of truth , may not be introduced into a poem , and with advantage ; for they may <unk> incidentally , in various ways , the general purposes of the work : but the true artist <name> always contrive to tone them down in proper subjection to that beauty which is the atmosphere and the real essence of the poem .
i can not better introduce the few poems which i shall present for your consideration , than by the <unk> of the <unk> to longfellow 's " waif " : the day is done , and the darkness falls from the wings of night , as a feather is wafted downward from an eagle in his flight .
i see the lights of the village gleam through the rain and the mist , and a feeling of sadness comes o'er me , that my soul can not resist ; a feeling of sadness and longing , that is not akin to pain , and resembles sorrow only as the mist resembles the rain .
come , read to me some poem , some simple and <unk> lay , that shall soothe this restless feeling , and banish the thoughts of day .
not from the grand old masters , not from the bards sublime , whose distant footsteps <name> through the corridors of time .
for , like strains of martial music , their mighty thoughts suggest life 's endless toil and endeavor ; and to-night i long for rest .
read from some humbler poet , whose songs gushed from his heart , as showers from the clouds of summer , or tears from the eyelids start ; who through long days of labor , and nights devoid of ease , still heard in his soul the music of wonderful melodies .
such songs have power to quiet the restless pulse of care , and come like the benediction that follows after prayer .
then read from the treasured volume the poem of thy choice , and lend to the rhyme of the poet the beauty of thy voice .
and the night shall be filled with music , and the cares that infest the day , shall fold their tents like the arabs , and as silently steal away .
with no great range of imagination , these lines have been justly admired for their delicacy of expression .
some of the images are very effective .
nothing can be better than  the bards sublime , whose distant footsteps <name> down the corridors of time .
the idea of the last <unk> is also very effective .
the poem on the whole , however , is chiefly to be admired for the graceful <unk> of its metre , so well in accordance with the character of the sentiments , and especially for the ease of the general manner .
this " ease " or <unk> , in a literary style , it has long been the fashion to regard as ease in appearance alone  as a point of really difficult attainment .
but not so :  a natural manner is difficult only to him who should never meddle with it  to the unnatural .
it is but the result of writing with the understanding , or with the instinct , that the tone , in composition , should always be that which the mass of mankind would adopt  and must perpetually vary , of course , with the occasion .
the author who , after the fashion of the north american review , should be upon all occasions merely " quiet , " must necessarily upon many occasions be simply silly , or stupid ; and has no more right to be considered " easy " or " natural " than a cockney exquisite , or than the sleeping beauty in the <unk> .
among the minor poems of <name> , none has so much impressed me as the one which he <unk> " <name> . "
i quote only a portion of it : there , through the long , long summer hours , the golden light should lie , and thick young herbs and groups of flowers stand in their beauty by .
the <unk> should build and tell his <unk> , close beside my cell ; the idle butterfly should rest him there , and there be heard the <unk> and humming bird .
and what , if cheerful shouts at noon , come , from the village sent , or songs of maids , beneath the moon , with <name> laughter <unk> ?
and what if , in the evening light , betrothed lovers walk in sight of my low monument ?
i would the lovely scene around might know no sadder sight nor sound .
i know , i know i should not see the season 's glorious show , nor would its brightness shine for me ; nor its wild music flow ; but if , around my place of sleep , the friends i love should come to weep , they might not haste to go .
soft airs and song , and light and bloom , should keep them lingering by my tomb .
these to their soften 'd hearts should bear the thought of what has been , and speak of one who can not share the gladness of the scene ; whose part in all the pomp that fills the circuit of the summer hills , is  that his grave is green ; and deeply would their hearts rejoice to hear again his living voice .
the <unk> flow here is even voluptuous  nothing could be more melodious .
the poem has always affected me in a remarkable manner .
the intense melancholy which seems to well up , perforce , to the surface of all the poet 's cheerful sayings about his grave , we find thrilling us to the soul  while there is the truest poetic elevation in the thrill .
the impression left is one of a pleasurable sadness .
and if , in the remaining compositions which i shall introduce to you , there be more or less of a similar tone always apparent , let me remind you that ( how or why we know not ) this certain taint of sadness is <unk> connected with all the higher manifestations of true beauty .
it is , nevertheless , a feeling of sadness and longing that is not akin to pain , and resembles sorrow only as the mist resembles the rain .
the taint of which i speak is clearly perceptible even in a poem so full of brilliancy and spirit as " the health " of <name> <unk> <unk> : i fill this cup to one made up of loveliness alone , a woman , of her gentle sex the seeming paragon ; to whom the better elements and kindly stars have given a form so fair , that like the air , 't is less of earth than heaven .
her every tone is music 's own , like those of morning birds , and something more than <name> dwells ever in her words ; the <unk> of her heart are they , and from her lips each flows as one may see the burden 'd <name> forth issue from the rose .
affections are as thoughts to her , the measures of her hours ; her feelings have the <unk> , the freshness of young flowers ; and lovely passions , changing oft , so fill her , she appears the image of themselves by turns ,  the idol of past years !
of her bright face one glance <name> trace a picture on the <name> , and of her voice in echoing hearts a sound must long remain ; but memory , such as mine of her , so very much <unk> , when death is nigh my latest sigh <name> not be life 's , but hers .
i fill 'd this cup to one made up of loveliness alone , a woman , of her gentle sex the seeming paragon  her health !
and would on earth there stood , some more of such a frame , that life might be all poetry , and weariness a name .
it was the misfortune of mr. <unk> to have been born too far south .
had he been a new <unk> , it is probable that he would have been ranked as the first of american <unk> by that magnanimous <unk> which has so long controlled the destinies of american letters , in conducting the thing called 'the north american review ' .
the poem just cited is especially beautiful ; but the poetic elevation which it induces we must refer chiefly to our sympathy in the poet 's enthusiasm .
we pardon his <unk> for the evident earnestness with which they are uttered .
it was by no means my design , however , to <unk> upon the merits of what i should read you .
these <name> necessarily speak for themselves .
<unk> , in his <unk> from <unk> ' , tells us that <unk> once presented apollo a very caustic criticism upon a very admirable book :  whereupon the god asked him for the beauties of the work .
he replied that he only busied himself about the errors .
on hearing this , apollo , handing him a sack of <unk> wheat , bade him pick out all the chaff for his reward .
now this fable answers very well as a hit at the critics  but i am by no means sure that the god was in the right .
i am by no means certain that the true limits of the critical duty are not grossly misunderstood .
excellence , in a poem especially , may be considered in the light of an axiom , which need only be properly put , to become self-evident .
it is not excellence if it require to be demonstrated its such :  and thus to point out too particularly the merits of a work of <name> , is to admit that they are not merits altogether .
among the " melodies " of <name> moore is one whose distinguished character as a poem proper seems to have been singularly left out of view .
i allude to his lines beginning  " come , rest in this bosom . "
the intense energy of their expression is not surpassed by anything in <name> .
there are two of the lines in which a sentiment is conveyed that <unk> the all in all of the divine passion of love  a sentiment which , perhaps , has found its <name> in more , and in more passionate , human hearts that any other single sentiment ever embodied in words : come , rest in this bosom , my own stricken deer , though the herd have fled from thee , thy home is still here ; here still is the smile , that no cloud can <unk> , and a heart and a hand all thy own to the last .
oh !
what was love made for , if 't is not the same through <name> and through torment , through <name> and shame ?
i know not , i ask not , if guilt 's in that heart , i but know that i love thee , whatever thou <name> .
thou hast call 'd me thy <name> in moments of bliss , and thy <name> i 'll be , 'mid the horrors of this ,  through the furnace , <unk> , thy steps to pursue , and shield thee , and save thee ,  or perish there too !
it has been the fashion of late days to deny moore imagination , while granting him fancy  a distinction originating with coleridge  than whom no man more fully comprehended the great powers of moore .
the fact is , that the fancy of this poet so far <unk> over all his other faculties , and over the fancy of all other men , as to have induced , very naturally , the idea that he is fanciful <unk> but never was there a greater mistake .
never was a <unk> wrong done the fame of a true poet .
in the compass of the english language i can call to mind no poem more profoundly  more <unk> imaginative ,  in the best sense , than the lines commencing  " i would i were by that dim lake "  which are the composition of <name> moore .
i regret that i am unable to remember them .
one of the noblest  and , speaking of fancy  one of the most singularly fanciful of modern poets , was <name> hood .
his " fair <name> " had always for me an inexpressible charm : o saw ye not fair <name> ?
she 's gone into the west , to dazzle when the sun is down and <name> the world of rest she took our daylight with her , the smiles that we love best , with morning blushes on her cheek , and pearls upon her breast .
o turn again , fair <name> , before the fall of night , for fear the moon should shine alone , and stars <unk> 'd bright ; and blessed <name> the lover be that walks beneath their light , and breathes the love against thy cheek i dare not even write !
would i had been , fair <name> , that gallant cavalier , who rode so gaily by thy side , and whisper 'd thee so near !
were there no <name> dames at home , or no true lovers here , that he should cross the seas to win the dearest of the dear ?
i saw thee , lovely <name> , descend along the shore , with bands of <name> gentlemen , and <unk> before ; and gentle youth and maidens <name> , and snowy plumes they wore ; it would have been a <unk> dream , if it had been no more !
alas , alas , fair <name> , she went away with song , with music waiting on her steps , and shoutings of the throng ; but some were sad and felt no mirth , but only music 's wrong , in sounds that sang farewell , farewell , to her you 've loved so long .
farewell , farewell , fair <name> , that vessel never bore so fair a <name> on its deck , nor danced so light before ,  alas for pleasure on the sea , and sorrow on the shore !
the smile that blest one lover 's heart has broken many more !
" the haunted house , " by the same author , is one of the truest poems ever written ,  one of the truest , one of the most unexceptionable , one of the most thoroughly artistic , both in its theme and in its execution .
it is , moreover , powerfully ideal  imaginative .
i regret that its length renders it unsuitable for the purposes of this lecture .
in place of it permit me to offer the universally appreciated " bridge of sighs : " one more unfortunate , weary of breath , rashly importunate gone to her death !
take her up tenderly , lift her with care ;  fashion 'd so <unk> , young and so fair !
look at her garments clinging like <unk> ; whilst the wave constantly <unk> from her clothing ; take her up instantly , loving , not loathing .
touch her not scornfully think of her mournfully , gently and humanly ; not of the stains of her , all that remains of her now is pure womanly .
make no deep scrutiny into her mutiny rash and undutiful ; past all dishonor , death has left on her only the beautiful .
where the lamps quiver so far in the river , with many a light from window and casement , from <name> to basement , she stood , with amazement , houseless by night .
the bleak wind of march made her tremble and shiver ; but not the dark arch , or the black flowing river : mad from life 's history , glad to death 's mystery , swift to be hurl 'd  anywhere , anywhere out of the world !
in she plunged boldly , no matter how coldly the rough river ran ,  over the brink of it , picture it ,  think of it , dissolute man !
lave in it , drink of it then , if you can !
still , for all slips of hers , one of <name> 's family  wipe those poor lips of hers oozing so <unk> , loop up her tresses escaped from the comb , her fair <unk> tresses ; whilst <unk> guesses where was her home ?
who was her father ?
who was her mother !
had she a sister ?
had she a brother ?
or was there a dearer one still , and a nearer one yet , than all other ?
alas !
for the rarity of <name> <name> under the sun !
oh !
it was pitiful !
near a whole city full , home she had none .
<unk> , brotherly , <unk> , motherly , feelings had changed : love , by harsh evidence , thrown from its eminence ; even god 's providence seeming <unk> .
take her up tenderly ; lift her with care ; fashion 'd so <unk> , young , and so fair !
ere her limbs <unk> stiffen too rigidly , decently ,  kindly ,  smooth and compose them ; and her eyes , close them , staring so blindly !
dreadfully staring through muddy <unk> , as when with the daring last look of despairing fixed on futurity .
perishing gloomily , spurred by <unk> , cold <unk> , burning insanity , into her rest ,  cross her hands humbly , as if praying <unk> , over her breast !
owning her weakness , her evil behavior , and leaving , with meekness , her sins to her saviour !
the vigor of this poem is no less remarkable than its pathos .
the versification , although carrying the fanciful to the very verge of the fantastic , is nevertheless admirably adapted to the wild insanity which is the <unk> of the poem .
among the minor poems of lord <name> is one which has never received from the critics the praise which it undoubtedly deserves : though the day of my <name> 's over , and the <name> of my fate hath declined , thy soft heart refused to discover the faults which so many could find ; though thy soul with my grief was acquainted , it shrunk not to share it with me , and the love which my spirit hath painted it never hath found but in <unk> then when nature around me is smiling , the last smile which answers to mine , i do not believe it beguiling , because it reminds me of thine ; and when winds are at war with the ocean , as the breasts i believed in with me , if their billows excite an emotion , it is that they bear me from <unk> though the rock of my last <name> is shivered , and its fragments are sunk in the wave , though i feel that my soul is delivered to pain  it shall not be its slave .
there is many a pang to pursue me : they may crush , but they shall not <unk>  they may torture , but shall not subdue me  't is of thee that i think  not of them .
though human , thou didst not deceive me , though woman , thou didst not forsake , though loved , thou <unk> to grieve me , though <unk> , thou never couldst shake ,  though trusted , thou didst not <unk> me , though parted , it was not to fly , though watchful , 't was not to <unk> me , nor mute , that the world might <unk> .
yet i blame not the world , nor despise it , nor the war of the many with one  if my soul was not fitted to prize it , 't was folly not sooner to shun : and if dearly that error hath cost me , and more than i once could foresee , i have found that whatever it lost me , it could not deprive me of thee .
from the wreck of the past , which hath perished , thus much i at least may recall , it hath taught me that which i most cherished deserved to be dearest of all : in the desert a fountain is springing , in the wide waste there still is a tree , and a bird in the solitude singing , which speaks to my spirit of thee .
although the rhythm here is one of the most difficult , the versification could scarcely be improved .
no nobler theme ever engaged the pen of poet .
it is the <unk> idea that no man can consider himself entitled to complain of fate while in his adversity he still retains the <unk> love of woman .
from <name> tennyson , although in perfect sincerity i regard him as the noblest poet that ever lived , i have left myself time to cite only a very brief specimen .
i call him , and think him the noblest of poets , not because the impressions he produces are at all times the most profound  not because the poetical excitement which he induces is at all times the most intense  but because it is at all times the most ethereal  in other words , the most elevating and most pure .
no poet is so little of the earth , earthy .
what i am about to read is from his last long poem , " the <name> : " tears , idle tears , i know not what they mean , tears from the depth of some divine despair rise in the heart , and gather to the eyes , in looking on the happy autumn fields , and thinking of the days that are no more .
fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail , that brings our friends up from the <unk> , sad as the last which <unk> over one that sinks with all we love below the verge ; so sad , so fresh , the days that are no more .
ah , sad and strange as in dark summer <unk> the earliest pipe of <unk> 'd birds to dying ears , when unto dying eyes the casement slowly grows a glimmering square ; so sad , so strange , the days that are no more .
dear as remember 'd kisses after death , and sweet as those by hopeless fancy <unk> on lips that are for others ; deep as love , deep as first love , and wild with all regret ; o death in life , the days that are no more .
thus , although in a very cursory and imperfect manner , i have endeavored to convey to you my <name> of the poetic principle .
it has been my purpose to suggest that , while this principle itself is strictly and simply the human aspiration for <unk> beauty , the manifestation of the principle is always found in an elevating excitement of the soul , quite independent of that passion which is the intoxication of the heart , or of that truth which is the satisfaction of the reason .
for in regard to passion , alas !
its tendency is to degrade rather than to elevate the soul .
love , on the contrary  love  the true , the divine eros  the <unk> as distinguished from the <unk> <name>  is unquestionably the purest and truest of all poetical themes .
and in regard to truth , if , to be sure , through the attainment of a truth we are led to perceive a <name> where none was apparent before , we experience at once the true poetical effect ; but this effect is referable to the <name> alone , and not in the least degree to the truth which merely served to render the <name> manifest .
we shall reach , however , more immediately a distinct <name> of what true poetry is , by mere reference to a few of the simple elements which induce in the poet himself the true poetical effect .
he recognizes the <unk> which <unk> his soul in the bright orbs that shine in heaven , in the <unk> of the flower , in the clustering of low <unk> , in the waving of the <unk> , in the slanting of tall eastern trees , in the blue distance of mountains , in the grouping of clouds , in the twinkling of <unk> <name> , in the gleaming of silver rivers , in the repose of <unk> lakes , in the <unk> depths of lonely wells .
he perceives it in the songs of birds , in the harp of <unk> , in the sighing of the <unk> , in the <unk> voice of the forest , in the surf that complains to the shore , in the fresh breath of the woods , in the scent of the <name> , in the voluptuous perfume of the <name> , in the suggestive odor that comes to him at eventide from <unk> undiscovered islands , over dim oceans , illimitable and unexplored .
he owns it in all <name> thoughts , in all <unk> motives , in all holy impulses , in all chivalrous , generous , and self-sacrificing deeds .
he feels it in the beauty of woman , in the <name> of her step , in the lustre of her eye , in the <name> of her voice , in her soft laughter , in her sigh , in the <name> of the rustling of her robes .
he deeply feels it in her winning endearments , in her burning enthusiasms , in her gentle charities , in her meek and devotional endurance , but above all , ah , far above all , he <unk> to it , he worships it in the <name> , in the purity , in the strength , in the altogether divine majesty of her <unk> let me conclude by the recitation of yet another brief poem , one very different in character from any that i have before quoted .
it is by <unk> , and is called " the song of the cavalier . "
with our modern and altogether rational ideas of the absurdity and <unk> of warfare , we are not precisely in that frame of mind best adapted to sympathize with the sentiments , and thus to appreciate the real excellence of the poem .
to do this fully we must identify ourselves in fancy with the soul of the old cavalier : a steed !
a steed !
of matchless <unk> !
a sword of metal <unk> !
<name> else to <name> <unk> is <unk>  <name> else on earth is <unk> .
the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> of the drum , the <unk> of the trumpet <unk>  be <unk> from heaven that come .
and oh !
the thundering <unk> of <unk> , when as their <unk> <unk> , may tole from heaven an <name> bright , and <unk> a fiend from hell , then <unk> !
then <unk> , brave <unk> all , and <name> your <unk> <unk> , <unk> 's couriers , fame and honor , call us to the field <unk> .
no <unk> <unk> shall fill your eye when the <unk> 's in our hand ,  <unk> we 'll part , and no whit <unk> for the <unk> of the land ; let piping <unk> , and craven wight , thus <unk> and <unk> <unk> , our business is like men to fight , and <unk> to die !
* * * * * the philosophy of composition .
<name> dickens , in a note now lying before me , alluding to an examination i once made of the mechanism of barnaby <unk> , says  " by the way , are you aware that godwin wrote his <name> <name> backwards ?
he first involved his hero in a web of difficulties , forming the second volume , and then , for the first , cast about him for some mode of accounting for what had been done . "
i can not think this the precise mode of procedure on the part of godwin  and indeed what he himself <unk> is not altogether in accordance with mr. dickens 's idea  but the author of <name> <name> was too good an artist not to perceive the advantage <unk> from at least a somewhat similar process .
nothing is more clear than that every plot , worth the name , must be elaborated to its <unk> before anything be attempted with the pen .
it is only with the <unk> constantly in view that we can give a plot its indispensable air of consequence , or <unk> , by making the incidents , and especially the tone at all points , tend to the development of the intention .
there is a radical error , i think , in the usual mode of constructing a story .
either history affords a <unk>  or one is suggested by an incident of the day  or , at best , the author sets himself to work in the combination of striking events to form merely the basis of his narrative  designing , generally , to fill in with description , dialogue , or <unk> comment , whatever crevices of fact or action may , from <name> to <name> , render themselves apparent .
i prefer commencing with the consideration of an <unk> keeping originality always in view  for he is false to himself who ventures to dispense with so obvious and so easily attainable a source of interest  i say to myself , in the first place , " of the innumerable effects or impressions of which the heart , the intellect , or ( more generally ) the soul is susceptible , what one shall i , on the present occasion , select ? "
having chosen a novel first , and secondly , a vivid effect , i consider whether it can be best wrought by incident or tone  whether by ordinary incidents and peculiar tone , or the converse , or by peculiarity both of incident and tone  afterwards looking about me ( or rather within ) for such combinations of events or tone as shall best aid me in the construction of the effect .
i have often thought how interesting a magazine paper might be written by any author who would  that is to say , who could  detail , step by step , the processes by which any one of his compositions attained its ultimate point of completion .
why such a paper has never been given to the world , i am much at a loss to say  but perhaps the <unk> vanity has had more to do with the omission than any one other cause .
most writers  poets in especial  prefer having it understood that they compose by a species of fine frenzy  an ecstatic intuition  and would positively shudder at letting the public take a peep behind the scenes , at the elaborate and <unk> <unk> of thought  at the true purposes seized only at the last moment  at the innumerable glimpses of idea that arrived not at the maturity of full view  at the <unk> fancies discarded in despair as unmanageable  at the cautious selections and <unk>  at the painful <unk> and <unk> ,  in a word , at the wheels and pinions , the tackle for <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> , the cock 's feathers , the red paint , and the black patches , which , in ninety-nine cases out of the hundred , constitute the properties of the literary <unk> i am aware , on the other hand , that the case is by no means common , in which an author is at all in condition to retrace the steps by which his conclusions have been attained .
in general , suggestions , having arisen pell-mell , are pursued and forgotten in a similar manner .
for my own part , i have neither sympathy with the repugnance alluded to , nor , at any time , the least difficulty in recalling to mind the progressive steps of any of my compositions ; and , since the interest of an analysis , or reconstruction , such as i have considered a <unk> , is quite independent of any real or fancied interest in the thing analyzed , it <name> not be regarded as a breach of decorum on my part to show the modus <unk> by which some one of my own works was put together .
i select " the <name> " as most generally known .
it is my design to render it manifest that no one point in its composition is <unk> either to accident or intuition  that the work proceeded , step by step , to its completion with the precision and rigid consequence of a mathematical problem .
let us dismiss , as irrelevant to the poem , per se , the circumstance  or say the necessity  which , in the first place , gave rise to the intention of composing a poem that should suit at once the popular and the critical taste .
we commence , then , with this intention .
the initial consideration was that of extent .
if any literary work is too long to be read at one sitting , we must be content to dispense with the immensely important effect <unk> from unity of impression  for , if two sittings be required , the affairs of the world interfere , and everything like <unk> is at once destroyed .
but since , <unk> <unk> , no poet can afford to dispense with anything that may advance his design , it but remains to be seen whether there is , in extent , any advantage to <unk> the loss of unity which attends it .
here i say no , at once .
what we term a long poem is , in fact , merely a succession of brief ones  that is to say , of brief poetical effects .
it is needless to demonstrate that a poem is such only inasmuch as it intensely excites , by elevating the soul ; and all intense excitements are , through a <unk> necessity , brief .
for this reason , at least one-half of the " paradise lost " is essentially prose  a succession of poetical excitements interspersed , inevitably , with corresponding depressions  the whole being deprived , through the <unk> of its length , of the vastly important artistic element , <unk> , or unity of effect .
it appears evident , then , that there is a distinct limit , as regards length , to all works of literary <name>  the limit of a single sitting  and that , although in certain classes of prose composition , such as robinson crusoe ( demanding no unity ) , this limit may be advantageously <unk> , it can never properly be <unk> in a poem .
within this limit , the extent of a poem may be made to bear mathematical relation to its merit  in other words , to the excitement or elevation  again , in other words , to the degree of the true poetical effect which it is capable of inducing ; for it is clear that the brevity must be in direct ratio of the intensity of the intended effect  this , with one <unk>  that a certain degree of duration is absolutely requisite for the production of any effect at all .
holding in view these considerations , as well as that degree of excitement which i deemed not above the popular , while not below the critical taste , i reached at once what i conceived the proper length for my intended poem  a length of about one hundred lines .
it is , in fact , a hundred and eight .
my next thought concerned the choice of an impression , or effect , to be conveyed : and here i may as well observe that , throughout the construction , i kept steadily in view the design of rendering the work universally appreciable .
i should be carried too far out of my immediate topic were i to demonstrate a point upon which i have repeatedly insisted , and which , with the poetical , stands not in the slightest need of demonstration  the point , i mean , that beauty is the sole legitimate province of the poem .
a few words , however , in <unk> of my real meaning , which some of my friends have evinced a disposition to <unk> .
that pleasure which is at once the most intense , the most elevating , and the most pure , is , i believe , found in the contemplation of the beautiful .
when , indeed , men speak of beauty , they mean , precisely , not a quality , as is supposed , but an effect  they refer , in short , just to that intense and pure elevation of soul  not of intellect , or of heart  upon which i have commented , and which is experienced in consequence of contemplating " the beautiful . "
now i designate beauty as the province of the poem , merely because it is an obvious rule of <name> that effects should be made to spring from direct causes  that objects should be attained through means best adapted for their attainment  no one as yet having been weak enough to deny that the peculiar elevation alluded to is most readily attained in the poem .
now the object truth , or the satisfaction of the intellect , and the object passion , or the excitement of the heart , are , although attainable to a certain extent in poetry , far more readily attainable in prose .
truth , in fact , demands a precision , and passion a <unk> ( the truly passionate <name> comprehend me ) which are absolutely antagonistic to that beauty which , i maintain , is the excitement , or pleasurable elevation , of the soul .
it by no means follows from anything here said that passion , or even truth , may not be introduced , and even profitably introduced , into a poem  for they may serve in <unk> , or aid the general effect , as do <unk> in music , by contrast  but the true artist <name> always contrive , first , to tone them into proper <unk> to the predominant aim , and secondly , to <unk> them , as far as possible , in that beauty which is the atmosphere and the essence of the poem .
regarding , then , beauty as my province , my next question referred to the tone of its highest manifestation  and all experience has shown that this tone is one of sadness .
beauty of whatever kind , in its supreme development , invariably excites the sensitive soul to tears .
melancholy is thus the most legitimate of all the poetical tones .
the length , the province , and the tone being thus determined , i betook myself to ordinary induction , with the view of obtaining some artistic <unk> which might serve me as a <unk> in the construction of the poem  some pivot upon which the whole structure might turn .
in carefully thinking over all the usual artistic effects  or more properly points , in the theatrical sense  i did not fail to perceive immediately that no one had been so universally employed as that of the refrain .
the universality of its employment sufficed to assure me of its intrinsic value , and spared me the necessity of submitting it to analysis .
i considered it , however , with regard to its susceptibility of improvement , and soon saw it to be in a primitive condition .
as commonly used , the refrain , or burden , not only is limited to lyric verse , but depends for its impression upon the force of monotone  both in sound and thought .
the pleasure is deduced solely from the sense of identity  of repetition .
i resolved to <unk> , and so heighten the effect , by adhering in general to the monotone of sound , while i continually varied that of thought : that is to say , i determined to produce continuously novel effects , by the variation of the application of the refrain  the refrain itself remaining , for the most part , <unk> .
these points being settled , i next bethought me of the nature of my refrain .
since its application was to be repeatedly varied , it was clear that the refrain itself must be brief , for there would have been an insurmountable difficulty in frequent variations of application in any sentence of length .
in proportion to the brevity of the sentence would of course be the facility of the variation .
this led me at once to a single word as the best refrain .
the question now arose as to the character of the word .
having made up my mind to a refrain , the division of the poem into stanzas was of course a <unk> , the refrain forming the close to each stanza .
that such a close , to have force , must be sonorous and susceptible of protracted emphasis , admitted no doubt , and these considerations inevitably led me to the long o as the most sonorous <unk> in connection with r as the most <unk> <unk> .
the sound of the refrain being thus determined , it became necessary to select a word <unk> this sound , and at the same time in the fullest possible keeping with that melancholy which i had <unk> as the tone of the poem .
in such a search it would have been absolutely impossible to overlook the word " nevermore . "
in fact , it was the very first which presented itself .
the next <unk> was a pretext for the continuous use of the one word " nevermore . "
in observing the difficulty which i at once found in inventing a sufficiently plausible reason for its continuous repetition , i did not fail to perceive that this difficulty arose solely from the <unk> that the word was to be so continuously or monotonously spoken by a human being  i did not fail to perceive , in short , that the difficulty lay in the reconciliation of this monotony with the exercise of reason on the part of the creature repeating the word .
here , then , immediately arose the idea of a <unk> creature capable of speech ; and very naturally , a parrot , in the first instance , suggested itself , but was superseded forthwith by a <name> as equally capable of speech , and infinitely more in keeping with the intended tone .
i had now gone so far as the <name> of a <name> , the bird of <unk> , monotonously repeating the one word " nevermore " at the conclusion of each stanza in a poem of melancholy tone , and in length about one hundred lines .
now , never losing sight of the object <unk> or perfection at all points , i asked myself  " of all melancholy topics what , according to the universal understanding of mankind , is the most melancholy ? "
death , was the obvious reply .
" and when , " i said , " is this most melancholy of topics most poetical ? "
from what i have already explained at some length , the answer here also is obvious  " when it most closely allies itself to beauty ; the death , then , of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetical topic in the world , and equally is it beyond doubt that the lips best suited for such topic are those of a bereaved lover . "
i had now to combine the two ideas of a lover lamenting his deceased mistress and a <name> continuously repeating the word " nevermore . "
i had to combine these , bearing in mind my design of varying at every turn the application of the word repeated , but the only intelligible mode of such combination is that of imagining the <name> employing the word in answer to the queries of the lover .
and here it was that i saw at once the opportunity afforded for the effect on which i had been depending , that is to say , the effect of the variation of application .
i saw that i could make the first query propounded by the lover  the first query to which the <name> should reply " nevermore "  that i could make this first query a commonplace one , the second less so , the third still less , and so on , until at length the lover , startled from his original nonchalance by the melancholy character of the word itself , by its frequent repetition , and by a consideration of the ominous reputation of the fowl that uttered it , is at length excited to superstition , and wildly <unk> queries of a far different character  queries whose solution he has passionately at heart  <unk> them half in superstition and half in that species of despair which delights in <unk>  <unk> them not altogether because he believes in the prophetic or <unk> character of the bird ( which reason assures him is merely repeating a lesson learned by <unk> ) , but because he experiences a frenzied pleasure in so <unk> his questions as to receive from the expected " nevermore " the most delicious because the most intolerable of sorrow .
perceiving the opportunity thus afforded me , or , more strictly , thus forced upon me in the progress of the construction , i first established in mind the climax or concluding query  that query to which " nevermore " should be in the last place an answer  that query in reply to which this word " nevermore " should involve the utmost conceivable amount of sorrow and despair .
here then the poem may be said to have its beginning , at the end where all works of <name> should begin ; for it was here at this point of my <unk> that i first put pen to paper in the composition of the stanza : " prophet , " said i , " thing of evil !
prophet still if bird or devil !
by that heaven that bends above us  by that god we both adore , tell this soul with sorrow laden , if within the distant aidenn , it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name <name>  clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name <name> . "
quoth the <name> , " nevermore . "
i composed this stanza , at this point , first that , by establishing the climax , i might the better vary and graduate , as regards seriousness , and importance the preceding queries of the lover , and secondly , that i might definitely settle the rhythm , the metre , and the length and general arrangement of the stanza , as well as graduate the stanzas which were to precede , so that none of them might surpass this in <unk> effect .
had i been able in the subsequent composition to construct more vigorous stanzas , i should without scruple have purposely enfeebled them so as not to interfere with the <unk> effect .
and here i may as well say a few words of the versification .
my first object ( as usual ) was originality .
the extent to which this has been neglected in versification is one of the most unaccountable things in the world .
admitting that there is little possibility of variety in mere rhythm , it is still clear that the possible varieties of metre and stanza are absolutely infinite ; and yet , for centuries , no man , in verse has ever done , or ever seemed to think of doing , an original thing .
the fact is that originality ( unless in minds of very unusual force ) is by no means a matter , as some suppose , of impulse or intuition .
in general , to be found , it must be elaborately sought and , although a positive merit of the highest class , demands in its attainment less of invention than negation .
of course i pretend to no originality in either the rhythm or metre of the " <name> . "
the former is <unk>  the latter is <unk> <unk> , alternating with <unk> <unk> repeated in the refrain of the fifth verse , and terminating with <unk> <unk> .
less <unk> , the feet employed throughout ( <unk> ) consists of a long syllable followed by a short ; the first line of the stanza consists of eight of these feet , the second of seven and a half ( in effect two-thirds ) , the third of eight , the fourth of seven and a half , the fifth the same , the sixth three and a half .
now , each of these lines taken individually has been employed before , and what originality the " <name> " has , is in their combinations into stanzas ;  nothing even remotely approaching this combination has ever been attempted .
the effect of this originality of combination is aided by other unusual and some altogether novel effects , arising from an extension of the application of the principles of rhyme and <unk> .
the next point to be considered was the mode of bringing together the lover and the <name>  and the first branch of this consideration was the <unk> .
for this the most natural suggestion might seem to be a forest , or the fields  but it has always appeared to me that a close <unk> of space is absolutely necessary to the effect of insulated incident  it has the force of a frame to a picture .
it has an indisputable moral power in keeping concentrated the attention , and , of course , must not be confounded with mere unity of place .
i determined , then , to place the lover in his chamber  in a chamber rendered sacred to him by memories of her who had frequented it .
the room is represented as richly furnished  this in mere pursuance of the ideas i have already explained on the subject of beauty , as the sole true poetical <unk> .
the <unk> being thus determined , i had now to introduce the bird  and the thought of introducing him through the window was inevitable .
the idea of making the lover suppose , in the first instance , that the flapping of the wings of the bird against the shutter , is a " tapping " at the door , originated in a wish to increase , by <unk> , the <unk> curiosity , and in a <name> to admit the incidental effect arising from the lover 's throwing open the door , finding all dark , and thence adopting the <unk> that it was the spirit of his mistress that knocked .
i made the night tempestuous , first to account for the <name> 's seeking admission , and secondly , for the effect of contrast with the ( physical ) serenity within the chamber .
i made the bird alight on the bust of pallas , also for the effect of contrast between the marble and the plumage  it being understood that the bust was absolutely suggested by the bird  the bust of pallas being chosen , first , as most in keeping with the <unk> of the lover , and , secondly , for the <unk> of the word , pallas , itself .
about the middle of the poem , also , i have availed myself of the force of contrast , with a view of deepening the ultimate impression .
for example , an air of the fantastic  approaching as nearly to the ludicrous as was admissible  is given to the <name> 's entrance .
he comes in " with many a flirt and flutter . "
not the least obeisance made he  not a moment stopped or stayed he , but with mien of lord or <name> , perched above my chamber door .
in the two stanzas which follow , the design is more obviously carried out : then this <name> bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore , " though thy crest be shorn and shaven , thou , " i said , " <name> sure no craven , ghastly grim and ancient <name> wandering from the nightly shore  tell me what thy lordly name is on the night 's <unk> shore ? "
quoth the <name> , " nevermore . "
much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly , though its answer little meaning  little relevancy bore ; for we can not help agreeing that no living human being ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door  bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door , with such name as " nevermore . "
the effect of the <unk> being thus provided for , i immediately drop the fantastic for a tone of the most profound seriousness  this tone commencing in the stanza directly following the one last quoted , with the line , but the <name> , sitting lonely on that placid bust , spoke only , etc .
from this epoch the lover no longer jests  no longer sees anything even of the fantastic in the <name> 's demeanor .
he speaks of him as a " grim , ungainly , ghastly , gaunt , and ominous bird of yore , " and feels the " fiery eyes " burning into his " bosom 's core . "
this revolution of thought , or fancy , on the lover 's part , is intended to induce a similar one on the part of the reader  to bring the mind into a proper frame for the <unk>  which is now brought about as rapidly and as directly as possible .
with the <unk> proper  with the <name> 's reply , " nevermore , " to the lover 's final demand if he shall meet his mistress in another world  the poem , in its obvious phase , that of a simple narrative , may be said to have its completion .
so far , everything is within the limits of the accountable  of the real .
a <name> having learned by <unk> the single word " nevermore , " and having escaped from the custody of its owner , is driven at midnight , through the violence of a storm , to seek admission at a window from which a light still gleams  the <unk> of a student , occupied half in pouring over a volume , half in dreaming of a beloved mistress deceased .
the casement being thrown open at the fluttering of the bird 's wings , the bird itself <unk> on the most convenient seat out of the immediate reach of the student , who , amused by the incident and the oddity of the <unk> demeanor , demands of it , in jest and with out looking for a reply , its name .
the <name> addressed , answers with its customary word , " nevermore "  a word which finds immediate <name> in the melancholy heart of the student , who , giving utterance aloud to certain thoughts suggested by the occasion , is again startled by the fowl 's repetition of " nevermore . "
the student now guesses the state of the case , but is impelled , as i have before explained , by the human thirst for <unk> , and in part by superstition , to <unk> such queries to the bird as <name> bring him , the lover , the most of the luxury of sorrow through the anticipated answer " nevermore . "
with the indulgence , to the extreme , of this <unk> , the narration , in what i have termed its first or obvious phase , has a natural termination , and so far there has been no <unk> of the limits of the real .
but in subjects so handled , however skilfully , or with however vivid an array of incident , there is always a certain hardness or nakedness which <unk> the <unk> eye .
two things are invariably required  first , some amount of complexity , or more properly , adaptation ; and , secondly , some amount of <unk> , some <unk> , however indefinite of meaning .
it is this latter , in especial , which imparts to a work of <name> so much of that richness ( to borrow from colloquy a forcible term ) which we are too fond of <unk> with the ideal .
it is the excess of the suggested meaning  it is the rendering this the upper instead of the under current of theme  which turns into prose ( and that of the very <unk> kind ) the so-called poetry of the so-called <unk> .
holding these opinions , i added the two concluding stanzas of the poem  their <unk> being thus made to <unk> all the narrative which has preceded them .
the <unk> of meaning is rendered first apparent in the lines : " take thy beak from out my heart , and take thy form from off my door ! "
quoth the <name> , " nevermore ! "
it <name> be observed that the words , " from out my heart , " involve the first metaphorical expression in the poem .
they , with the answer , " nevermore , " dispose the mind to seek a moral in all that has been previously narrated .
the reader begins now to regard the <name> as <unk>  but it is not until the very last line of the very last stanza , that the intention of making him <unk> of mournful and <unk> remembrance is permitted distinctly to be seen : and the <name> , never flitting , still is sitting , still is sitting on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door ; and his eyes have all the seeming of a demon 's that is dreaming , and the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor ; and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted  nevermore !
* * * * * old english poetry .
[ 1 ] it should not be doubted that at least one-third of the affection with which we regard the elder poets of great britain should be attributed to what is , in itself , a thing apart from poetry  we mean to the simple love of the antique  and that , again , a third of even the proper poetic sentiment inspired by their writings , should be ascribed to a fact which , while it has strict connection with poetry in the abstract , and with the old british poems themselves , should not be looked upon as a merit <unk> to the authors of the poems .
almost every devout admirer of the old bards , if demanded his opinion of their productions , would mention vaguely , yet with perfect sincerity , a sense of dreamy , wild , indefinite , and he would perhaps say , indefinable delight ; on being required to point out the source of this so shadowy pleasure , he would be apt to speak of the quaint in phraseology and in general handling .
this <unk> is , in fact , a very powerful adjunct to <unk> , but in the case in question it arises independently of the author 's <name> , and is altogether apart from his intention .
words and their rhythm have varied .
verses which affect us to-day with a vivid delight , and which delight , in many instances , may be traced to the one source , <unk> , must have worn in the days of their construction a very commonplace air .
this is , of course , no argument against the poems now  we mean it only as against the poets then .
there is a growing <name> to overrate them .
the old english muse was <name> , guileless , sincere and although very learned , still learned without <name> .
no general error <unk> a more thorough confusion of ideas than the error of supposing donne and <unk> metaphysical in the sense wherein wordsworth and coleridge are so .
with the two former ethics were the end  with the two latter the means .
the poet of the " creation " wished , by highly artificial verse , to <unk> what he supposed to be moral truth  the poet of the " ancient mariner " to <unk> the poetic sentiment through channels suggested by analysis .
the one finished by complete failure what he commenced in the <unk> <unk> ; the other , by a path which could not possibly lead him astray , arrived at a triumph which is not the less glorious because hidden from the profane eyes of the multitude .
but in this view even the " metaphysical verse " of <unk> is but evidence of the simplicity and <unk> of the man .
and he was in this but a type of his school  for we may as well designate in this way the entire class of writers whose poems are bound up in the volume before us , and throughout all of whom there runs a very perceptible general character .
they used little <name> in composition .
their writings sprang immediately from the soul  and partook intensely of that soul 's nature .
nor is it difficult to perceive the tendency of this abandon  to elevate immeasurably all the energies of mind  but , again , so to mingle the greatest possible fire , force , delicacy , and all good things , with the lowest possible <unk> , baldness , and imbecility , as to render it not a matter of doubt that the average results of mind in such a school <name> be found inferior to those results in one ( <unk> <unk> ) more artificial .
we can not bring ourselves to believe that the selections of the " book of gems " are such as <name> impart to a poetical reader the clearest possible idea of the beauty of the school  but if the intention had been merely to show the school 's character , the attempt might have been considered successful in the highest degree .
there are long passages now before us of the most despicable trash , with no merit whatever beyond that of their antiquity .
the criticisms of the editor do not particularly please us .
his enthusiasm is too general and too vivid not to be false .
his opinion , for example , of sir <name> 's <unk> 's " verses on the <name> of bohemia "  that " there are few finer things in our language , " is untenable and absurd .
in such lines we can perceive not one of those higher attributes of <unk> which belong to her in all circumstances and throughout all time .
here everything is <name> , <unk> , or but awkwardly concealed .
no <unk> for the mere antique ( and in this case we can imagine no other <unk> ) should induce us to <unk> with the sacred name of poetry , a series , such as this , of elaborate and threadbare compliments , stitched , apparently , together , without fancy , without plausibility , and without even an attempt at adaptation .
in common with all the world , we have been much delighted with " the shepherd 's hunting " by withers  a poem partaking , in a remarkable degree , of the peculiarities of <unk> <unk> ' .
speaking of <unk> , the author says : " by the murmur of a spring , or the least boughs <unk> , by a <name> whose leaves spread , shut when <unk> goes to bed , or a shady bush or tree , she could more <unk> in me than all nature 's beauties con in some other wiser man .
by her help i also now make this <unk> place allow something that may <unk> gladness in the very gall of sadness  the dull <unk> , the black shade , that these hanging vaults have made the strange music of the waves beating on these hollow caves , this black den which rocks <unk> , overgrown with eldest moss , the rude <unk> that give light more to terror than delight , this my chamber of neglect walled about with disrespect ; from all these and this dull air a fit object for despair , she hath taught me by her might to draw comfort and delight . "
but these lines , however good , do not bear with them much of the general character of the english antique .
something more of this <name> be found in <unk> 's " farewell to the fairies ! "
we copy a portion of <unk> " maiden lamenting for her <name> , " which we prefer  not only as a specimen of the elder poets , but in itself as a beautiful poem , abounding in pathos , exquisitely delicate imagination and truthfulness  to anything of its species : " it is a wondrous thing how fleet 't was on those little silver feet , with what a pretty skipping <name> it oft would challenge me the race , and whe n't had left me far away 'twould stay , and run again , and stay ; for it was <unk> much than <unk> , and trod as if on the four winds .
i have a garden of my own , but so with roses overgrown , and lilies , that you would it guess to be a little wilderness ; and all the <unk> of the year it only loved to be there .
among the beds of lilies i have sought it oft where it should lie , yet could not , till itself would rise , find it , although before mine eyes .
for in the <unk> lilies shade it like a bank of lilies laid ; upon the roses it would feed until its lips even seemed to bleed , and then to me 'twould boldly trip , and print those roses on my lip , but all its chief delight was still with roses thus itself to fill , and its pure virgin limbs to fold in whitest sheets of lilies cold , had it lived long , it would have been lilies without , roses within . "
how truthful an air of lamentations hangs here upon every syllable !
it pervades all .
it comes over the sweet <name> of the words  over the gentleness and <name> which we fancy in the little maiden herself  even over the <unk> , <unk> air with which she lingers on the beauties and good qualities of her favorite  like the cool shadow of a summer cloud over a bed of lilies and violets , " and all sweet flowers . "
the whole is <unk> with poetry of a very lofty order .
every line is an idea conveying either the beauty and <unk> of the <name> , or the <unk> of the maiden , or her love , or her admiration , or her grief , or the fragrance and warmth and <unk> of the little <unk> bed of lilies and roses which the <name> devoured as it lay upon them , and could scarcely be distinguished from them by the once happy little damsel who went to seek her pet with an arch and <name> smile on her face .
consider the great variety of truthful and delicate thought in the few lines we have quoted  the wonder of the little maiden at the fleetness of her favorite  the " little silver feet "  the <name> challenging his mistress to a race with " a pretty skipping <name> , " running on before , and then , with head turned back , awaiting her approach only to fly from it again  can we not distinctly perceive all these things ?
how exceedingly vigorous , too , is the line , " and trod as if on the four winds ! "
a vigor apparent only when we keep in mind the artless character of the speaker and the four feet of the favorite , one for each wind .
then consider the garden of " my own , " so overgrown , entangled with roses and lilies , as to be " a little wilderness "  the <name> loving to be there , and there " only "  the maiden seeking it " where it should lie "  and not being able to distinguish it from the flowers until " itself would rise "  the lying among the lilies " like a bank of lilies "  the loving to " fill itself with roses , " " and its pure virgin limbs to fold in whitest sheets of lilies cold , " and these things being its " chief " delights  and then the <unk> beauty and <unk> of the concluding lines , whose very <unk> only renders them more true to nature when we consider the innocence , the <unk> , the enthusiasm , the passionate girl , and more passionate admiration of the bereaved child : " had it lived long , it would have been lilies without , roses within .

entered , according to act of congress , in the year 1848 , by <name> a. poe , in the <unk> office of the district court for the southern district of <unk> .
<unk> , trow & co <unk> , 33 <unk> .
with very profound respect , this work is dedicated to <name> <name> humboldt .
preface .
to the few who love me and whom i <unk> those who feel rather than to those who <unk> the dreamers and those who put <name> in dreams as in the only <unk> offer this book of truths , not in its character of <unk> , but for the beauty that abounds in its truth ; constituting it true .
to these i present the composition as an <unk> alone : <unk> us say as a romance ; or , if i be not urging too lofty a claim , as a poem .
what i here <unk> is true : <unk> it can not die : <unk> if by any means it be now trodden down so that it die , it <name> <unk> again to the life <unk> nevertheless it is as a poem only that i wish this work to be judged after i am dead .
e. a. p. eureka : an essay on the material and spiritual universe .
it is with humility really <unk> is with a sentiment even of <unk> i pen the opening sentence of this work : for of all conceivable subjects i approach the reader with the most <unk> most <unk> most <unk> most <name> .
what terms shall i find sufficiently simple in their <unk> sublime in their <unk> the mere enunciation of my theme ?
i design to speak of the physical , metaphysical and <unk> the material and spiritual universe : <unk> its essence , its origin , its creation , its present condition and its <name> .
i shall be so rash , moreover , as to challenge the conclusions , and thus , in effect , to question the sagacity , of many of the greatest and most justly <unk> of men .
in the beginning , let me as distinctly as possible <unk> the <unk> which i <name> to <unk> , whatever the mathematicians may assert , there is , in this world at least , no such thing as <unk> the ruling idea which , throughout this volume , i shall be continually endeavoring to suggest .
my general proposition , then , is this : <unk> the original unity of the first thing lies the secondary cause of all things , with the germ of their inevitable annihilation .
in illustration of this idea , i propose to take such a survey of the universe that the mind may be able really to receive and to perceive an individual impression .
he who from the top of <unk> casts his eyes leisurely around , is affected chiefly by the extent and diversity of the scene .
only by a rapid whirling on his heel could he <name> to comprehend the panorama in the sublimity of its <unk> .
but as , on the summit of <unk> , no man has thought of whirling on his heel , so no man has ever taken into his <name> the full <unk> of the prospect ; and so , again , whatever considerations lie involved in this <unk> , have as yet no practical existence for mankind .
i do not know a treatise in which a survey of the <unk> the word in its most comprehensive and only legitimate <unk> taken at all : —and it may be as well here to mention that by the term <unk> , ” wherever employed without qualification in this essay , i mean to designate the utmost conceivable expanse of space , with all things , spiritual and material , that can be imagined to exist within the compass of that expanse .
in speaking of what is ordinarily implied by the expression , <unk> , ” i shall take a phrase of <unk> universe of <unk> why this distinction is considered necessary , <name> be seen in the sequel .
but even of treatises on the really limited , although always assumed as the <unk> , universe of stars , i know none in which a survey , even of this limited universe , is so taken as to warrant deductions from its individuality .
the nearest approach to such a work is made in the <unk> of <name> <name> humboldt .
he presents the subject , however , not in its individuality but in its generality .
his theme , in its last result , is the law of each portion of the merely physical universe , as this law is related to the laws of every other portion of this merely physical universe .
his design is simply <unk> .
in a word , he <unk> the universality of material relation , and <unk> to the eye of philosophy whatever inferences have hitherto lain hidden behind this universality .
but however admirable be the <unk> with which he has treated each particular point of his topic , the mere multiplicity of these points occasions , necessarily , an amount of detail , and thus an <unk> of idea , which <unk> all individuality of impression .
it seems to me that , in aiming at this latter effect , and , through it , at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , if nothing better offer itself the mere guesses which may result from <unk> require something like a mental <unk> on the heel .
we need so rapid a revolution of all things about the central point of sight that , while the <unk> vanish altogether , even the more conspicuous objects become blended into one .
among the vanishing <unk> , in a survey of this kind , would be all exclusively terrestrial matters .
the earth would be considered in its <unk> relations alone .
a man , in this view , becomes mankind ; mankind a member of the <unk> family of <unk> .
and now , before proceeding to our subject proper , let me beg the <unk> attention to an extract or two from a somewhat remarkable letter , which appears to have been found <unk> in a bottle and floating on the mare <unk> ocean well described by the <unk> <unk> , ptolemy <unk> , but little frequented in modern days unless by the <unk> and some other divers for <unk> .
the date of this letter , i confess , surprises me even more particularly than its contents ; for it seems to have been written in the year two thousand eight hundred and forty-eight .
as for the passages i am about to <unk> , they , i fancy , <name> speak for themselves .
“do you know , my dear friend , ” says the writer , addressing , no doubt , a <unk> you know that it is scarcely more than eight or nine hundred years ago since the <unk> first consented to relieve the people of the singular fancy that there exist but two practicable roads to truth ?
believe it if you can !
it appears , however , that long , long ago , in the night of time , there lived a turkish philosopher called <unk> and <unk> <unk> [ here , possibly , the letter-writer means aristotle ; the best names are <unk> corrupted in two or three thousand years . ]
“the fame of this great man depended mainly upon his demonstration that sneezing is a natural provision , by means of which <unk> thinkers are enabled to expel superfluous ideas through the nose ; but he obtained a scarcely less valuable celebrity as the founder , or at all events as the principal <unk> , of what was termed the <unk> or à priori philosophy .
he started with what he maintained to be axioms , or self-evident truths : —and the now well understood fact that no truths are <unk> , really does not make in the slightest degree against his speculations : <unk> was sufficient for his purpose that the truths in question were evident at all .
from axioms he proceeded , logically , to results .
his most illustrious disciples were one <unk> , a <unk> , ” [ meaning euclid ] “and one kant , a dutchman , the originator of that species of <unk> which , with the change merely of a c for a k , now bears his peculiar name .
“well , <unk> <unk> flourished supreme , until the advent of one hog , <unk> ‘the <unk> shepherd , ’ who preached an entirely different system , which he called the à <unk> or <unk> .
his plan referred altogether to sensation .
he proceeded by observing , analyzing , and classifying <unk> <unk> , as they were somewhat <unk> <unk> arranging them into general laws .
in a word , while the mode of <unk> rested on <unk> , that of hog depended on phenomena ; and so great was the admiration excited by this latter system that , at its first introduction , <unk> fell into general <unk> .
finally , however , he recovered ground , and was permitted to divide the empire of philosophy with his more modern rival : —the savans contenting themselves with <unk> all other competitors , past , present , and to come ; putting an end to all controversy on the topic by the <unk> of a median law , to the effect that the <unk> and baconian roads are , and of right ought to be , the <unk> possible avenues to knowledge : <unk> , ’ you must know , my dear friend , ” adds the letter-writer at this point , <unk> an adjective invented as equivalent to <unk> , and at the same time more dignified and <unk> .
“now i do assure you most <unk> the <unk> i represent these matters fairly ; and you can easily understand how restrictions so absurd on their very face must have operated , in those days , to retard the progress of true science , which makes its most important <unk> all history <name> <unk> seemingly <unk> leaps .
these ancient ideas confined investigation to crawling ; and i need not suggest to you that crawling , among varieties of locomotion , is a very capital thing of its kind ; —but because the tortoise is sure of foot , for this reason must we clip the wings of the eagles ?
for many centuries , so great was the infatuation , about hog especially , that a <unk> stop was put to all thinking , properly so called .
no man dared utter a truth for which he felt himself indebted to his soul alone .
it mattered not whether the truth was even <unk> such ; for the <unk> philosophers of that epoch regarded only the road by which it professed to have been attained .
the end , with them , was a point of no moment , whatever : <unk> means ! ’ they <unk> us look at the means ! <unk> if , on scrutiny of the means , it was found to come neither under the category hog , nor under the category <unk> ( which means ram ) , why then the savans went no farther , but , calling the thinker a fool and <unk> him a <unk> , ’ would never , thenceforward , have any thing to do either with him or with his truths .
“now , my dear friend , ” continues the letter-writer , “it can not be maintained that by the crawling system , exclusively adopted , men would arrive at the maximum amount of truth , even in any long series of ages ; for the repression of imagination was an evil not to be counterbalanced even by absolute certainty in the snail processes .
but their certainty was very far from absolute .
the error of our progenitors was quite analogous with that of the <unk> who fancies he must necessarily see an object the more distinctly , the more closely he holds it to his eyes .
they blinded themselves , too , with the impalpable , <unk> scotch snuff of detail ; and thus the boasted facts of the <unk> were by no means always <unk> point of little importance but for the assumption that they always were .
the vital taint , however , in <unk> most lamentable <unk> of <unk> in its tendency to throw power and consideration into the hands of merely <unk> <unk> those <unk> <unk> , the microscopical <unk> <unk> and <unk> of minute facts , for the most part in physical <unk> all of which they <unk> at the same price upon the highway ; their value depending , it was supposed , simply upon the fact of their fact , without reference to their <unk> or <unk> in the development of those ultimate and only legitimate facts , called law .
<unk> the <unk> letter goes on to <unk> the persons thus suddenly elevated by the <unk> philosophy into a station for which they were <unk> transferred from the <unk> into the parlors of <unk> its <unk> into its <unk> these individuals a more <unk> more intolerable set of <unk> and tyrants never existed on the face of the earth .
their creed , their text and their sermon were , alike , the one word <unk> , for the most part , even of this one word , they knew not even the meaning .
on those who ventured to disturb their facts with the view of putting them in order and to use , the disciples of hog had no <name> whatever .
all attempts at generalization were met at once by the words <unk> , ’ <unk> , ’ <unk> thought , to be brief , was very properly resented as a personal affront to themselves .
cultivating the natural sciences to the exclusion of metaphysics , the mathematics , and logic , many of these <unk> <unk> , <unk> and lame of a <unk> more <unk> <unk> miserably ignorant , in view of all the comprehensible objects of knowledge , than the veriest <unk> hind who proves that he knows something at least , in admitting that he knows absolutely nothing .
<unk> had our forefathers any better right to talk about certainty , when pursuing , in blind confidence , the à priori path of axioms , or of the ram .
at innumerable points this path was scarcely as straight as a <unk> .
the simple truth is , that the <unk> erected their castles upon a basis far less reliable than air ; for no such things as axioms ever existed or can possibly exist at all .
this they must have been very blind , indeed , not to see , or at least to suspect ; for , even in their own day , many of their <unk> <unk> had been abandoned : <unk> <unk> <unk> fit , ’ for example , and a <unk> can not act where it is not , ’ and <unk> can not be <unk> , ’ and <unk> can not proceed from <unk> these and numerous similar propositions formerly accepted , without hesitation , as axioms , or undeniable truths , were , even at the period of which i speak , seen to be altogether untenable : <unk> absurd in these people , then , to persist in relying upon a basis , as immutable , whose <unk> had become so repeatedly manifest !
“but , even through evidence afforded by themselves against themselves , it is easy to convict these à priori <unk> of the <unk> <unk> is easy to show the <unk> <unk> of their axioms in general .
i have now lying before <unk> <name> be observed that we still proceed with the <unk> have now lying before me a book printed about a thousand years ago .
pundit assures me that it is decidedly the <unk> ancient work on its topic , which is <unk> the author , who was much esteemed in his day , was one miller , or mill ; and we find it recorded of him , as a point of some importance , that he rode a <unk> whom he called <name> bentham : —but let us glance at the volume itself !
<unk> ! <unk> or inability to conceive , ’ says mr. mill very properly , <unk> in no case to be received as a criterion of <unk> <unk> now , that this is a palpable <unk> no one in his senses <name> deny .
not to admit the proposition , is to insinuate a charge of variability in truth itself , whose very title is a <unk> of the steadfast .
if ability to conceive be taken as a criterion of truth , then a truth to <name> hume would very seldom be a truth to <name> ; and ninety-nine <unk> of what is undeniable in heaven would be <unk> <unk> upon earth .
the proposition of mr. mill , then , is sustained .
i <name> not <name> it to be an axiom ; and this merely because i am showing that no axioms exist ; but , with a distinction which could not have been <unk> at even by mr. mill himself , i am ready to <name> that , if an axiom there be , then the proposition of which we speak has the fullest right to be considered an <unk> no more absolute axiom <unk> , consequently , that any subsequent proposition which shall conflict with this one primarily advanced , must be either a <unk> in <unk> is to say no <unk> , if admitted <unk> , must at once neutralize both itself and its predecessor .
“and now , by the logic of their own <unk> , let us proceed to test any one of the axioms propounded .
let us give mr. mill the fairest of play .
we <name> bring the point to no ordinary issue .
we <name> select for investigation no <unk> <unk> axiom of what , not the less <unk> because only <unk> , he terms his secondary <unk> if a positive truth by definition could be either more or less positively a truth : <unk> <name> select , i say , no axiom of an <unk> so questionable as is to be found in euclid .
we <name> not talk , for example , about such propositions as that two straight lines can not enclose a space , or that the whole is greater than any one of its parts .
we <name> afford the <unk> every advantage .
we <name> come at once to a proposition which he regards as the acme of the <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
here it is : <unk> can not both be <unk> is , can not <unk> in <unk> here mr. mill means , for instance , —and i give the most forcible instance <unk> a tree must be either a tree or not a <unk> it can not be at the same time a tree and not a tree : <unk> which is quite reasonable of itself and <name> answer remarkably well as an axiom , until we bring it into <unk> with an axiom insisted upon a few pages <unk> other <unk> which i have previously <unk> we test it by the logic of its own <unk> .
<unk> tree , ’ mr. mill asserts , <unk> be either a tree or not a <unk> very well : —and now let me ask him , why .
to this little query there is but one response : <unk> defy any man living to invent a second .
the sole answer is this : <unk> we find it impossible to conceive that a tree can be any thing else than a tree or not a <unk> this , i repeat , is mr. <unk> sole answer : <unk> <name> not pretend to suggest another : —and yet , by his own showing , his answer is clearly no answer at all ; for has he not already required us to admit , as an axiom , that ability or inability to conceive is in no case to be taken as a criterion of <unk> truth ?
thus <unk> all his <unk> is at sea without a rudder .
let it not be urged that an exception from the general rule is to be made , in cases where the <unk> to <unk> is so peculiarly great as when we are called upon to conceive a tree both a tree and not a tree .
let no attempt , i say , be made at urging this <unk> ; for , in the first place , there are no degrees of <unk> , ’ and thus no one impossible <name> can be more peculiarly impossible than another impossible <name> : —in the second place , mr. mill himself , no doubt after thorough deliberation , has most distinctly , and most rationally , excluded all opportunity for exception , by the emphasis of his proposition , that , in no case , is ability or inability to conceive , to be taken as a criterion of <unk> truth : —in the third place , even were exceptions admissible at all , it remains to be shown how any exception is admissible here .
that a tree can be both a tree and not a tree , is an idea which the angels , or the devils , may entertain , and which no doubt many an earthly <unk> , or <unk> , does .
“now i do not quarrel with these ancients , ” continues the letter-writer , <unk> much on account of the transparent frivolity of their <unk> , to be plain , was <unk> , worthless and fantastic <unk> on account of their pompous and <unk> <unk> of all other roads to truth than the two narrow and crooked <unk> one of creeping and the other of <unk> which , in their ignorant perversity , they have dared to confine the <unk> soul which loves nothing so well as to soar in those regions of illimitable intuition which are utterly <unk> of <unk> “by the bye , my dear friend , is it not an evidence of the mental slavery <unk> upon those bigoted people by their hogs and rams , that in spite of the eternal <unk> of their savans about roads to truth , none of them fell , even by accident , into what we now so distinctly perceive to be the broadest , the straightest and most available of all mere <unk> great <unk> majestic highway of the consistent ?
is it not wonderful that they should have failed to deduce from the works of god the <unk> momentous consideration that a perfect consistency can be nothing but an absolute truth ?
how <unk> rapid our progress since the late announcement of this proposition !
by its means , investigation has been taken out of the hands of the <unk> , and given as a duty , rather than as a task , to the <unk> the only true <unk> the <unk> men of ardent imagination .
these <unk> <unk> <unk> are the <unk> you not fancy the shout of scorn with which they would be received by our progenitors , were it possible for them to be looking over my shoulders as i write ?
the <unk> , i repeat , <unk> their theories are merely <unk> , little by little , of their chaff of <unk> at length there stands apparent an <unk> <unk> consistency which the most stolid <unk> it is a <unk> be an absolute and an unquestionable truth .
“i have often thought , my friend , that it must have puzzled these <unk> of a thousand years ago , to determine , even , by which of their two boasted roads it is that the <unk> attains the solution of the more <unk> <unk> by which of them <unk> guided mankind to those important and innumerable truths which , for so many centuries , have lain entombed amid the <unk> hieroglyphics of egypt .
in especial , would it not have given these <unk> some trouble to determine by which of their two roads was reached the most momentous and sublime of all their <unk> <unk> fact of gravitation ?
<name> deduced it from the laws of kepler .
kepler admitted that these laws he <unk> laws whose investigation disclosed to the greatest of british astronomers that principle , the basis of all ( existing ) physical principle , in going behind which we enter at once the nebulous kingdom of metaphysics .
yes ! <unk> vital laws kepler <unk> is to say , he imagined them .
had he been asked to point out either the <unk> or <unk> route by which he attained them , his reply might have <unk> know nothing about <unk> i do know the machinery of the universe .
here it is .
i grasped it with my <unk> reached it through mere dint of <unk> alas , poor ignorant old man !
could not any metaphysician have told him that what he called <unk> was but the conviction resulting from <unk> or <unk> of which the processes were so shadowy as to have escaped his consciousness , eluded his reason , or bidden defiance to his capacity of expression ?
how great a pity it is that some <unk> <unk> had not enlightened him about all this !
how it would have comforted him on his death-bed to know that , instead of having gone <unk> and thus <unk> , he had , in fact , proceeded <unk> and <unk> is to say <unk> , or at least <unk> the vast halls where lay gleaming , <unk> , and hitherto untouched by mortal <unk> by mortal <unk> imperishable and priceless secrets of the universe !
“yes , kepler was essentially a <unk> ; but this title , now of so much sanctity , was , in those ancient days , a designation of supreme contempt .
it is only now that men begin to appreciate that divine old <unk> sympathize with the <unk> and poetical <unk> of his <unk> words .
for my part , ” continues the unknown correspondent , “i glow with a sacred fire when i even think of them , and feel that i shall never grow weary of their repetition : —in concluding this letter , let me have the real pleasure of <unk> them once again : <unk> care not whether my work be read now or by posterity .
i can afford to wait a century for readers when god himself has waited six thousand years for an observer .
i triumph .
i have stolen the golden secret of the egyptians .
i <name> indulge my sacred <unk> here end my quotations from this very unaccountable and , perhaps , somewhat impertinent epistle ; and perhaps it would be folly to comment , in any respect , upon the <unk> , not to say revolutionary , fancies of the <unk> he <unk> so radically at war with the <unk> and <unk> opinions of this age .
let us proceed , then , to our legitimate <unk> , the universe .
this <unk> admits a choice between two modes of discussion : <unk> may <unk> or <unk> .
beginning at our own point of <unk> the earth on which we <unk> may pass to the other planets of our <unk> to the <unk> to our system considered <unk> thence , through other systems , indefinitely outwards ; or , commencing on high at some point as definite as we can make it or conceive it , we may come down to the habitation of man .
<unk> is to say , in ordinary essays on <unk> first of these two modes is , with certain reservation , adopted : <unk> for the obvious reason that astronomical facts , merely , and principles , being the object , that object is best fulfilled in stepping from the known because proximate , gradually onward to the point where all <unk> becomes lost in the remote .
for my present purpose , however , —that of enabling the mind to take in , as if from afar and at one glance , a distinct <name> of the individual <unk> is clear that a descent to small from <unk> the outskirts from the centre ( if we could establish a centre ) <unk> the end from the beginning ( if we could fancy a beginning ) would be the preferable course , but for the difficulty , if not impossibility , of presenting , in this course , to the <unk> , a picture at all comprehensible in regard to such considerations as are involved in <unk> is to say , in number , magnitude and distance .
now , <unk> , at all points , is a primary feature in my general design .
on important topics it is better to be a good deal <unk> than even a very little obscure .
but <unk> is a quality <unk> to no subject per se .
all are alike , in facility of comprehension , to him who approaches them by properly graduated steps .
it is merely because a <unk> , here and there , is heedlessly left <unk> in our road to the <unk> <unk> , that this latter is not altogether as simple a thing as a sonnet by mr. <name> <unk> .
by way of admitting , then , no chance for <unk> , i think it advisable to proceed as if even the more obvious facts of astronomy were unknown to the reader .
in combining the two modes of discussion to which i have referred , i propose to avail myself of the advantages peculiar to <unk> very especially of the <unk> in detail which <name> be unavoidable as a consequence of the plan .
commencing with a descent , i shall reserve for the return upwards those indispensable considerations of quantity to which allusion has already been made .
let us begin , then , at once , with that merest of words , <unk> this , like <unk> , ” <unk> , ” and some other expressions of which the equivalents exist in all languages , is by no means the expression of an <unk> of an effort at one .
it stands for the possible attempt at an impossible <name> .
man needed a term by which to point out the direction of this <unk> cloud behind which lay , forever invisible , the object of this attempt .
a word , in fine , was demanded , by means of which one human being might put himself in relation at once with another human being and with a certain tendency of the human intellect .
out of this demand arose the word , <unk> ; ” which is thus the representative but of the thought of a thought .
as regards that infinity now <unk> infinity of <unk> often hear it said that <unk> idea is admitted by the <unk> acquiesced <unk> <unk> account of the greater difficulty which attends the <name> of a <unk> but this is merely one of those phrases by which even profound thinkers , time out of mind , have occasionally taken pleasure in deceiving themselves .
the quibble lies concealed in the word <unk> “the mind , ” we are told , <unk> the idea of limitless , through the greater difficulty which it finds in entertaining that of limited , <unk> now , were the proposition but fairly put , its absurdity would become transparent at once .
clearly , there is no mere difficulty in the case .
the assertion intended , if presented according to its intention and without <unk> , would run thus : <unk> mind admits the idea of limitless , through the greater impossibility of entertaining that of limited , <unk> it must be immediately seen that this is not a question of two statements between whose respective <unk> of two arguments between whose respective <unk> reason is called upon to decide : <unk> is a matter of two conceptions , directly conflicting , and each <unk> impossible , one of which the intellect is supposed to be capable of entertaining , on account of the greater impossibility of entertaining the other .
the choice is not made between two difficulties ; <unk> is merely fancied to be made between two impossibilities .
now of the former , there are <unk> of the latter , none : <unk> as our impertinent letter-writer has already suggested .
a task may be more or less difficult ; but it is either possible or not possible : <unk> are no gradations .
it might be more difficult to overthrow the andes than an <unk> ; but it can be no more impossible to annihilate the matter of the one than the matter of the other .
a man may jump ten feet with less difficulty than he can jump twenty , but the impossibility of his leaping to the moon is not a whit less than that of his leaping to the <unk> .
since all this is undeniable : since the choice of the mind is to be made between impossibilities of <name> : since one impossibility can not be greater than another : and since , thus , one can not be preferred to another : the philosophers who not only maintain , on the grounds mentioned , man’s idea of infinity but , on account of such <unk> idea , infinity <unk> plainly engaged in demonstrating one impossible thing to be possible by showing how it is that some one other <unk> impossible too .
this , it <name> be said , is nonsense ; and perhaps it is : <unk> i think it very capital <unk> forego all claim to it as nonsense of mine .
the <unk> mode , however , of displaying the fallacy of the philosophical argument on this question , is by simply <unk> to a fact respecting it which has been hitherto quite <unk> fact that the argument alluded to both proves and <unk> its own proposition .
“the mind is impelled , ” say the <unk> and others , “to admit a first cause , by the superior difficulty it experiences in conceiving cause beyond cause without <unk> the quibble , as before , lies in the word <unk> here what is it employed to sustain ?
a first cause .
and what is a first cause ?
an ultimate termination of causes .
and what is an ultimate termination of causes ?
<unk> finite .
thus the one quibble , in two processes , by god knows how many philosophers , is made to support now <unk> and now <unk> it not be brought to support something besides ?
as for the <unk> , at least , are insupportable .
<unk> dismiss them : <unk> they prove in the one case is the identical nothing which they demonstrate in the other .
of course , no one <name> suppose that i here contend for the absolute impossibility of that which we attempt to convey in the word <unk> my purpose is but to show the folly of endeavoring to prove infinity itself or even our <name> of it , by any such blundering <unk> as that which is ordinarily employed .
nevertheless , as an individual , i may be permitted to say that i cannot conceive infinity , and am convinced that no human being can .
a mind not thoroughly <unk> accustomed to the <unk> analysis of its own <unk> , it is true , often deceive itself by supposing that it has entertained the <name> of which we speak .
in the effort to entertain it , we proceed step beyond <unk> fancy point still beyond point ; and so long as we continue the effort , it may be said , in fact , that we are tending to the formation of the idea designed ; while the strength of the impression that we actually form or have formed it , is in the ratio of the period during which we keep up the mental endeavor .
but it is in the act of <unk> the <unk> fulfilling ( as we think ) the <unk> putting the finishing stroke ( as we suppose ) to the <unk> we overthrow at once the whole fabric of our fancy by resting upon some one ultimate and therefore definite point .
this fact , however , we fail to perceive , on account of the absolute coincidence , in time , between the settling down upon the ultimate point and the act of cessation in <unk> attempting , on the other hand , to frame the idea of a limited space , we merely converse the processes which involve the impossibility .
we believe in a god .
we may or may not believe in finite or in infinite space ; but our belief , in such cases , is more properly designated as <name> , and is a matter quite distinct from that belief <unk> that intellectual <unk> <unk> the mental <name> .
the fact is , that , upon the enunciation of any one of that class of terms to which <unk> <unk> class representing thoughts of <unk> who has a right to say that he thinks at all , feels himself called upon , not to entertain a <name> , but simply to direct his mental vision toward some given point , in the intellectual firmament , where lies a <unk> never to be resolved .
to solve it , indeed , he makes no effort ; for with a rapid instinct he <unk> , not only the impossibility , but , as regards all human purposes , the <unk> , of its solution .
he perceives that the deity has not designed it to be solved .
he sees , at once , that it lies out of the <name> of man , and even how , if not exactly why , it lies out of it .
there are people , i am aware , who , <unk> themselves in attempts at the unattainable , acquire very easily , by dint of the <unk> they emit , among those <unk> with whom darkness and depth are synonymous , a kind of cuttle-fish reputation for profundity ; but the finest quality of thought is its <unk> ; and , with some little <unk> , it may be said that no fog of the mind can well be greater than that which , extending to the very boundaries of the mental domain , shuts out even these boundaries themselves from comprehension .
it <name> now be understood that , in using the phrase , <unk> of space , ” i make no call upon the reader to entertain the impossible <name> of an absolute infinity .
i refer simply to the <unk> conceivable <unk> of <unk> shadowy and fluctuating domain , now shrinking , now swelling , in accordance with the <unk> energies of the imagination .
hitherto , the universe of stars has always been considered as coincident with the universe proper , as i have defined it in the commencement of this discourse .
it has been always either directly or indirectly <unk> least since the <name> of intelligible <unk> , were it possible for us to attain any given point in space , we should still find , on all sides of us , an interminable succession of stars .
this was the untenable idea of <unk> when making perhaps the most successful attempt ever made , at <unk> the <name> for which we struggle in the word <unk> “it is a sphere , ” he says , <unk> which the centre is everywhere , the circumference , <unk> but although this intended definition is , in fact , no definition of the universe of stars , we may accept it , with some mental reservation , as a definition ( rigorous enough for all practical purposes ) of the universe <unk> is to say , of the universe of space .
this latter , then , let us regard as <unk> sphere of which the centre is everywhere , the circumference <unk> in fact , while we find it impossible to fancy an end to space , we have no difficulty in picturing to ourselves any one of an infinity of beginnings .
as our <unk> , then , let us adopt the <unk> .
of this <unk> , in itself , he alone is not <unk> alone is not impious who <unk> .
<unk> ne <unk> <unk> , ” says the baron de <unk> ne <unk> <unk> de la nature ou de <unk> de dieu : <unk> <unk> ce <unk> est , il <unk> <unk> dieu <unk> know absolutely nothing of the nature or essence of god : —in order to comprehend what he is , we should have to be god <unk> <unk> should have to be god ourselves ! <unk> a phrase so startling as this yet ringing in my ears , i nevertheless venture to demand if this our present ignorance of the deity is an ignorance to which the soul is <unk> condemned .
by him , <unk> , at least , the <unk> <unk> him as <unk> is to say , as not <unk> distinction which , for all intelligible purposes , <name> stand well instead of a <unk> him , then , existing as spirit , let us content ourselves , to-night , with supposing to have been created , or made out of nothing , by dint of his <unk> some point of space which we <name> take as a <unk> some period into which we do not pretend to inquire , but at all events immensely <unk> him , then again , let us suppose to have been <unk> ?
this is a <unk> momentous epoch in our considerations .
what is it that we are <unk> alone we are justified in supposing to have been , primarily and solely , created ?
we have attained a point where only intuition can aid us : —but now let me recur to the idea which i have already suggested as that alone which we can properly entertain of intuition .
it is but the conviction arising from those <unk> or deductions of which the processes are so shadowy as to escape our consciousness , elude our reason , or defy our capacity of expression .
with this understanding , i now <unk> an intuition altogether irresistible , although inexpressible , forces me to the conclusion that what god originally <unk> that matter which , by dint of his volition , he first made from his spirit , or from <unk> , could have been nothing but matter in its utmost conceivable state <unk> ? <unk> simplicity ?
this <name> be found the sole absolute assumption of my discourse .
i use the word <unk> in its ordinary sense ; yet i maintain that even this my primary proposition , is very , very far indeed , from being really a mere assumption .
nothing was ever more <unk> human conclusion was ever , in fact , more <unk> rigorously <unk> : —but , alas !
the processes lie out of the human <unk> all events are beyond the utterance of the human tongue .
let us now endeavor to conceive what matter must be , when , or if , in its absolute extreme of simplicity .
here the reason flies at once to <unk> a <unk> one <unk> particle of one <unk> one <unk> one <unk> one <unk> one <unk> particle , therefore , <unk> form and <unk> particle positively a particle at all <unk> particle absolutely unique , individual , undivided , and not <unk> only because he who created it , by dint of his <name> , can by an infinitely less energetic exercise of the same <name> , as a matter of course , divide it .
<unk> , then , is all that i predicate of the originally created matter ; but i propose to show that this <unk> is a principle abundantly sufficient to account for the constitution , the existing phænomena and the plainly inevitable annihilation of at least the material universe .
the willing into being the primordial particle , has completed the act , or more properly the <name> , of creation .
we now proceed to the ultimate purpose for which we are to suppose the particle <unk> is to say , the ultimate purpose so far as our considerations yet enable us to see <unk> constitution of the universe from it , the particle .
this constitution has been effected by forcing the originally and therefore normally one into the abnormal condition of many .
an action of this character implies rëaction .
a diffusion from unity , under the conditions , involves a tendency to return into <unk> tendency ineradicable until satisfied .
but on these points i <name> speak more fully hereafter .
the assumption of absolute unity in the primordial particle includes that of infinite <unk> .
let us conceive the particle , then , to be only not totally exhausted by diffusion into space .
from the one particle , as a centre , let us suppose to be <unk> <unk> all <unk> immeasurable but still to definite distances in the previously vacant <unk> certain inexpressibly great yet limited number of <unk> yet not infinitely minute atoms .
now , of these atoms , thus diffused , or upon diffusion , what conditions are we <unk> to assume , but to infer , from consideration as well of their source as of the character of the design apparent in their diffusion ?
unity being their source , and difference from unity the character of the design manifested in their diffusion , we are warranted in supposing this character to be at least generally preserved throughout the design , and to form a portion of the design itself : —that is to say , we shall be warranted in conceiving continual differences at all points from the <unk> and simplicity of the origin .
but , for these reasons , shall we be justified in imagining the atoms heterogeneous , dissimilar , unequal , and <unk> ?
more <unk> we to consider no two atoms as , at their diffusion , of the same nature , or of the same form , or of the same size ? —and , after fulfilment of their diffusion into space , is absolute <unk> , each from each , to be understood of all of them ?
in such arrangement , under such conditions , we most easily and immediately comprehend the subsequent most feasible carrying out to completion of any such design as that which i have <unk> design of variety out of <unk> out of <unk> out of <unk> out of <unk> a word , the utmost possible multiplicity of relation out of the emphatically <unk> one .
undoubtedly , therefore , we should be warranted in assuming all that has been mentioned , but for the reflection , first , that <unk> is not <unk> of any divine act ; and , secondly , that the object supposed in view , appears as feasible when some of the conditions in question are dispensed with , in the beginning , as when all are understood immediately to exist .
i mean to say that some are involved in the rest , or so instantaneous a consequence of them as to make the distinction inappreciable .
difference of size , for example , <name> at once be brought about through the tendency of one atom to a second , in preference to a third , on account of particular <unk> ; which is to be comprehended as particular <unk> between centres of quantity , in neighboring atoms of different <unk> matter not at all interfering with the <unk> distribution of the atoms .
difference of kind , too , is easily conceived to be merely a result of differences in size and form , taken more or less conjointly : —in fact , since the unity of the particle proper implies absolute <unk> , we can not imagine the atoms , at their diffusion , differing in kind , without imagining , at the same time , a special exercise of the divine <name> , at the <unk> of each atom , for the purpose of effecting , in each , a change of its essential nature : <unk> fantastic an idea is the less to be indulged , as the object proposed is seen to be thoroughly attainable without such minute and elaborate interposition .
we perceive , therefore , upon the whole , that it would be <unk> , and consequently <unk> , to predicate of the atoms , in view of their purposes , any thing more than difference of form at their dispersion , with particular <unk> after <unk> other differences arising at once out of these , in the very first processes of <unk> : <unk> thus establish the universe on a purely geometrical basis .
of course , it is by no means necessary to assume absolute difference , even of form , among all the atoms <unk> more than absolute particular <unk> of each from each .
we are required to conceive merely that no neighboring atoms are of similar <unk> atoms which can ever approximate , until their inevitable <unk> at the end .
although the immediate and perpetual tendency of the <unk> atoms to return into their normal unity , is implied , as i have said , in their abnormal diffusion ; still it is clear that this tendency <name> be without <unk> tendency and no <unk> the <unk> energy , in ceasing to be exerted , shall leave it , the tendency , free to seek its satisfaction .
the divine act , however , being considered as determinate , and <unk> on fulfilment of the diffusion , we understand , at once , a <unk> other words , a <unk> tendency of the <unk> atoms to return into one .
but the <unk> energy being withdrawn , and the rëaction having commenced in furtherance of the ultimate <unk> of the utmost possible <unk> design is now in danger of being frustrated , in detail , by reason of that very tendency to return which is to effect its accomplishment in general .
multiplicity is the object ; but there is nothing to prevent proximate atoms , from <unk> at once , through the now <unk> <unk> the fulfilment of any ends proposed in <unk> absolute <unk> among themselves : <unk> is nothing to impede the aggregation of various unique masses , at various points of space : —in other words , nothing to interfere with the accumulation of various masses , each absolutely one .
for the effectual and thorough completion of the general design , we thus see the necessity for a repulsion of limited <unk> <unk> something which , on withdrawal of the <unk> volition , shall at the same time allow the approach , and forbid the junction , of the atoms ; suffering them infinitely to approximate , while denying them positive contact ; in a word , having the <unk> to a certain <unk> preventing their <unk> , but no ability to interfere with their <unk> in any respect or degree .
the repulsion , already considered as so peculiarly limited in other regards , must be understood , let me repeat , as having power to prevent absolute <unk> , only up to a certain epoch .
unless we are to conceive that the appetite for unity among the atoms is doomed to be satisfied never ; <unk> we are to conceive that what had a beginning is to have no <unk> <name> which can not really be entertained , however much we may talk or dream of entertaining <unk> are forced to conclude that the repulsive influence imagined , <name> , <unk> pressure of the <unk> collectively applied , but never and in no degree until , on fulfilment of the divine purposes , such collective application shall be naturally <unk> to a force which , at that ultimate epoch , shall be the superior force precisely to the extent required , and thus permit the universal subsidence into the inevitable , because original and therefore normal , <unk> conditions here to be reconciled are difficult indeed : <unk> can not even comprehend the possibility of their <unk> ; <unk> , the apparent impossibility is brilliantly suggestive .
that the repulsive something actually exists , we see .
man neither employs , nor knows , a force sufficient to bring two atoms into contact .
this is but the well-established proposition of the <unk> of matter .
all experiment <unk> philosophy admits it .
the design of the <unk> necessity for its <unk> have endeavored to show ; but from all attempt at investigating its nature have religiously <unk> ; this on account of an <unk> conviction that the principle at issue is strictly <unk> in a recess impervious to our present <unk> involved in a consideration of what <unk> our human <unk> not to be <unk> a consideration of spirit in itself .
i feel , in a word , that here the god has interposed , and here only , because here and here only the knot demanded the interposition of the god .
in fact , while the tendency of the diffused atoms to return into unity , <name> be recognized , at once , as the principle of the newtonian gravity , what i have spoken of as a repulsive influence <unk> limits to the ( immediate ) satisfaction of the tendency , <name> be understood as that which we have been in the practice of <unk> now as heat , now as magnetism , now as electricity ; displaying our ignorance of its awful character in the <unk> of the phraseology with which we endeavor to <unk> it .
calling it , merely for the moment , electricity , we know that all experimental analysis of electricity has given , as an ultimate result , the principle , or seeming principle , <unk> .
only where things differ is electricity apparent ; and it is <unk> that they never differ where it is not developed at least , if not apparent .
now , this result is in the fullest keeping with that which i have reached <unk> .
the design of the repulsive influence i have maintained to be that of preventing immediate unity among the diffused atoms ; and these atoms are represented as different each from each .
difference is their <unk> <unk> as <unk> was the <unk> of their source .
when we say , then , that an attempt to bring any two of these atoms together would induce an effort , on the part of the repulsive influence , to prevent the contact , we may as well use the strictly <unk> sentence that an attempt to bring together any two differences <name> result in a development of electricity .
all existing bodies , of course , are composed of these atoms in proximate contact , and are therefore to be considered as mere assemblages of more or fewer differences ; and the resistance made by the repulsive spirit , on bringing together any two such assemblages , would be in the ratio of the two sums of the differences in each : <unk> expression which , when reduced , is equivalent to this : <unk> amount of electricity developed on the approximation of two bodies , is proportional to the difference between the respective sums of the atoms of which the bodies are <unk> that no two bodies are absolutely alike , is a simple <unk> from all that has been here said .
electricity , therefore , existing always , is developed whenever any bodies , but manifested only when bodies of appreciable difference , are brought into approximation .
to <unk> , for the present , continuing to call <unk> may not be wrong in referring the various physical appearances of light , heat and magnetism ; but far less shall we be liable to err in attributing to this strictly spiritual principle the more important phænomena of vitality , consciousness and thought .
on this topic , however , i need pause here merely to suggest that these phænomena , whether observed generally or in detail , seem to proceed at least in the ratio of the heterogeneous .
<unk> now the two equivocal terms , <unk> and <unk> , ” let us adopt the more definite expressions , <unk> and <unk> the former is the body ; the latter the soul : the one is the material ; the other the spiritual , principle of the universe .
no other principles <unk> all phænomena are referable to one , or to the other , or to both combined .
so rigorously is this the <unk> thoroughly <unk> is it that attraction and repulsion are the sole properties through which we perceive the <unk> other words , by which matter is manifested to <unk> , for all merely <unk> purposes , we are fully justified in assuming that matter exists only as attraction and <unk> attraction and repulsion are matter : <unk> being no conceivable case in which we may not employ the term <unk> and the terms <unk> and <unk> , ” taken together , as equivalent , and therefore <unk> , expressions in logic .
i said , just now , that what i have described as the tendency of the diffused atoms to return into their original unity , would be understood as the principle of the newtonian law of gravity : and , in fact , there can be little difficulty in such an understanding , if we look at the newtonian gravity in a merely general view , as a force impelling matter to seek matter ; that is to say , when we pay no attention to the known modus <unk> of the newtonian force .
the general coincidence satisfies us ; but , upon looking closely , we see , in detail , much that appears <unk> , and much in regard to which no coincidence , at least , is established .
for example ; the newtonian gravity , when we think of it in certain moods , does not seem to be a tendency to <unk> at all , but rather a tendency of all bodies in all <unk> phrase apparently expressive of a tendency to diffusion .
here , then , is an <unk> .
again ; when we reflect on the mathematical law governing the newtonian tendency , we see clearly that no coincidence has been made good , in respect of the modus <unk> , at least , between gravitation as known to exist and that seemingly simple and direct tendency which i have assumed .
in fact , i have attained a point at which it <name> be advisable to strengthen my position by reversing my processes .
so far , we have gone on à priori , from an abstract consideration of simplicity , as that quality most likely to have characterized the original action of god .
let us now see whether the established facts of the newtonian gravitation may not afford us , à <unk> , some legitimate <unk> .
what does the newtonian law declare ? —that all bodies attract each other with forces proportional to their quantities of matter and inversely proportional to the squares of their distances .
purposely , i have here given , in the first place , the vulgar version of the law ; and i confess that in this , as in most other vulgar <unk> of great truths , we find little of a suggestive character .
let us now adopt a more philosophical phraseology : <unk> atom , of every body , attracts every other atom , both of its own and of every other body , with a force which varies inversely as the squares of the distances between the attracting and attracted <unk> , indeed , a flood of suggestion bursts upon the mind .
but let us see distinctly what it was that <name> <unk> to the grossly irrational definitions of proof prescribed by the metaphysical schools .
he was forced to content himself with showing how thoroughly the motions of an imaginary universe , composed of attracting and attracted atoms obedient to the law he announced , coincide with those of the actually existing universe so far as it comes under our observation .
this was the amount of his <unk> is to say , this was the amount of it , according to the conventional cant of the <unk> his successes added proof multiplied by <unk> proof as a sound intellect <unk> the demonstration of the law itself , persist the <unk> , had not been strengthened in any degree .
<unk> , physical proof , ” however , of attraction , here upon earth , in accordance with the newtonian theory , was , at length , much to the satisfaction of some intellectual <unk> , afforded .
this proof arose <unk> and incidentally ( as nearly all important truths have arisen ) out of an attempt to ascertain the mean density of the earth .
in the famous <unk> , <unk> and bailly experiments for this purpose , the attraction of the mass of a mountain was seen , felt , measured , and found to be mathematically consistent with the immortal theory of the british astronomer .
but in spite of this confirmation of that which needed <unk> spite of the so-called <unk> of the <unk> by the so-called <unk> and physical <unk> spite of the character of this <unk> ideas which even really philosophical men can not help <unk> of <unk> , especially , the ideas of it which ordinary men get and contentedly maintain , are seen to have been derived , for the most part , from a consideration of the principle as they find it <unk> in the planet upon which they stand .
now , to what does so partial a consideration <unk> what species of error does it give rise ?
on the earth we see and feel , only that gravity impels all bodies towards the centre of the earth .
no man in the common walks of life could be made to see or to feel anything <unk> be made to perceive that anything , anywhere , has a perpetual , <unk> tendency in any other direction than to the centre of the earth ; yet ( with an exception hereafter to be specified ) it is a fact that every earthly thing ( not to speak now of every heavenly thing ) has a tendency not only to the <unk> centre but in every conceivable direction besides .
now , although the philosophic can not be said to err with the vulgar in this matter , they nevertheless permit themselves to be influenced , without knowing it , by the sentiment of the vulgar idea .
<unk> the pagan fables are not believed , ” says <name> , in his very <unk> <unk> , ” <unk> we forget ourselves continually and make inferences from them as from existing <unk> i mean to assert that the merely sensitive perception of gravity as we experience it on earth , <unk> mankind into the fancy of <unk> or <unk> respecting <unk> been continually <unk> towards this fancy even the mightiest <unk> , although imperceptibly , leading them away from the real characteristics of the principle ; thus preventing them , up to this date , from ever getting a glimpse of that vital truth which lies in a diametrically opposite <unk> the <unk> essential <unk> , not of <unk> or <unk> of universality and diffusion .
this <unk> <unk> is unity as the source of the <unk> .
let me now repeat the definition of gravity : <unk> atom , of every body , attracts every other atom , both of its own and of every other body , with a force which varies inversely as the squares of the distances of the attracting and attracted atom .
here let the reader pause with me , for a moment , in contemplation of the <unk> the <unk> the altogether unimaginable complexity of relation involved in the fact that each atom attracts every other <unk> merely in this fact of the attraction , without reference to the law or mode in which the attraction is <unk> merely in the fact that each atom attracts every other atom at all , in a wilderness of atoms so numerous that those which go to the composition of a cannon-ball , exceed , probably , in mere point of number , all the stars which go to the constitution of the universe .
had we discovered , simply , that each atom tended to some one favorite <unk> some especially attractive <unk> should still have fallen upon a discovery which , in itself , would have sufficed to overwhelm the mind : —but what is it that we are actually called upon to comprehend ?
that each atom <unk> with the most delicate movements of every other atom , and with each and with all at the same time , and forever , and according to a determinate law of which the complexity , even considered by itself solely , is utterly beyond the grasp of the imagination of man .
if i propose to ascertain the influence of one <unk> in a <unk> upon its neighboring <unk> , i can not accomplish my purpose without first counting and weighing all the atoms in the universe and defining the precise positions of all at one particular moment .
if i venture to <unk> , by even the <unk> part of an inch , the microscopical speck of dust which lies now upon the point of my finger , what is the character of that act upon which i have <unk> ?
i have done a deed which shakes the moon in her path , which causes the sun to be no longer the sun , and which alters forever the <name> of the multitudinous myriads of stars that roll and glow in the majestic presence of their creator .
these <unk> such as <unk> <unk> rather than conclusions or even considerations of the intellect : <unk> , i repeat , such as these , are such as we can alone <name> profitably to entertain in any effort at grasping the great principle , attraction .
but now , <unk> such <unk> such a vision of the marvellous complexity of attraction fairly in his <unk> any person competent of thought on such topics as these , set himself to the task of imagining a principle for the phænomena <unk> condition from which they sprang .
does not so evident a brotherhood among the atoms point to a common parentage ?
does not a sympathy so <unk> , so ineradicable , and so thoroughly <unk> , suggest a common <unk> as its source ?
does not one extreme <unk> the reason to the other ?
does not the infinitude of division refer to the <unk> of individuality ?
does not the <unk> of the complex hint at the perfection of the simple ?
it is not that the atoms , as we see them , are divided or that they are complex in their <unk> that they are inconceivably divided and <unk> complex : <unk> is the <unk> of the conditions to which i now allude , rather than to the conditions themselves .
in a word , is it not because the atoms were , at some remote epoch of time , even more than <unk> it not because originally , and therefore normally , they were <unk> now , in all <unk> all <unk> all <unk> all modes of <unk> all relations and through all <unk> struggle back to this absolutely , this <unk> , this unconditionally one ?
some person may here demand : <unk> it is to the one that the atoms struggle <unk> we not find and define attraction <unk> merely general tendency to a centre ? <unk> , in especial , do not your <unk> atoms which you describe as having been <unk> from a <unk> at once , <unk> , back to the central point of their origin ? ” i reply that they do ; as <name> be distinctly shown ; but that the cause of their so doing is quite <unk> of the centre as such .
they all tend <unk> towards a centre , because of the <unk> with which they have been <unk> into space .
each atom , forming one of a generally uniform globe of atoms , finds more atoms in the direction of the centre , of course , than in any other , and in that direction , therefore , is <unk> is not thus impelled because the centre is the point of its origin .
it is not to any point that the atoms are allied .
it is not any locality , either in the concrete or in the abstract , to which i suppose them bound .
nothing like location was conceived as their origin .
their source lies in the principle , unity .
this is their lost parent .
this they seek <unk> all <unk> it is even partially to be found ; thus <unk> , in some measure , the ineradicable tendency , while on the way to its absolute satisfaction in the end .
it follows from all this , that any principle which shall be adequate to account for the law , or modus <unk> , of the attractive force in general , <name> account for this law in particular : —that is to say , any principle which <name> show why the atoms should tend to their general centre of irradiation with forces inversely proportional to the squares of the distances , <name> be admitted as satisfactorily accounting , at the same time , for the tendency , according to the same law , of these atoms each to each : <unk> the tendency to the centre is merely the tendency each to each , and not any tendency to a centre as <unk> it <name> be seen , also , that the establishment of my propositions would involve no necessity of modification in the terms of the newtonian definition of gravity , which declares that each atom attracts each other atom and so forth , and declares this merely ; but ( always under the supposition that what i propose be , in the end , admitted ) it seems clear that some error might occasionally be avoided , in the future processes of science , were a more ample phraseology adopted : <unk> instance : <unk> atom tends to every other atom & c. with a force & c. : the general result being a tendency of all , with a similar force , to a general <unk> the reversal of our processes has thus brought us to an identical result ; but , while in the one process intuition was the <unk> , in the other it was the goal .
in commencing the former journey i could only say that , with an irresistible intuition , i felt simplicity to have been the characteristic of the original action of god : —in ending the latter i can only declare that , with an irresistible intuition , i perceive unity to have been the source of the observed phænomena of the newtonian gravitation .
thus , according to the schools , i prove nothing .
so be it : <unk> design but to <unk> to convince through the suggestion .
i am proudly aware that there exist many of the most profound and cautiously <unk> human intellects which can not help being abundantly content with <unk> .
to these <unk> to my <unk> is no mathematical demonstration which could bring the least additional true proof of the great truth which i have <unk> truth of original unity as the <unk> the principle of the universal phænomena .
for my part , i am not so sure that i speak and <unk> am not so sure that my heart beats and that my soul lives : <unk> the rising of <unk> <unk> probability that as yet lies in the <unk> do not pretend to be one thousandth part as <unk> i am of the irretrievably <unk> fact that all things and all thoughts of things , with all their ineffable multiplicity of relation , sprang at once into being from the primordial and <unk> one .
referring to the newtonian gravity , dr. <name> , the eloquent author of “the architecture of the heavens , ” says : <unk> truth we have no reason to suppose this great law , as now revealed , to be the ultimate or simplest , and therefore the universal and <unk> , form of a great ordinance .
the mode in which its intensity diminishes with the element of distance , has not the aspect of an ultimate principle ; which always assumes the simplicity and <unk> of those axioms which constitute the basis of <unk> now , it is quite true that <unk> principles , ” in the common understanding of the words , always assume the simplicity of geometrical <unk> ( as for <unk> , ” there is no such thing ) —but these principles are clearly not <unk> ; ” in other terms what we are in the habit of calling principles are no principles , properly <unk> there can be but one principle , the volition of god .
we have no right to assume , then , from what we observe in rules that we choose foolishly to name <unk> , ” anything at all in respect to the characteristics of a principle proper .
the <unk> <unk> of which dr. <name> speaks as having geometrical simplicity , may and do have this geometrical turn , as being part and parcel of a vast geometrical system , and thus a system of simplicity <unk> which , nevertheless , the truly ultimate principle is , as we know , the consummation of the <unk> is to say , of the <unk> is it not the spiritual capacity of god ?
i quoted dr. <unk> remark , however , not so much to question its philosophy , as by way of calling attention to the fact that , while all men have admitted some principle as existing behind the law of gravity , no attempt has been yet made to point out what this principle in particular is : <unk> we except , perhaps , occasional fantastic efforts at referring it to magnetism , or mesmerism , or <unk> , or <unk> , or some other equally delicious <unk> of the same species , and invariably patronized by one and the same species of people .
the great mind of <name> , while boldly grasping the law itself , shrank from the principle of the law .
the more fluent and comprehensive at least , if not the more patient and profound , sagacity of laplace , had not the courage to attack it .
but hesitation on the part of these two astronomers it is , perhaps , not so very difficult to understand .
they , as well as all the first class of mathematicians , were mathematicians solely : <unk> intellect , at least , had a <unk> <unk> tone .
what lay not distinctly within the domain of physics , or of mathematics , seemed to them either <unk> or shadow .
nevertheless , we may well wonder that <unk> , who was a marked exception to the general rule in these respects , and whose mental temperament was a singular <unk> of the mathematical with the <unk> , did not at once investigate and establish the point at issue .
either <name> or laplace , seeking a principle and discovering none physical , would have rested contentedly in the conclusion that there was absolutely none ; but it is almost impossible to fancy , of <unk> , that , having exhausted in his search the physical dominions , he would not have stepped at once , boldly and hopefully , amid his old familiar haunts in the kingdom of metaphysics .
here , indeed , it is clear that he must have <unk> in search of the treasure : —that he did not find it after all , was , perhaps , because his <name> guide , imagination , was not sufficiently <unk> , or well-educated , to direct him aright .
i observed , just now , that , in fact , there had been certain vague attempts at referring gravity to some very uncertain <unk> .
these attempts , however , although considered bold and justly so considered , looked no farther than to the <unk> merest <unk> the newtonian law .
its modus <unk> has never , to my knowledge , been approached in the way of an effort at explanation .
it is , therefore , with no unwarranted fear of being taken for a madman at the outset , and before i can bring my propositions fairly to the eye of those who alone are competent to decide upon them , that i here declare the modus <unk> of the law of gravity to be an exceedingly simple and perfectly explicable <unk> is to say , when we make our advances towards it in just gradations and in the true <unk> we regard it from the proper point of view .
whether we reach the idea of absolute unity as the source of all things , from a consideration of simplicity as the most probable characteristic of the original action of god ; <unk> we arrive at it from an inspection of the universality of relation in the <unk> phænomena ; <unk> whether we attain it as a result of the mutual <unk> afforded by both processes ; <unk> , the idea itself , if entertained at all , is entertained in inseparable connection with another <unk> of the condition of the universe of stars as we now perceive <unk> is to say , a condition of immeasurable diffusion through space .
now a connection between these two <unk> and <unk> can not be established unless through the entertainment of a third <unk> of irradiation .
absolute unity being taken as a centre , then the existing universe of stars is the result of irradiation from that centre .
now , the laws of irradiation are known .
they are part and parcel of the sphere .
they belong to the class of indisputable geometrical properties .
we say of them , “they are <unk> are <unk> to demand why they are true , would be to demand why the axioms are true upon which their demonstration is based .
nothing is <unk> , strictly speaking ; but if anything be , then the <unk> laws in question are demonstrated .
but these <unk> do they declare ?
<unk> what steps does it proceed outwardly from a centre ?
from a luminous centre , light issues by irradiation ; and the quantities of light received upon any given plane , supposed to be shifting its position so as to be now nearer the centre and now farther from it , <name> be diminished in the same proportion as the squares of the distances of the plane from the luminous body , are increased ; and <name> be increased in the same proportion as these squares are diminished .
the expression of the law may be thus <unk> : —the number of <unk> ( or , if the phrase be preferred , the number of <unk> ) received upon the shifting plane , <name> be inversely proportional with the squares of the distances of the plane .
<unk> yet again , we may say that the <unk> <unk> irradiation , in a <unk> directly proportional with the squares of the distances .
[ illustration ] for example : at the distance b , from the luminous centre a , a certain number of particles are so diffused as to occupy the surface b .
then at double the <unk> is to say at <unk> <name> be so much farther diffused as to occupy four such surfaces : <unk> treble the distance , or at d , they <name> be so much farther separated as to occupy nine such surfaces : <unk> , at quadruple the distance , or at e , they <name> have become so scattered as to spread themselves over sixteen such <unk> so on forever .
in saying , generally , that the irradiation proceeds in direct proportion with the squares of the distances , we use the term irradiation to express the degree of the diffusion as we proceed outwardly from the centre .
conversing the idea , and employing the word <unk> to express the degree of the drawing together as we come back toward the centre from an outward position , we may say that <unk> proceeds inversely as the squares of the distances .
in other words , we have reached the conclusion that , on the hypothesis that matter was originally <unk> from a centre and is now returning to it , the <unk> , in the return , proceeds exactly as we know the force of gravitation to proceed .
now here , if we could be permitted to assume that <unk> exactly represented the force of the tendency to the <unk> the one was exactly proportional to the other , and that the two proceeded <unk> should have shown all that is required .
the sole difficulty existing , then , is to establish a direct proportion between <unk> and the force of <unk> ; and this is done , of course , if we establish such proportion between <unk> and the force of irradiation .
a very slight inspection of the heavens assures us that the stars have a certain general uniformity , equability , or <unk> , of distribution through that region of space in which , collectively , and in a roughly globular form , they are situated : <unk> species of very general , rather than absolute , equability , being in full keeping with my deduction of <unk> , within certain limits , among the originally diffused atoms , as a <unk> from the evident design of infinite complexity of relation out of <unk> .
i started , it <name> be remembered , with the idea of a generally uniform but particularly <unk> distribution of the atoms ; <unk> idea , i repeat , which an inspection of the stars , as they exist , confirms .
but even in the merely general equability of distribution , as regards the atoms , there appears a difficulty which , no doubt , has already suggested itself to those among my readers who have borne in mind that i suppose this equability of distribution effected through irradiation from a centre .
the very first glance at the idea , irradiation , forces us to the entertainment of the hitherto <unk> and seemingly inseparable idea of <unk> about a centre , with dispersion as we recede from <unk> idea , in a word , of <unk> of distribution in respect to the matter <unk> .
now , i have elsewhere [ 1 ] observed that it is by just such difficulties as the one now in <unk> <unk> <unk> protuberances above the plane of the <unk> reason feels her way , if at all , in her search for the true .
by the <unk> <unk> presented , i leap at once to the <unk> secret which i might never have attained but for the peculiarity and the inferences which , in its mere character of peculiarity , it affords me .
[ 1 ] <unk> in the rue <unk> .
133 .
the process of thought , at this point , may be thus roughly sketched : <unk> say to <unk> , as i have explained it , is a <unk> feel it .
diffusion is a <unk> see it .
irradiation , by which alone these two truths are reconciled , is a consequent <unk> perceive it .
equability of diffusion , first deduced à priori and then corroborated by the inspection of phænomena , is also a <unk> fully admit it .
so far all is clear around me : <unk> are no clouds behind which the <unk> great secret of the <unk> modus <unk> possibly lie hidden ; —but this secret lies hereabouts , most assuredly ; and were there but a cloud in view , i should be driven to suspicion of that <unk> and now , just as i say this , there actually comes a cloud into view .
this cloud is the seeming impossibility of <unk> my truth , irradiation , with my truth , equability of diffusion .
i say now : <unk> this seeming impossibility is to be found what i <unk> i do not say <unk> impossibility ; ” for invincible <name> in my truths assures me that it is a mere difficulty after <unk> i go on to say , with unflinching confidence , that , when this difficulty shall be solved , we shall find , wrapped up in the process of solution , the key to the secret at which we aim .
<unk> feel that we shall discover but one possible solution of the difficulty ; this for the reason that , were there two , one would be <unk> be <unk> be <unk> contain no <unk> no duplicate key can be needed to any secret of nature .
and now , let us see : <unk> usual notions of <unk> fact all our distinct notions of <unk> caught merely from the process as we see it exemplified in light .
here there is a continuous <unk> of <unk> , and with a force which we have at least no right to suppose varies at all .
now , in any such irradiation as <unk> and of unvarying <unk> regions nearer the centre must inevitably be always more crowded with the <unk> matter than the regions more remote .
but i have assumed no such irradiation as this .
i assumed no continuous irradiation ; and for the simple reason that such an assumption would have involved , first , the necessity of entertaining a <name> which i have shown no man can entertain , and which ( as i <name> more fully explain hereafter ) all observation of the firmament <unk> <name> of the absolute infinity of the universe of <unk> would have involved , secondly , the impossibility of understanding a <unk> is , <unk> existing <unk> , while an act is continued , no rëaction , of course , can take place .
my assumption , then , or rather my inevitable deduction from just <unk> that of a determinate <unk> finally <unk> .
let me now describe the sole possible mode in which it is conceivable that matter could have been diffused through space , so as to fulfil the conditions at once of irradiation and of generally equable distribution .
for convenience of illustration , let us imagine , in the first place , a hollow sphere of glass , or of anything else , occupying the space throughout which the universal matter is to be thus equally diffused , by means of irradiation , from the absolute , <unk> , <unk> particle , placed in the centre of the sphere .
now , a certain exertion of the <unk> power ( presumed to be the divine volition ) —in other words , a certain <unk> measure is the quantity of <unk> is to say , the number of <unk> ; emits , by irradiation , this certain number of atoms ; forcing them in all directions outwardly from the <unk> proximity to each other diminishing as they <unk> , finally , they are distributed , loosely , over the interior surface of the sphere .
when these atoms have attained this position , or while proceeding to attain it , a second and inferior exercise of the same <unk> a second and inferior force of the same <unk> , in the same <unk> is to say , by irradiation as <unk> second stratum of atoms which proceeds to deposit itself upon the first ; the number of atoms , in this case as in the former , being of course the measure of the force which emitted them ; in other words the force being precisely adapted to the purpose it <unk> force and the number of atoms sent out by the force , being directly proportional .
when this second stratum has reached its destined <unk> while approaching <unk> third still inferior exertion of the force , or a third inferior force of a similar <unk> number of atoms emitted being in all cases the measure of the <unk> to deposit a third stratum upon the second : —and so on , until these concentric strata , growing gradually less and less , come down at length to the central point ; and the <unk> matter , simultaneously with the <unk> force , is exhausted .
we have now the sphere filled , through means of irradiation , with atoms <unk> diffused .
the two necessary <unk> of irradiation and of equable <unk> satisfied ; and by the sole process in which the possibility of their simultaneous satisfaction is conceivable .
for this reason , i confidently expect to find , lurking in the present condition of the atoms as distributed throughout the sphere , the secret of which i am in <unk> all-important principle of the modus <unk> of the newtonian law .
let us examine , then , the actual condition of the atoms .
they lie in a series of concentric strata .
they are <unk> diffused throughout the sphere .
they have been <unk> into these states .
the atoms being <unk> distributed , the greater the superficial extent of any of these concentric strata , or spheres , the more atoms <name> lie upon it .
in other words , the number of atoms lying upon the surface of any one of the concentric spheres , is directly proportional with the extent of that surface .
but , in any series of concentric spheres , the surfaces are directly proportional with the squares of the distances from the <unk> [ 2 ] [ 2 ] <unk> surfaces of spheres are as the squares of their radii .
therefore the number of atoms in any stratum is directly proportional with the square of that <unk> distance from the centre .
but the number of atoms in any stratum is the measure of the force which emitted that <unk> is to say , is directly proportional with the force .
therefore the force which <unk> any stratum is directly proportional with the square of that <unk> distance from the centre : <unk> , generally , the force of the irradiation has been directly proportional with the squares of the <unk> now , rëaction , as far as we know anything of it , is action conversed .
the general principle of gravity being , in the first place , understood as the rëaction of an <unk> the expression of a <name> on the part of matter , while existing in a state of diffusion , to return into the unity whence it was diffused ; and , in the second place , the mind being called upon to determine the character of the <unk> manner in which it would , naturally , be manifested ; in other words , being called upon to conceive a probable law , or modus <unk> , for the return ; could not well help arriving at the conclusion that this law of return would be precisely the converse of the law of departure .
that such would be the case , any one , at least , would be abundantly justified in taking for granted , until such time as some person should suggest something like a plausible reason why it should not be the <unk> such period as a law of return shall be imagined which the intellect can consider as preferable .
matter , then , <unk> into space with a force varying as the squares of the distances , might , à priori , be supposed to return towards its centre of irradiation with a force varying inversely as the squares of the distances : and i have already shown [ 3 ] that any principle which <name> explain why the atoms should tend , according to any law , to the general centre , must be admitted as satisfactorily explaining , at the same time , why , according to the same law , they should tend each to each .
for , in fact , the tendency to the general centre is not to a centre as such , but because of its being a point in tending towards which each atom tends most directly to its real and essential centre , <unk> absolute and final union of all .
[ 3 ] <name> 44 .
the consideration here involved presents to my own mind no embarrassment <unk> this fact does not blind me to the possibility of its being obscure to those who may have been less in the habit of dealing with <unk> : —and , upon the whole , it may be as well to look at the matter from one or two other points of view .
the absolute , <unk> particle primarily created by the volition of god , must have been in a condition of positive <unk> , or <unk> <unk> implies relation .
right is positive ; wrong is <unk> merely the negation of right ; as cold is the negation of <unk> of light .
that a thing may be wrong , it is necessary that there be some other thing in relation to which it is <unk> condition which it fails to satisfy ; some law which it <unk> ; some being whom it <unk> .
if there be no such being , law , or condition , in respect to which the thing is <unk> , still more especially , if no beings , laws , or conditions exist at <unk> the thing <unk> be wrong and consequently must be right .
any deviation from <unk> involves a tendency to return into it .
a difference from the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> be understood as effected only by the overcoming a difficulty ; and if the force which <unk> the difficulty be not infinitely continued , the ineradicable tendency to return <name> at length be permitted to act for its own satisfaction .
upon withdrawal of the force , the tendency acts .
this is the principle of rëaction as the inevitable consequence of finite action .
employing a phraseology of which the seeming affectation <name> be pardoned for its <unk> , we may say that rëaction is the return from the condition of as it is and ought not to be into the condition of as it was , originally , and therefore ought to be : —and let me add here that the absolute force of rëaction would no doubt be always found in direct proportion with the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> ever it were possible to measure this latter : —and , consequently , the greatest of all conceivable reactions must be that produced by the tendency which we now <unk> tendency to return into the absolutely <unk> the supremely primitive .
gravity , then , must be the strongest of <unk> idea reached à priori and abundantly confirmed by induction .
what use i make of the idea , <name> be seen in the sequel .
the atoms , now , having been diffused from their normal condition of unity , seek to return <unk> ?
not to any particular point , certainly ; for it is clear that if , upon the diffusion , the whole universe of matter had been projected , collectively , to a distance from the point of irradiation , the atomic tendency to the general centre of the sphere would not have been disturbed in the least : —the atoms would not have sought the point in absolute space from which they were originally impelled .
it is merely the condition , and not the point or locality at which this condition took its rise , that these atoms seek to <unk> ; <unk> is merely that condition which is their <unk> , that they <name> .
“but they seek a centre , ” it <name> be said , “and a centre is a <unk> true ; but they seek this point not in its character of <unk> ( for , were the whole sphere moved from its position , they would seek , equally , the centre ; and the centre then would be a new point ) —but because it so happens , on account of the form in which they collectively <unk> ( that of the sphere ) —that only through the point in <unk> <unk> <unk> can attain their true object , unity .
in the direction of the centre each atom perceives more atoms than in any other direction .
each atom is impelled towards the centre because along the straight line joining it and the centre and passing on to the circumference beyond , there lie a greater number of atoms than along any other straight <unk> greater number of objects that seek it , the individual <unk> greater number of tendencies to <unk> greater number of <unk> for its own tendency to <unk> a word , because in the direction of the centre lies the utmost possibility of satisfaction , generally , for its own individual appetite .
to be brief , the condition , unity , is all that is really sought ; and if the atoms seem to seek the centre of the sphere , it is only <unk> , through <unk> such centre happens to imply , to include , or to involve , the only essential centre , unity .
but on account of this implication or <unk> , there is no possibility of practically separating the tendency to unity in the abstract , from the tendency to the concrete centre .
thus the tendency of the atoms to the general centre is , to all practical intents and for all logical purposes , the tendency each to each ; and the tendency each to each is the tendency to the centre ; and the one tendency may be assumed as the other ; whatever <name> apply to the one must be thoroughly applicable to the other ; and , in conclusion , whatever principle <name> satisfactorily explain the one , can not be questioned as an explanation of the other .
in looking carefully around me for rational objection to what i have advanced , i am able to discover nothing ; —but of that class of objections usually urged by the <unk> for <unk> sake , i very readily perceive three ; and proceed to dispose of them in order .
it may be said , first : “the proof that the force of irradiation ( in the case described ) is directly proportional to the squares of the distances , depends upon an unwarranted <unk> of the number of atoms in each stratum being the measure of the force with which they are <unk> i reply , not only that i am warranted in such assumption , but that i should be utterly <unk> in any other .
what i assume is , simply , that an effect is the measure of its <unk> every exercise of the divine <name> <name> be proportional to that which demands the <unk> the means of <unk> , or of <unk> , <name> be exactly adapted to its purposes .
neither can a deficiency nor an excess of cause bring to pass any effect .
had the force which <unk> any stratum to its position , been either more or less than was needed for the <unk> is to say , not directly proportional to the <unk> to its position that stratum could not have been <unk> .
had the force which , with a view to general equability of distribution , emitted the proper number of atoms for each stratum , been not directly proportional to the number , then the number would not have been the number demanded for the equable distribution .
the second <unk> objection is somewhat better entitled to an answer .
it is an admitted principle in <unk> that every body , on receiving an impulse , or disposition to move , <name> move onward in a straight line , in the direction imparted by the impelling force , until deflected , or stopped , by some other force .
how then , it may be asked , is my first or external stratum of atoms to be understood as <unk> their movement at the circumference of the imaginary glass sphere , when no second force , of more than an imaginary character , appears , to account for the <unk> ?
i reply that the objection , in this case , actually does arise out of <unk> unwarranted <unk> the part of the <unk> assumption of a principle , in <unk> , at an epoch when no <unk> , ” in anything , exist : <unk> use the word <unk> , ” of course , in the <unk> understanding of the word .
“in the <unk> we can <unk> we can <unk> one first <unk> truly ultimate <unk> volition of god .
the primary <unk> of irradiation from <unk> have been independent of all that which the world now calls <unk> all that we so designate is but a consequence of the rëaction of that primary act : <unk> say <unk> act ; for the creation of the absolute material particle is more properly to be regarded as a <name> than as an <unk> in the ordinary meaning of the term .
thus , we must regard the primary act as an act for the establishment of what we now call <unk> but this primary act itself is to be considered as continuous volition .
the thought of god is to be understood as originating the <unk> proceeding with <unk> regulating <unk> , finally , as being withdrawn from it upon its completion .
then commences rëaction , and through rëaction , <unk> , ” as we employ the word .
it <name> be advisable , however , to limit the application of this word to the two immediate results of the <unk> of the divine <unk> is , to the two agents , attraction and repulsion .
every other natural agent depends , either more or less immediately , upon these two , and therefore would be more conveniently designated as <unk> .
it may be objected , thirdly , that , in general , the peculiar mode of distribution which i have suggested for the atoms , is <unk> hypothesis and nothing <unk> now , i am aware that the word hypothesis is a ponderous <unk> , grasped immediately , if not lifted , by all very diminutive thinkers , upon the first appearance of any proposition wearing , in any particular , the garb of a theory .
but <unk> can not be wielded here to any good purpose , even by those who succeed in lifting <unk> men or great .
i maintain , first , that only in the mode described is it conceivable that matter could have been diffused so as to fulfil at once the conditions of irradiation and of generally equable distribution .
i maintain , secondly , that these conditions themselves have been imposed upon me , as necessities , in a train of <unk> as rigorously logical as that which establishes any demonstration in euclid ; and i maintain , thirdly , that even if the charge of <unk> were as fully sustained as it is , in fact , <unk> and untenable , still the validity and <unk> of my result would not , even in the slightest particular , be disturbed .
to explain : —the newtonian <unk> law of <unk> law whose existence as such no one out of bedlam <unk> law whose admission as such enables us to account for nine-tenths of the universal <unk> law which , merely because it does so enable us to account for these phænomena , we are perfectly willing , without reference to any other considerations , to admit , and can not help admitting , as a <unk> law , nevertheless , of which neither the principle nor the modus <unk> of the principle , has ever yet been traced by the human <unk> law , in short , which , neither in its detail nor in its generality , has been found susceptible of explanation at <unk> at length seen to be at every point thoroughly explicable , provided only we yield our assent <unk> ?
to an hypothesis ?
why if an <unk> the merest <unk> an hypothesis for whose <unk> in the case of that pure hypothesis the newtonian law <unk> shadow of à priori reason could be <unk> an hypothesis , even so absolute as all this implies , would enable us to perceive a principle for the newtonian <unk> enable us to understand as satisfied , conditions so <unk> <unk> complex and seemingly <unk> as those involved in the relations of which gravity tells us , <unk> rational being could so expose his <unk> as to call even this absolute hypothesis an hypothesis any <unk> , indeed , he were to persist in so calling it , with the understanding that he did so , simply for the sake of consistency in words ?
but what is the true state of our present case ?
what is the fact ?
not only that it is not an hypothesis which we are required to adopt , in order to admit the principle at issue explained , but that it is a logical conclusion which we are requested not to adopt if we can avoid <unk> we are simply invited to deny if we can : <unk> conclusion of so accurate a <unk> that to dispute it would be the <unk> doubt its validity beyond our power : <unk> conclusion from which we see no mode of escape , turn as we <name> ; a result which <unk> us either at the end of an <unk> journey from the phænomena of the very law discussed , or at the close of a <unk> career from the most rigorously simple of all conceivable <unk> assumption , in a word , of simplicity itself .
and if here , for the mere sake of <unk> , it be urged , that although my <unk> is , as i assert , the assumption of absolute simplicity , yet simplicity , considered merely in itself , is no axiom ; and that only deductions from axioms are <unk> is thus that i reply : — every other science than logic is the science of certain concrete relations .
arithmetic , for example , is the science of the relations of <unk> , of the relations of <unk> in general , of the relations of quantity in <unk> whatever can be increased or diminished .
logic , however , is the science of relation in the <unk> absolute <unk> relation considered solely in itself .
an axiom in any particular science other than logic is , thus , merely a proposition announcing certain concrete relations which seem to be too obvious for <unk> when we say , for instance , that the whole is greater than its part : —and , thus again , the principle of the logical <unk> other words , of an axiom in the <unk> , simply , <unk> of relation .
now , it is clear , not only that what is obvious to one mind may not be obvious to another , but that what is obvious to one mind at one epoch , may be anything but obvious , at another epoch , to the same mind .
it is clear , moreover , that what , to-day , is obvious even to the majority of mankind , or to the majority of the best intellects of mankind , may to-morrow be , to either majority , more or less obvious , or in no respect obvious at all .
it is seen , then , that the <unk> principle itself is susceptible of variation , and of course that axioms are susceptible of similar change .
being <unk> , the <unk> which grow out of them are necessarily <unk> too ; or , in other words , are never to be positively depended upon as truths at <unk> truth and immutability are one .
it <name> now be readily understood that no <unk> <unk> idea founded in the fluctuating principle , <unk> of <unk> possibly be so <unk> reliable a basis for any structure erected by the reason , as that <unk> ( whatever it is , wherever we can find it , or if it be practicable to find it anywhere ) <unk> is <unk> <unk> not only presents to the understanding no <unk> of relation , either greater or less , to be considered , but subjects the intellect , not in the <unk> degree , to the necessity of even looking at any relation at all .
if such an idea be not what we too heedlessly term <unk> axiom , ” it is at least preferable , as a logical basis , to any axiom ever propounded , or to all imaginable axioms combined : —and such , precisely , is the idea with which my <unk> process , so thoroughly corroborated by induction , commences .
my particle proper is but absolute <unk> .
to sum up what has been here advanced : <unk> a starting point i have taken it for granted , simply , that the beginning had nothing behind it or before <unk> it was a beginning in <unk> it was a beginning and nothing different from a <unk> short that this beginning <unk> which it was .
if this be a <unk> <unk> then a <unk> <unk> let it be .
to conclude this branch of the subject : <unk> am fully warranted in announcing that the law which we have been in the habit of calling gravity exists on account of <unk> having been <unk> , at its origin , <unk> , into a limited [ 4 ] sphere of space , from one , individual , <unk> , <unk> , and absolute particle proper , by the sole process in which it was possible to satisfy , at the same time , the two conditions , irradiation , and <unk> distribution throughout the <unk> is to say , by a force varying in direct proportion with the squares of the distances between the <unk> atoms , respectively , and the particular centre of irradiation .
[ 4 ] limited <unk> sphere is necessarily limited .
i prefer <unk> to a chance of <unk> .
i have already given my reasons for presuming matter to have been diffused by a determinate rather than by a continuous or infinitely continued force .
supposing a continuous force , we should be unable , in the first place , to comprehend a rëaction at all ; and we should be required , in the second place , to entertain the impossible <name> of an infinite extension of matter .
not to dwell upon the impossibility of the <name> , the infinite extension of matter is an idea which , if not positively <unk> , is at least not in any respect warranted by <unk> observation of the <unk> point to be explained more fully hereafter ; and this <unk> reason for believing in the original <unk> of matter is <unk> confirmed .
for example : <unk> , for the moment , the possibility of understanding space filled with the <unk> <unk> is to say , admitting , as well as we can , for <unk> sake , that the succession of the <unk> atoms had absolutely no <unk> it is abundantly clear that , even when the volition of god had been withdrawn from them , and thus the tendency to return into unity permitted ( <unk> ) to be satisfied , this permission would have been <unk> and <unk> valueless and of no effect whatever .
no rëaction could have taken place ; no movement toward unity could have been made ; no law of gravity could have obtained .
to explain : <unk> the abstract tendency of any one atom to any one other as the inevitable result of diffusion from the normal unity : <unk> , what is the same thing , admit any given atom as proposing to move in any given <unk> is clear that , since there is an infinity of atoms on all sides of the atom proposing to move , it never can actually move toward the satisfaction of its tendency in the direction given , on account of a precisely equal and <unk> tendency in the direction diametrically opposite .
in other words , exactly as many tendencies to unity are behind the hesitating atom as before it ; for it is a mere <unk> to say that one infinite line is longer or shorter than another infinite line , or that one infinite number is greater or less than another number that is infinite .
thus the atom in question must remain stationary forever .
under the impossible circumstances which we have been merely endeavoring to conceive for <unk> sake , there could have been no aggregation of <unk> <unk> <unk> but a perpetually atomic and inconsequential universe .
in fact , view it as we <name> , the whole idea of unlimited matter is not only untenable , but impossible and preposterous .
with the understanding of a sphere of atoms , however , we perceive , at once , a <unk> tendency to union .
the general result of the tendency each to each , being a tendency of all to the centre , the general process of condensation , or approximation , commences immediately , by a common and simultaneous movement , on withdrawal of the divine volition ; the individual <unk> , or <unk> <unk> atom with atom , being subject to almost infinite variations of time , degree , and condition , on account of the excessive multiplicity of relation , arising from the differences of form assumed as <unk> the atoms at the moment of their quitting the particle proper ; as well as from the subsequent particular <unk> , each from each .
what i wish to impress upon the reader is the certainty of there arising , at once , ( on withdrawal of the <unk> force , or divine volition , ) out of the condition of the atoms as described , at innumerable points throughout the universal sphere , innumerable <unk> , characterized by innumerable specific differences of form , size , essential nature , and distance each from each .
the development of repulsion ( electricity ) must have commenced , of course , with the very earliest particular efforts at unity , and must have proceeded constantly in the ratio of <unk> is to say , in that of condensation , or , again , of <unk> .
thus the two principles proper , attraction and <unk> material and the <unk> each other , in the strictest fellowship , forever .
thus the body and the soul walk hand in hand .
if now , in fancy , we select any one of the <unk> considered as in their primary stages throughout the universal sphere , and suppose this incipient <unk> to be taking place at that point where the centre of our sun <unk> rather where it did exist originally ; for the sun is perpetually shifting his <unk> shall find ourselves met , and borne onward for a time at least , by the most magnificent of <unk> the nebular <unk> of laplace : <unk> <unk> is far too comprehensive a term for what he really <unk> is the constitution of our solar system <unk> one among the myriad of similar systems which make up the universe <unk> universal <unk> <unk> and absolute <unk> which forms the subject of my present discourse .
confining himself to an obviously limited <unk> of our solar system with its comparatively immediate <unk> merely <unk> is to say , assuming without any basis whatever , either <unk> or <unk> of what i have been just endeavoring to place upon a more stable basis than assumption ; assuming , for example , matter as diffused ( without pretending to account for the diffusion ) throughout , and somewhat beyond , the space occupied by our <unk> in a state of heterogeneous <unk> and obedient to that <unk> law of gravity at whose principle he ventured to make no guess ; <unk> all this ( which is quite true , although he had no logical right to its assumption ) laplace has shown , <unk> and mathematically , that the results in such case necessarily ensuing , are those and those alone which we find manifested in the actually existing condition of the system itself .
to explain : <unk> us conceive that particular <unk> of which we have just <unk> one at the point designated by our <unk> <unk> have so far proceeded that a vast quantity of nebulous matter has here assumed a roughly globular form ; its centre being , of course , coincident with what is now , or rather was originally , the centre of our sun ; and its <unk> extending out beyond the orbit of neptune , the most remote of our planets : —in other words , let us suppose the diameter of this rough sphere to be some <unk> millions of miles .
for ages , this mass of matter has been undergoing condensation , until at length it has become reduced into the bulk we imagine ; having proceeded gradually , of course , from its atomic and imperceptible state , into what we understand of visible , palpable , or otherwise appreciable <unk> .
now , the condition of this mass implies a rotation about an imaginary <unk> rotation which , commencing with the absolute <unk> of the aggregation , has been ever since acquiring velocity .
the very first two atoms which met , approaching each other from points not diametrically opposite , would , in rushing partially past each other , form a nucleus for the <unk> movement described .
how this would increase in velocity , is readily seen .
the two atoms are joined by others : <unk> aggregation is formed .
the mass continues to <unk> while condensing .
but any atom at the circumference has , of course , a more rapid motion than one nearer the centre .
the outer atom , however , with its superior velocity , approaches the centre ; carrying this superior velocity with it as it goes .
thus every atom , proceeding inwardly , and finally attaching itself to the condensed centre , adds something to the original velocity of that <unk> is to say , increases the <unk> movement of the mass .
let us now suppose this mass so far condensed that it occupies precisely the space circumscribed by the orbit of neptune , and that the velocity with which the surface of the mass moves , in the general rotation , is precisely that velocity with which neptune now revolves about the sun .
at this epoch , then , we are to understand that the constantly increasing centrifugal force , having gotten the better of the <unk> centripetal , loosened and separated the exterior and least condensed stratum , or a few of the exterior and least condensed strata , at the equator of the sphere , where the <unk> velocity <unk> ; so that these strata formed about the main body an independent ring encircling the equatorial regions : <unk> as the exterior portion thrown off , by excessive velocity of rotation , from a grindstone , would form a ring about the grindstone , but for the solidity of the superficial material : were this <unk> , or anything similar in consistency , precisely the <unk> i describe would be presented .
the ring thus whirled from the nebulous mass , revolved , of course , as a separate ring , with just that velocity with which , while the surface of the mass , it <unk> .
in the meantime , condensation still proceeding , the interval between the discharged ring and the main body continued to increase , until the former was left at a vast distance from the latter .
now , admitting the ring to have possessed , by some seemingly accidental arrangement of its heterogeneous materials , a constitution nearly uniform , then this ring , as such , would never have ceased revolving about its primary ; but , as might have been anticipated , there appears to have been enough irregularity in the disposition of the materials , to make them cluster about centres of superior solidity ; and thus the annular form was destroyed .
[ 5 ] no doubt , the band was soon broken up into several portions , and one of these portions , <unk> in mass , absorbed the others into itself ; the whole settling , <unk> , into a planet .
that this latter , as a planet , continued the revolutionary movement which characterized it while a ring , is sufficiently clear ; and that it took upon itself also , an additional movement in its new condition of sphere , is readily explained .
the ring being understood as yet unbroken , we see that its exterior , while the whole revolves about the parent body , moves more rapidly than its interior .
when the rupture occurred , then , some portion in each fragment must have been moving with greater velocity than the others .
the superior movement prevailing , must have whirled each fragment <unk> is to say , have caused it to <unk> ; and the direction of the rotation must , of course , have been the direction of the revolution whence it arose .
all the fragments having become subject to the rotation described , must , in <unk> , have imparted it to the one planet constituted by their <unk> planet was neptune .
its material continuing to undergo condensation , and the centrifugal force generated in its rotation getting , at length , the better of the centripetal , as before in the case of the parent orb , a ring was whirled also from the equatorial surface of this planet : this ring , having been <unk> in its constitution , was broken up , and its several fragments , being absorbed by the most massive , were collectively <unk> into a moon .
subsequently , the operation was repeated , and a second moon was the result .
we thus account for the planet neptune , with the two satellites which accompany him .
[ 5 ] laplace assumed his <unk> heterogeneous , merely that he might be thus enabled to account for the breaking up of the rings ; for had the <unk> been homogeneous , they would not have broken .
i reach the same <unk> of the secondary masses immediately resulting from the <unk> from an à priori consideration of their general <unk> .
in throwing off a ring from its equator , the sun <unk> that equilibrium between its centripetal and centrifugal forces which had been disturbed in the process of condensation ; but , as this condensation still proceeded , the equilibrium was again immediately disturbed , through the increase of rotation .
by the time the mass had so far shrunk that it occupied a spherical space just that circumscribed by the orbit of <unk> , we are to understand that the centrifugal force had so far obtained the ascendency that new relief was needed : a second equatorial band was , consequently , thrown off , which , proving <unk> , was broken up , as before in the case of neptune ; the fragments settling into the planet <unk> ; the velocity of whose actual revolution about the sun indicates , of course , the <unk> speed of that <unk> equatorial surface at the moment of the separation .
<unk> , adopting a rotation from the collective <unk> of the fragments composing it , as previously explained , now threw off ring after ring ; each of which , becoming broken up , settled into a moon : <unk> moons , at different epochs , having been formed , in this manner , by the rupture and general <unk> of as many distinct <unk> rings .
by the time the sun had shrunk until it occupied a space just that circumscribed by the orbit of saturn , the balance , we are to suppose , between its centripetal and centrifugal forces had again become so far disturbed , through increase of <unk> velocity , the result of condensation , that a third effort at equilibrium became necessary ; and an annular band was therefore whirled off as twice before ; which , on rupture through <unk> , became consolidated into the planet saturn .
this latter threw off , in the first place , seven uniform bands , which , on rupture , were <unk> respectively into as many moons ; but , subsequently , it appears to have discharged , at three distinct but not very distant epochs , three rings whose equability of constitution was , by apparent accident , so considerable as to present no occasion for their rupture ; thus they continue to revolve as rings .
i use the phrase <unk> accident ; ” for of accident in the ordinary sense there was , of course , nothing : —the term is properly applied only to the result of indistinguishable or not immediately traceable law .
shrinking still farther , until it occupied just the space circumscribed by the orbit of jupiter , the sun now found need of farther effort to restore the <unk> of its two forces , continually <unk> in the still continued increase of rotation .
jupiter , accordingly , was now thrown off ; passing from the annular to the <unk> condition ; and , on attaining this latter , threw off in its turn , at four different epochs , four rings , which finally resolved themselves into so many moons .
still shrinking , until its sphere occupied just the space defined by the orbit of the <unk> , the sun now discarded a ring which appears to have had eight centres of superior solidity , and , on breaking up , to have separated into eight fragments no one of which so far <unk> in mass as to absorb the others .
all therefore , as distinct although comparatively small planets , proceeded to revolve in orbits whose distances , each from each , may be considered as in some degree the measure of the force which drove them asunder : <unk> the orbits , nevertheless , being so closely coincident as to admit of our calling them one , in view of the other <unk> orbits .
continuing to shrink , the sun , on becoming so small as just to fill the orbit of mars , now discharged this <unk> course by the process repeatedly described .
having no moon , however , mars could have thrown off no ring .
in fact , an epoch had now arrived in the career of the parent body , the centre of the system .
the <unk> of its <unk> , which is the <unk> of its density , and which again is the <unk> of its condensation , out of which latter arose the constant disturbance of <unk> , by this period , have attained a point at which the efforts for restoration would have been more and more ineffectual just in proportion as they were less frequently needed .
thus the processes of which we have been speaking would everywhere show signs of <unk> the planets , first , and secondly , in the original mass .
we must not fall into the error of supposing the decrease of interval observed among the planets as we approach the sun , to be in any respect indicative of an increase of frequency in the periods at which they were discarded .
exactly the converse is to be understood .
the longest interval of time must have occurred between the discharges of the two interior ; the shortest , between those of the two exterior , planets .
the decrease of the interval of space is , nevertheless , the measure of the density , and thus inversely of the condensation , of the sun , throughout the processes detailed .
having shrunk , however , so far as to fill only the orbit of our earth , the parent sphere whirled from itself still one other <unk> <unk> a condition so nebulous as to admit of this <unk> <unk> , in its turn , yet another , which is our moon ; —but here terminated the lunar formations .
finally , subsiding to the orbits first of <name> and then of mercury , the sun discarded these two interior planets ; neither of which has given birth to any moon .
thus from his original <unk> , to speak more accurately , from the condition in which we first considered <unk> a partially <unk> nebular mass , certainly much more than <unk> millions of miles in <unk> great central orb and origin of our <unk> system , has gradually descended , by condensation , in obedience to the law of gravity , to a globe only <unk> miles in diameter ; but it by no means follows , either that its condensation is yet complete , or that it may not still possess the capacity of whirling from itself another planet .
i have here <unk> outline of course , but still with all the detail necessary for <unk> view of the nebular theory as its author himself conceived it .
from whatever point we regard it , we shall find it beautifully true .
it is by far too beautiful , indeed , not to possess truth as its <unk> here i am very profoundly serious in what i say .
in the revolution of the satellites of <unk> , there does appear something seemingly inconsistent with the assumptions of laplace ; but that one inconsistency can <unk> a theory constructed from a million of intricate <unk> , is a fancy fit only for the fantastic .
in <unk> , confidently , that the apparent anomaly to which i refer , <name> , sooner or later , be found one of the strongest possible <unk> of the general hypothesis , i pretend to no especial spirit of <unk> .
it is a matter which the only difficulty seems not to foresee .
[ 6 ] [ 6 ] i am prepared to show that the anomalous revolution of the satellites of <unk> is a simply perspective anomaly arising from the inclination of the axis of the planet .
the bodies whirled off in the processes described , would exchange , it has been seen , the superficial rotation of the orbs whence they originated , for a revolution of equal velocity about these orbs as distant centres ; and the revolution thus engendered must proceed , so long as the centripetal force , or that with which the discarded body <unk> toward its parent , is neither greater nor less than that by which it was discarded ; that is , than the centrifugal , or , far more properly , than the <unk> , velocity .
from the unity , however , of the origin of these two forces , we might have expected to find them as they are <unk> one accurately <unk> the other .
it has been shown , indeed , that the act of <unk> is , in every case , merely an act for the preservation of the <unk> .
after referring , however , the centripetal force to the <unk> law of gravity , it has been the fashion with astronomical treatises , to seek beyond the limits of mere <unk> is to say , of secondary <unk> solution of the <unk> of <unk> velocity .
this latter they attribute directly to a first <unk> god .
the force which carries a <unk> body around its primary they assert to have originated in an impulse given immediately by the <unk> is the childish phraseology <unk> the finger of deity itself .
in this view , the planets , fully formed , are conceived to have been hurled from the divine hand , to a position in the vicinity of the suns , with an impetus mathematically adapted to the masses , or attractive capacities , of the suns themselves .
an idea so grossly <unk> , although so <unk> adopted , could have arisen only from the difficulty of otherwise accounting for the absolutely accurate adaptation , each to each , of two forces so seemingly independent , one of the other , as are the <unk> and <unk> .
but it should be remembered that , for a long time , the coincidence between the <unk> rotation and her <unk> <unk> matters seemingly far more independent than those now <unk> looked upon as positively miraculous ; and there was a strong disposition , even among astronomers , to attribute the <name> to the direct and continual agency of <unk> , in this case , it was said , had found it necessary to interpose , specially , among his general laws , a set of <unk> regulations , for the purpose of forever concealing from mortal eyes the glories , or perhaps the horrors , of the other side of the <unk> that mysterious hemisphere which has always avoided , and must perpetually avoid , the <unk> scrutiny of mankind .
the advance of science , however , soon <unk> to the philosophical instinct needed no <unk> the one movement is but a <unk> more , even , than a <unk> the other .
for my part , i have no <name> with <unk> at once so <unk> , so idle , and so awkward .
they belong to the veriest cowardice of thought .
that nature and the god of nature are distinct , no thinking being can long doubt .
by the former we imply merely the laws of the latter .
but with the very idea of god , omnipotent , <unk> , we entertain , also , the idea of the infallibility of his laws .
with him there being neither past nor <unk> him all being <unk> we not insult him in supposing his laws so contrived as not to provide for every possible contingency ? <unk> , rather , what idea can we have of any possible contingency , except that it is at once a result and a manifestation of his laws ?
he who , <unk> himself of prejudice , shall have the rare courage to think absolutely for himself , can not fail to arrive , in the end , at the condensation of laws into <unk> can not fail of reaching the conclusion that each law of nature is dependent at all points upon all other laws , and that all are but consequences of one primary exercise of the divine volition .
such is the principle of the <unk> which , with all necessary deference , i here venture to suggest and to maintain .
in this view , it <name> be seen that , dismissing as frivolous , and even impious , the fancy of the <unk> force having been imparted to the planets immediately by “the finger of god , ” i consider this force as originating in the rotation of the stars : <unk> rotation as brought about by the <unk> of the primary atoms , towards their respective centres of aggregation : <unk> <unk> as the consequence of the law of gravity : <unk> law as but the mode in which is necessarily manifested the tendency of the atoms to return into <unk> : <unk> tendency to return as but the inevitable rëaction of the first and most sublime of <unk> act by which a god , <unk> and alone existing , became all things at once , through dint of his volition , while all things were thus constituted a portion of god .
the radical assumptions of this discourse suggest to me , and in fact imply , certain important modifications of the nebular theory as given by laplace .
the efforts of the repulsive power i have considered as made for the purpose of preventing contact among the atoms , and thus as made in the ratio of the approach to <unk> is to say , in the ratio of condensation .
[ 7 ] in other words , electricity , with its <unk> phænomena , heat , light and magnetism , is to be understood as proceeding as condensation proceeds , and , of course , inversely as density proceeds , or the cessation to condense .
thus the sun , in the process of its aggregation , must soon , in developing repulsion , have become excessively <unk> incandescent : and we can perceive how the operation of <unk> its rings must have been materially assisted by the slight incrustation of its surface consequent on cooling .
any common experiment shows us how readily a crust of the character suggested , is separated , through <unk> , from the interior mass .
but , on every successive rejection of the crust , the new surface would appear incandescent as before ; and the period at which it would again become so far encrusted as to be readily loosened and discharged , may well be imagined as exactly coincident with that at which a new effort would be needed , by the whole mass , to restore the equilibrium of its two forces , <unk> through condensation .
in other words : <unk> the time the electric influence ( repulsion ) has prepared the surface for rejection , we are to understand that the <unk> influence ( attraction ) is precisely ready to reject it .
here , then , as everywhere , the body and the soul walk hand in hand .
[ 7 ] see <name> 70 .
these ideas are <unk> confirmed at all points .
since condensation can never , in any body , be considered as absolutely at an end , we are warranted in anticipating that , whenever we have an opportunity of testing the matter , we shall find indications of resident <unk> in all the <unk> <unk> and planets as well as suns .
that our moon is strongly <unk> , we see at her every total eclipse , when , if not so , she would disappear .
on the dark part of the satellite , too , during her phases , we often observe flashes like our own <unk> ; and that these latter , with our various other so-called electrical phænomena , without reference to any more steady radiance , must give our earth a certain appearance of <unk> to an inhabitant of the moon , is quite evident .
in fact , we should regard all the phænomena referred to , as mere manifestations , in different moods and degrees , of the <unk> <unk> condensation .
if my views are <unk> , we should be prepared to find the newer <unk> is to say , those nearer the <unk> luminous than those older and more remote : —and the extreme brilliancy of <name> ( on whose dark portions , during her phases , the <unk> are frequently visible ) does not seem to be altogether accounted for by her mere proximity to the central orb .
she is no doubt vividly <unk> , although less so than mercury : while the <unk> of neptune may be comparatively nothing .
admitting what i have urged , it is clear that , from the moment of the <unk> <unk> a ring , there must be a continuous diminution both of his heat and light , on account of the continuous <unk> of his surface ; and that a period would <unk> period immediately previous to a new <unk> a very material decrease of both light and heat , must become apparent .
now , we know that tokens of such changes are distinctly recognizable .
on the melville <unk> <unk> merely one out of a hundred <unk> find traces of <unk> <unk> plants that never could have flourished without immensely more light and heat than are at present afforded by our sun to any portion of the surface of the earth .
is such vegetation referable to an epoch immediately subsequent to the <unk> of <name> ?
at this epoch must have occurred to us our greatest access of solar influence ; and , in fact , this influence must then have attained its maximum : <unk> out of view , of course , the period when the earth itself was <unk> period of its mere organization .
again : <unk> know that there exist <unk> <unk> is to say , suns whose existence we determine through the movements of others , but whose <unk> is not sufficient to impress us .
are these suns invisible merely on account of the length of time elapsed since their discharge of a planet ?
and yet again : <unk> we <unk> least in certain <unk> for the sudden appearances of suns where none had been previously suspected , by the hypothesis that , having rolled with encrusted surfaces throughout the few thousand years of our astronomical history , each of these suns , in whirling off a new secondary , has at length been enabled to display the glories of its still incandescent interior ? <unk> the well-ascertained fact of the proportional increase of heat as we descend into the earth , i need of course , do nothing more than refer : <unk> comes in the strongest possible <unk> of all that i have said on the topic now at issue .
in speaking , not long ago , of the repulsive or electrical influence , i remarked that “the important phænomena of vitality , consciousness , and thought , whether we observe them generally or in detail , seem to proceed at least in the ratio of the <unk> [ 8 ] i mentioned , too , that i would recur to the suggestion : —and this is the proper point at which to do so .
looking at the matter , first , in detail , we perceive that not merely the manifestation of vitality , but its importance , consequence , and elevation of character , keep pace , very closely , with the <unk> , or complexity , of the animal structure .
looking at the question , now , in its generality , and referring to the first movements of the atoms towards <unk> , we find that <unk> , brought about directly through condensation , is proportional with it forever .
we thus reach the proposition that the importance of the development of the terrestrial vitality proceeds <unk> with the terrestrial condensation .
[ 8 ] <name> 36 .
now this is in precise accordance with what we know of the succession of animals on the earth .
as it has proceeded in its condensation , superior and still superior races have appeared .
is it impossible that the successive geological revolutions which have attended , at least , if not immediately caused , these successive elevations of <unk> <unk> it improbable that these revolutions have themselves been produced by the successive <unk> discharges from the <unk> other words , by the successive variations in the solar influence on the earth ?
were this idea <unk> , we should not be unwarranted in the fancy that the discharge of yet a new planet , interior to mercury , may give rise to yet a new modification of the terrestrial <unk> modification from which may spring a race both materially and spiritually superior to man .
these thoughts impress me with all the force of <unk> i throw them out , of course , merely in their obvious character of suggestion .
the nebular theory of laplace has lately received far more confirmation than it needed , at the hands of the philosopher , <unk> .
these two have thus together <unk> , to be sure , that matter at any period actually existed as described , in a state of nebular diffusion , but that , admitting it so to have existed throughout the space and much beyond the space now occupied by our solar system , and to have commenced a movement towards a <unk> must gradually have assumed the various forms and motions which are now seen , in that system , to obtain .
a demonstration such as <unk> <unk> and mathematical demonstration , as far as demonstration can <unk> and <unk> , indeed , by that unprofitable and disreputable tribe , the professional <unk> mere madmen who deny the newtonian law of gravity on which the results of the french mathematicians are <unk> demonstration , i say , such as this , would to most intellects be <unk> i confess that it is so to <unk> the validity of the nebular hypothesis upon which the demonstration depends .
that the demonstration does not prove the hypothesis , according to the common understanding of the word <unk> , ” i admit , of course .
to show that certain existing <unk> certain established <unk> be , even mathematically , accounted for by the assumption of a certain hypothesis , is by no means to establish the hypothesis itself .
in other words : <unk> show that , certain data being given , a certain existing result might , or even must , have ensued , <name> fail to prove that this result did ensue , from the data , until such time as it shall be also shown that there are , and can be , no other data from which the result in question might equally have ensued .
but , in the case now discussed , although all must admit the deficiency of what we are in the habit of <unk> <unk> , ” still there are many intellects , and those of the loftiest order , to which no proof could bring one <unk> of additional conviction .
without going into details which might <unk> upon the <unk> of metaphysics , i may as well here observe that the force of conviction , in cases such as this , <name> always , with the <unk> , be proportional to the amount of complexity intervening between the hypothesis and the result .
to be less abstract : —the greatness of the complexity found existing among <unk> conditions , by rendering great in the same proportion the difficulty of accounting for all these conditions at once , strengthens , also in the same proportion , our <name> in that hypothesis which does , in such manner , satisfactorily account for them : —and as no complexity can well be conceived greater than that of the astronomical conditions , so no conviction can be <unk> my mind at <unk> that with which i am impressed by an hypothesis that not only <unk> these conditions , with mathematical accuracy , and reduces them into a consistent and intelligible whole , but is , at the same time , the sole hypothesis by means of which the human intellect has been ever enabled to account for them at all .
a most <unk> opinion has become latterly current in gossiping and even in scientific <unk> opinion that the so-called nebular <unk> has been overthrown .
this fancy has arisen from the report of late observations made , among what hitherto have been termed the <unk> , ” through the large telescope of cincinnati , and the <unk> instrument of lord <unk> .
certain spots in the firmament which presented , even to the most powerful of the old telescopes , the appearance of <unk> , or haze , had been regarded for a long time as confirming the theory of laplace .
they were looked upon as stars in that very process of condensation which i have been attempting to describe .
thus it was supposed that we <unk> <unk> <unk> evidence , by the way , which has always been found very <unk> the truth of the hypothesis ; and , although certain <unk> improvements , every now and then , enabled us to perceive that a spot , here and there , which we had been classing among the <unk> , was , in fact , but a cluster of stars <unk> its nebular character only from its immensity of <unk> it was thought that no doubt could exist as to the actual <unk> of numerous other masses , the <unk> of the <unk> , bidding defiance to every effort at segregation .
of these latter the most interesting was the great <unk> in the constellation orion : —but this , with innumerable other <unk> <unk> , ” when viewed through the magnificent modern telescopes , has become resolved into a simple collection of stars .
now this fact has been very generally understood as conclusive against the nebular hypothesis of laplace ; and , on announcement of the discoveries in question , the most enthusiastic defender and most eloquent <unk> of the theory , dr. <name> , went so far as to <unk> the necessity of <unk> an idea which had formed the material of his most praiseworthy book .
[ 9 ] [ 9 ] <unk> of the architecture of the <unk> a letter , <unk> to be from dr. <name> to a friend in <name> , went the rounds of our newspapers , about two years ago , i think , admitting “the <unk> to which i refer .
in a subsequent lecture , however , dr. n. appears in some manner to have gotten the better of the necessity , and does not quite renounce the theory , although he seems to wish that he could sneer at it as “a purely hypothetical <unk> what else was the law of gravity before the <unk> experiments ?
and who questioned the law of gravity , even then ?
many of my readers <name> no doubt be inclined to say that the result of these new investigations has at least a strong tendency to overthrow the hypothesis ; while some of them , more thoughtful , <name> suggest that , although the theory is by no means <unk> through the segregation of the particular <unk> , ” alluded to , still a failure to <unk> them , with such telescopes , might well have been understood as a triumphant <unk> of the theory : —and this latter class <name> be surprised , perhaps , to hear me say that even with them i disagree .
if the propositions of this discourse have been comprehended , it <name> be seen that , in my view , a failure to <unk> the <unk> would have tended to the refutation , rather than to the confirmation , of the nebular hypothesis .
let me explain : —the newtonian law of gravity we may , of course , assume as demonstrated .
this law , it <name> be remembered , i have referred to the rëaction of the first divine <unk> the rëaction of an exercise of the divine volition temporarily overcoming a difficulty .
this difficulty is that of forcing the normal into the <unk> impelling that whose originality , and therefore whose rightful condition , was one , to take upon itself the <unk> condition of many .
it is only by conceiving this difficulty as temporarily overcome , that we can comprehend a rëaction .
there could have been no rëaction had the act been infinitely continued .
so long as the act lasted , no rëaction , of course , could commence ; in other words , no gravitation could take <unk> we have considered the one as but the manifestation of the other .
but gravitation has taken place ; therefore the act of creation has ceased : and gravitation has long ago taken place ; therefore the act of creation has long ago ceased .
we can no more expect , then , to observe the primary processes of creation ; and to these primary processes the condition of <unk> has already been explained to belong .
through what we know of the propagation of light , we have direct proof that the more remote of the stars have existed , under the forms in which we now see them , for an inconceivable number of years .
so far back at least , then , as the period when these stars underwent condensation , must have been the epoch at which the <unk> processes began .
that we may conceive these processes , then , as still going on in the case of certain <unk> , ” while in all other cases we find them thoroughly at an end , we are forced into assumptions for which we have really no basis <unk> have to thrust in , again , upon the revolting reason , the blasphemous idea of special <unk> have to suppose that , in the particular instances of these <unk> , ” an unerring god found it necessary to introduce certain supplementary <unk> improvements of the general <unk> <unk> and <unk> , in a word , which had the effect of <unk> the completion of these individual stars for centuries of centuries beyond the <unk> during which all the other <unk> bodies had time , not only to be fully constituted , but to grow hoary with an unspeakable old age .
of course , it <name> be immediately objected that since the light by which we recognize the <unk> now , must be merely that which left their surfaces a vast number of years ago , the processes at present observed , or supposed to be observed , are , in fact , not processes now actually going on , but the phantoms of processes completed long in the <unk> as i maintain all these <unk> processes must have been .
to this i reply that neither is the <unk> condition of the condensed stars their actual condition , but a condition completed long in the past ; so that my argument drawn from the relative condition of the stars and the <unk> , ” is in no manner disturbed .
moreover , those who maintain the existence of <unk> , do not refer the <unk> to extreme distance ; they declare it a real and not merely a perspective <unk> .
that we may conceive , indeed , a nebular mass as visible at all , we must conceive it as very near us in comparison with the condensed stars brought into view by the modern telescopes .
in maintaining the appearances in question , then , to be really nebulous , we maintain their comparative vicinity to our point of view .
thus , their condition , as we see them now , must be referred to an epoch far less remote than that to which we may refer the <unk> condition of at least the majority of the <unk> a word , should astronomy ever demonstrate a <unk> , ” in the sense at present intended , i should consider the nebular <unk> , indeed , as corroborated by the <unk> as thereby irretrievably overthrown .
by way , however , of rendering unto cæsar no more than the things that are <unk> , let me here remark that the assumption of the hypothesis which led him to so glorious a result , seems to have been suggested to laplace in great measure by a <unk> the very <unk> of which we have just been <unk> the generally prevalent misunderstanding of the character of the <unk> , so <unk> .
these he supposed to be , in reality , what their designation implies .
the fact is , this great man had , very properly , an inferior <name> in his own merely <unk> powers .
in respect , therefore , to the actual existence of <unk> existence so confidently maintained by his <unk> <unk> depended less upon what he saw than upon what he heard .
it <name> be seen that the only valid objections to his theory , are those made to its hypothesis as <unk> what suggested <unk> to what it suggests ; to its propositions rather than to its results .
his most unwarranted assumption was that of giving the atoms a movement towards a centre , in the very face of his evident understanding that these atoms , in unlimited succession , extended throughout the universal space .
i have already shown that , under such circumstances , there could have occurred no movement at all ; and laplace , consequently , assumed one on no more philosophical ground than that something of the kind was necessary for the establishment of what he intended to establish .
his original idea seems to have been a compound of the true <unk> atoms with the false <unk> of his contemporaries ; and thus his theory presents us with the singular anomaly of absolute truth deduced , as a mathematical result , from a hybrid <unk> of ancient imagination <unk> with modern <unk> .
<unk> real strength lay , in fact , in an almost miraculous mathematical instinct : <unk> this he relied ; and in no instance did it fail or deceive him : —in the case of the nebular <unk> , it led him , blindfolded , through a labyrinth of error , into one of the most luminous and stupendous temples of truth .
let us now fancy , for the moment , that the ring first thrown off by the <unk> is to say , the ring whose <unk> constituted <unk> not , in fact , break up until the <unk> of the ring out of which <unk> arose ; that this latter ring , again , remained perfect until the discharge of that out of which sprang saturn ; that this latter , again , remained entire until the discharge of that from which originated <unk> so on .
let us imagine , in a word , that no dissolution occurred among the rings until the final rejection of that which gave birth to mercury .
we thus paint to the eye of the mind a series of <unk> concentric circles ; and looking as well at them as at the processes by which , according to <unk> hypothesis , they were constructed , we perceive at once a very singular analogy with the atomic strata and the process of the original irradiation as i have described it .
is it impossible that , on measuring the forces , respectively , by which each successive <unk> circle was thrown <unk> is to say , on measuring the successive excesses of rotation over gravitation which occasioned the successive <unk> should find the analogy in question more decidedly confirmed ?
is it improbable that we should discover these forces to have <unk> in the original <unk> to the squares of the distances ?  our solar system , consisting , in chief , of one sun , with sixteen planets certainly , and possibly a few more , revolving about it at various distances , and attended by seventeen moons assuredly , but very probably by several <unk> now to be considered as an example of the innumerable <unk> which proceeded to take place throughout the universal sphere of atoms on withdrawal of the divine volition .
i mean to say that our solar system is to be understood as affording a generic instance of these <unk> , or , more correctly , of the ulterior conditions at which they arrived .
if we keep our attention fixed on the idea of the utmost possible relation as the omnipotent design , and on the precautions taken to accomplish it through difference of form , among the original atoms , and particular <unk> , we shall find it impossible to suppose for a moment that even any two of the incipient <unk> reached precisely the same result in the end .
we shall rather be inclined to think that no two <unk> bodies in the <unk> suns , planets or <unk> particularly , while all are generally , similar .
still less , then , can we imagine any two assemblages of such <unk> two <unk> having more than a general resemblance .
[ 10 ] our telescopes , at this point , thoroughly confirm our deductions .
taking our own solar system , then , as merely a loose or general type of all , we have so far proceeded in our subject as to survey the universe under the aspect of a spherical space , throughout which , dispersed with merely general equability , exist a number of but generally similar systems .
[ 10 ] it is not impossible that some unlooked-for optical improvement may disclose to us , among innumerable varieties of systems , a luminous sun , encircled by luminous and <unk> rings , within and without and between which , revolve luminous and <unk> planets , attended by moons having <unk> even these latter again having moons .
let us now , expanding our conceptions , look upon each of these systems as in itself an atom ; which in fact it is , when we consider it as but one of the countless myriads of systems which constitute the universe .
regarding all , then , as but colossal atoms , each with the same ineradicable tendency to unity which <unk> the actual atoms of which it <unk> enter at once upon a new order of <unk> .
the smaller systems , in the vicinity of a larger one , would , inevitably , be drawn into still closer vicinity .
a thousand would assemble here ; a million <unk> here , again , even a <unk> , thus , immeasurable vacancies in space .
and if now , it be demanded why , in the case of these <unk> these merely <unk> <unk> speak , simply , of an <unk> , ” and not , as in the case of the actual atoms , of a more or less consolidated <unk> : <unk> it be asked , for instance , why i do not <name> what i suggest to its legitimate conclusion , and describe , at once , these assemblages of <unk> as rushing to consolidation in <unk> each becoming condensed into one magnificent <unk> reply is that <unk> <unk> am but pausing , for a moment , on the awful threshold of the future .
for the present , calling these assemblages <unk> , ” we see them in the incipient stages of their consolidation .
their absolute consolidation is to come .
we have now reached a point from which we behold the universe as a spherical space , interspersed , <unk> , with clusters .
it <name> be noticed that i here prefer the <unk> <unk> to the phrase <unk> a merely general equability , ” employed before .
it is evident , in fact , that the equability of distribution <name> diminish in the ratio of the <unk> <unk> is to say , as the things distributed diminish in number .
thus the increase of <unk> increase which must continue until , sooner or later , an epoch <name> arrive at which the largest <unk> <name> absorb all the <unk> be viewed as , simply , a <unk> indication of the tendency to one .
and here , at length , it seems proper to inquire whether the ascertained facts of astronomy confirm the general arrangement which i have thus , <unk> , assigned to the heavens .
thoroughly , they do .
<unk> observation , guided by the laws of perspective , enables us to understand that the perceptible universe exists as a cluster of clusters , irregularly disposed .
the <unk> of which this universal <unk> of <unk> consists , are merely what we have been in the practice of <unk> <unk> , of these <unk> , ” one is of paramount interest to mankind .
i allude to the galaxy , or milky way .
this interests us , first and most obviously , on account of its great superiority in apparent size , not only to any one other cluster in the firmament , but to all the other clusters taken together .
the largest of these latter occupies a mere point , comparatively , and is distinctly seen only with the aid of a telescope .
the galaxy sweeps throughout the heaven and is brilliantly visible to the naked eye .
but it interests man chiefly , although less immediately , on account of its being his home ; the home of the earth on which he exists ; the home of the sun about which this earth revolves ; the home of that <unk> of orbs of which the sun is the centre and <unk> earth one of sixteen <unk> , or <unk> moon one of seventeen <unk> , or satellites .
the galaxy , let me repeat , is but one of the clusters which i have been <unk> one of the <unk> <unk> revealed to <unk> the telescope alone , <unk> faint hazy spots in various quarters of the sky .
we have no reason to suppose the milky way really more extensive than the least of these <unk> its vast superiority in size is but an apparent superiority arising from our position in regard to <unk> is to say , from our position in its midst .
however strange the assertion may at first appear to those <unk> in astronomy , still the astronomer himself has no hesitation in asserting that we are in the midst of that inconceivable host of <unk> <unk> <unk> constitute the galaxy .
moreover , not only have <unk> only has our sun a right to claim the galaxy as its own especial cluster , but , with slight reservation , it may be said that all the distinctly visible stars of the <unk> the stars visible to the naked <unk> equally a right to claim it as their own .
there has been a great deal of <unk> in respect to the shape of the galaxy ; which , in nearly all our astronomical treatises , is said to resemble that of a capital y .
the cluster in question has , in reality , a certain <unk> general resemblance to the planet saturn , with its <unk> triple ring .
instead of the solid orb of that planet , however , we must picture to ourselves a <unk> <unk> , or collection of stars ; our sun lying <unk> the shore of the <unk> that side of it which is nearest the constellation of the cross and farthest from that of <unk> .
the surrounding ring , where it approaches our position , has in it a longitudinal gash , which does , in fact , cause the ring , in our vicinity , to assume , loosely , the appearance of a capital y .
we must not fall into the error , however , of conceiving the somewhat indefinite girdle as at all remote , comparatively speaking , from the also indefinite <unk> cluster which it surrounds ; and thus , for mere purpose of explanation , we may speak of our sun as actually situated at that point of the y where its three component lines unite ; and , conceiving this letter to be of a certain <unk> a certain thickness , very trivial in comparison with its <unk> may even speak of our position as in the middle of this thickness .
<unk> ourselves thus placed , we shall no longer find difficulty in accounting for the phænomena <unk> are perspective altogether .
when we look upward or <unk> is to say , when we cast our eyes in the direction of the <unk> <unk> look through fewer stars than when we cast them in the direction of its length , or along either of the three component lines .
of course , in the former case , the stars appear <unk> the latter , <unk> reverse this explanation : <unk> inhabitant of the earth , when looking , as we commonly express ourselves , at the galaxy , is then beholding it in some of the directions of its <unk> looking along the lines of the <unk> when , looking out into the general heaven , he turns his eyes from the galaxy , he is then surveying it in the direction of the <unk> thickness ; and on this account the stars seem to him scattered ; while , in fact , they are as close together , on an average , as in the mass of the cluster .
no consideration could be better adapted to convey an idea of this <unk> stupendous extent .
if , with a telescope of high <unk> power , we carefully inspect the firmament , we shall become aware of a belt of <unk> what we have hitherto called <unk> band , of varying breadth , stretching from horizon to horizon , at right angles to the general course of the milky way .
this band is the ultimate cluster of clusters .
this belt is the universe .
our galaxy is but one , and perhaps one of the most inconsiderable , of the clusters which go to the constitution of this ultimate , universal belt or band .
the appearance of this cluster of clusters , to our eyes , as a belt or band , is altogether a perspective <unk> of the same character as that which causes us to behold our own individual and <unk> cluster , the galaxy , under guise also of a belt , traversing the heavens at right angles to the universal one .
the shape of the <unk> cluster is , of course generally , that of each individual cluster which it includes .
just as the scattered stars which , on looking from the galaxy , we see in the general sky , are , in fact , but a portion of that galaxy itself , and as closely intermingled with it as any of the <unk> points in what seems the <unk> portion of its <unk> are the scattered <unk> which , on casting our eyes from the universal belt , we perceive at all points of the <unk> , i say , are these scattered <unk> to be understood as only <unk> scattered , and as part and parcel of the one supreme and universal sphere .
no astronomical fallacy is more untenable , and none has been more pertinaciously adhered to , than that of the absolute <unk> of the universe of stars .
the reasons for limitation , as i have already assigned them , à priori , seem to me unanswerable ; but , not to speak of these , observation assures us that there is , in numerous directions around us , certainly , if not in all , a positive <unk> , at the very least , affords us no basis whatever for thinking otherwise .
were the succession of stars endless , then the background of the sky would present us an uniform <unk> , like that displayed by the <unk> there could be absolutely no point , in all that background , at which would not exist a <unk> the only mode , therefore , in which , under such a state of affairs , we could comprehend the <unk> which our telescopes find in innumerable directions , would be by supposing the distance of the invisible background so immense that no <name> from it has yet been able to reach us at all .
that this may be so , who shall venture to deny ?
i maintain , simply , that we have not even the shadow of a reason for believing that it is so .
when speaking of the vulgar propensity to regard all bodies on the earth as tending merely to the <unk> centre , i observed that , <unk> certain exceptions to be specified hereafter , every body on the earth tended not only to the <unk> centre , but in every conceivable direction <unk> [ 11 ] the <unk> refer to those frequent gaps in the heavens , where our utmost scrutiny can detect not only no <unk> bodies , but no indications of their existence : <unk> yawning chasms , blacker than <unk> , seem to afford us glimpses , through the boundary walls of the universe of stars , into the illimitable universe of vacancy , beyond .
now as any body , existing on the earth , chances to pass , either through its own movement or the <unk> , into a line with any one of these <unk> , or <unk> abysses , it clearly is no longer attracted in the direction of that void , and for the moment , consequently , is <unk> than at any period , either after or before .
independently of the consideration of these <unk> , however , and looking only at the generally <unk> distribution of the stars , we see that the absolute tendency of bodies on the earth to the <unk> centre , is in a state of perpetual variation .
[ 11 ] <name> 62 .
we comprehend , then , the insulation of our universe .
we perceive the isolation of <unk> all that which we grasp with the senses .
we know that there exists one cluster of <unk> collection around which , on all sides , extend the immeasurable <unk> of a space to all human perception <unk> .
but because upon the confines of this universe of stars we are compelled to pause , through want of farther evidence from the senses , is it right to conclude that , in fact , there is no material point beyond that which we have thus been permitted to attain ?
have we , or have we not , an analogical right to the inference that this perceptible <unk> this cluster of <unk> but one of a series of clusters of clusters , the rest of which are invisible through <unk> the diffusion of their light being so excessive , ere it reaches us , as not to produce upon our <unk> a <unk> from there being no such <unk> as light at all , in these unspeakably distant <unk> , lastly , from the mere interval being so vast , that the electric tidings of their presence in space , have not <unk> the <unk> myriads of <unk> enabled to traverse that interval ?
have we any right to <unk> we any ground whatever for visions such as these ?
if we have a right to them in any degree , we have a right to their infinite extension .
the human <name> has obviously a leaning to the <unk> , ” and <unk> the phantom of the idea .
it seems to long with a passionate fervor for this impossible <name> , with the <name> of intellectually believing it when conceived .
what is general among the whole race of man , of course no individual of that race can be warranted in considering abnormal ; nevertheless , there may be a class of superior <unk> , to whom the human bias alluded to may wear all the character of <unk> .
my question , however , remains <unk> : <unk> we any right to <unk> us say , rather , to <unk> interminable succession of the <unk> of clusters , ” or of <unk> more or less similar ?
i reply that the <unk> , ” in a case such as this , depends absolutely upon the hardihood of that imagination which ventures to claim the right .
let me declare , only , that , as an individual , i myself feel impelled to the <unk> daring to call it <unk> there does exist a limitless succession of <unk> , more or less similar to that of which we have <unk> that of which alone we shall ever have <unk> the very least until the return of our own particular universe into unity .
if such clusters of clusters exist , <unk> they <unk> is abundantly clear that , having had no part in our origin , they have no portion in our laws .
they neither attract us , nor we them .
their <unk> spirit is not <unk> not that which obtains in any part of our universe .
they could not impress our senses or our souls .
among them and <unk> all , for the moment , <unk> are no influences in common .
each exists , apart and independently , in the bosom of its proper and particular god .
in the conduct of this discourse , i am aiming less at physical than at metaphysical order .
the clearness with which even material phænomena are presented to the understanding , depends very little , i have long since learned to perceive , upon a merely natural , and almost altogether upon a moral , arrangement .
if then i seem to step somewhat too <unk> from point to point of my topic , let me suggest that i do so in the <name> of thus the better keeping unbroken that chain of graduated impression by which alone the intellect of man can expect to <unk> the grandeurs of which i speak , and , in their majestic <unk> , to comprehend them .
so far , our attention has been directed , almost exclusively , to a general and relative grouping of the <unk> bodies in space .
of <unk> there has been little ; and whatever ideas of quantity have been <unk> is to say , of number , magnitude , and <unk> been conveyed incidentally and by way of preparation for more <unk> conceptions .
these latter let us now attempt to entertain .
our solar system , as has been already mentioned , consists , in chief , of one sun and sixteen planets certainly , but in all probability a few others , revolving around it as a centre , and attended by seventeen moons of which we know , with possibly several more of which as yet we know nothing .
these various bodies are not true spheres , but <unk> <unk> flattened at the poles of the imaginary axes about which they <unk> : —the <unk> being a consequence of the rotation .
neither is the sun absolutely the centre of the system ; for this sun itself , with all the planets , revolves about a perpetually shifting point of space , which is the <unk> general centre of gravity .
neither are we to consider the paths through which these different <unk> <unk> moons about the planets , the planets about the sun , or the sun about the common <unk> circles in an accurate sense .
they are , in fact , <unk> of the <unk> being the point about which the revolution is made .
an ellipse is a curve , returning into itself , one of whose diameters is longer than the other .
in the longer diameter are two points , equidistant from the middle of the line , and so situated otherwise that if , from each of them a straight line be drawn to any one point of the curve , the two lines , taken together , <name> be equal to the longer diameter itself .
now let us conceive such an ellipse .
at one of the points mentioned , which are the <unk> , let us fasten an orange .
by an elastic thread let us connect this orange with a pea ; and let us place this latter on the circumference of the ellipse .
let us now move the pea continuously around the <unk> always on the circumference of the ellipse .
the elastic thread , which , of course , varies in length as we move the pea , <name> form what in geometry is called a radius <unk> .
now , if the orange be understood as the sun , and the pea as a planet revolving about it , then the revolution should be made at such a <unk> a velocity so <unk> the radius <unk> may pass over equal areas of space in equal times .
the progress of the pea should <unk> other words , the progress of the planet is , of course , <unk> in proportion to its distance from the <unk> in proportion to its proximity .
those planets , moreover , move the more slowly which are the farther from the sun ; the squares of their periods of revolution having the same proportion to each other , as have to each other the cubes of their mean distances from the sun .
the wonderfully complex laws of revolution here described , however , are not to be understood as obtaining in our system alone .
they everywhere prevail where attraction prevails .
they control the universe .
every shining speck in the firmament is , no doubt , a luminous sun , resembling our own , at least in its general features , and having in attendance upon it a greater or less number of planets , greater or less , whose still lingering <unk> is not sufficient to render them visible to us at so vast a distance , but which , nevertheless , revolve , <unk> , about their starry centres , in obedience to the principles just <unk> obedience to the three <unk> laws of <unk> three immortal laws guessed by the imaginative kepler , and but subsequently demonstrated and accounted for by the patient and mathematical <name> .
among a tribe of philosophers who pride themselves excessively upon matter-of-fact , it is far too fashionable to sneer at all speculation under the comprehensive <unk> , <unk> the point to be considered is , who guesses .
in guessing with plato , we spend our time to better purpose , now and then , than in <unk> to a demonstration by <unk> .
in many works on astronomy i find it distinctly stated that the laws of kepler are the basis of the great principle , gravitation .
this idea must have arisen from the fact that the suggestion of these laws by kepler , and his proving them à <unk> to have an actual existence , led <name> to account for them by the hypothesis of gravitation , and , finally , to demonstrate them à priori , as necessary consequences of the hypothetical principle .
thus so far from the laws of kepler being the basis of gravity , gravity is the basis of these <unk> it is , indeed , of all the laws of the material universe which are not referable to repulsion alone .
the mean distance of the earth from the <unk> is to say , from the heavenly body in our closest <unk> <unk> miles .
mercury , the planet nearest the sun , is distant from him 37 millions of miles .
<name> , the next , revolves at a distance of 68 millions : —the earth , which comes next , at a distance of 95 millions : <unk> , then , at a distance of 144 millions .
now come the eight <unk> ( ceres , <unk> , <name> , pallas , <unk> , <name> , <name> , and <unk> ) at an average distance of about 250 millions .
then we have jupiter , distant <unk> millions ; then saturn , 900 millions ; then <unk> , 19 hundred millions ; finally neptune , lately discovered , and revolving at a distance , say of 28 hundred millions .
leaving neptune out of the <unk> which as yet we know little accurately and which is , possibly , one of a system of <unk> <name> be seen that , within certain limits , there exists an order of interval among the planets .
speaking loosely , we may say that each outer planet is twice as far from the sun as is the next inner one .
may not the order here <unk> not the law of <unk> deduced from consideration of the analogy suggested by me as having place between the solar discharge of rings and the mode of the atomic irradiation ?
the <name> hurriedly mentioned in this summary of distance , it is folly to attempt comprehending , unless in the light of abstract arithmetical facts .
they are not practically tangible ones .
they convey no precise ideas .
i have stated that neptune , the planet farthest from the sun , revolves about him at a distance of 28 hundred millions of miles .
so far good : <unk> have stated a mathematical fact ; and , without comprehending it in the least , we may put it to <unk> .
but in mentioning , even , that the moon revolves about the earth at the comparatively trifling distance of <unk> miles , i entertained no expectation of giving any one to <unk> <unk> <unk> far from the earth the moon actually is .
<unk> miles !
there are , perhaps , few of my readers who have not crossed the atlantic ocean ; yet how many of them have a distinct idea of even the 3,000 miles intervening between shore and shore ?
i doubt , indeed , whether the man lives who can force into his <name> the most remote <name> of the interval between one <unk> and its next neighbor upon the turnpike .
we are in some measure aided , however , in our consideration of distance , by combining this consideration with the kindred one of velocity .
sound passes through <unk> feet of space in a second of time .
now were it possible for an inhabitant of the earth to see the flash of a cannon discharged in the moon , and to hear the report , he would have to wait , after perceiving the former , more than 13 entire days and nights before getting any intimation of the latter .
however feeble be the impression , even thus conveyed , of the <unk> real distance from the earth , it <name> , nevertheless , effect a good object in enabling us more clearly to see the futility of attempting to grasp such intervals as that of the 28 hundred millions of miles between our sun and neptune ; or even that of the 95 millions between the sun and the earth we inhabit .
a cannon-ball , flying at the greatest velocity with which such a ball has ever been known to fly , could not traverse the latter interval in less than 20 years ; while for the former it would require <unk> .
our <unk> real diameter is <unk> miles ; yet she is comparatively so trifling an object that it would take nearly 50 such orbs to compose one as great as the earth .
the diameter of our own globe is <unk> <unk> from the enunciation of these <name> what positive idea do we derive ?
if we ascend an ordinary mountain and look around us from its summit , we behold a landscape stretching , say 40 miles , in every direction ; forming a circle 250 miles in circumference ; and including an area of <unk> square miles .
the extent of such a prospect , on account of the <unk> with which its portions necessarily present themselves to view , can be only very feebly and very partially appreciated : <unk> the entire panorama would comprehend no more than one <unk> part of the mere surface of our globe .
were this panorama , then , to be succeeded , after the lapse of an hour , by another of equal extent ; this again by a third , after the lapse of another hour ; this again by a fourth after lapse of another <unk> so on , until the scenery of the whole earth were exhausted ; and were we to be engaged in examining these various <unk> for twelve hours of every day ; we should nevertheless , be 9 years and 48 days in completing the general survey .
but if the mere surface of the earth <unk> the grasp of the imagination , what are we to think of its cubical contents ?
it embraces a mass of matter equal in weight to at least 2 <unk> , 200 <unk> of tons .
let us suppose it in a state of quiescence ; and now let us endeavor to conceive a mechanical force sufficient to set it in motion !
not the strength of all the myriads of beings whom we may conclude to inhabit the <unk> worlds of our <unk> the combined physical strength of all these <unk> admitting all to be more powerful than <unk> avail to stir the ponderous mass a single inch from its position .
what are we to understand , then , of the force , which under similar circumstances , would be required to move the largest of our planets , jupiter ?
this is <unk> miles in diameter , and would include within its <unk> more than a thousand orbs of the magnitude of our own .
yet this stupendous body is actually flying around the sun at the rate of <unk> miles an <unk> is to say , with a velocity 40 times greater than that of a cannon-ball !
the thought of such a <unk> can not well be said to startle the mind : <unk> <unk> and <unk> it .
not unfrequently we task our imagination in picturing the capacities of an <name> .
let us fancy such a being at a distance of some hundred miles from <unk> close <unk> of this planet as it speeds on its annual revolution .
now can we , i demand , fashion for ourselves any <name> so distinct of this ideal <unk> spiritual exaltation , as that involved in the supposition that , even by this immeasurable mass of matter , whirled immediately before his eyes , with a velocity so unutterable , <unk> <unk> though he <unk> not at once struck into nothingness and overwhelmed ?
at this point , however , it seems proper to suggest that , in fact , we have been speaking of comparative trifles .
our sun , the central and controlling orb of the system to which jupiter belongs , is not only greater than jupiter , but greater by far than all the planets of the system taken together .
this fact is an essential condition , indeed , of the stability of the system itself .
the diameter of jupiter has been mentioned : <unk> is <unk> miles : —that of the sun is <unk> miles .
an inhabitant of the latter , travelling 90 miles a day , would be more than 80 years in going round a great circle of its circumference .
it occupies a cubical space of 681 <unk> , 472 <unk> of miles .
the moon , as has been stated , revolves about the earth at a distance of <unk> <unk> an orbit , consequently , of nearly a million and a half .
now , were the sun placed upon the earth , centre over centre , the body of the former would extend , in every direction , not only to the line of the <unk> orbit , but beyond it , a distance of <unk> miles .
and here , once again , let me suggest that , in fact , we have still been speaking of comparative trifles .
the distance of the planet neptune from the sun has been stated : <unk> is 28 hundred millions of miles ; the circumference of its orbit , therefore , is about 17 billions .
let this be borne in mind while we glance at some one of the brightest stars .
between this and the <name> of our system , ( the sun , ) there is a gulf of space , to convey any idea of which we should need the tongue of an archangel .
from our system , then , and from our sun , or <name> , the <name> at which we suppose ourselves glancing is a thing altogether apart : <unk> , for the moment , let us imagine it placed upon our sun , centre over centre , as we just now imagined this sun itself placed upon the earth .
let us now conceive the particular <name> we have in mind , extending , in every direction , beyond the orbit of <unk> <unk> the earth : <unk> on , beyond the orbit of <unk> <unk> <unk> , finally , we fancy it filling the <unk> billions of miles in <unk> is described by the revolution of <unk> planet .
when we have conceived all this , we shall have entertained no extravagant <name> .
there is the very best reason for believing that many of the stars are even far larger than the one we have imagined .
i mean to say that we have the very best <unk> basis for such belief : —and , in looking back at the original , atomic arrangements for diversity , which have been assumed as a part of the divine plan in the constitution of the universe , we shall be enabled easily to understand , and to credit , the existence of even far vaster <unk> in <unk> size than any to which i have hitherto alluded .
the largest orbs , of course , we must expect to find rolling through the widest vacancies of space .
i remarked , just now , that to convey an idea of the interval between our sun and any one of the other stars , we should require the eloquence of an archangel .
in so saying , i should not be accused of exaggeration ; for , in simple truth , these are topics on which it is scarcely possible to exaggerate .
but let us bring the matter more distinctly before the eye of the mind .
in the first place , we may get a general , relative <name> of the interval referred to , by comparing it with the <unk> spaces .
if , for example , we suppose the earth , which is , in reality , 95 millions of miles from the sun , to be only one foot from that <unk> ; then neptune would be 40 feet distant ; and the <name> <name> <unk> , at the very least , 159 .
now i presume that , in the termination of my last sentence , few of my readers have noticed anything especially <unk> wrong .
i said that the distance of the earth from the sun being taken at one foot , the distance of neptune would be 40 feet , and that of <name> <unk> , 159 .
the proportion between one foot and 159 has appeared , perhaps , to convey a sufficiently definite impression of the proportion between the two <unk> of the earth from the sun and that of <name> <unk> from the same <unk> .
but my account of the matter should , in reality , have run thus : —the distance of the earth from the sun being taken at one foot , the distance of neptune would be 40 feet , and that of <name> <unk> , <unk> : —that is to say , i had assigned to <name> <unk> , in my first statement of the case , only the <unk> part of that distance which is the least distance possible at which it can actually lie .
to proceed : <unk> distant a mere planet is , yet when we look at it through a telescope , we see it under a certain <unk> a certain appreciable size .
now i have already hinted at the probable bulk of many of the stars ; nevertheless , when we view any one of them , even through the most powerful telescope , it is found to present us with no form , and consequently with no magnitude whatever .
we see it as a point and nothing more .
again ; <unk> us suppose ourselves walking , at night , on a highway .
in a field on one side of the road , is a line of tall objects , say trees , the figures of which are distinctly defined against the background of the sky .
this line of objects extends at right angles to the road , and from the road to the horizon .
now , as we proceed along the road , we see these objects changing their positions , respectively , in relation to a certain fixed point in that portion of the firmament which forms the background of the view .
let us suppose this fixed <unk> fixed for our <unk> be the rising moon .
we become aware , at once , that while the tree nearest us so far alters its position in respect to the moon , as to seem flying behind us , the tree in the extreme distance has scarcely changed at all its relative position with the satellite .
we then go on to perceive that the farther the objects are from us , the less they alter their positions ; and the converse .
then we begin , unwittingly , to estimate the distances of individual trees by the degrees in which they evince the relative alteration .
finally , we come to understand how it might be possible to ascertain the actual distance of any given tree in the line , by using the amount of relative alteration as a basis in a simple geometrical problem .
now this relative alteration is what we call <unk> ; ” and by <unk> we calculate the distances of the heavenly bodies .
applying the principle to the trees in question , we should , of course , be very much at a loss to comprehend the distance of that tree , which , however far we proceeded along the road , should evince no <unk> at all .
this , in the case described , is a thing impossible ; but impossible only because all distances on our earth are trivial indeed : —in comparison with the vast <unk> quantities , we may speak of them as absolutely nothing .
now , let us suppose the <name> <name> <unk> directly overhead ; and let us imagine that , instead of standing on the earth , we stand at one end of a straight road stretching through space to a distance equalling the diameter of the <unk> <unk> is to say , to a distance of 190 millions of miles .
having observed , by means of the most delicate <unk> instruments , the exact position of the <name> , let us now pass along this inconceivable road , until we reach its other extremity .
now , once again , let us look at the <name> .
it is precisely where we left it .
our instruments , however delicate , assure us that its relative position is <unk> identically the same as at the commencement of our unutterable journey .
no <unk> <unk> been found .
the fact is , that , in regard to the distance of the fixed <unk> any one of the myriads of suns glistening on the farther side of that awful chasm which separates our system from its brothers in the cluster to which it <unk> science , until very lately , could speak only with a negative certainty .
assuming the brightest as the nearest , we could say , even of them , only that there is a certain incomprehensible distance on the hither side of which they can not be : <unk> far they are beyond it we had in no case been able to ascertain .
we perceived , for example , that <name> <unk> can not be nearer to us than 19 <unk> , 200 billions of miles ; but , for all we knew , and indeed for all we now know , it may be distant from us the square , or the cube , or any other power of the number mentioned .
by dint , however , of wonderfully minute and cautious observations , continued , with novel instruments , for many laborious years , <unk> , not long ago deceased , has lately succeeded in determining the distance of six or seven stars ; among others , that of the <name> numbered 61 in the constellation of the swan .
the distance in this latter instance ascertained , is <unk> times that of the sun ; which last it <name> be remembered , is 95 millions of miles .
the <name> 61 <unk> , then , is nearly 64 <unk> of miles from <unk> more than three times the distance assigned , as the least possible , for <name> <unk> .
in attempting to appreciate this interval by the aid of any considerations of velocity , as we did in endeavoring to estimate the distance of the moon , we must leave out of sight , altogether , such <unk> as the speed of a cannon-ball , or of sound .
light , however , according to the latest calculations of <unk> , proceeds at the rate of <unk> miles in a second .
thought itself can not pass through this interval more <unk> , indeed , thought can traverse it at all .
yet , in coming from 61 <unk> to us , even at this inconceivable rate , light occupies more than ten years ; and , consequently , were the <name> this moment blotted out from the universe , still , for ten years , would it continue to <name> on , <unk> in its paradoxical <name> .
keeping now in mind whatever feeble <name> we may have attained of the interval between our sun and 61 <unk> , let us remember that this interval , however <unk> vast , we are permitted to consider as but the average interval among the countless host of stars composing that cluster , or <unk> , ” to which our system , as well as that of 61 <unk> , belongs .
i have , in fact , stated the case with great moderation : <unk> have excellent reason for believing 61 <unk> to be one of the nearest stars , and thus for concluding , at least for the present , that its distance from us is less than the average distance between <name> and <name> in the magnificent cluster of the milky way .
and here , once again and finally , it seems proper to suggest that even as yet we have been speaking of trifles .
ceasing to wonder at the space between <name> and <name> in our own or in any particular cluster , let us rather turn our thoughts to the intervals between cluster and cluster , in the all comprehensive cluster of the universe .
i have already said that light proceeds at the rate of <unk> miles in a <unk> is , about 10 millions of miles in a minute , or about 600 millions of miles in an hour : <unk> so far removed from us are some of the <unk> that even light , speeding with this velocity , could not and does not reach us , from those mysterious regions , in less than 3 millions of years .
this calculation , moreover , is made by the elder <unk> , and in reference merely to those comparatively proximate clusters within the scope of his own telescope .
there are <unk> , ” however , which , through the magical tube of lord <unk> , are this instant whispering in our ears the secrets of a million of ages <unk> .
in a word , the events which we behold <unk> this <unk> those <unk> the identical events which interested their inhabitants ten hundred thousand centuries ago .
in <unk> distances such as this suggestion forces upon the <unk> than upon the <unk> find , at length , a fitting climax to all hitherto frivolous considerations of quantity .
our fancies thus occupied with the <unk> distances , let us take the opportunity of referring to the difficulty which we have so often experienced , while pursuing the beaten path of astronomical reflection , in accounting for the immeasurable <unk> alluded <unk> comprehending why chasms so totally unoccupied and therefore apparently so needless , have been made to intervene between <name> and <unk> cluster and <unk> understanding , to be brief , a sufficient reason for the <unk> scale , in respect of mere space , on which the universe is seen to be constructed .
a rational cause for the <unk> , i maintain that astronomy has palpably failed to assign : —but the considerations through which , in this essay , we have proceeded step by step , enable us clearly and immediately to perceive that space and duration are one .
that the universe might endure throughout an <unk> at all commensurate with the grandeur of its component material portions and with the high majesty of its spiritual purposes , it was necessary that the original atomic diffusion be made to so inconceivable an extent as to be only not infinite .
it was required , in a word , that the stars should be gathered into <unk> from invisible <unk> from <unk> to <unk> so grow grey in giving birth and death to unspeakably numerous and complex variations of <unk> development : <unk> was required that the stars should do all <unk> have time thoroughly to accomplish all these divine <unk> the period in which all things were effecting their return into unity with a velocity accumulating in the inverse proportion of the squares of the distances at which lay the inevitable end .
throughout all this we have no difficulty in understanding the absolute accuracy of the divine adaptation .
the density of the stars , respectively , proceeds , of course , as their condensation diminishes ; condensation and <unk> keep pace with each other ; through the latter , which is the index of the former , we estimate the <unk> and spiritual development .
thus , in the density of the globes , we have the measure in which their purposes are fulfilled .
as density <unk> the divine intentions are <unk> less and still less remains to be <unk> the same <unk> we expect to find an <unk> of the end : —and thus the philosophical mind <name> easily comprehend that the divine designs in constituting the stars , advance mathematically to their fulfilment : —and more ; it <name> readily give the advance a mathematical expression ; it <name> decide that this advance is inversely proportional with the squares of the distances of all created things from the <unk> and goal of their creation .
not only is this divine adaptation , however , mathematically accurate , but there is that about it which stamps it as divine , in distinction from that which is merely the work of human <unk> .
i allude to the complete <unk> of adaptation .
for example ; in human constructions a particular cause has a particular effect ; a particular intention brings to pass a particular object ; but this is all ; we see no <unk> .
the effect does not <unk> upon the cause ; the intention does not change relations with the object .
in divine constructions the object is either design or object as we choose to regard <unk> we may take at any time a cause for an effect , or the <unk> that we can never absolutely decide which is which .
to give an instance : —in polar climates the human frame , to maintain its animal heat , requires , for combustion in the capillary system , an abundant supply of highly <unk> food , such as <unk> .
but again : —in polar climates nearly the sole food afforded man is the oil of abundant seals and whales .
now , whether is oil at hand because imperatively demanded , or the only thing demanded because the only thing to be obtained ?
it is impossible to decide .
there is an absolute <unk> of adaptation .
the pleasure which we derive from any display of human ingenuity is in the ratio of the approach to this species of <unk> .
in the construction of plot , for example , in fictitious literature , we should aim at so arranging the incidents that we shall not be able to determine , of any one of them , whether it depends from any one other or <unk> it .
in this sense , of course , perfection of plot is really , or practically , <unk> only because it is a finite intelligence that <unk> .
the plots of god are perfect .
the universe is a plot of god .
and now we have reached a point at which the intellect is forced , again , to struggle against its propensity for analogical <unk> its <unk> grasping at the infinite .
moons have been seen revolving about planets ; planets about stars ; and the poetical instinct of <unk> instinct of the symmetrical , if the symmetry be but a symmetry of surface : <unk> instinct , which the soul , not only of man but of all created beings , took up , in the beginning , from the geometrical basis of the universal <unk> us to the fancy of an endless extension of this system of cycles .
closing our eyes equally to <unk> and <unk> , we insist upon imagining a revolution of all the orbs of the galaxy about some gigantic globe which we take to be the central pivot of the whole .
each cluster in the great cluster of clusters is imagined , of course , to be similarly supplied and constructed ; while , that the <unk> may be wanting at no point , we go on to conceive these clusters themselves , again , as revolving about some still more <name> sphere ; <unk> latter , still again , with its encircling clusters , as but one of a yet more magnificent series of <unk> , <unk> about yet another orb central to <unk> orb still more unspeakably <unk> orb , let us rather say , of infinite sublimity <unk> multiplied by the infinitely sublime .
such are the conditions , continued in perpetuity , which the voice of what some people term <unk> calls upon the fancy to <unk> and the reason to contemplate , if possible , without becoming dissatisfied with the picture .
such , in general , are the interminable <unk> beyond <unk> which we have been instructed by philosophy to comprehend and to account for , at least in the best manner we can .
now and then , however , a philosopher <unk> whose <unk> takes a very determinate <unk> genius , to speak more <unk> , has a <unk> <unk> bias , doing every thing up by the <unk> us to see precisely that point out of sight , at which the revolutionary processes in question do , and of right ought to , come to an end .
it is hardly worth while , perhaps , even to sneer at the reveries of <unk> : —but much has been said , latterly , of the hypothesis of <unk> there exists , in the centre of the galaxy , a stupendous globe about which all the systems of the cluster revolve .
the period of our own , indeed , has been <unk> millions of years .
that our sun has a motion in space , independently of its rotation , and revolution about the <unk> centre of gravity , has long been suspected .
this motion , granting it to exist , would be manifested <unk> .
the stars in that <unk> region which we were leaving behind us , would , in a very long series of years , become crowded ; those in the opposite quarter , scattered .
now , by means of astronomical history , we ascertain , <unk> , that some such phænomena have occurred .
on this ground it has been declared that our system is moving to a point in the heavens diametrically opposite the <name> <unk> <unk> : —but this inference is , perhaps , the maximum to which we have any logical right .
<unk> , however , has gone so far as to designate a particular <name> , <unk> in the <unk> , as being at or about the very spot around which a general revolution is performed .
now , since by <unk> we are led , in the first instance , to these dreams , it is no more than proper that we should abide by analogy , at least in some measure , during their development ; and that analogy which suggests the revolution , suggests at the same time a central orb about which it should be performed : <unk> far the astronomer was consistent .
this central orb , however , should , <unk> , be greater than all the orbs , taken together , which surround it .
of these there are about 100 millions .
“why , then , ” it was of course demanded , “do we not see this vast central <unk> least equal in mass to 100 millions of such suns as <unk> do we not see <unk> , especially , who occupy the mid region of the <unk> very locality near which , at all events , must be situated this incomparable <name> ? ” the reply was <unk> must be <unk> , as are our <unk> here , then , to suit a purpose , analogy is suddenly let fall .
“not so , ” it may be <unk> know that <unk> suns actually <unk> it is true that we have reason at least for supposing so ; but we have certainly no reason whatever for supposing that the <unk> suns in question are encircled by luminous suns , while these again are surrounded by <unk> planets : —and it is precisely all this with which <unk> is called upon to find any thing analogous in the <unk> it is precisely all this which he imagines in the case of the galaxy .
admitting the thing to be so , we can not help here picturing to ourselves how sad a puzzle the why it is so must prove to all à priori philosophers .
but granting , in the very teeth of analogy and of every thing else , the <unk> of the vast central orb , we may still inquire how this orb , so enormous , could fail of being rendered visible by the flood of light thrown upon it from the 100 millions of glorious suns glaring in all directions about it .
upon the urging of this question , the idea of an actually solid central sun appears , in some measure , to have been abandoned ; and speculation proceeded to assert that the systems of the cluster perform their revolutions merely about an immaterial centre of gravity common to all .
here again then , to suit a purpose , analogy is let fall .
the planets of our system revolve , it is true , about a common centre of gravity ; but they do this in connexion with , and in consequence of , a material sun whose mass more than <unk> the rest of the system .
the mathematical circle is a curve composed of an infinity of straight lines .
but this idea of the <unk> idea which , in view of all ordinary geometry , is merely the mathematical , as <unk> from the practical , <unk> , in sober fact , the practical <name> which alone we have any right to entertain in regard to the majestic circle with which we have to deal , at least in fancy , when we suppose our system revolving about a point in the centre of the galaxy .
let the most vigorous of human imaginations attempt but to take a single step towards the comprehension of a sweep so ineffable !
it would scarcely be paradoxical to say that a flash of lightning itself , travelling forever upon the circumference of this unutterable circle , would still , forever , be travelling in a straight line .
that the path of our sun in such an orbit would , to any human perception , deviate in the slightest degree from a straight line , even in a million of years , is a proposition not to be entertained : <unk> we are required to believe that a curvature has become apparent during the brief period of our astronomical <unk> a mere <unk> the utter nothingness of two or three thousand years .
it may be said that <unk> has really ascertained a curvature in the direction of our <unk> now well-established progress through space .
admitting , if necessary , this fact to be in reality such , i maintain that nothing is thereby shown except the reality of this <unk> fact of a curvature .
for its thorough determination , ages <name> be required ; and , when determined , it <name> be found indicative of some <unk> or other multiple relation between our sun and some one or more of the proximate stars .
i hazard nothing however , in <unk> , that , after the lapse of many centuries , all efforts at determining the path of our sun through space , <name> be abandoned as fruitless .
this is easily conceivable when we look at the infinity of <unk> it must experience , from its <unk> relations with other orbs , in the common approach of all to the nucleus of the galaxy .
but in examining other <unk> than that of the milky <unk> surveying , generally , the clusters which overspread the <unk> we or do we not find confirmation of <unk> hypothesis ?
we do not .
the forms of the clusters are exceedingly diverse when casually viewed ; but on close inspection , through powerful telescopes , we recognize the sphere , very distinctly , as at least the proximate form of all : <unk> constitution , in general , being at variance with the idea of revolution about a common centre .
“it is difficult , ” says sir <name> <unk> , “to form any <name> of the <unk> state of such systems .
on one hand , without a <unk> motion and a centrifugal force , it is hardly possible not to regard them as in a state of progressive collapse .
on the other , granting such a motion and such a force , we find it no less difficult to reconcile their forms with the rotation of the whole system [ meaning cluster ] around any single axis , without which internal collision would appear to be <unk> some remarks lately made about the <unk> by dr. <name> , in taking quite a different view of the <unk> conditions from any taken in this <unk> a very peculiar <unk> to the point now at issue .
he says : “when our greatest telescopes are brought to bear upon them , we find that those which were thought to be irregular , are not so ; they approach nearer to a globe .
here is one that looked oval ; but lord <unk> telescope brought it into a circle ... . now there occurs a very remarkable circumstance in reference to these comparatively sweeping circular masses of <unk> .
we find they are not entirely circular , but the reverse ; and that all around them , on every side , there are volumes of stars , stretching out apparently as if they were rushing towards a great central mass in consequence of the action of some great <unk> [ 12 ] [ 12 ] i must be understood as denying , especially , only the revolutionary portion of <unk> hypothesis .
of course , if no great central orb exists now in our cluster , such <name> exist hereafter .
whenever existing , it <name> be merely the nucleus of the consolidation .
were i to describe , in my own words , what must necessarily be the existing condition of each <unk> on the hypothesis that all matter is , as i suggest , now returning to its original unity , i should simply be going over , nearly verbatim , the language here employed by dr. <name> , without the faintest suspicion of that stupendous truth which is the key to these nebular phænomena .
and here let me fortify my position still farther , by the voice of a greater than <unk> one , moreover , to whom all the data of <unk> have long been familiar things , carefully and thoroughly considered .
referring to the elaborate calculations of <unk> very researches which form <unk> <unk> , whose <unk> powers have never , perhaps been equalled , has the following observation : “when we regard the real , proper , or <unk> motions of the stars , we find many groups of them moving in opposite directions ; and the data as yet in hand render it not necessary , at least , to conceive that the systems composing the milky way , or the clusters , generally , composing the universe , are revolving about any particular centre unknown , whether luminous or <unk> .
it is but man’s longing for a fundamental first cause , that impels both his intellect and his fancy to the adoption of such an <unk> [ 13 ] [ 13 ] <unk> man die nicht <unk> <unk> <unk> der <unk> , so <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> ; und die <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> es <unk> <unk> nicht <unk> , <unk> , dass <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> oder <unk> der <unk> <unk> , <unk> den <unk> <unk> , sich um <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> oder <unk> <unk> <unk> .
das <unk> nach den <unk> und <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> die <unk> <unk> des <unk> , wie seine <unk> , zu <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> here alluded <unk> of <unk> groups moving in opposite <unk> quite inexplicable by <unk> idea ; but arises , as a necessary consequence , from that which forms the basis of this discourse .
while the merely general direction of each <unk> each moon , planet , <name> , or <unk> , on my hypothesis , be , of course , absolutely <unk> ; while the general path of all bodies would be a right line leading to the centre of all ; it is clear , nevertheless , that this general <unk> would be compounded of what , with scarcely any exaggeration , we may term an infinity of particular <unk> infinity of local deviations from <unk> result of continuous differences of relative position among the multitudinous masses , as each proceeded on its own proper journey to the end .
i quoted , just now , from sir <name> <unk> , the following words , used in reference to the clusters : <unk> one hand , without a <unk> motion and a centrifugal force , it is hardly possible not to regard them as in a state of progressive <unk> the fact is , that , in surveying the <unk> with a telescope of high power , we shall find it quite impossible , having once conceived this idea of <unk> , ” not to gather , at all points , <unk> of the idea .
a nucleus is always apparent , in the direction of which the stars seem to be <unk> themselves ; nor can these nuclei be mistaken for merely perspective phænomena : —the clusters are really denser near the <unk> in the regions more remote from it .
in a word , we see every thing as we should see it were a collapse taking place ; but , in general , it may be said of these clusters , that we can fairly entertain , while looking at them , the idea of <unk> movement about a centre , only by admitting the possible existence , in the distant domains of space , of <unk> laws with which we are unacquainted .
on the part of <unk> , however , there is evidently a reluctance to regard the <unk> as in “a state of progressive <unk> but if <unk> even appearances justify the supposition of their being in this state , why , it may well be demanded , is he disinclined to admit it ?
simply on account of a prejudice ; <unk> because the supposition is at war with a preconceived and utterly <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the eternal stability of the universe .
if the propositions of this discourse are <unk> , the <unk> of progressive <unk> is precisely that state in which alone we are warranted in considering all things ; and , with due humility , let me here confess that , for my part , i am at a loss to conceive how any other understanding of the existing condition of affairs , could ever have made its way into the human <name> .
“the tendency to <unk> and “the attraction of <unk> are <unk> phrases .
in using either , we speak of the rëaction of the first act .
never was necessity less obvious than that of supposing matter imbued with an ineradicable quality forming part of its material <unk> quality , or instinct , forever inseparable from it , and by dint of which inalienable principle every atom is perpetually impelled to seek its <unk> .
never was necessity less obvious than that of entertaining this <unk> idea .
going boldly behind the vulgar thought , we have to conceive , <unk> , that the <unk> principle <unk> to matter <unk> while <unk> while existing as many instead of as <unk> to it by virtue of its state of irradiation <unk> , in a word , altogether to its condition , and not in the <unk> degree to itself .
in this view , when the irradiation shall have returned into its <unk> the rëaction shall be <unk> <unk> principle <name> no longer exist .
and , in fact , astronomers , without at any time reaching the idea here suggested , seem to have been <unk> it , in the assertion that “if there were but one body in the universe , it would be impossible to understand how the principle , gravity , could obtain : <unk> is to say , from a consideration of matter as they find it , they reach a conclusion at which i <unk> arrive .
that so pregnant a suggestion as the one just quoted should have been permitted to remain so long <unk> , is , nevertheless , a mystery which i find it difficult to fathom .
it is , perhaps , in no little degree , however , our propensity for the <unk> the <unk> the present case more particularly for the <unk> has been leading us astray .
and , in fact , the sense of the symmetrical is an instinct which may be depended upon with an almost blindfold reliance .
it is the poetical essence of the <unk> the universe which , in the <unk> of its symmetry , is but the most sublime of poems .
now symmetry and consistency are <unk> terms : <unk> poetry and truth are one .
a thing is consistent in the ratio of its <unk> in the ratio of its consistency .
a perfect consistency , i repeat , can be nothing but an absolute <unk> we may take it for granted , then , that man can not long or widely err , if he suffer himself to be guided by his poetical , which i have maintained to be his truthful , in being his symmetrical , instinct .
he must have a care , however , lest , in pursuing too heedlessly the superficial symmetry of forms and motions , he leave out of sight the really essential symmetry of the principles which determine and control them .
that the <unk> bodies would finally be merged in <unk> , at last , all would be drawn into the substance of one stupendous central orb already <unk> an idea which , for some time past , seems , vaguely and <unk> , to have held possession of the fancy of mankind .
it is an idea , in fact , which belongs to the class of the excessively obvious .
it springs , instantly , from a superficial observation of the <unk> and seemingly <unk> , or <unk> movements of those individual portions of the universe which come most immediately and most closely under our observation .
there is not , perhaps , a human being , of ordinary education and of average reflective capacity , to whom , at some period , the fancy in question has not occurred , as if spontaneously , or <unk> , and wearing all the character of a very profound and very original <name> .
this <name> , however , so commonly entertained , has never , within my knowledge , arisen out of any abstract considerations .
being , on the contrary , always suggested , as i say , by the <unk> movements about centres , a reason for it , also , <unk> cause for the <unk> of all the orbs into one , imagined to be already existing , was naturally sought in the same <unk> these <unk> movements themselves .
thus it happened that , on announcement of the gradual and perfectly regular decrease observed in the orbit of <unk> comet , at every successive revolution about our sun , astronomers were nearly unanimous in the opinion that the cause in question was <unk> a principle was discovered sufficient to account , physically , for that final , universal <unk> which , i repeat , the analogical , symmetrical or poetical instinct of man had <unk> to understand as something more than a simple hypothesis .
this <unk> sufficient reason for the final <unk> declared to exist in an exceedingly rare but still material medium pervading space ; which medium , by retarding , in some degree , the progress of the comet , perpetually weakened its <unk> force ; thus giving a predominance to the centripetal ; which , of course , <name> the comet nearer and nearer at each revolution , and would eventually precipitate it upon the sun .
all this was strictly <unk> the medium or ether ; but this ether was assumed , most <unk> , on the ground that no other mode than the one spoken of could be discovered , of accounting for the observed decrease in the orbit of the comet : <unk> if from the fact that we could discover no other mode of accounting for it , it followed , in any respect , that no other mode of accounting for it existed .
it is clear that innumerable causes might operate , in combination , to diminish the orbit , without even a possibility of our ever becoming acquainted with one of them .
in the meantime , it has never been fairly shown , perhaps , why the retardation occasioned by the skirts of the <unk> atmosphere , through which the comet passes at <unk> , is not enough to account for the <unk> .
that <unk> comet <name> be absorbed into the sun , is probable ; that all the comets of the system <name> be absorbed , is more than merely possible ; but , in such case , the principle of absorption must be referred to eccentricity of <unk> the close approximation to the sun , of the comets at their <unk> ; and is a principle not affecting , in any degree , the ponderous spheres , which are to be regarded as the true material constituents of the <unk> comets , in general , let me here suggest , in passing , that we can not be far wrong in looking upon them as the <unk> of the <unk> heaven .
the idea of a retarding ether and , through it , of a final <unk> of all things , seemed at one time , however , to be confirmed by the observation of a positive decrease in the orbit of the solid moon .
by reference to <unk> recorded <unk> years ago , it was found that the velocity of the <unk> revolution then was considerably less than it is now ; that on the hypothesis that its motions in its orbit is uniformly in accordance with <unk> law , and was accurately determined <unk> years <unk> is now in advance of the position it should occupy , by nearly <unk> miles .
the increase of velocity proved , of course , a diminution of orbit ; and astronomers were fast yielding to a belief in an ether , as the sole mode of accounting for the <unk> , when <unk> came to the rescue .
he showed that , owing to the <unk> of the <unk> , the shorter axes of their ellipses are subject to variation in length ; the longer axes being permanent ; and that this variation is continuous and <unk> that every orbit is in a state of transition , either from circle to ellipse , or from ellipse to circle .
in the case of the moon , where the shorter axis is <unk> , the orbit is passing from circle to ellipse and , consequently , is <unk> too ; but , after a long series of ages , the ultimate eccentricity <name> be attained ; then the shorter axis <name> proceed to <unk> , until the orbit becomes a circle ; when the process of shortening <name> again take place ; —and so on forever .
in the case of the earth , the orbit is passing from ellipse to circle .
the facts thus demonstrated do away , of course , with all necessity for supposing an ether , and with all apprehension of the <unk> <unk> the <unk> account .
it <name> be remembered that i have myself assumed what we may term an ether .
i have spoken of a subtle influence which we know to be ever in attendance upon matter , although becoming manifest only through <unk> <unk> .
to this <unk> daring to touch it at all in any effort at explaining its awful <unk> have referred the various phænomena of electricity , heat , light , magnetism ; and <unk> vitality , consciousness , and <unk> a word , of <unk> .
it <name> be seen , at once , then , that the ether thus conceived is radically distinct from the ether of the astronomers ; inasmuch as theirs is matter and mine not .
with the idea of a material ether , seems , thus , to have departed altogether the thought of that universal <unk> so long <unk> by the poetical fancy of mankind : <unk> <unk> in which a sound philosophy might have been warranted in putting <name> , at least to a certain extent , if for no other reason than that by this poetical fancy it had been so <unk> .
but so far as <unk> far as mere physics have yet spoken , the cycles of the universe are <unk> universe has no conceivable end .
had an end been demonstrated , however , from so purely collateral a cause as an ether , man’s instinct of the divine capacity to adapt , would have rebelled against the demonstration .
we should have been forced to regard the universe with some such sense of dissatisfaction as we experience in contemplating an unnecessarily complex work of human <name> .
creation would have affected us as an imperfect plot in a romance , where the <unk> is awkwardly brought about by interposed incidents external and foreign to the main subject ; instead of springing out of the bosom of the <unk> of the heart of the ruling <unk> of arising as a result of the primary <unk> inseparable and inevitable part and parcel of the fundamental <name> of the book .
what i mean by the symmetry of mere surface <name> now be more clearly understood .
it is simply by the <unk> of this symmetry that we have been beguiled into the general idea of which <unk> hypothesis is but a <unk> idea of the <unk> <unk> of the orbs .
dismissing this <unk> physical <name> , the symmetry of principle sees the end of all things <unk> involved in the thought of a beginning ; seeks and finds in this origin of all things the rudiment of this end ; and perceives the <unk> of supposing this end likely to be brought about less <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> through the rëaction of the originating act .
recurring , then , to a previous suggestion , let us understand the <unk> us understand each <name> , with its attendant <unk> but a <unk> atom existing in space with precisely the same inclination for unity which characterized , in the beginning , the actual atoms after their irradiation throughout the universal sphere .
as these original atoms rushed towards each other in generally straight lines , so let us conceive as at least generally <unk> , the paths of the <unk> towards their respective centres of aggregation : —and in this direct drawing together of the systems into clusters , with a similar and simultaneous drawing together of the clusters themselves while undergoing consolidation , we have at length attained the great <unk> awful <unk> existing condition of the universe .
of the still more awful future a not irrational analogy may guide us in framing an hypothesis .
the equilibrium between the centripetal and centrifugal forces of each system , being necessarily destroyed upon attainment of a certain proximity to the nucleus of the cluster to which it belongs , there must occur , at once , a chaotic or seemingly chaotic precipitation , of the moons upon the planets , of the planets upon the suns , and of the suns upon the nuclei ; and the general result of this precipitation must be the gathering of the myriad <unk> stars of the firmament into an almost infinitely less number of almost infinitely superior spheres .
in being immeasurably fewer , the worlds of that day <name> be immeasurably greater than our own .
then , indeed , amid unfathomable abysses , <name> be glaring unimaginable suns .
but all this <name> be merely a <unk> magnificence <unk> the great end .
of this end the new <name> described , can be but a very partial postponement .
while undergoing consolidation , the clusters themselves , with a speed prodigiously accumulative , have been rushing towards their own general <unk> now , with a <unk> electric velocity , commensurate only with their material grandeur and with the spiritual passion of their appetite for <unk> , the majestic remnants of the tribe of stars flash , at length , into a common embrace .
the inevitable catastrophe is at hand .
but this <unk> is it ?
we have seen accomplished the <unk> of the orbs .
henceforward , are we not to understand one material globe of globes as constituting and comprehending the universe ?
such a fancy would be altogether at war with every assumption and consideration of this discourse .
i have already alluded to that absolute <unk> of adaptation which is the <unk> of the divine <unk> it divine .
up to this point of our reflections , we have been regarding the electrical influence as a something by dint of whose repulsion alone matter is enabled to exist in that state of diffusion demanded for the fulfilment of its purposes : <unk> far , in a word , we have been considering the influence in question as ordained for <unk> <unk> <unk> the objects of matter .
with a perfectly legitimate <unk> , we are now permitted to look at matter , as created solely for the sake of this <unk> to serve the objects of this spiritual ether .
through the <unk> the <unk> the agency of matter , and by dint of its <unk> this ether <unk> spirit <unk> .
it is merely in the development of this ether , through <unk> , that particular masses of matter become <unk> in the ratio of their <unk> ; <unk> reaching a degree of sensitiveness involving what we call thought and thus attaining conscious intelligence .
in this view , we are enabled to perceive matter as a <unk> as an end .
its purposes are thus seen to have been comprehended in its diffusion ; and with the return into unity these purposes cease .
the absolutely consolidated globe of globes would be <unk> : <unk> not for a moment could it continue to exist .
matter , created for an end , would unquestionably , on fulfilment of that end , be matter no longer .
let us endeavor to understand that it would disappear , and that god would remain all in all .
that every work of divine <name> must <unk> and <unk> with its particular design , seems to me especially obvious ; and i make no doubt that , on perceiving the final globe of globes to be <unk> , the majority of my readers <name> be satisfied with my <unk> it can not continue to <unk> nevertheless , as the startling thought of its instantaneous disappearance is one which the most powerful intellect can not be expected readily to entertain on grounds so decidedly abstract , let us endeavor to look at the idea from some other and more ordinary point of view : <unk> us see how thoroughly and beautifully it is corroborated in an à <unk> consideration of matter as we actually find it .
i have before said that <unk> and repulsion being <unk> the sole properties by which matter is manifested to mind , we are justified in assuming that matter exists only as attraction and <unk> other words that attraction and repulsion are matter ; there being no conceivable case in which we may not employ the term matter and the terms <unk> and <unk> taken together , as equivalent , and therefore <unk> , expressions in <unk> [ 14 ] [ 14 ] <name> 37 .
now the very definition of attraction implies <unk> existence of parts , particles , or atoms ; for we define it as the tendency of <unk> atom & c. to every other <unk> & c. according to a certain law .
of course where there are no <unk> there is absolute <unk> the tendency to <unk> is <unk> can be no attraction : <unk> has been fully shown , and all philosophy admits it .
when , on fulfilment of its purposes , then , matter shall have returned into its original condition of <unk> condition which <unk> the expulsion of the <unk> ether , whose province and whose capacity are limited to keeping the atoms apart until that great day when , this ether being no longer needed , the overwhelming pressure of the finally collective attraction shall at length just sufficiently <unk> [ 15 ] and expel it : <unk> , i say , matter , finally , <unk> the ether , shall have returned into absolute unity , <unk> <name> then ( to speak paradoxically for the moment ) be matter without attraction and without <unk> other words , matter without <unk> other words , again , matter no more .
in sinking into unity , it <name> sink at once into that nothingness which , to all finite perception , unity must <unk> that material <unk> from which alone we can conceive it to have been <unk> have been created by the volition of god .
[ 15 ] <unk> , therefore , must be the strongest of <unk> <name> 39 .
i repeat <unk> us endeavor to comprehend that the final globe of globes <name> instantaneously disappear , and that god <name> remain all in all .
but are we here to pause ?
not so .
on the universal <unk> and dissolution , we can readily conceive that a new and perhaps totally different series of conditions may <unk> creation and irradiation , returning into <unk> action and rëaction of the divine <name> .
guiding our imaginations by that <unk> law of laws , the law of <unk> , are we not , indeed , more than justified in entertaining a <unk> us say , rather , in indulging a <unk> the processes we have here ventured to contemplate <name> be renewed forever , and forever , and forever ; a novel universe swelling into existence , and then subsiding into nothingness , at every throb of the heart divine ?
and <unk> heart <unk> is it ?
it is our <unk> let not the merely seeming irreverence of this idea frighten our souls from that cool exercise of <unk> that deep tranquillity of <unk> which alone we can <name> to attain the presence of this , the most sublime of truths , and look it leisurely in the face .
the phænomena on which our conclusions must at this point depend , are merely spiritual shadows , but not the less thoroughly substantial .
we walk about , amid the destinies of our <unk> , encompassed by dim but ever present memories of a <name> more <unk> distant in the <unk> time , and infinitely awful .
we live out a youth peculiarly haunted by such dreams ; yet never mistaking them for dreams .
as memories we know them .
during our youth the distinction is too clear to deceive us even for a moment .
so long as this youth endures , the feeling that we exist , is the most natural of all feelings .
we understand it thoroughly .
that there was a period at which we did not <unk> , that it might so have happened that we never had existed at <unk> the considerations , indeed , which during this youth , we find difficulty in understanding .
why we should not exist , is , up to the epoch of our manhood , of all queries the most unanswerable .
<unk> from all time and to all <unk> , up to the epoch of manhood , a normal and unquestionable condition : <unk> , because it is .
but now comes the period at which a conventional <unk> awakens us from the truth of our dream .
doubt , surprise and <unk> arrive at the same moment .
they say : <unk> live and the time was when you lived not .
you have been created .
an intelligence exists greater than your own ; and it is only through this intelligence you live at <unk> these things we struggle to comprehend and can not : <unk> , because these things , being untrue , are thus , of necessity , incomprehensible .
no thinking being lives who , at some luminous point of his life of thought , has not felt himself lost amid the surges of futile efforts at understanding , or believing , that anything exists greater than his own soul .
the utter impossibility of any <unk> soul feeling itself inferior to another ; the intense , overwhelming dissatisfaction and rebellion at the thought ; <unk> , with the <unk> aspirations at perfection , are but the spiritual , coincident with the material , struggles towards the original <unk> , to my mind at least , a species of proof far surpassing what man terms demonstration , that no one soul is inferior to <unk> nothing is , or can be , superior to any one <unk> each soul is , in part , its own <unk> own creator : —in a word , that <unk> material and spiritual <unk> exists solely in the diffused matter and spirit of the universe ; and that the <unk> of this diffused matter and spirit <name> be but the <unk> of the purely spiritual and individual god .
in this view , and in this view alone , we comprehend the riddles of divine <unk> inexorable fate .
in this view alone the existence of evil becomes intelligible ; but in this view it becomes <unk> becomes <unk> .
our souls no longer rebel at a sorrow which we ourselves have imposed upon ourselves , in furtherance of our own <unk> a <unk> even with a futile <unk> the extension of our own <name> .
i have spoken of memories that haunt us during our youth .
they sometimes pursue us even in our manhood : <unk> gradually less and less indefinite shapes : <unk> and then speak to us with low voices , saying : “there was an epoch in the night of time , when a <unk> being <unk> of an absolutely infinite number of similar beings that people the absolutely infinite domains of the absolutely infinite space .
[ 16 ] it was not and is not in the power of this <unk> more than it is in your <unk> extend , by actual increase , the <name> of his existence ; but just as it is in your power to expand or to concentrate your pleasures ( the absolute amount of happiness remaining always the same ) so did and does a similar capability <unk> to this divine being , who thus passes his eternity in perpetual variation of concentrated self and almost infinite <unk> .
what you call the universe is but his present expansive existence .
he now feels his life through an infinity of imperfect <unk> partial and <unk> pleasures of those inconceivably numerous things which you designate as his creatures , but which are really but infinite <unk> of himself .
all these <unk> which you term animate , as well as those to whom you deny life for no better reason than that you do not behold it in <unk> these creatures have , in a greater or less degree , a capacity for pleasure and for pain : <unk> the general sum of their sensations is precisely that amount of happiness which <unk> by right to the divine being when concentrated within himself .
these creatures are all , too , more or less conscious <unk> ; conscious , first , of a proper identity ; conscious , secondly and by faint indeterminate glimpses , of an identity with the divine being of whom we <unk> an identity with god .
of the two classes of consciousness , fancy that the former <name> grow weaker , the latter stronger , during the long succession of ages which must elapse before these myriads of individual <unk> become <unk> the bright stars become <unk> one .
think that the sense of individual identity <name> be gradually merged in the general <unk> man , for example , ceasing imperceptibly to feel himself man , <name> at length attain that awfully triumphant epoch when he shall recognize his existence as that of jehovah .
in the meantime bear in mind that all is <unk> within <unk> less within the greater , and all within the spirit <unk> [ 16 ] see pages <unk> commencing “i reply that the right , ” and ending <unk> and particular <unk> the end .

the cask of amontillado by <name> <name> poe the thousand injuries of fortunato i had borne as i best could , but when he ventured upon insult , i vowed revenge .
you , who so well know the nature of my soul , <name> not suppose , however , that i gave utterance to a threat .
at length i would be avenged ; this was a point definitely settled  but the very <unk> with which it was resolved , <unk> the idea of risk .
i must not only punish , but punish with impunity .
a wrong is <unk> when retribution <unk> its <unk> .
it is equally <unk> when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong .
it must be understood that neither by word nor deed had i given fortunato cause to doubt my good <name> .
i continued , as was my wont , to smile in his face , and he did not perceive that my smile now was at the thought of his <unk> .
he had a weak point  this fortunato  although in other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared .
he prided himself on his <unk> in wine .
few italians have the true <unk> spirit .
for the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunity  to practise imposture upon the british and austrian millionaires .
in painting and <unk> , fortunato , like his countrymen , was a quack  but in the matter of old wines he was sincere .
in this respect i did not differ from him materially : i was skillful in the italian <unk> myself , and bought largely whenever i could .
it was about dusk , one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season , that i encountered my friend .
he accosted me with excessive warmth , for he had been drinking much .
the man wore motley .
he had on a <unk> <unk> dress , and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells .
i was so pleased to see him , that i thought i should never have done wringing his hand .
i said to him  " my dear fortunato , you are luckily met .
how remarkably well you are looking to-day !
but i have received a pipe of what passes for amontillado , and i have my doubts . "
" how ? "
said he .
" amontillado ?
a pipe ?
impossible !
and in the middle of the carnival ! "
" i have my doubts , " i replied ; " and i was silly enough to pay the full amontillado price without consulting you in the matter .
you were not to be found , and i was fearful of losing a bargain . "
" amontillado ! "
" i have my doubts . "
" amontillado ! "
" and i must satisfy them . "
" amontillado ! "
" as you are engaged , i am on my way to <unk> .
if any one has a critical turn , it is he .
he <name> tell me  " " <unk> can not tell amontillado from <name> . "
" and yet some fools <name> have it that his taste is a match for your own . "
" come , let us go . "
" whither ? "
" to your vaults . "
" my friend , no ; i <name> not impose upon your good nature .
i perceive you have an engagement .
<unk>  " " i have no engagement ;  come . "
" my friend , no .
it is not the engagement , but the severe cold with which i perceive you are afflicted .
the vaults are <unk> damp .
they are encrusted with nitre . "
" let us go , nevertheless .
the cold is merely nothing .
amontillado !
you have been imposed upon .
and as for <unk> , he can not distinguish <name> from amontillado . "
thus speaking , fortunato possessed himself of my arm .
putting on a mask of black silk , and drawing a <unk> closely about my person , i suffered him to hurry me to my <unk> .
there were no attendants at home ; they had <unk> to make <name> in honour of the time .
i had told them that i should not return until the morning , and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house .
these orders were sufficient , i well knew , to insure their immediate disappearance , one and all , as soon as my back was turned .
i took from their <unk> two <unk> , and giving one to fortunato , bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into the vaults .
i passed down a long and winding staircase , requesting him to be cautious as he followed .
we came at length to the foot of the descent , and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the <unk> .
the gait of my friend was unsteady , and the bells upon his cap jingled as he strode .
" the pipe , " said he .
" it is farther on , " said i ; " but observe the white <unk> which gleams from these cavern walls . "
he turned towards me , and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that distilled the <unk> of intoxication .
" nitre ? "
he asked , at length .
" nitre , " i replied .
" how long have you had that cough ? "
" ugh !
ugh !
ugh !  ugh !
ugh !
ugh !  ugh !
ugh !
ugh !  ugh !
ugh !
ugh !  ugh !
ugh !
ugh ! "
my poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes .
" it is nothing , " he said , at last .
" come , " i said , with decision , " we <name> go back ; your health is precious .
you are <name> , respected , admired , beloved ; you are happy , as once i was .
you are a man to be missed .
for me it is no matter .
we <name> go back ; you <name> be ill , and i can not be responsible .
besides , there is <unk>  " " enough , " he said ; " the cough is a mere nothing ; it <name> not kill me .
i shall not die of a cough . "
" true  true , " i replied ; " and , indeed , i had no intention of alarming you unnecessarily  but you should use all proper caution .
a draught of this <unk> <name> defend us from the <unk> . "
here i knocked off the neck of a bottle which i <name> from a long row of its fellows that lay upon the mould .
" drink , " i said , presenting him the wine .
he raised it to his lips with a leer .
he paused and nodded to me familiarly , while his bells jingled .
" i drink , " he said , " to the buried that repose around us . "
" and i to your long life . "
he again took my arm , and we proceeded .
" these vaults , " he said , " are extensive . "
" the <unk> , " i replied , " were a great and numerous family . "
" i forget your arms . "
" a huge human foot <unk> , in a field azure ; the foot <unk> a serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel . "
" and the motto ? "
" <unk> me <unk> <unk> . "
" good ! "
he said .
the wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled .
my own fancy grew warm with the <unk> .
we had passed through walls of piled bones , with casks and <unk> <unk> , into the inmost recesses of catacombs .
i paused again , and this time i made bold to seize fortunato by an arm above the elbow .
" the nitre ! "
i said ; " see , it increases .
it hangs like moss upon the vaults .
we are below the river 's bed .
the drops of moisture trickle among the bones .
come , we <name> go back ere it is too late .
your cough  " " it is nothing , " he said ; " let us go on .
but first , another draught of the <unk> . "
i broke and reached him a <unk> of de grave .
he emptied it at a breath .
his eyes flashed with a fierce light .
he laughed and threw the bottle upwards with a <unk> i did not understand .
i looked at him in surprise .
he repeated the movement  a grotesque one .
" you do not comprehend ? "
he said .
" not i , " i replied .
" then you are not of the brotherhood . "
" how ? "
" you are not of the masons . "
" yes , yes , " i said ; " yes , yes . "
" you ?
impossible !
a <name> ? "
" a <name> , " i replied .
" a sign , " he said , " a sign . "
" it is this , " i answered , producing a trowel from beneath the folds of my <unk> .
" you jest , " he exclaimed , <unk> a few paces .
" but let us proceed to the amontillado . "
" be it so , " i said , replacing the tool beneath the cloak and again offering him my arm .
he leaned upon it heavily .
we continued our route in search of the amontillado .
we passed through a range of low arches , descended , passed on , and descending again , arrived at a deep crypt , in which the <unk> of the air caused our <unk> rather to glow than flame .
at the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less spacious .
its walls had been lined with human remains , piled to the vault overhead , in the fashion of the great catacombs of <name> .
three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner .
from the fourth side the bones had been thrown down , and lay promiscuously upon the earth , forming at one point a mound of some size .
within the wall thus exposed by the <unk> of the bones , we perceived a still interior recess , in depth about four feet in width three , in height six or seven .
it seemed to have been constructed for no especial use within itself , but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs , and was backed by one of their <unk> walls of solid granite .
it was in vain that fortunato , uplifting his dull torch , endeavoured to pry into the depth of the recess .
its termination the feeble light did not enable us to see .
" proceed , " i said ; " herein is the amontillado .
as for <unk>  " " he is an <unk> , " interrupted my friend , as he stepped unsteadily forward , while i followed immediately at his heels .
in an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche , and finding his progress arrested by the rock , stood stupidly bewildered .
a moment more and i had fettered him to the granite .
in its surface were two iron <unk> , distant from each other about two feet , horizontally .
from one of these depended a short chain , from the other a <unk> .
throwing the links about his waist , it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it .
he was too much astounded to resist .
withdrawing the key i stepped back from the recess .
" pass your hand , " i said , " over the wall ; you can not help feeling the nitre .
indeed , it is very damp .
once more let me implore you to return .
no ?
then i must positively leave you .
but i must first render you all the little attentions in my power . "
" the amontillado ! "
ejaculated my friend , not yet recovered from his astonishment .
" true , " i replied ; " the amontillado . "
as i said these words i busied myself among the pile of bones of which i have before spoken .
throwing them aside , i soon uncovered a quantity of building stone and mortar .
with these materials and with the aid of my trowel , i began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche .
i had scarcely laid the first tier of the masonry when i discovered that the intoxication of fortunato had in a great measure worn off .
the earliest indication i had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth of the recess .
it was not the cry of a drunken man .
there was then a long and obstinate silence .
i laid the second tier , and the third , and the fourth ; and then i heard the furious vibrations of the chain .
the noise lasted for several minutes , during which , that i might hearken to it with the more satisfaction , i ceased my labours and sat down upon the bones .
when at last the clanking subsided , i resumed the trowel , and finished without interruption the fifth , the sixth , and the seventh tier .
the wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast .
i again paused , and holding the <unk> over the <unk> , threw a few feeble rays upon the figure within .
a succession of loud and shrill screams , bursting suddenly from the throat of the chained form , seemed to thrust me violently back .
for a brief moment i hesitated  i trembled .
<unk> my <unk> , i began to grope with it about the recess ; but the thought of an instant reassured me .
i placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs , and felt satisfied .
i <unk> the wall ; i replied to the yells of him who clamoured .
i <unk>  i aided  i surpassed them in volume and in strength .
i did this , and the <unk> grew still .
it was now midnight , and my task was drawing to a close .
i had completed the eighth , the ninth , and the tenth tier .
i had finished a portion of the last and the eleventh ; there remained but a single stone to be fitted and plastered in .
i struggled with its weight ; i placed it partially in its destined position .
but now there came from out the niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head .
it was succeeded by a sad voice , which i had difficulty in recognizing as that of the <name> fortunato .
the voice said  " <name> !
<name> !
<name> !  he !
he !
he !  a very good joke indeed  an excellent jest .
we shall have many a <name> laugh about it at the <unk>  he !
he !
he !  over our wine  he !
he !
he ! "
" the amontillado ! "
i said .
" he !
he !
he !  he !
he !
he !  yes , the amontillado .
but is it not getting late ?
<name> not they be awaiting us at the <unk> , the <name> fortunato and the rest ?
let us be gone . "
" yes , " i said , " let us be gone . "
" for the love of god , <unk> !  " " yes , " i said , " for the love of god ! "
but to these words i <unk> in vain for a reply .
i grew impatient .
i called aloud  " fortunato ! "
no answer .
i called again  " fortunato  " no answer still .
i thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let it fall within .
there came forth in reply only a jingling of the bells .
my heart grew sick on account of the dampness of the catacombs .
i hastened to make an end of my labour .
i forced the last stone into its position ; i plastered it up .
against the new masonry i <unk> the old rampart of bones .
for the half of a century no mortal has disturbed them .
in pace <unk> ! 
the fall of the house of usher son <unk> est <name> <unk> <unk> ; <unk> <unk> <name> <unk> il <unk> .
de <unk> .
during the whole of a dull , dark , and <unk> day in the autumn of the year , when the clouds <name> <unk> low in the heavens , i had been passing alone , on horseback , through a singularly dreary tract of country ; and at length found myself , as the shades of the evening <name> on , within view of the melancholy house of usher .
i know not how it was  but , with the first glimpse of the building , a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit .
i say insufferable ; for the feeling was <unk> by any of that <unk> , because poetic , sentiment , with which the mind usually receives even the <unk> natural images of the desolate or terrible .
i looked upon the scene before me  upon the mere house , and the simple landscape features of the domain  upon the bleak walls  upon the vacant <unk> windows  upon a few rank <unk>  and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees  with an utter depression of soul which i can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the <unk> of the <unk> upon opium  the bitter lapse into everyday life  the hideous dropping off of the veil .
there was an <unk> , a sinking , a sickening of the heart  an <unk> <unk> of thought which no <unk> of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime .
what was it  i paused to think  what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the house of usher ?
it was a mystery all insoluble ; nor could i grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as i pondered .
i was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion , that while , beyond doubt , there are combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us , still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth .
it was possible , i reflected , that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene , of the details of the picture , would be sufficient to modify , or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression ; and , acting upon this idea , i reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling , and gazed down  but with a shudder even more thrilling than before  upon the <unk> and inverted images of the grey <unk> , and the ghastly <unk> , and the vacant and <unk> windows .
nevertheless , in this mansion of gloom i now proposed to myself a sojourn of some weeks .
its proprietor , <name> usher , had been one of my boon companions in boyhood ; but many years had elapsed since our last meeting .
a letter , however , had lately reached me in a distant part of the country  a letter from him  which , in its wildly importunate nature , had admitted of no other than a personal reply .
the ms gave evidence of nervous agitation .
the writer spoke of acute bodily illness  of a mental disorder which oppressed him  and of an <name> <name> to see me , as his best , and indeed his only personal friend , with a view of attempting , by the cheerfulness of my society , some <unk> of his malady .
it was the manner in which all this , and much more , was said  it was the apparent heart that went with his request  which allowed me no room for hesitation ; and i accordingly obeyed forthwith what i still considered a very singular summons .
although , as boys , we had been even intimate associates , yet i really knew little of my friend .
his reserve had been always excessive and habitual .
i was aware , however , that his very ancient family had been noted , time out of mind , for a peculiar sensibility of temperament , displaying itself , through long ages , in many works of exalted <name> , and manifested , of late , in repeated deeds of <unk> yet unobtrusive <name> , as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies , perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties of musical science .
i had learned , too , the very remarkable fact , that the stem of the usher race , all <unk> as it was , had put forth , at no period , any enduring branch ; in other words , that the entire family lay in the direct line of descent , and had always , with very trifling and very temporary variation , so lain .
it was this deficiency , i considered , while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with the <unk> character of the people , and while speculating upon the possible influence which the one , in the long lapse of centuries , might have exercised upon the other  it was this deficiency , perhaps , of collateral issue , and the consequent <unk> transmission , from sire to son , of the <unk> with the name , which had , at length , so identified the two as to <unk> the original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the " house of usher "  an appellation which seemed to include , in the minds of the peasantry who used it , both the family and the family mansion .
i have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment  that of looking down within the tarn  had been to deepen the first singular impression .
there can be no doubt that the consciousness of the rapid increase of my <unk>  for why should i not so term it ?  served mainly to <unk> the increase itself .
such , i have long known , is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a basis .
and it might have been for this reason only , that , when i again uplifted my eyes to the house itself , from its image in the pool , there grew in my mind a strange fancy  a fancy so ridiculous , indeed , that i but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me .
i had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain there <name> an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity  an atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven , but which had reeked up from the decayed trees , and the grey wall , and the silent tarn  a <unk> and mystic vapour , dull , sluggish , faintly discernible , and <unk> .
shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream , i scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building .
its principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity .
the <unk> of ages had been great .
minute <unk> overspread the whole exterior , hanging in a fine tangled <unk> from the eaves .
yet all this was apart from any extraordinary <unk> .
no portion of the masonry had fallen ; and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts , and the crumbling condition of the individual stones .
in this there was much that reminded me of the <unk> <unk> of old <unk> which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault , with no disturbance from the breath of the external air .
beyond this indication of extensive decay , however , the fabric gave little token of instability .
perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have discovered a barely perceptible fissure , which , extending from the roof of the building in front , made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction , until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn .
noticing these things , i rode over a short causeway to the house .
a servant in waiting took my horse , and i entered the gothic archway of the hall .
a valet , of stealthy step , thence conducted me , in silence , through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio of his master .
much that i encountered on the way contributed , i know not how , to heighten the vague sentiments of which i have already spoken .
while the objects around me  while the carvings of the ceilings , the sombre tapestries of the walls , the <unk> blackness of the floors , and the <unk> <unk> trophies which rattled as i strode , were but matters to which , or to such as which , i had been accustomed from my infancy  while i hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all this  i still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up .
on one of the staircases , i met the physician of the family .
his countenance , i thought , wore a mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity .
he accosted me with trepidation and passed on .
the valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master .
the room in which i found myself was very large and lofty .
the windows were long , narrow , and pointed , and at so vast a dis <unk> from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within .
feeble gleams of <unk> light made their way through the <unk> panes , and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects around ; the eye , however , struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber , or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling .
dark draperies <name> upon the walls .
the general furniture was profuse , comfortless , antique , and tattered .
many books and musical instruments lay scattered about , but failed to give any vitality to the scene .
i felt that i breathed an atmosphere of sorrow .
an air of stern , deep , and <unk> gloom <name> over and pervaded all .
upon my entrance , usher rose from a sofa on which he had been lying at full length , and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it , i at first thought , of an overdone cordiality  of the constrained effort of the <unk> man of the world .
a glance , however , at his countenance , convinced me of his perfect sincerity .
we sat down ; and for some moments , while he spoke not , i gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity , half of awe .
surely , man had never before so terribly altered , in so brief a period , as had <name> usher !
it was with difficulty that i could bring myself to admit the identity of the <name> being before me with the companion of my early boyhood .
yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable .
a <unk> of complexion ; an eye large , liquid , and luminous beyond comparison ; lips somewhat thin and very pallid , but of a <unk> beautiful curve ; a nose of a delicate hebrew model , but with a breadth of <unk> unusual in similar formations ; a <unk> <name> , speaking , in its want of prominence , of a want of moral energy ; hair of a more than <unk> softness and tenuity ; these features , with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the <name> , made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten .
and now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features , and of the expression they were wont to convey , lay so much of change that i doubted to whom i spoke .
the now ghastly pallor of the skin , and the now miraculous lustre of the eye , above all things startled and even awed me .
the silken hair , too , had been suffered to grow all unheeded , and as , in its wild gossamer texture , it floated rather than fell about the face , i could not , even with effort , connect its <unk> expression with any idea of simple humanity .
in the manner of my friend i was at once struck with an <unk>  an inconsistency ; and i soon found this to arise from a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual <unk>  an excessive nervous agitation .
for something of this nature i had indeed been prepared , no less by his letter , than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits , and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament .
his action was alternately vivacious and sullen .
his voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision ( when the animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance ) to that species of energetic <unk>  that abrupt , weighty , <unk> , and <unk> enunciation  that leaden , self balanced and perfectly <unk> guttural utterance , which may be observed in the lost drunkard , or the <unk> eater of opium , during the periods of his most intense excitement .
it was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit , of his <name> <name> to see me , and of the solace he expected me to afford him .
he entered , at some length , into what he conceived to be the nature of his malady .
it was , he said , a constitutional and a family evil , and one for which he despaired to find a remedy  a mere nervous affection , he immediately added , which would undoubtedly soon pass off .
it displayed itself in a host of unnatural sensations .
some of these , as he detailed them , interested and bewildered me ; although , perhaps , the terms , and the general manner of the narration had their weight .
he suffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses ; the most insipid food was alone <unk> ; he could wear only garments of certain texture ; the odours of all flowers were oppressive ; his eyes were tortured by even a faint light ; and there were but peculiar sounds , and these from <unk> instruments , which did not inspire him with horror .
to an anomalous species of terror i found him a <unk> slave .
" i shall perish , " said he , " i must perish in this deplorable folly .
thus , thus , and not otherwise , shall i be lost .
i dread the events of the future , not in themselves , but in their results .
i shudder at the thought of any , even the most trivial , incident , which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul .
i have , indeed , no abhorrence of danger , except in its absolute effect  in terror .
in this unnerved  in this pitiable condition  i feel that the period <name> sooner or later arrive when i must abandon life and reason together , in some struggle with the grim <unk> , fear . "
i learned , moreover , at intervals , and through broken and equivocal hints , another singular feature of his mental condition .
he was <unk> by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted , and whence , for many years , he had never ventured forth  in regard to an influence whose <unk> force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be <unk>  an influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion , had , by dint of long sufferance , he said , obtained over his spirit  an effect which the physique of the grey walls and turrets , and of the dim tarn into which they all looked down , had , at length , brought about upon the <unk> of his existence .
he admitted , however , although with hesitation , that much of the peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more natural and far more palpable origin  to the severe and long-continued illness  indeed to the evidently approaching dis solution  of a tenderly beloved sister  his sole companion for long years  his last and only relative on earth .
" her decease , " he said , with a bitterness which i can never forget , " would leave him ( him the hopeless and the frail ) the last of the ancient race of the ushers . "
while he spoke , the <name> <name> ( for so was she called ) passed slowly through a remote portion of the apartment , and , without having noticed my presence , disappeared .
i regarded her with an utter astonishment not <unk> with dread  and yet i found it impossible to account for such feelings .
a sensation of stupor oppressed me , as my eyes followed her retreating steps .
when a door , at length , closed upon her , my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brother  but he had buried his face in his hands , and i could only perceive that a far more than ordinary <unk> had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears .
the disease of the <name> <name> had long baffled the skill of her physicians .
a settled apathy , a gradual wasting away of the person , and frequent although transient affections of a partially <unk> character , were the unusual diagnosis .
hitherto she had steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady , and had not <unk> herself finally to bed ; but , on the closing in of the evening of my arrival at the house , she succumbed ( as her brother told me at night with inexpressible agitation ) to the <unk> power of the destroyer ; and i learned that the glimpse i had obtained of her person would thus probably be the last i should obtain  that the <name> , at least while living , would be seen by me no more .
for several days ensuing , her name was <unk> by either usher or myself : and during this period i was busied in <name> endeavours to <unk> the melancholy of my friend .
we painted and read together ; or i listened , as if in a dream , to the wild <unk> of his speaking guitar .
and thus , as a closer and still closer intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit , the more bitterly did i perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness , as if an inherent positive quality , poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe , in one unceasing radiation of gloom .
i shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours i thus spent alone with the master of the house of usher .
yet i should fail in any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies , or of the occupations , in which he involved me , or led me the way .
an excited and highly <unk> <unk> threw a <unk> lustre over all .
his long improvised <unk> <name> ring for ever in my ears .
among other things , i hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and <unk> of the wild air of the last waltz of <name> <unk> .
from the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded , and which grew , touch by touch , into <unk> at which i shuddered the more <unk> , because i shuddered knowing not why ;  from these paintings ( vivid as their images now are before me ) i would in vain endeavour to <unk> more than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely written words .
by the utter simplicity , by the nakedness of his designs , he arrested and overawed attention .
if ever mortal painted an idea , that mortal was <name> usher .
for me at least  in the circumstances then surrounding me  there arose out of the pure <unk> which the <unk> contrived to throw upon his canvas , an intensity of intolerable awe , no shadow of which felt i ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries of <unk> .
one of the <unk> conceptions of my friend , partaking not so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction , may be shadowed forth , although feebly , in words .
a small picture presented the interior of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel , with low walls , smooth , white , and without interruption or device .
certain accessory points of the design served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface of the earth .
no outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent , and no torch , or other artificial source of light was discernible ; yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout , and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendour .
i have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer , with the exception of certain effects of <unk> instruments .
it was , perhaps , the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar , which gave birth , in great measure , to the fantastic character of the performances .
but the <unk> facility of his <unk> could not be so accounted for .
they must have been , and were , in the notes , as well as in the words of his wild <unk> ( for he not unfrequently accompanied himself with <unk> verbal <unk> ) , the result of that intense mental <unk> and concentration to which i have previously alluded as observable only in particular moments of the highest artificial excitement .
the words of one of these <unk> i have easily remembered .
i was , perhaps , the more forcibly impressed with it , as he gave it , because , in the under or mystic current of its meaning , i fancied that i perceived , and for the first time , a full consciousness on the part of usher , of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne .
the verses , which were entitled " the haunted palace , " ran very nearly , if not accurately , thus : i .
in the <unk> of our valleys , by good angels tenanted , once a fair and stately palace  radiant palace  reared its head .
in the monarch thought 's dominion  it stood there !
never seraph spread a <unk> over fabric half so fair .
ii .
banners yellow , glorious , golden , on its roof did float and flow ; ( this  all this  was in the olden time long ago ) and every gentle air that <unk> , in that sweet day , along the ramparts plumed and pallid , a winged odour went away .
iii .
wanderers in that happy valley through two luminous windows saw spirits moving musically to a <unk> 's well tuned law , round about a throne , where sitting ( <unk> ! )
in state his <name> well <unk> , the ruler of the realm was seen .
iv .
and all with <name> and <name> glowing was the fair palace door , through which came flowing , flowing , flowing and sparkling evermore , a troop of echoes whose sweet duty was but to sing , in voices of surpassing beauty , the wit and wisdom of their king .
v. but evil things , in robes of sorrow , assailed the monarch 's high estate ; ( ah , let us mourn , for never morrow shall <name> upon him , desolate ! )
and , round about his home , the <name> that blushed and bloomed is but a <unk> story , of the old time entombed .
<name> .
and travellers now within that valley , through the <unk> windows , see vast forms that move fantastically to a discordant <name> ; while , like a rapid ghastly river , through the pale door , a hideous throng rush out forever , and laugh  but smile no more .
i well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad , led us into a train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of usher 's which i mention not so much on account of its novelty ( for other <unk> have thought thus , ) as on account of the pertinacity with which he maintained it .
this opinion , in its general form , was that of the <unk> of all vegetable things .
but , in his disordered fancy , the idea had assumed a more daring character , and <unk> , under certain conditions , upon the kingdom of <unk> .
i lack words to express the full extent , or the <name> abandon of his persuasion .
the belief , however , was connected ( as i have previously hinted ) with the gray stones of the home of his forefathers .
the conditions of the <unk> had been here , he imagined , fulfilled in the method of <unk> of these stones  in the order of their arrangement , as well as in that of the many <unk> which overspread them , and of the decayed trees which stood around  above all , in the long undisturbed endurance of this arrangement , and in its <unk> in the still waters of the tarn .
its evidence  the evidence of the <unk>  was to be seen , he said , ( and i here started as he spoke , ) in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls .
the result was discoverable , he added , in that silent , yet importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family , and which made him what i now saw him  what he was .
such opinions need no comment , and i <name> make none .
our books  the books which , for years , had formed no small portion of the mental existence of the invalid  were , as might be supposed , in strict keeping with this character of <unk> .
we <unk> together over such works as the <unk> et <unk> of <unk> ; the <unk> of machiavelli ; the heaven and hell of swedenborg ; the subterranean voyage of <name> <unk> by <unk> ; the <unk> of <name> <unk> , of <name> <unk> , and of de la <unk> ; the journey into the blue distance of <unk> ; and the city of the sun by <unk> .
one favourite volume was a small octavo edition of the <unk> <unk> , by the <unk> <unk> de <unk> ; and there were passages in <unk> <unk> , about the old african <unk> and <unk> , over which usher would sit dreaming for hours .
his chief delight , however , was found in the perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto gothic  the <name> of a forgotten church  the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work , and of its probable influence upon the <unk> , when , one evening , having informed me abruptly that the <name> <name> was no more , he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight , ( previously to its final interment ) , in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of the building .
the worldly reason , however , assigned for this singular proceeding , was one which i did not feel at <name> to dispute .
the brother had been led to his resolution ( so he told me ) by consideration of the unusual character of the malady of the deceased , of certain <unk> and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men , and of the remote and exposed situation of the <unk> of the family .
i <name> not deny that when i called to mind the sinister countenance of the person whom i met upon the staircase , on the day of my arrival at the house , i had no <name> to oppose what i regarded as at best but a harmless , and by no means an unnatural , precaution .
at the request of usher , i personally aided him in the arrangements for the temporary <unk> .
the body having been <unk> , we two alone bore it to its rest .
the vault in which we placed it ( and which had been so long unopened that our torches , half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere , gave us little opportunity for investigation ) was small , damp , and entirely without means of admission for light ; lying , at great depth , immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my own sleeping apartment .
it had been used , apparently , in remote feudal times , for the worst purposes of a <unk> , and , in later days , as a place of deposit for powder , or some other highly combustible substance , as a portion of its floor , and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it , were carefully sheathed with copper .
the door , of massive iron , had been , also , similarly protected .
its immense weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound , as it moved upon its hinges .
having deposited our mournful burden upon <unk> within this region of horror , we partially turned aside the yet <unk> lid of the coffin , and looked upon the face of the tenant .
a striking <unk> between the brother and sister now first arrested my attention ; and usher , <unk> , perhaps , my thoughts , murmured out some few words from which i learned that the deceased and himself had been twins , and that sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them .
our glances , however , rested not long upon the dead  for we could not regard her <unk> .
the disease which had thus entombed the <name> in the maturity of youth , had left , as usual in all maladies of a strictly <unk> character , the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face , and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death .
we replaced and screwed down the lid , and , having secured the door of iron , made our way , with toil , into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house .
and now , some days of bitter grief having elapsed , an observable change came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend .
his ordinary manner had vanished .
his ordinary occupations were neglected or forgotten .
he roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried , unequal , and <unk> step .
the pallor of his countenance had assumed , if possible , a more ghastly <name>  but the <unk> of his eye had utterly gone out .
the once occasional <unk> of his tone was heard no more ; and a tremulous <unk> , as if of extreme terror , habitually characterized his utterance .
there were times , indeed , when i thought his unceasingly agitated mind was labouring with some oppressive secret , to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage .
at times , again , i was obliged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness , for i beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours , in an attitude of the profoundest attention , as if listening to some imaginary sound .
it was no wonder that his condition terrified  that it infected me .
i felt creeping upon me , by slow yet certain degrees , the wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions .
it was , especially , upon retiring to bed late in the night of the seventh or eighth day after the placing of the <name> <name> within the <unk> , that i experienced the full power of such feelings .
sleep came not near my couch  while the hours waned and waned away .
i struggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me .
i endeavoured to believe that much , if not all of what i felt , was due to the bewildering influence of the gloomy furniture of the room  of the dark and tattered draperies , which , tortured into motion by the breath of a rising tempest , swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls , and rustled uneasily about the decorations of the bed .
but my efforts were fruitless .
an irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame ; and , at length , there sat upon my very heart an <unk> of utterly <unk> alarm .
shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle , i uplifted myself upon the pillows , and , peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber , <unk>  i know not why , except that an instinctive spirit prompted me  to certain low and indefinite sounds which came , through the pauses of the storm , at long intervals , i knew not whence .
overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror , unaccountable yet unendurable , i threw on my clothes with haste ( for i felt that i should sleep no more during the night , ) and endeavoured to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which i had fallen , by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment .
i had taken but few turns in this manner , when a light step on an adjoining staircase arrested my attention .
i presently recognized it as that of usher .
in an instant afterwards he rapped , with a gentle touch , at my door , and entered , bearing a lamp .
his countenance was , as usual , <unk> <name>  but , moreover , there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyes  an evidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanour .
his air appalled me  but anything was preferable to the solitude which i had so long endured , and i even welcomed his presence as a relief .
" and you have not seen it ? "
he said abruptly , after having stared about him for some moments in silence  " you have not then seen it ?  but , stay !
you shall . "
thus speaking , and having carefully shaded his lamp , he hurried to one of the <unk> , and threw it freely open to the storm .
the impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet .
it was , indeed , a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night , and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty .
a whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity ; for there were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind ; and the exceeding density of the clouds ( which <name> so low as to press upon the turrets of the house ) did not prevent our perceiving the <unk> velocity with which they flew <unk> from all points against each other , without passing away into the distance .
i say that even their exceeding density did not prevent our perceiving this  yet we had no glimpse of the moon or stars  nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning .
but the under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapor , as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us , were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous <unk> which <name> about and enshrouded the mansion .
" you must not  you shall not behold this ! "
said i , <unk> , to usher , as i led him , with a gentle violence , from the window to a seat .
" these appearances , which bewilder you , are merely electrical phenomena not uncommon  or it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the rank <unk> of the tarn .
let us close this casement ;  the air is chilling and dangerous to your frame .
here is one of your favourite romances .
i <name> read , and you shall listen ;  and so we <name> pass away this terrible night together . "
the antique volume which i had taken up was the " mad <unk> " of sir launcelot canning ; but i had called it a favourite of usher 's more in sad jest than in <name> ; for , in truth , there is little in its uncouth and <unk> <unk> which could have had interest for the lofty and spiritual <unk> of my friend .
it was , however , the only book immediately at hand ; and i indulged a vague <name> that the excitement which now agitated the <unk> , might find relief ( for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies ) even in the <unk> of the folly which i should read .
could i have judged , indeed , by the wild <unk> air of vivacity with which he <unk> , or apparently <unk> , to the words of the tale , i might well have congratulated myself upon the success of my design .
i had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where ethelred , the hero of the <unk> , having sought in vain for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit , proceeds to make good an entrance by force .
here , it <name> be remembered , the words of the narrative run thus : " and ethelred , who was by nature of a doughty heart , and who was now mighty withal , on account of the <unk> of the wine which he had drunken , waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit , who , in sooth , was of an obstinate and <unk> turn , but , feeling the rain upon his shoulders , and fearing the rising of the tempest , uplifted his <unk> outright , and , with blows , made quickly room in the <unk> of the door for his <unk> hand ; and now pulling therewith sturdily , he so cracked , and ripped , and tore all asunder , that the noise of the dry and <unk> wood alarmed and <unk> throughout the forest . "
at the termination of this sentence i started , and for a moment , paused ; for it appeared to me ( although i at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived me )  it appeared to me that , from some very remote portion of the mansion , there came , indistinctly , to my ears , what might have been , in its exact similarity of character , the <name> ( but a stifled and dull one certainly ) of the very cracking and ripping sound which sir launcelot had so particularly described .
it was , beyond doubt , the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention ; for , amid the rattling of the sashes of the <unk> , and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm , the sound , in itself , had nothing , surely , which should have interested or disturbed me .
i continued the story : " but the good champion ethelred , now entering within the door , was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the <unk> hermit ; but , in the stead thereof , a dragon of a <unk> and prodigious demeanour , and of a fiery tongue , which sate in guard before a palace of gold , with a floor of silver ; and upon the wall there <name> a shield of shining brass with this legend <unk>  who <unk> herein , a <unk> hath bin ; who <unk> the dragon , the shield he shall win ; and ethelred uplifted his <unk> , and struck upon the head of the dragon , which fell before him , and gave up his <unk> breath , with a shriek so horrid and harsh , and withal so piercing , that ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it , the like whereof was never before heard . "
here again i paused abruptly , and now with a feeling of wild amazement  for there could be no doubt whatever that , in this instance , i did actually hear ( although from what direction it proceeded i found it impossible to say ) a low and apparently distant , but harsh , protracted , and most unusual screaming or grating sound  the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already <unk> up for the dragon 's unnatural shriek as described by the <unk> .
oppressed , as i certainly was , upon the occurrence of the second and most extraordinary coincidence , by a thousand conflicting sensations , in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant , i still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting , by any observation , the sensitive nervousness of my companion .
i was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question ; although , assuredly , a strange alteration had , during the last few minutes , taken place in his demeanour .
from a position fronting my own , he had gradually brought round his chair , so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber ; and thus i could but partially perceive his features , although i saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring <unk> .
his head had dropped upon his breast  yet i knew that he was not asleep , from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as i caught a glance of it in profile .
the motion of his body , too , was at variance with this idea  for he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway .
having rapidly taken notice of all this , i resumed the narrative of sir launcelot , which thus proceeded : " and now , the champion , having escaped from the terrible fury of the dragon , <unk> himself of the brazen shield , and of the breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it , removed the carcass from out of the way before him , and approached <unk> over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall ; which in sooth tarried not for his full coming , but fell down at his feet upon the silver floor , with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound . "
no sooner had these syllables passed my lips , than  as if a shield of brass had indeed , at the moment , fallen heavily upon a floor of silver  i became aware of a distinct , hollow , metallic , and <unk> , yet apparently muffled <unk> .
completely unnerved , i leaped to my feet ; but the measured rocking movement of usher was undisturbed .
i rushed to the chair in which he sat .
his eyes were bent fixedly before him , and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony rigidity .
but , as i placed my hand upon his shoulder , there came a strong shudder over his whole person ; a sickly smile quivered about his lips ; and i saw that he spoke in a low , hurried , and <unk> murmur , as if unconscious of my presence .
bending closely over him , i at length drank in the hideous import of his words .
" not hear it ?  yes , i hear it , and have heard it .
long long  long  many minutes , many hours , many days , have i heard it  yet i dared not  oh , pity me , miserable wretch that i am !  i dared not  i dared not speak !
we have put her living in the tomb !
said i not that my senses were acute ?
i now tell you that i heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin .
i heard them  many , many days ago  yet i dared not  i dared not speak !
and now  to-night  ethelred  <name> !
<name> !  the breaking of the hermit 's door , and the <unk> of the dragon , and the <unk> of the shield !  say , rather , the rending of her coffin , and the grating of the iron hinges of her prison , and her struggles within the <unk> archway of the vault !
oh whither shall i fly ?
<name> she not be here anon ?
is she not hurrying to upbraid me for my haste ?
have i not heard her footsteps on the stair ?
do i not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart ?
madman ! "
here he sprang furiously to his feet , and shrieked out his syllables , as if in the effort he were giving up his soul  " madman !
i tell you that she now stands without the door ! "
as if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found the <unk> of a spell  the huge antique panels to which the speaker pointed , threw slowly back , upon the instant , their ponderous and <name> jaws .
it was the work of the rushing gust  but then without those doors there did stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the <name> <name> of usher .
there was blood upon her white robes , and the evidence of some bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame .
for a moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold ,  then , with a low moaning cry , fell heavily inward upon the person of her brother , and in her violent and now final <unk> , bore him to the floor a corpse , and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated .
from that chamber , and from that mansion , i fled aghast .
the storm was still abroad in all its wrath as i found myself crossing the old causeway .
suddenly there shot along the path a wild light , and i turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued ; for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me .
the radiance was that of the full , setting , and blood-red moon which now shone vividly through that once <unk> fissure of which i have before spoken as extending from the roof of the building , in a zigzag direction , to the base .
while i gazed , this fissure rapidly widened  there came a fierce breath of the whirlwind  the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my sight  my <name> reeled as i saw the mighty walls rushing asunder  there was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters  and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the " house of usher " .
* watson , dr <unk> , <unk> , and especially the bishop of <unk> .
the <unk> of the red death by <name> <name> poe the " red death " had long <unk> the country .
no pestilence had ever been so fatal , or so hideous .
blood was its <unk> and its seal  the redness and the horror of blood .
there were sharp pains , and sudden dizziness , and then profuse bleeding at the pores , with dissolution .
the <name> stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim , were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellow-men .
and the whole seizure , progress and termination of the disease , were the incidents of half an hour .
but the <name> <unk> was happy and dauntless and sagacious .
when his dominions were half <unk> , he summoned to his presence a thousand hale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of his court , and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his <unk> abbeys .
this was an extensive and magnificent structure , the creation of the <name> 's own eccentric yet <name> taste .
a strong and lofty wall <unk> it in .
this wall had gates of iron .
the courtiers , having entered , brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts .
they resolved to leave means neither of ingress nor egress to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within .
the <name> was amply <unk> .
with such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to <unk> .
the external world could take care of itself .
in the meantime it was folly to grieve , or to think .
the <name> had provided all the appliances of pleasure .
there were <unk> , there were <unk> , there were <unk> , there were musicians , there was beauty , there was wine .
all these and security were within .
without was the " red death " .
it was towards the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion , and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad , that the <name> <unk> entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most unusual magnificence .
it was a voluptuous scene , that masquerade .
but first let me tell of the rooms in which it was held .
these were seven  an imperial suite .
in many palaces , however , such suites form a long and straight vista , while the folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand , so that the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded .
here the case was very different , as might have been expected from the <unk> love of the bizarre .
the apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more than one at a time .
there was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards , and at each turn a novel effect .
to the right and left , in the middle of each wall , a tall and narrow gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of the suite .
these windows were of stained glass whose colour varied in accordance with the prevailing <name> of the decorations of the chamber into which it opened .
that at the eastern extremity was <name> , for example in blue  and vividly blue were its windows .
the second chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries , and here the panes were purple .
the third was green throughout , and so were the <unk> .
the fourth was furnished and lighted with orange  the fifth with white  the sixth with <name> .
the seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black <name> tapestries that <name> all over the ceiling and down the walls , falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and <name> .
but in this chamber only , the colour of the windows failed to correspond with the decorations .
the panes here were <name>  a deep blood colour .
now in no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or <unk> , amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the roof .
there was no light of any kind <unk> from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers .
but in the corridors that followed the suite , there stood , opposite to each window , a heavy tripod , bearing a <unk> of fire , that projected its rays through the tinted glass and so <unk> illumined the room .
and thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances .
but in the western or black chamber the effect of the <unk> that streamed upon the dark hangings through the <unk> panes , was ghastly in the extreme , and produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered , that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all .
it was in this apartment , also , that there stood against the western wall , a gigantic clock of <name> .
its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull , heavy , monotonous clang ; and when the <unk> made the circuit of the face , and the hour was to be stricken , there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical , but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that , at each lapse of an hour , the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause , momentarily , in their performance , to <unk> to the sound ; and thus the <unk> perforce ceased their evolutions ; and there was a brief <unk> of the whole <name> company ; and , while the <unk> of the clock yet rang , it was observed that the <unk> grew pale , and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in confused revery or meditation .
but when the echoes had fully ceased , a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly ; the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly , and made whispering vows , each to the other , that the next <unk> of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion ; and then , after the lapse of sixty minutes , ( which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of the time that flies , ) there came yet another <unk> of the clock , and then were the same <unk> and <unk> and meditation as before .
but , in spite of these things , it was a <name> and magnificent revel .
the tastes of the duke were peculiar .
he had a fine eye for colours and effects .
he disregarded the <unk> of mere fashion .
his plans were bold and fiery , and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre .
there are some who would have thought him mad .
his followers felt that he was not .
it was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he was not .
he had directed , in great part , the movable embellishments of the seven chambers , upon occasion of this great <unk> ; and it was his own guiding taste which had given character to the <unk> .
be sure they were grotesque .
there were much glare and glitter and <unk> and <unk>  much of what has been since seen in " <unk> " .
there were <unk> figures with <unk> limbs and appointments .
there were delirious fancies such as the madman fashions .
there were much of the beautiful , much of the wanton , much of the bizarre , something of the terrible , and not a little of that which might have excited disgust .
to and fro in the seven chambers there stalked , in fact , a multitude of dreams .
and these  the dreams  writhed in and about taking <name> from the rooms , and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the <name> of their steps .
and , anon , there strikes the <name> clock which stands in the hall of the <name> .
and then , for a moment , all is still , and all is silent save the voice of the clock .
the dreams are <unk> as they stand .
but the echoes of the chime die away  they have endured but an instant  and a light , <unk> laughter floats after them as they depart .
and now again the music swells , and the dreams live , and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever , taking <name> from the many tinted windows through which stream the rays from the <unk> .
but to the chamber which lies most <unk> of the seven , there are now none of the <unk> who venture ; for the night is waning away ; and there flows a <unk> light through the <unk> panes ; and the blackness of the sable drapery <unk> ; and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet , there comes from the near clock of <name> a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulged in the more remote <unk> of the other apartments .
but these other apartments were densely crowded , and in them beat feverishly the heart of life .
and the revel went <unk> on , until at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock .
and then the music ceased , as i have told ; and the evolutions of the <unk> were quieted ; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before .
but now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the <name> of the clock ; and thus it happened , perhaps , that more of thought crept , with more of time , into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled .
and thus too , it happened , perhaps , that before the last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence , there were many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no single individual before .
and the rumour of this new presence having spread itself <unk> around , there arose at length from the whole company a buzz , or murmur , expressive of disapprobation and surprise  then , finally , of terror , of horror , and of disgust .
in an assembly of <unk> such as i have painted , it may well be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation .
in truth the masquerade <unk> of the night was nearly unlimited ; but the figure in question had <unk> herod , and gone beyond the bounds of even the <name> 's indefinite decorum .
there are chords in the hearts of the most reckless which can not be touched without emotion .
even with the utterly lost , to whom life and death are equally jests , there are matters of which no jest can be made .
the whole company , indeed , seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed .
the figure was tall and gaunt , and shrouded from head to foot in the <unk> of the grave .
the mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat .
and yet all this might have been endured , if not approved , by the mad <unk> around .
but the <unk> had gone so far as to assume the type of the red death .
his <unk> was <unk> in blood  and his broad brow , with all the features of the face , was <unk> with the <name> horror .
when the eyes of the <name> <unk> fell upon this spectral image ( which , with a slow and solemn movement , as if more fully to sustain its role , stalked to and fro among the <unk> ) he was seen to be convulsed , in the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste ; but , in the next , his brow reddened with rage .
" who dares , "  he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near him  " who dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery ?
seize him and <unk> him  that we may know whom we have to <name> , at sunrise , from the battlements ! "
it was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the <name> <unk> as he uttered these words .
they rang throughout the seven rooms loudly and clearly , for the <name> was a bold and robust man , and the music had become hushed at the waving of his hand .
it was in the blue room where stood the <name> , with a group of pale courtiers by his side .
at first , as he spoke , there was a slight rushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder , who at the moment was also near at hand , and now , with deliberate and stately step , made closer approach to the speaker .
but from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the <unk> had inspired the whole party , there were found none who put forth hand to seize him ; so that , <unk> , he passed within a yard of the <name> 's person ; and , while the vast assembly , as if with one impulse , shrank from the centres of the rooms to the walls , he made his way uninterruptedly , but with the same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the first , through the blue chamber to the purple  through the purple to the green  through the green to the orange  through this again to the white  and even thence to the <name> , ere a decided movement had been made to arrest him .
it was then , however , that the <name> <unk> , maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice , rushed hurriedly through the six chambers , while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had seized upon all .
he bore aloft a drawn dagger , and had approached , in rapid impetuosity , to within three or four feet of the retreating figure , when the latter , having attained the extremity of the <name> apartment , turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer .
there was a sharp cry  and the dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet , upon which , instantly afterwards , fell prostrate in death the <name> <unk> .
then , summoning the wild courage of despair , a throng of the <unk> at once threw themselves into the black apartment , and , seizing the <unk> , whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the <name> clock , gasped in unutterable horror at finding the grave <unk> and <unk> mask , which they handled with so violent a rudeness , <unk> by any tangible form .
and now was acknowledged the presence of the red death .
he had come like a thief in the night .
and one by one dropped the <unk> in the <unk> halls of their revel , and died each in the despairing posture of his fall .
and the life of the <name> clock went out with that of the last of the <name> .
and the flames of the <unk> expired .
and darkness and decay and the red death held illimitable dominion over all .
the <name> by <name> <name> poe once upon a midnight dreary , while i pondered , weak and weary , over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten <name>  while i nodded , nearly napping , suddenly there came a tapping , as of some one gently rapping , rapping at my chamber door .
" 't is some visitor , " i muttered , " tapping at my chamber door  only this and nothing more . "
ah , distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december , and each separate dying <unk> wrought its ghost upon the floor .
eagerly i wished the morrow ;  vainly i had sought to borrow from my books <unk> of sorrow  sorrow for the lost <name>  for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name <name>  nameless here for evermore .
and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled me  filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before ; so that now , to still the beating of my heart , i stood repeating " 't is some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door  some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door ; this it is and nothing more . "
presently my soul grew stronger ; hesitating then no longer , " sir , " said i , " or madam , truly your forgiveness i implore ; but the fact is i was napping , and so gently you came rapping , and so faintly you came tapping , tapping at my chamber door , that i scarce was sure i heard you "  here i opened wide the door  darkness there and nothing more .
deep into that darkness peering , long i stood there wondering , fearing , doubting , dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before ; but the silence was unbroken , and the stillness gave no token , and the only word there spoken was the whispered word , " <name> ? "
this i whispered , and an <name> murmured back the word , " <name> ! "
 merely this and nothing more .
back into the chamber turning , all my soul within me burning , soon again i heard a tapping something louder than before .
" surely , " said i , " surely that is something at my window lattice ; let me see , then , what <unk> is and this mystery explore  let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore ;  't is the wind and nothing more .
open here i flung the shutter , when , with many a flirt and flutter , in there stepped a stately <name> of the saintly days of yore .
not the least obeisance made he ; not a minute stopped or stayed he , but , with mien of lord or <name> , perched above my chamber door  perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door  perched , and sat , and nothing more .
then the <name> bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling , by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore , " though thy crest be shorn and shaven , thou , " i said , " <name> sure no craven , ghastly grim and ancient <name> wandering from the nightly shore  tell me what thy lordly name is on the night 's <unk> shore ! "
quoth the <name> , " nevermore . "
much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly , though its answer little meaning  little relevancy bore ; for we can not help agreeing that no living human being ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door  bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door , with such name as " nevermore . "
but the <name> , sitting lonely on that placid bust , spoke only that one word , as if its soul in that one word he did <unk> nothing farther then he uttered ; not a feather then he fluttered  till i scarcely more than muttered : " other friends have flown before  on the morrow he <name> leave me , as my hopes have flown before . "
then the bird said " nevermore . "
startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken , " doubtless , " said i , " what it utters is its only stock and store , caught from some unhappy master whom <unk> disaster followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore  till the <unk> of his <name> that melancholy burden bore of 'never  nevermore . ' "
but the <name> still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling , straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door ; then , upon the <name> sinking , i betook myself to linking fancy unto fancy , thinking what this ominous bird of yore  what this grim , ungainly , ghastly , gaunt , and ominous bird of yore meant in croaking " nevermore . "
this i sat engaged in guessing , but no syllable expressing to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom 's core ; this and more i sat <unk> , with my head at ease reclining on the cushion 's <name> lining that the <unk> <unk> o'er , but whose <name> <name> lining with the <unk> <unk> o'er she shall press , ah , nevermore !
then , methought , the air grew denser , perfumed from an unseen censer swung by <unk> whose <unk> <unk> on the tufted floor .
" wretch , " i cried , " thy god hath lent thee  by these angels he hath sent thee respite  respite and <unk> from thy memories of <name> !
<unk> , oh <unk> this kind <unk> and forget this lost <name> ! "
quoth the <name> , " nevermore . "
" prophet ! "
said i , " thing of evil !  prophet still , if bird or devil !  whether <unk> sent , or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore , desolate , yet all undaunted , on this desert land enchanted  on this home by horror haunted  tell me truly , i implore  is there  is there balm in <unk> ?  tell me  tell me , i implore ! "
quoth the <name> , " nevermore . "
" prophet ! "
said i , " thing of evil !  prophet still , if bird or devil !
by that heaven that bends above us  by that god we both adore  tell this soul with sorrow laden if , within the distant aidenn , it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name <name>  clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name <name> . "
quoth the <name> , " nevermore . "
" be that our sign of parting , bird or fiend ! "
i shrieked , <unk>  " get thee back into the tempest and the night 's <unk> shore !
leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul has spoken !
leave my loneliness unbroken !  quit the bust above my door !
take thy beak from out my heart , and take thy form from off my door ! "
quoth the <name> , " nevermore . "
and the <name> , never flitting , still is sitting , still is sitting on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door ; and his eyes have all the seeming of a demon 's that is dreaming and the <unk> o'er him streaming throws his shadows on the floor ; and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted  nevermore !

"
this stanza from " the <name> " was recommended by <name> <name> <name> as an inscription upon the baltimore monument which marks the resting place of <name> <name> poe , the most interesting and original figure in american letters .
and , to signify that peculiar musical quality of poe 's genius which <unk> every reader , mr. <name> suggested this additional verse , from the " haunted palace " : and all with <name> and <name> glowing was the fair palace door , through which came flowing , flowing , flowing , and sparkling ever more , a troop of echoes , whose sweet duty was but to sing , in voices of surpassing beauty , the wit and wisdom of their king .
born in poverty at boston , <name> 19 1809 , dying under painful circumstances at baltimore , october 7 , 1849 , his whole literary career of scarcely fifteen years a pitiful struggle for mere subsistence , his memory <unk> <unk> by his earliest biographer , griswold , how completely has truth at last routed falsehood and how magnificently has poe come into his own , for " the <name> , " first published in 1845 , and , within a few months , read , recited and <unk> wherever the english language was spoken , the <unk> poet received $ 10 !
less than a year later his brother poet , n. p. <name> , issued this touching appeal to the admirers of genius on behalf of the neglected author , his dying wife and her devoted mother , then living under very <unk> circumstances in a little cottage at fordham , n. y. : " here is one of the finest scholars , one of the most original men of genius , and one of the most industrious of the literary profession of our country , whose temporary suspension of labor , from bodily illness , drops him immediately to a level with the common objects of public <name> .
there is no intermediate <unk> , no respectful shelter , where , with the delicacy due to genius and culture , he might secure aid , till , with returning health , he would resume his labors , and his <unk> sense of independence . "
and this was the tribute paid by the american public to the master who had given to it such tales of <unk> charm , of witchery and mystery as " the fall of the house of usher " and " ligeia " ; such fascinating <unk> as " the unparalleled adventure of <name> <unk> , " " <unk> .
found in a bottle , " " a descent into a <unk> " and " the balloon hoax " ; such tales of conscience as " <name> <name> , " " the black cat " and " the <unk> heart , " wherein the <unk> of remorse are portrayed with an awful fidelity ; such tales of natural beauty as " the island of the <name> " and " the domain of <unk> " ; such marvellous studies in <unk> as the " <unk> , " " the murders in the rue morgue , " " the <unk> letter " and " the mystery of <name> <unk> , " the latter , a recital of fact , demonstrating the author 's wonderful capability of correctly analyzing the mysteries of the human mind ; such tales of illusion and banter as " the premature burial " and " the system of dr. <unk> and professor <unk> " ; such bits of <unk> as " the devil in the belfry " and " the <name> of the odd " ; such tales of adventure as " the narrative of <name> <name> <unk> " ; such papers of keen criticism and review as won for poe the enthusiastic admiration of <name> dickens , although they made him many enemies among the <unk> minor american writers so mercilessly exposed by him ; such poems of beauty and <name> as " the bells , " " the haunted palace , " " <unk> , " " the city in the sea " and " the <name> . "
what delight for the jaded senses of the reader is this enchanted domain of <unk> !
what an atmosphere of beauty , music , color !
what resources of imagination , construction , analysis and absolute <name> !
one might almost sympathize with <name> <name> <unk> , who , confessing to a half <name> in the old superstition of the significance of <unk> , found , in the <unk> letters of <name> poe 's name , the words " a <unk> . "
his mind , she says , was indeed a " haunted palace , " echoing to the <unk> of angels and demons .
" no man , " poe himself wrote , " has recorded , no man has dared to record , the wonders of his inner life . "
in these twentieth century days  of lavish recognition  artistic , popular and material  of genius , what rewards might not a poe claim !
<name> 's father , a son of general <name> poe , the american revolutionary patriot and friend of <unk> , had married mrs. hopkins , an english actress , and , the match meeting with parental disapproval , had himself taken to the stage as a profession .
notwithstanding mrs. poe 's beauty and talent the young couple had a sorry struggle for existence .
when <name> , at the age of two years , was <unk> , the family was in the utmost destitution .
apparently the future poet was to be cast upon the world homeless and friendless .
but fate decreed that a few <unk> of <name> were to <unk> his life , for the little fellow was adopted by <name> <name> , a wealthy merchant of richmond , <unk> a brother and sister , the remaining children , were cared for by others .
in his new home <name> found all the luxury and advantages money could provide .
he was petted , spoiled and shown off to strangers .
in mrs. <name> he found all the affection a childless wife could bestow .
mr. <name> took much pride in the <unk> , precocious lad .
at the age of five the boy recited , with fine effect , passages of english poetry to the visitors at the <name> house .
from his eighth to his thirteenth year he attended the manor house school , at <unk> , a suburb of london .
it was the rev .
dr. <unk> , head of the school , whom poe so quaintly portrayed in " <name> <name> . "
returning to richmond in 1820 <name> was sent to the school of professor <name> h. clarke .
he proved an apt pupil .
years afterward professor clarke thus wrote : " while the other boys wrote mere mechanical verses , poe wrote genuine poetry ; the boy was a born poet .
as a scholar he was ambitious to excel .
he was remarkable for self-respect , without <unk> .
he had a sensitive and tender heart and would do anything for a friend .
his nature was entirely free from selfishness . "
at the age of seventeen poe entered the university of <name> at <unk> .
he left that institution after one session .
official records prove that he was not expelled .
on the contrary , he gained a creditable record as a student , although it is admitted that he contracted debts and had " an ungovernable passion for <unk> . "
these debts may have led to his quarrel with mr. <name> which eventually compelled him to make his own way in the world .
early in 1827 poe made his first literary venture .
he induced <name> <name> , a poor and youthful printer , to publish a small volume of his verses under the title " <unk> and other poems . "
in 1829 we find poe in baltimore with another manuscript volume of verses , which was soon published .
its title was " <name> aaraaf , <unk> and other poems . "
neither of these ventures seems to have attracted much attention .
soon after mrs. <name> 's death , which occurred in 1829 , poe , through the aid of mr. <name> , secured admission to the united states military academy at west point .
any glamour which may have attached to cadet life in poe 's eyes was speedily lost , for discipline at west point was never so severe nor were the accommodations ever so poor .
poe 's bent was more and more toward literature .
life at the academy daily became increasingly distasteful .
soon he began to purposely neglect his studies and to disregard his duties , his aim being to secure his dismissal from the united states service .
in this he succeeded .
on march 7 , 1831 , poe found himself free .
mr. <name> 's second marriage had thrown the lad on his own resources .
his literary career was to begin .
poe 's first genuine victory was won in 1833 , when he was the successful competitor for a prize of $ 100 offered by a baltimore periodical for the best prose story .
" a <unk> .
found in a bottle " was the winning tale .
poe had submitted six stories in a volume .
" our only difficulty , " says mr. <unk> , one of the judges , " was in selecting from the <name> contents of the volume . "
during the fifteen years of his literary life poe was connected with various newspapers and magazines in richmond , philadelphia and new york .
he was faithful , punctual , industrious , thorough .
n. p. <name> , who for some time employed poe as critic and <unk> on the " evening mirror , " wrote thus : " with the highest admiration for poe 's genius , and a willingness to let it alone for more than ordinary irregularity , we were led by common report to expect a very capricious attention to his duties , and occasionally a scene of violence and difficulty .
time went on , however , and he was invariably punctual and industrious .
we saw but one presentiment of the <unk> quiet , patient , industrious and most gentlemanly person .
" we heard , from one who knew him well ( what should be stated in all mention of his lamentable irregularities ) , that with a single glass of wine his whole nature was reversed , the demon became uppermost , and , though none of the usual signs of intoxication were visible , his <name> was palpably insane .
in this reversed character , we repeat , it was never our chance to meet him . "
on <name> 22 , 1835 , poe married his cousin , <name> <unk> , in baltimore .
she had barely turned thirteen years , poe himself was but twenty-six .
he then was a resident of richmond and a regular <unk> to the " southern literary messenger . "
it was not until a year later that the bride and her widowed mother followed him thither .
poe 's devotion to his <unk> was one of the most beautiful features of his life .
many of his famous poetic productions were inspired by her beauty and charm .
consumption had marked her for its victim , and the constant efforts of husband and mother were to secure for her all the comfort and happiness their slender means permitted .
<name> died <name> 30 , 1847 , when but twenty-five years of age .
a friend of the family pictures the death-bed scene  mother and husband trying to impart warmth to her by chafing her hands and her feet , while her pet cat was suffered to nestle upon her bosom for the sake of added warmth .
these verses from " <name> <name> , " written by poe in 1849 , the last year of his life , tell of his sorrow at the loss of his <unk> : i was a child and she was a child , in a kingdom by the sea ; but we loved with a love that was more than love  i and my <name> <name> ; with a love that the winged <unk> of heaven coveted her and me .
and this was the reason that , long ago ; in this kingdom by the sea .
a wind blew out of a cloud , chilling my beautiful <name> <name> ; so that her <unk> kinsmen came and bore her away from me , to shut her up in a sepulchre in this kingdom by the sea , poe was connected at various times and in various capacities with the " southern literary messenger " in richmond , <unk> ; " <name> 's magazine " and the " gentleman 's magazine " in philadelphia .
; the " evening mirror , " the " broadway journal , " and " <unk> 's <name> 's book " in new york .
everywhere poe 's life was one of <unk> toil .
no tales and poems were ever produced at a greater cost of <name> and spirit .
poe 's initial salary with the " southern literary messenger , " to which he contributed the first drafts of a number of his best-known tales , was $ 10 a week !
two years later his salary was but $ 600 a year .
even in 1844 , when his literary reputation was established securely , he wrote to a friend expressing his pleasure because a magazine to which he was to contribute had agreed to pay him $ 20 monthly for two pages of criticism .
those were discouraging times in american literature , but poe never lost <name> .
he was finally to triumph wherever <unk> talents win admirers .
his genius has had no better description than in this stanza from <name> <name> 's poem , read at the dedication exercises of the actors ' monument to poe , may 4 , 1885 , in new york : he was the voice of beauty and of woe , passion and mystery and the dread unknown ; pure as the mountains of perpetual snow , cold as the icy winds that round them moan , dark as the eaves wherein earth 's thunders groan , wild as the tempests of the upper sky , sweet as the faint , far-off celestial tone of <name> whispers , fluttering from on high , and tender as love 's tear when youth and beauty die .
in the two and a half score years that have elapsed since poe 's death he has come fully into his own .
for a while griswold 's malignant <unk> colored the public estimate of poe as man and as writer .
but , thanks to j. h. <unk> , w. f. gill , <name> <unk> , <name> <name> <unk> and others these <unk> have been dispelled and poe is seen as he actually <unk> as a man without failings , it is true , but as the finest and most original genius in american letters .
as the years go on his fame increases .
his works have been translated into many foreign languages .
his is a household name in <name> and <unk> fact , the latter nation has often uttered the reproach that poe 's own country has been slow to appreciate him .
but that reproach , if it ever was warranted , certainly is untrue .
w. h. r. <name> <name> poe by <name> <name> <name> the situation of american literature is anomalous .
it has no centre , or , if it have , it is like that of the sphere of <unk> .
it is , divided into many systems , each revolving round its several suns , and often presenting to the rest only the faint glimmer of a <unk> way .
our capital city , unlike london or <name> , is not a great central heart from which life and vigor <unk> to the extremities , but resembles more an isolated <unk> stuck down as near a 's may be to the centre of the land , and seeming rather to tell a legend of former usefulness than to serve any present need .
boston , new york , philadelphia , each has its literature almost more distinct than those of the different dialects of germany ; and the young <name> of the west has also one of her own , of which some articulate rumor barely has reached us dwellers by the atlantic .
perhaps there is no task more difficult than the just criticism of contemporary literature .
it is even more grateful to give praise where it is needed than where it is deserved , and friendship so often <unk> the iron <unk> of justice into a vague flourish , that she writes what seems rather like an <unk> than a criticism .
yet if praise be given as an alms , we could not drop so poisonous a one into any man 's hat .
the critic 's ink may suffer equally from too large an infusion of <unk> or of sugar .
but it is easier to be generous than to be just , and we might readily put <name> in that fabulous direction to the hiding place of truth , did we judge from the amount of water which we usually find mixed with it .
remarkable experiences are usually confined to the inner life of imaginative men , but mr. poe 's biography displays a <unk> and peculiarity of interest such as is rarely met with .
the offspring of a romantic marriage , and left an orphan at an early age , he was adopted by mr. <name> , a wealthy virginian , whose barren <unk> seemed the <unk> of a large estate to the young poet .
having received a classical education in england , he returned home and entered the university of <name> , where , after an extravagant course , followed by reformation at the last extremity , he was graduated with the highest honors of his class .
then came a boyish attempt to join the fortunes of the <unk> greeks , which ended at st. petersburg , where he got into difficulties through want of a passport , from which he was rescued by the american consul and sent home .
he now entered the military academy at west point , from which he obtained a dismissal on hearing of the birth of a son to his adopted father , by a second marriage , an event which cut off his expectations as an heir .
the death of mr. <name> , in whose <name> his name was not mentioned , soon after relieved him of all doubt in this regard , and he committed himself at once to authorship for a support .
previously to this , however , he had published ( in 1827 ) a small volume of poems , which soon ran through three editions , and excited high expectations of its author 's future distinction in the minds of many competent judges .
that no certain <unk> can be drawn from a poet 's earliest <unk> there are instances enough to prove .
shakespeare 's first poems , though brimful of vigor and youth and picturesqueness , give but a very faint promise of the directness , condensation and overflowing moral of his <unk> works .
perhaps , however , shakespeare is hardly a case in point , his " <name> and adonis " having been published , we believe , in his <unk> year .
<name> 's latin verses show tenderness , a fine eye for nature , and a delicate appreciation of classic models , but give no hint of the author of a new style in poetry .
pope 's youthful pieces have all the sing-song , wholly <unk> by the glittering malignity and eloquent <unk> of his later productions .
collins ' callow <unk> died and gave no sign of the vigorous and original genius which he afterward displayed .
we have never thought that the world lost more in the " marvellous boy , " <unk> , than a very ingenious <unk> of obscure and <unk> dulness .
where he becomes original ( as it is called ) , the interest of ingenuity ceases and he becomes stupid .
<unk> white 's promises were <unk> by the respectable name of mr. <unk> , but surely with no authority from apollo .
they have the merit of a traditional piety , which to our mind , if uttered at all , had been less objectionable in the retired closet of a diary , and in the sober raiment of prose .
they do not clutch hold of the memory with the drowning pertinacity of <unk> ; neither have they the interest of his occasional simple , lucky beauty .
burns having fortunately been rescued by his humble station from the <unk> society of the " best models , " wrote well and naturally from the first .
had he been unfortunate enough to have had an educated taste , we should have had a series of poems from which , as from his letters , we could sift here and there a kernel from the mass of chaff .
coleridge 's youthful efforts give no promise whatever of that poetical genius which produced at once the wildest , tenderest , most original and most purely imaginative poems of modern times .
<unk> " hours of idleness " would never find a reader except from an intrepid and indefatigable curiosity .
in wordsworth 's first <unk> there is but a dim <unk> of the creator of an <name> .
from <unk> 's early poems , a safer <unk> might have been drawn .
they show the patient <unk> , the close student of history , and the unwearied explorer of the beauties of predecessors , but they give no assurances of a man who should add aught to stock of household words , or to the rarer and more sacred delights of the fireside or the arbor .
the earliest specimens of <name> 's poetic mind already , also , give tokens of that ethereal <unk> in which the spirit seems to soar above the regions of words , but leaves its body , the verse , to be entombed , without <name> of resurrection , in a mass of them .
<unk> is generally <unk> as a wonder of <unk> .
but his early <unk> show only a capacity for <unk> and for the <unk> arrangement of certain conventional combinations of words , a capacity wholly dependent on a delicate physical organization , and an unhappy memory .
an early poem is only remarkable when it displays an effort of reason , and the rudest verses in which we can trace some <name> of the ends of poetry , are worth all the miracles of smooth juvenile versification .
a school-boy , one would say , might acquire the regular <unk> of pope merely by an association with the motion of the <unk> tilt .
mr. poe 's early productions show that he could see through the verse to the spirit beneath , and that he already had a feeling that all the life and <name> of the one must depend on and be <unk> by the <name> of the other .
we call them the most remarkable boyish poems that we have ever read .
we know of none that can compare with them for maturity of purpose , and a nice understanding of the effects of language and metre .
such pieces are only valuable when they display what we can only express by the contradictory phrase of innate experience .
we copy one of the shorter poems , written when the author was only fourteen .
there is a little dimness in the filling up , but the <name> and symmetry of the outline are such as few poets ever attain .
there is a smack of <unk> about it .
to <name> <name> , thy beauty is to me like those <unk> barks of yore , that gently , o'er a perfumed sea , the weary , <unk> wanderer bore to his own native shore .
on desperate seas long wont to roam , thy <name> hair , thy classic face , thy <unk> airs have brought me home to the <name> that was greece and the grandeur that was rome .
lo !
in <name> brilliant <unk> how <unk> i see thee stand !
the agate lamp within thy hand , ah !
psyche , from the regions which are holy land !
it is the tendency of the young poet that impresses us .
here is no " withering scorn , " no heart " blighted " ere it has safely got into its teens , none of the drawing-room <unk> which <name> had brought into vogue .
all is limpid and serene , with a pleasant dash of the greek <unk> in it .
the <name> of the whole , too , is remarkable .
it is not of that kind which can be demonstrated <unk> upon the tips of the fingers .
it is of that finer sort which the inner ear alone can estimate .
it seems simple , like a greek column , because of its perfection .
in a poem named " ligeia , " under which title he intended to <unk> the music of nature , our <unk> gives us the following exquisite picture : ligeia !
ligeia !
my beautiful one , whose <unk> idea <name> to <name> run , say , is it thy <name> , on the breezes to toss , or , capriciously still , like the lone albatross , incumbent on night , as she on the air , to keep watch with delight on the <name> there ?
<name> <name> , himself a man of genius , and whose lyre has been too long capriciously silent , appreciated the high merit of these and similar passages , and <name> a proud horoscope for their author .
mr. poe had that indescribable something which men have agreed to call genius .
no man could ever tell us precisely what it is , and yet there is none who is not inevitably aware of its presence and its power .
let talent writhe and <unk> itself as it may , it has no such magnetism .
larger of bone and sinew it may be , but the wings are wanting .
talent sticks fast to earth , and its most perfect works have still one foot of <name> .
genius claims kindred with the very workings of nature herself , so that a sunset shall seem like a quotation from <name> , and if shakespeare be read in the very presence of the sea itself , his verses shall but seem nobler for the sublime criticism of ocean .
talent may make friends for itself , but only genius can give to its creations the divine power of winning love and veneration .
enthusiasm can not cling to what itself is <unk> , nor <name> he ever have disciples who has not himself impulsive zeal enough to be a disciple .
great wits are allied to madness only inasmuch as they are possessed and carried away by their demon , while talent keeps him , as <unk> did , securely <unk> in the pommel of his sword .
to the eye of genius , the veil of the spiritual world is ever rent asunder that it may perceive the ministers of good and evil who throng continually around it .
no man of mere talent ever flung his inkstand at the devil .
when we say that mr. poe had genius , we do not mean to say that he has produced evidence of the highest .
but to say that he possesses it at all is to say that he needs only zeal , industry , and a reverence for the trust reposed in him , to achieve the proudest triumphs and the <unk> laurels .
if we may believe the <unk> ; and <unk> of our newspapers , we have quite too many geniuses of the loftiest order to render a place among them at all desirable , whether for its hardness of attainment or its seclusion .
the highest peak of our <unk> is , according to these gentlemen , by far the most thickly settled portion of the country , a circumstance which must make it an uncomfortable residence for individuals of a poetical temperament , if love of solitude be , as immemorial tradition asserts , a necessary part of their <unk> .
mr. poe has two of the prime qualities of genius , a faculty of vigorous yet minute analysis , and a wonderful <unk> of imagination .
the first of these faculties is as needful to the artist in words , as a knowledge of anatomy is to the artist in colors or in stone .
this enables him to conceive truly , to maintain a proper relation of parts , and to draw a correct outline , while the second groups , fills up and colors .
both of these mr. poe has displayed with singular distinctness in his prose works , the last <unk> in his earlier tales , and the first in his later ones .
in judging of the merit of an author , and assigning him his niche among our household gods , we have a right to regard him from our own point of view , and to measure him by our own standard .
but , in estimating the amount of power displayed in his works , we must be governed by his own design , and placing them by the side of his own ideal , find how much is wanting .
we differ from mr. poe in his opinions of the objects of <name> .
he <unk> that object to be the creation of beauty , and perhaps it is only in the definition of that word that we disagree with him .
but in what we shall say of his writings , we shall take his own standard as our guide .
the <name> of the god of song is equally accessible from every side , and there is room enough in it for all who bring offerings , or seek in oracle .
in his tales , mr. poe has chosen to exhibit his power chiefly in that dim region which stretches from the very utmost limits of the probable into the weird confines of superstition and unreality .
he combines in a very remarkable manner two faculties which are seldom found united ; a power of influencing the mind of the reader by the impalpable shadows of mystery , and a minuteness of detail which does not leave a pin or a button unnoticed .
both are , in truth , the natural results of the <unk> quality of his mind , to which we have before alluded , analysis .
it is this which distinguishes the artist .
his mind at once reaches forward to the effect to be produced .
having resolved to bring about certain emotions in the reader , he makes all subordinate parts tend strictly to the common centre .
even his mystery is mathematical to his own mind .
to him x is a known quantity all along .
in any picture that he paints he understands the chemical properties of all his colors .
however vague some of his figures may seem , however formless the shadows , to him the outline is as clear and distinct as that of a geometrical diagram .
for this reason mr. poe has no sympathy with <unk> .
the mystic dwells in the mystery , is enveloped with it ; it colors all his thoughts ; it affects his optic nerve especially , and the commonest things get a rainbow edging from it .
mr. poe , on the other hand , is a spectator ab extra .
he <unk> , he <unk> , he watches " with an eye serene , the very pulse of the machine , " for such it practically is to him , with wheels and <unk> and <unk> , all working to produce a certain end .
this analyzing tendency of his mind balances the poetical , and by giving him the <name> to be minute , enables him to throw a wonderful reality into his most unreal fancies .
a <unk> he paints with great power .
he loves to <unk> one of these <unk> of the mind , and to trace all the subtle ramifications of its roots .
in raising images of horror , also , he has strange success , conveying to us sometimes by a dusky hint some terrible doubt which is the secret of all horror .
he leaves to imagination the task of finishing the picture , a task to which only she is competent .
" for much imaginary work was there ; conceit deceitful , so compact , so kind , that for achilles ' image stood his spear grasped in an armed hand ; himself behind was left unseen , save to the eye of mind . "
besides the merit of <name> , mr. poe 's writings have also that of form .
his style is highly finished , graceful and truly classical .
it would be hard to find a living author who had displayed such varied powers .
as an example of his style we would refer to one of his tales , " the house of usher , " in the first volume of his " tales of the grotesque and <unk> . "
it has a singular charm for us , and we think that no one could read it without being strongly moved by its serene and sombre beauty .
had its author written nothing else , it would alone have been enough to stamp him as a man of genius , and the master of a classic style .
in this tale occurs , perhaps , the most beautiful of his poems .
the great masters of imagination have seldom resorted to the vague and the unreal as sources of effect .
they have not used dread and horror alone , but only in combination with other qualities , as means of <unk> the fancies of their readers .
the loftiest muse has ever a household and fireside charm about her .
mr. poe 's secret lies mainly in the skill with which he has employed the strange fascination of mystery and terror .
in this his success is so great and striking as to deserve the name of <name> , not artifice .
we can not call his materials the noblest or purest , but we must concede to him the highest merit of construction .
as a critic , mr. poe was <unk> deficient .
unerring in his analysis of <unk> , metres and plots , he seemed wanting in the faculty of perceiving the <unk> ethics of <name> .
his criticisms are , however , distinguished for scientific precision and <unk> of logic .
they have the exactness , and at the same time , the coldness of mathematical demonstrations .
yet they stand in strikingly refreshing contrast with the vague <unk> and sharp personalities of the day .
if deficient in warmth , they are also without the heat of <unk> .
they are especially valuable as illustrating the great truth , too generally overlooked , that <unk> power is a subordinate quality of the critic .
on the whole , it may be considered certain that mr. poe has attained an individual eminence in our literature which he <name> keep .
he has given proof of power and originality .
he has done that which could only be done once with success or safety , and the imitation or repetition of which would produce weariness .
death of <name> a. poe by n. p. <name> the ancient fable of two antagonistic spirits imprisoned in one body , equally powerful and having the complete mastery by <unk> one man , that is to say , inhabited by both a devil and an <name> seems to have been realized , if all we hear is true , in the character of the extraordinary man whose name we have written above .
our own impression of the nature of <name> a. poe , differs in some important degree , however , from that which has been generally conveyed in the notices of his death .
let us , before telling what we personally know of him , copy a graphic and highly finished <unk> , from the pen of dr. <name> w. griswold , which appeared in a recent number of the " tribune " : " <name> <name> poe is dead .
he died in baltimore on <name> , october 7th .
this announcement <name> startle many , but few <name> be grieved by it .
the poet was known , personally or by reputation , in all this country ; he had readers in england and in several of the states of continental europe ; but he had few or no friends ; and the regrets for his death <name> be suggested principally by the consideration that in him literary <name> has lost one of its most brilliant but erratic stars .
" his conversation was at times almost <unk> in its eloquence .
his voice was <unk> with astonishing skill , and his large and <unk> expressive eyes looked repose or shot fiery tumult into theirs who listened , while his own face glowed , or was <unk> in pallor , as his imagination quickened his blood or <name> it back frozen to his heart .
his imagery was from the worlds which no mortals can see but with the vision of genius .
suddenly starting from a proposition , exactly and sharply defined , in terms of utmost simplicity and clearness , he rejected the forms of customary logic , and by a crystalline process of <unk> , built up his <unk> demonstrations in forms of <unk> and <unk> grandeur , or in those of the most airy and delicious beauty , so minutely and distinctly , yet so rapidly , that the attention which was yielded to him was chained till it stood among his wonderful creations , till he himself dissolved the spell , and brought his hearers back to common and base existence , by vulgar fancies or exhibitions of the <unk> passion .
" he was at all times a <unk> in ideal <unk> heaven or <unk> with the creatures and the accidents of his <name> .
he <unk> streets , in madness or melancholy , with lips moving in indistinct curses , or with eyes upturned in passionate prayer ( never for himself , for he felt , or professed to feel , that he was already damned , but ) for their happiness who at the moment were objects of his idolatry ; or with his glances <unk> to a heart gnawed with anguish , and with a face shrouded in gloom , he would brave the wildest storms , and all night , with drenched garments and arms beating the winds and rains , would speak as if the spirits that at such times only could be evoked by him from the aidenn , close by whose <unk> his disturbed soul sought to forget the ills to which his constitution subjected him  close by the aidenn where were those he <unk> aidenn which he might never see , but in fitful glimpses , as its gates opened to receive the less fiery and more happy natures whose <name> to sin did not involve the doom of death .
" he seemed , except when some fitful pursuit <unk> his <name> and engrossed his faculties , always to bear the memory of some controlling sorrow .
the remarkable poem of 'the <name> ' was probably much more nearly than has been supposed , even by those who were very intimate with him , a reflection and an <name> of his own history .
he was that <unk> " <unk> master whom <unk> disaster followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore  till the <unk> of his <name> that melancholy burden bore of <unk> more . '
" every genuine author in a greater or less degree leaves in his works , whatever their design , traces of his personal character : elements of his immortal being , in which the individual <unk> the person .
while we read the pages of the <unk> of the house of usher , ' or of <unk> revelations , ' we see in the solemn and stately gloom which <unk> one , and in the subtle metaphysical analysis of both , indications of the <unk> of what was most remarkable and peculiar in the <unk> intellectual nature .
but we see here only the better phases of his nature , only the symbols of his <unk> action , for his harsh experience had deprived him of all <name> in man or woman .
he had made up his mind upon the numberless <unk> of the social world , and the whole system with him was an imposture .
this conviction gave a direction to his shrewd and naturally <unk> character .
still , though he regarded society as composed altogether of villains , the sharpness of his intellect was not of that kind which enabled him to cope with <unk> , while it continually caused him by <unk> to fail of the success of honesty .
he was in many respects like <name> <name> in <unk> 's novel of 'the <unk> . '
passion , in him , comprehended  many of the worst emotions which <unk> against human happiness .
you could not contradict him , but you raised quick <unk> ; you could not speak of wealth , but his cheek paled with gnawing envy .
the astonishing natural advantages of this poor boy  his beauty , his readiness , the daring spirit that breathed around him like a fiery atmosphere  had raised his constitutional self-confidence into an arrogance that turned his very claims to admiration into prejudices against him .
<unk> , envious  bad enough , but not the worst , for these salient angles were all varnished over with a cold , <unk> <unk> , his passions <unk> themselves in <unk> .
there seemed to him no moral susceptibility ; and , what was more remarkable in a proud nature , little or nothing of the true point of honor .
he had , to a morbid excess , that , <name> to rise which is <unk> called ambition , but no wish for the esteem or the love of his species ; only the hard wish to <unk> shine , not serve  succeed , that he might have the right to despise a world which galled his <unk> .
" we have suggested the influence of his aims and vicissitudes upon his literature .
it was more conspicuous in his later than in his earlier writings .
nearly all that he wrote in the last two or three <unk> much of his best <unk> in some sense biographical ; in draperies of his imagination , those who had taken the trouble to trace his steps , could perceive , but slightly concealed , the figure of himself . "
apropos of the <unk> portion of the above <unk> sketch , let us truthfully say : some four or five years since , when <unk> a daily paper in this city , mr. poe was employed by us , for several months , as critic and <unk> .
this was our first personal acquaintance with him .
he resided with his wife and mother at fordham , a few miles out of town , but was at his desk in the office , from nine in the morning till the evening paper went to press .
with the highest admiration for his genius , and a willingness to let it atone for more than ordinary irregularity , we were led by common report to expect a very capricious attention to his duties , and occasionally a scene of violence and difficulty .
time went on , however , and he was invariably punctual and industrious .
with his pale , beautiful , and intellectual face , as a reminder of what genius was in him , it was impossible , of course , not to treat him always with deferential courtesy , and , to our occasional request that he would not <unk> too deep in a criticism , or that he would <unk> a passage colored too highly with his <unk> against society and mankind , he readily and courteously <unk> more yielding than most men , we thought , on points so <unk> sensitive .
with a prospect of taking the lead in another periodical , he , at last , voluntarily gave up his employment with us , and , through all this considerable period , we had seen but one <unk> of the <unk> quiet , patient , industrious , and most gentlemanly person , commanding the utmost respect and good feeling by his unvarying deportment and ability .
residing as he did in the country , we never met mr. poe in hours of leisure ; but he frequently called on us afterward at our place of business , and we met him often in the <unk> the same sad <unk> , winning and refined gentleman , such as we had always known him .
it was by rumor only , up to the day of his death , that we knew of any other development of manner or character .
we heard , from one who knew him well ( what should be stated in all mention of his lamentable irregularities ) , that , with a single glass of wine , his whole nature was reversed , the demon became uppermost , and , though none of the usual signs of intoxication were visible , his <name> was palpably insane .
possessing his reasoning faculties in excited activity , at such times , and seeking his acquaintances with his wonted look and memory , he easily seemed <unk> only another phase of his natural character , and was accused , accordingly , of insulting arrogance and <unk> .
in this reversed character , we repeat , it was never our chance to see him .
we know it from hearsay , and we mention it in connection with this sad infirmity of physical constitution ; which puts it upon very nearly the ground of a temporary and almost irresponsible insanity .
the arrogance , vanity , and depravity of heart , of which mr. poe was generally accused , seem to us referable altogether to this reversed phase of his character .
under that degree of intoxication which only acted upon him by <unk> his sense of truth and right , he doubtless said and did much that was wholly <unk> with his better nature ; but , when himself , and as we knew him only , his modesty and unaffected humility , as to his own <unk> , were a constant charm to his character .
his letters , of which the constant application for autographs has taken from us , we are sorry to confess , the greater portion , exhibited this quality very strongly .
in one of the carelessly written notes of which we chance still to retain possession , for instance , he speaks of " the <name> "  that extraordinary poem which electrified the world of imaginative readers , and has become the type of a school of poetry of its <unk> , in evident <name> , attributes its success to the few words of commendation with which we had <unk> it in this <unk>  it <name> throw light on his sane character to give a literal copy of the note : " fordham , <name> 20 , 1849 " my dear <name>  the poem which i <unk> , and which i am so vain as to <name> you <name> like , in some respects , has been just published in a paper for which sheer necessity compels me to write , now and then .
it pays well as times <unk> unquestionably it ought to pay ten prices ; for whatever i send it i feel i am <unk> to the tomb of the <unk> .
the verses accompanying this , may i beg you to take out of the tomb , and bring them to light in the <unk> journal ? '
if you can oblige me so far as to copy them , i do not think it <name> be necessary to say 'from the   , that would be too bad ; and , perhaps , 'from a late   paper , ' would do .
" i have not forgotten how a 'good word in season ' from you made 'the <name> , ' and made <unk> ' ( which <unk> , people have done me the honor of attributing to you ) , therefore , i would ask you ( if i dared ) to say something of these lines if they please you .
" truly yours ever , " <name> a .
poe . "
in double proof of his <name> disposition to do the best for himself , and of the <unk> and grateful nature which has been denied him , we give another of the only three of his notes which we chance to retain : " fordham , <name> 22 , 1848 .
" my dear mr. <name>  i am about to make an effort at <unk> myself in the literary world , and feel that i may depend upon your aid .
" my general aim is to start a magazine , to be called 'the <unk> , ' but it would be useless to me , even when established , if not entirely out of the control of a publisher .
i mean , therefore , to get up a journal which shall be my own at all points .
with this end in view , i must get a list of at least five hundred subscribers to begin with ; nearly two hundred i have already .
i propose , however , to go south and west , among my personal and literary friends  old college and west point acquaintances  and see what i can do .
in order to get the means of taking the first step , i propose to lecture at the society library , on thursday , the 3d of february , and , that there may be no cause of <unk> , my subject shall not be literary at all .
i have chosen a broad text : 'the universe . '
" having thus given you the facts of the case , i leave all the rest to the suggestions of your own tact and generosity .
gratefully , most gratefully ,   " your friend always ,   " <name> a. <unk> " brief and <unk> as these letters are , we think they sufficiently prove the existence of the very qualities denied to mr. <unk> , willingness to persevere , belief in another 's friendship , and capability of cordial and grateful friendship !
such he assuredly was when sane .
such only he has invariably seemed to us , in all we have happened personally to know of him , through a friendship of five or six years .
and so much easier is it to believe what we have seen and known , than what we hear of only , that we remember him but with admiration and respect ; these descriptions of him , when morally insane , seeming to us like portraits , painted in sickness , of a man we have only known in health .
but there is another , more touching , and far more forcible evidence that there was goodness in <name> a. poe .
to reveal it we are obliged to venture upon the lifting of the veil which <unk> covers grief and refinement in poverty ; but we think it may be excused , if so we can brighten the memory of the poet , even were there not a more needed and immediate service which it may render to the nearest link broken by his death .
our first knowledge of mr. poe 's removal to this city was by a call which we received from a <name> who introduced herself to us as the mother of his wife .
she was in search of employment for him , and she excused her errand by mentioning that he was ill , that her daughter was a confirmed invalid , and that their circumstances were such as compelled her taking it upon herself .
the countenance of this <name> , made beautiful and saintly with an evidently complete giving up of her life to privation and sorrowful tenderness , her gentle and mournful voice urging its plea , her long-forgotten but habitually and unconsciously refined manners , and her appealing and yet appreciative mention of the claims and abilities of her son , disclosed at once the presence of one of those angels upon earth that women in adversity can be .
it was a hard fate that she was watching over .
mr. poe wrote with fastidious difficulty , and in a style too much above the popular level to be well paid .
he was always in pecuniary difficulty , and , with his sick wife , frequently in want of the merest necessaries of life .
<name> after <name> , for years , the most touching sight to us , in this whole city , has been that tireless minister to genius , thinly and <unk> clad , going from office to office with a poem , or an article on some literary subject , to sell , sometimes simply pleading in a broken voice that he was ill , and begging for him , mentioning nothing but that " he was ill , " whatever might be the reason for his writing nothing , and never , amid all her tears and <unk> of distress , suffering one syllable to escape her lips that could convey a doubt of him , or a complaint , or a lessening of pride in his genius and good intentions .
her daughter died a year and a half since , but she did not desert him .
she continued his <unk> <name>  living with him , caring for him , guarding him against exposure , and when he was carried away by temptation , amid grief and the loneliness of feelings <unk> to , and awoke from his self abandonment prostrated in destitution and suffering , begging for him still .
if woman 's devotion , born with a first love , and fed with human passion , <unk> its object , as it is allowed to do , what does not a devotion like <unk> , disinterested and holy as the watch of an invisible <unk> for him who inspired it ?
we have a letter before us , written by this <name> , mrs. <unk> , on the morning in which she heard of the death of this object of her untiring care .
it is merely a request that we would call upon her , but we <name> copy a few of its words  sacred as its privacy is  to warrant the truth of the picture we have drawn above , and add force to the appeal we wish to make for her : " i have this morning heard of the death of my darling <name> ... . can you give me any circumstances or particulars ? ...
oh !
do not desert your poor friend in his bitter affliction ! ...
ask mr.   to come , as i must deliver a message to him from my poor <name> ... .
i need not ask you to notice his death and to speak well of him .
i know you <name> .
but say what an affectionate son he was to me , his poor desolate mother ... " to hedge round a grave with respect , what choice is there , between the relinquished wealth and honors of the world , and the story of such a woman 's <unk> devotion !
risking what we do , in delicacy , by making it public , we feel  other reasons aside  that it betters the world to make known that there are such ministrations to its erring and gifted .
what we have said <name> speak to some hearts .
there are those who <name> be glad to know how the lamp , whose light of poetry has beamed on their far-away recognition , was watched over with care and pain , that they may send to her , who is more darkened than they by its extinction , some token of their sympathy .
she is destitute and alone .
if any , far or near , <name> send to us what may aid and cheer her through the remainder of her life , we <name> joyfully place it in her hands .
the unparalleled adventures of one <name> <unk> ( *1 ) by late accounts from rotterdam , that city seems to be in a high state of philosophical excitement .
indeed , phenomena have there occurred of a nature so completely unexpected  so entirely novel  so utterly at variance with preconceived opinions  as to leave no doubt on my mind that long ere this all europe is in an uproar , all physics in a ferment , all reason and astronomy together by the ears .
it appears that on the   day of   ( i am not positive about the date ) , a vast crowd of people , for purposes not specifically mentioned , were assembled in the great square of the exchange in the <unk> city of rotterdam .
the day was warm  unusually so for the season  there was hardly a breath of air stirring ; and the multitude were in no bad humor at being now and then <unk> with friendly showers of momentary duration , that fell from large white masses of cloud which chequered in a fitful manner the blue vault of the firmament .
nevertheless , about noon , a slight but remarkable agitation became apparent in the assembly : the clattering of ten thousand tongues succeeded ; and , in an instant afterward , ten thousand faces were upturned toward the heavens , ten thousand pipes descended simultaneously from the corners of ten thousand mouths , and a shout , which could be compared to nothing but the roaring of niagara , resounded long , loudly , and furiously , through all the environs of rotterdam .
the origin of this hubbub soon became sufficiently evident .
from behind the huge bulk of one of those <unk> masses of cloud already mentioned , was seen slowly to emerge into an open area of blue space , a queer , heterogeneous , but apparently solid substance , so oddly shaped , so <unk> put together , as not to be in any manner comprehended , and never to be sufficiently admired , by the host of sturdy <unk> who stood open-mouthed below .
what could it be ?
in the name of all the <unk> and devils in rotterdam , what could it possibly portend ?
no one knew , no one could imagine ; no one  not even the burgomaster <unk> <unk> <name> <unk>  had the slightest clew by which to unravel the mystery ; so , as nothing more reasonable could be done , every one to a man replaced his pipe carefully in the corner of his mouth , and <unk> up his right eye towards the phenomenon , puffed , paused , <unk> about , and grunted significantly  then <unk> back , grunted , paused , and finally  puffed again .
in the meantime , however , lower and still lower toward the goodly city , came the object of so much curiosity , and the cause of so much smoke .
in a very few minutes it arrived near enough to be accurately discerned .
it appeared to be  yes !
it was undoubtedly a species of balloon ; but surely no such balloon had ever been seen in rotterdam before .
for who , let me ask , ever heard of a balloon manufactured entirely of dirty newspapers ?
no man in holland certainly ; yet here , under the very noses of the people , or rather at some distance above their noses was the identical thing in question , and composed , i have it on the best authority , of the precise material which no one had ever before known to be used for a similar purpose .
it was an <unk> insult to the good sense of the <unk> of rotterdam .
as to the shape of the phenomenon , it was even still more reprehensible .
being little or nothing better than a huge <unk> turned upside down .
and this <unk> was regarded as by no means lessened when , upon nearer inspection , there was perceived a large <unk> depending from its apex , and , around the upper rim or base of the cone , a circle of little instruments , resembling <unk> , which kept up a continual tinkling to the tune of <name> <name> .
but still worse .
suspended by blue ribbons to the end of this fantastic machine , there <name> , by way of car , an enormous drab beaver hat , with a brim <unk> broad , and a hemispherical crown with a black band and a silver buckle .
it is , however , somewhat remarkable that many citizens of rotterdam swore to having seen the same hat repeatedly before ; and indeed the whole assembly seemed to regard it with eyes of familiarity ; while the <unk> <unk> <unk> , upon sight of it , uttered an exclamation of joyful surprise , and declared it to be the identical hat of her good man himself .
now this was a circumstance the more to be observed , as <unk> , with three companions , had actually disappeared from rotterdam about five years before , in a very sudden and unaccountable manner , and up to the date of this narrative all attempts had failed of obtaining any intelligence concerning them whatsoever .
to be sure , some bones which were thought to be human , mixed up with a quantity of <unk> rubbish , had been lately discovered in a retired situation to the east of rotterdam , and some people went so far as to imagine that in this spot a foul murder had been committed , and that the sufferers were in all probability <name> <unk> and his associates .
but to return .
the balloon ( for such no doubt it was ) had now descended to within a hundred feet of the earth , allowing the crowd below a sufficiently distinct view of the person of its occupant .
this was in truth a very droll little somebody .
he could not have been more than two feet in height ; but this altitude , little as it was , would have been sufficient to destroy his equilibrium , and tilt him over the edge of his <name> car , but for the intervention of a circular rim reaching as high as the breast , and rigged on to the cords of the balloon .
the body of the little man was more than proportionately broad , giving to his entire figure a <unk> highly absurd .
his feet , of course , could not be seen at all , although a horny substance of suspicious nature was occasionally protruded through a rent in the bottom of the car , or to speak more properly , in the top of the hat .
his hands were enormously large .
his hair was extremely gray , and collected in a cue behind .
his nose was prodigiously long , crooked , and <unk> ; his eyes full , brilliant , and acute ; his <name> and cheeks , although wrinkled with age , were broad , puffy , and double ; but of ears of any kind or character there was not a semblance to be discovered upon any portion of his head .
this odd little gentleman was dressed in a loose <unk> of sky-blue satin , with tight breeches to match , fastened with silver buckles at the knees .
his vest was of some bright yellow material ; a white <unk> cap was set <unk> on one side of his head ; and , to complete his equipment , a blood-red silk handkerchief enveloped his throat , and fell down , in a dainty manner , upon his bosom , in a fantastic <unk> of <unk> dimensions .
having descended , as i said before , to about one hundred feet from the surface of the earth , the little old gentleman was suddenly seized with a fit of trepidation , and appeared disinclined to make any nearer approach to <name> <unk> .
throwing out , therefore , a quantity of sand from a canvas bag , which , he lifted with great difficulty , he became stationary in an instant .
he then proceeded , in a hurried and agitated manner , to extract from a <unk> in his <unk> a large morocco pocket-book .
this he poised suspiciously in his hand , then eyed it with an air of extreme surprise , and was evidently astonished at its weight .
he at length opened it , and drawing there from a huge letter sealed with red <unk> and tied carefully with red tape , let it fall precisely at the feet of the burgomaster , <unk> <name> <unk> .
his excellency stooped to take it up .
but the <unk> , still greatly <unk> , and having apparently no farther business to detain him in rotterdam , began at this moment to make busy preparations for departure ; and it being necessary to discharge a portion of ballast to enable him to <unk> , the half dozen bags which he threw out , one after another , without taking the trouble to empty their contents , tumbled , every one of them , most unfortunately upon the back of the burgomaster , and rolled him over and over no less than <unk> times , in the face of every man in rotterdam .
it is not to be supposed , however , that the great <unk> suffered this impertinence on the part of the little old man to pass off with impunity .
it is said , on the contrary , that during each and every one of his <unk> twenty <unk> he emitted no less than <unk> distinct and furious whiffs from his pipe , to which he held fast the whole time with all his might , and to which he intends holding fast until the day of his death .
in the meantime the balloon arose like a lark , and , soaring far away above the city , at length drifted quietly behind a cloud similar to that from which it had so oddly emerged , and was thus lost forever to the wondering eyes of the good citizens of rotterdam .
all attention was now directed to the letter , the descent of which , and the consequences attending thereupon , had proved so fatally <unk> of both person and personal dignity to his excellency , the illustrious burgomaster <unk> <unk> <name> <unk> .
that <unk> , however , had not failed , during his <unk> movements , to bestow a thought upon the important subject of securing the packet in question , which was seen , upon inspection , to have fallen into the most proper hands , being actually addressed to himself and professor <unk> , in their official capacities of president and vice-president of the rotterdam college of astronomy .
it was accordingly opened by those dignitaries upon the spot , and found to contain the following extraordinary , and indeed very serious , communications .
to their excellencies <name> <unk> and <unk> , president and vice-president of the states ' college of astronomers , in the city of rotterdam .
" your excellencies may perhaps be able to remember an humble <unk> , by name <name> <unk> , and by occupation a <unk> of bellows , who , with three others , disappeared from rotterdam , about five years ago , in a manner which must have been considered by all parties at once sudden , and extremely unaccountable .
if , however , it so please your excellencies , i , the writer of this communication , am the identical <name> <unk> himself .
it is well known to most of my fellow citizens , that for the period of forty years i continued to occupy the little square brick building , at the head of the alley called sauerkraut , in which i resided at the time of my disappearance .
my ancestors have also resided therein time out of mind  they , as well as myself , steadily following the respectable and indeed lucrative profession of mending of bellows .
for , to speak the truth , until of late years , that the heads of all the people have been set <unk> with politics , no better business than my own could an honest citizen of rotterdam either <name> or deserve .
credit was good , employment was never wanting , and on all hands there was no lack of either money or good-will .
but , as i was saying , we soon began to feel the effects of <name> and long speeches , and <unk> , and all that sort of thing .
people who were formerly , the very best customers in the world , had now not a moment of time to think of us at all .
they had , so they said , as much as they could do to read about the revolutions , and keep up with the march of intellect and the spirit of the age .
if a fire wanted fanning , it could readily be fanned with a newspaper , and as the government grew weaker , i have no doubt that leather and iron acquired <unk> in proportion , for , in a very short time , there was not a pair of bellows in all rotterdam that ever stood in need of a stitch or required the assistance of a hammer .
this was a state of things not to be endured .
i soon grew as poor as a rat , and , having a wife and children to provide for , my burdens at length became intolerable , and i spent hour after hour in reflecting upon the most convenient method of putting an end to my life .
duns , in the meantime , left me little leisure for contemplation .
my house was literally besieged from morning till night , so that i began to rave , and foam , and fret like a caged tiger against the bars of his enclosure .
there were three fellows in particular who worried me beyond endurance , keeping watch continually about my door , and threatening me with the law .
upon these three i internally vowed the bitterest revenge , if ever i should be so happy as to get them within my clutches ; and i believe nothing in the world but the pleasure of this anticipation prevented me from putting my plan of suicide into immediate execution , by blowing my brains out with a <unk> .
i thought it best , however , to <unk> my wrath , and to treat them with promises and fair words , until , by some good turn of fate , an opportunity of vengeance should be afforded me .
" one day , having given my creditors the slip , and feeling more than usually dejected , i continued for a long time to wander about the most obscure streets without object whatever , until at length i chanced to stumble against the corner of a bookseller 's stall .
seeing a chair close at hand , for the use of customers , i threw myself doggedly into it , and , hardly knowing why , opened the pages of the first volume which came within my reach .
it proved to be a small pamphlet treatise on speculative astronomy , written either by professor <unk> of berlin or by a frenchman of somewhat similar name .
i had some little <unk> of information on matters of this nature , and soon became more and more absorbed in the contents of the book , reading it actually through twice before i awoke to a recollection of what was passing around me .
by this time it began to grow dark , and i directed my steps toward home .
but the treatise had made an indelible impression on my mind , and , as i sauntered along the dusky streets , i revolved carefully over in my memory the wild and sometimes unintelligible reasonings of the writer .
there are some particular passages which affected my imagination in a powerful and extraordinary manner .
the longer i meditated upon these the more intense grew the interest which had been excited within me .
the limited nature of my education in general , and more especially my ignorance on subjects connected with natural philosophy , so far from rendering me diffident of my own ability to comprehend what i had read , or inducing me to mistrust the many vague notions which had arisen in consequence , merely served as a farther stimulus to imagination ; and i was vain enough , or perhaps reasonable enough , to doubt whether those crude ideas which , arising in <unk> minds , have all the appearance , may not often in effect possess all the force , the reality , and other inherent properties , of instinct or intuition ; whether , to proceed a step farther , profundity itself might not , in matters of a purely speculative nature , be detected as a legitimate source of <unk> and error .
in other words , i believed , and still do believe , that truth , is frequently of its own essence , superficial , and that , in many cases , the depth lies more in the abysses where we seek her , than in the actual situations wherein she may be found .
nature herself seemed to afford me <unk> of these ideas .
in the contemplation of the heavenly bodies it struck me forcibly that i could not distinguish a <name> with nearly as much precision , when i gazed on it with <name> , direct and <unk> attention , as when i suffered my eye only to glance in its vicinity alone .
i was not , of course , at that time aware that this apparent paradox was occasioned by the center of the <unk> area being less susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the exterior portions of the retina .
this knowledge , and some of another kind , came afterwards in the course of an eventful five years , during which i have dropped the prejudices of my former humble situation in life , and forgotten the <unk> in far different occupations .
but at the epoch of which i speak , the analogy which a casual observation of a <name> offered to the conclusions i had already drawn , struck me with the force of positive conformation , and i then finally made up my mind to the course which i afterwards pursued .
" it was late when i reached home , and i went immediately to bed .
my mind , however , was too much occupied to sleep , and i lay the whole night buried in meditation .
arising early in the morning , and contriving again to escape the vigilance of my creditors , i repaired eagerly to the bookseller 's stall , and laid out what little ready money i possessed , in the purchase of some volumes of mechanics and practical astronomy .
having arrived at home safely with these , i devoted every spare moment to their perusal , and soon made such proficiency in studies of this nature as i thought sufficient for the execution of my plan .
in the intervals of this period , i made every endeavor to conciliate the three creditors who had given me so much annoyance .
in this i finally succeeded  partly by selling enough of my household furniture to satisfy a <unk> of their claim , and partly by a promise of paying the balance upon completion of a little project which i told them i had in view , and for assistance in which i <unk> their services .
by these means  for they were ignorant men  i found little difficulty in gaining them over to my purpose .
" matters being thus arranged , i contrived , by the aid of my wife and with the greatest secrecy and caution , to dispose of what property i had remaining , and to borrow , in small sums , under various <unk> , and without paying any attention to my future means of <unk> , no inconsiderable quantity of ready money .
with the means thus <unk> i proceeded to procure at intervals , <unk> muslin , very fine , in pieces of twelve yards each ; twine ; a lot of the varnish of <unk> ; a large and deep basket of <unk> , made to order ; and several other articles necessary in the construction and equipment of a balloon of extraordinary dimensions .
this i directed my wife to make up as soon as possible , and gave her all requisite information as to the particular method of proceeding .
in the meantime i worked up the twine into a net-work of sufficient dimensions ; rigged it with a hoop and the necessary cords ; bought a <unk> , a compass , a spy-glass , a common barometer with some important modifications , and two astronomical instruments not so generally known .
i then took opportunities of conveying by night , to a retired situation east of rotterdam , five <unk> casks , to contain about fifty gallons each , and one of a larger size ; six tinned ware tubes , three inches in diameter , properly shaped , and ten feet in length ; a quantity of a particular metallic substance , or <unk> , which i shall not name , and a dozen <unk> of a very common acid .
the gas to be formed from these latter materials is a gas never yet generated by any other person than myself  or at least never applied to any similar purpose .
the secret i would make no difficulty in disclosing , but that it of right belongs to a citizen of <unk> , in <name> , by whom it was <unk> communicated to myself .
the same individual submitted to me , without being at all aware of my intentions , a method of constructing balloons from the membrane of a certain animal , through which substance any escape of gas was nearly an impossibility .
i found it , however , altogether too expensive , and was not sure , upon the whole , whether <unk> muslin with a coating of gum <unk> , was not equally as good .
i mention this circumstance , because i think it probable that hereafter the individual in question may attempt a balloon ascension with the novel gas and material i have spoken of , and i do not wish to deprive him of the honor of a very singular invention .
" on the spot which i intended each of the smaller casks to occupy respectively during the inflation of the balloon , i privately dug a hole two feet deep ; the holes forming in this manner a circle twenty-five feet in diameter .
in the centre of this circle , being the station designed for the large cask , i also dug a hole three feet in depth .
in each of the five smaller holes , i deposited a <unk> containing fifty pounds , and in the larger one a keg holding one hundred and fifty pounds , of cannon powder .
these  the keg and <unk>  i connected in a proper manner with covered trains ; and having let into one of the <unk> the end of about four feet of slow match , i covered up the hole , and placed the cask over it , leaving the other end of the match protruding about an inch , and barely visible beyond the cask .
i then filled up the remaining holes , and placed the barrels over them in their destined situation .
" besides the articles above enumerated , i conveyed to the depot , and there secreted , one of m. <unk> 's improvements upon the apparatus for condensation of the atmospheric air .
i found this machine , however , to require considerable alteration before it could be adapted to the purposes to which i intended making it applicable .
but , with severe labor and <unk> perseverance , i at length met with entire success in all my preparations .
my balloon was soon completed .
it would contain more than forty thousand cubic feet of gas ; would take me up easily , i calculated , with all my implements , and , if i managed rightly , with one hundred and seventy-five pounds of ballast into the bargain .
it had received three coats of varnish , and i found the <unk> muslin to answer all the purposes of silk itself , quite as strong and a good deal less expensive .
" everything being now ready , i exacted from my wife an oath of secrecy in relation to all my actions from the day of my first visit to the bookseller 's stall ; and promising , on my part , to return as soon as circumstances would permit , i gave her what little money i had left , and bade her farewell .
indeed i had no fear on her account .
she was what people call a notable woman , and could manage matters in the world without my assistance .
i believe , to tell the truth , she always looked upon me as an idle boy , a mere <unk> , good for nothing but building castles in the air , and was rather glad to get rid of me .
it was a dark night when i bade her good-bye , and taking with me , as <unk> , the three creditors who had given me so much trouble , we carried the balloon , with the car and accoutrements , by a roundabout way , to the station where the other articles were deposited .
we there found them all unmolested , and i proceeded immediately to business .
" it was the first of <name> .
the night , as i said before , was dark ; there was not a <name> to be seen ; and a <unk> rain , falling at intervals , rendered us very uncomfortable .
but my chief anxiety was concerning the balloon , which , in spite of the varnish with which it was defended , began to grow rather heavy with the moisture ; the powder also was liable to damage .
i therefore kept my three duns working with great diligence , pounding down ice around the central cask , and stirring the acid in the others .
they did not cease , however , <unk> me with questions as to what i intended to do with all this apparatus , and expressed much dissatisfaction at the terrible labor i made them undergo .
they could not perceive , so they said , what good was likely to result from their getting wet to the skin , merely to take a part in such horrible incantations .
i began to get uneasy , and worked away with all my might , for i verily believe the idiots supposed that i had entered into a compact with the devil , and that , in short , what i was now doing was nothing better than it should be .
i was , therefore , in great fear of their leaving me altogether .
i contrived , however , to <unk> them by promises of payment of all scores in full , as soon as i could bring the present business to a termination .
to these speeches they gave , of course , their own interpretation ; <unk> , no doubt , that at all events i should come into possession of vast quantities of ready money ; and provided i paid them all i owed , and a trifle more , in consideration of their services , i dare say they cared very little what became of either my soul or my carcass .
" in about four hours and a half i found the balloon sufficiently inflated .
i attached the car , therefore , and put all my implements in it  not forgetting the condensing apparatus , a copious supply of water , and a large quantity of provisions , such as <unk> , in which much nutriment is contained in comparatively little bulk .
i also secured in the car a pair of pigeons and a cat .
it was now nearly daybreak , and i thought it high time to take my departure .
dropping a lighted cigar on the ground , as if by accident , i took the opportunity , in stooping to pick it up , of <unk> privately the piece of slow match , whose end , as i said before , protruded a very little beyond the lower rim of one of the smaller casks .
this manoeuvre was totally unperceived on the part of the three duns ; and , jumping into the car , i immediately cut the single cord which held me to the earth , and was pleased to find that i shot upward , carrying with all ease one hundred and seventy-five pounds of leaden ballast , and able to have carried up as many more .
" scarcely , however , had i attained the height of fifty yards , when , roaring and rumbling up after me in the most horrible and tumultuous manner , came so dense a hurricane of fire , and smoke , and sulphur , and legs and arms , and gravel , and burning wood , and blazing metal , that my very heart sunk within me , and i fell down in the bottom of the car , trembling with unmitigated terror .
indeed , i now perceived that i had entirely overdone the business , and that the main consequences of the shock were yet to be experienced .
accordingly , in less than a second , i felt all the blood in my body rushing to my temples , and immediately thereupon , a concussion , which i shall never forget , burst abruptly through the night and seemed to rip the very firmament asunder .
when i afterward had time for reflection , i did not fail to attribute the extreme violence of the explosion , as regarded myself , to its proper cause  my situation directly above it , and in the line of its greatest power .
but at the time , i thought only of preserving my life .
the balloon at first collapsed , then furiously expanded , then whirled round and round with horrible velocity , and finally , reeling and staggering like a drunken man , hurled me with great force over the rim of the car , and left me dangling , at a terrific height , with my head downward , and my face outwards , by a piece of slender cord about three feet in length , which <name> accidentally through a crevice near the bottom of the <unk> , and in which , as i fell , my left foot became most <unk> entangled .
it is impossible  utterly impossible  to form any adequate idea of the horror of my situation .
i gasped convulsively for breath  a shudder resembling a fit of the ague agitated every nerve and muscle of my frame  i felt my eyes starting from their sockets  a horrible nausea overwhelmed me  and at length i fainted away .
" how long i remained in this state it is impossible to say .
it must , however , have been no inconsiderable time , for when i partially recovered the sense of existence , i found the day breaking , the balloon at a prodigious height over a wilderness of ocean , and not a trace of land to be discovered far and wide within the limits of the vast horizon .
my sensations , however , upon thus recovering , were by no means so rife with agony as might have been anticipated .
indeed , there was much of incipient madness in the calm survey which i began to take of my situation .
i <name> up to my eyes each of my hands , one after the other , and wondered what occurrence could have given rise to the swelling of the veins , and the horrible blackness of the <unk> .
i afterward carefully examined my head , shaking it repeatedly , and feeling it with minute attention , until i succeeded in satisfying myself that it was not , as i had more than half suspected , larger than my balloon .
then , in a knowing manner , i felt in both my breeches pockets , and , missing therefrom a set of tablets and a toothpick case , endeavored to account for their disappearance , and not being able to do so , felt inexpressibly chagrined .
it now occurred to me that i suffered great uneasiness in the joint of my left ankle , and a dim consciousness of my situation began to glimmer through my mind .
but , strange to say !
i was neither astonished nor <unk> .
if i felt any emotion at all , it was a kind of chuckling satisfaction at the cleverness i was about to display in <unk> myself from this dilemma ; and i never , for a moment , looked upon my ultimate safety as a question susceptible of doubt .
for a few minutes i remained wrapped in the profoundest meditation .
i have a distinct recollection of frequently <unk> my lips , putting my forefinger to the side of my nose , and making use of other gesticulations and grimaces common to men who , at ease in their <unk> , meditate upon matters of intricacy or importance .
having , as i thought , sufficiently collected my ideas , i now , with great caution and deliberation , put my hands behind my back , and unfastened the large iron buckle which belonged to the <unk> of my <unk> .
this buckle had three teeth , which , being somewhat <name> , turned with great difficulty on their axis .
i brought them , however , after some trouble , at right angles to the body of the buckle , and was glad to find them remain firm in that position .
holding the instrument thus obtained within my teeth , i now proceeded to untie the knot of my cravat .
i had to rest several times before i could accomplish this manoeuvre , but it was at length accomplished .
to one end of the cravat i then made fast the buckle , and the other end i tied , for greater security , tightly around my wrist .
drawing now my body upwards , with a prodigious exertion of muscular force , i succeeded , at the very first trial , in throwing the buckle over the car , and <unk> it , as i had anticipated , in the circular rim of the <unk> .
" my body was now inclined towards the side of the car , at an <name> of about forty-five degrees ; but it must not be understood that i was therefore only forty-five degrees below the perpendicular .
so far from it , i still lay nearly level with the plane of the horizon ; for the change of situation which i had acquired , had forced the bottom of the car considerably outwards from my position , which was accordingly one of the most imminent and deadly peril .
it should be remembered , however , that when i fell in the first instance , from the car , if i had fallen with my face turned toward the balloon , instead of turned outwardly from it , as it actually was ; or if , in the second place , the cord by which i was suspended had chanced to <name> over the upper edge , instead of through a crevice near the bottom of the car ,  i say it may be readily conceived that , in either of these supposed cases , i should have been unable to accomplish even as much as i had now accomplished , and the wonderful adventures of <name> <unk> would have been utterly lost to posterity , i had therefore every reason to be grateful ; although , in point of fact , i was still too stupid to be anything at all , and <name> for , perhaps , a quarter of an hour in that extraordinary manner , without making the slightest farther exertion whatsoever , and in a singularly tranquil state of idiotic enjoyment .
but this feeling did not fail to die rapidly away , and <unk> succeeded horror , and dismay , and a chilling sense of utter helplessness and ruin .
in fact , the blood so long accumulating in the vessels of my head and throat , and which had hitherto buoyed up my spirits with madness and delirium , had now begun to retire within their proper channels , and the distinctness which was thus added to my perception of the danger , merely served to deprive me of the self-possession and courage to encounter it .
but this weakness was , luckily for me , of no very long duration .
in good time came to my rescue the spirit of despair , and , with frantic cries and struggles , i jerked my way bodily upwards , till at length , clutching with a <unk> grip the <unk> rim , i writhed my person over it , and fell headlong and shuddering within the car .
" it was not until some time afterward that i recovered myself sufficiently to attend to the ordinary cares of the balloon .
i then , however , examined it with attention , and found it , to my great relief , uninjured .
my implements were all safe , and , fortunately , i had lost neither ballast nor provisions .
indeed , i had so well secured them in their places , that such an accident was entirely out of the question .
looking at my watch , i found it six o'clock .
i was still rapidly ascending , and my barometer gave a present altitude of three and <unk> miles .
immediately beneath me in the ocean , lay a small black object , slightly oblong in shape , seemingly about the size , and in every way bearing a great resemblance to one of those childish toys called a <unk> .
bringing my telescope to bear upon it , i plainly discerned it to be a british ninety <unk> ship , <unk> , and pitching heavily in the sea with her head to the <unk> .
besides this ship , i saw nothing but the ocean and the sky , and the sun , which had long arisen .
" it is now high time that i should explain to your excellencies the object of my perilous voyage .
your excellencies <name> bear in mind that distressed circumstances in rotterdam had at length driven me to the resolution of committing suicide .
it was not , however , that to life itself i had any , positive disgust , but that i was harassed beyond endurance by the <unk> miseries attending my situation .
in this state of mind , wishing to live , yet wearied with life , the treatise at the stall of the bookseller opened a resource to my imagination .
i then finally made up my mind .
i determined to depart , yet live  to leave the world , yet continue to exist  in short , to drop <unk> , i resolved , let what would ensue , to force a passage , if i could , to the moon .
now , lest i should be supposed more of a madman than i actually am , i <name> detail , as well as i am able , the considerations which led me to believe that an achievement of this nature , although without doubt difficult , and <unk> full of danger , was not absolutely , to a bold spirit , beyond the confines of the possible .
" the moon 's actual distance from the earth was the first thing to be attended to .
now , the mean or average interval between the centres of the two planets is <unk> of the earth 's equatorial radii , or only about <unk> miles .
i say the mean or average interval .
but it must be borne in mind that the form of the moon 's orbit being an ellipse of eccentricity amounting to no less than <unk> of the <name> <unk> of the ellipse itself , and the earth 's centre being situated in its focus , if i could , in any manner , contrive to meet the moon , as it were , in its <unk> , the above mentioned distance would be materially diminished .
but , to say nothing at present of this possibility , it was very certain that , at all events , from the <unk> miles i would have to <unk> the radius of the earth , say 4,000 , and the radius of the moon , say <unk> , in all <unk> , leaving an actual interval to be traversed , under average circumstances , of <unk> miles .
now this , i reflected , was no very extraordinary distance .
travelling on land has been repeatedly accomplished at the rate of thirty miles per hour , and indeed a much greater speed may be anticipated .
but even at this velocity , it would take me no more than 322 days to reach the surface of the moon .
there were , however , many particulars inducing me to believe that my average rate of travelling might possibly very much exceed that of thirty miles per hour , and , as these considerations did not fail to make a deep impression upon my mind , i <name> mention them more fully hereafter .
" the next point to be regarded was a matter of far greater importance .
from indications afforded by the barometer , we find that , in <unk> from the surface of the earth we have , at the height of 1,000 feet , left below us about <unk> of the entire mass of atmospheric air , that at <unk> we have ascended through nearly one-third ; and that at <unk> , which is not far from the elevation of <unk> , we have surmounted one-half the material , or , at all events , one-half the <unk> , body of air incumbent upon our globe .
it is also calculated that at an altitude not exceeding the hundredth part of the earth 's diameter  that is , not exceeding eighty miles  the rarefaction would be so excessive that animal life could in no manner be sustained , and , moreover , that the most delicate means we possess of ascertaining the presence of the atmosphere would be inadequate to assure us of its existence .
but i did not fail to perceive that these latter calculations are founded altogether on our experimental knowledge of the properties of air , and the mechanical laws regulating its <unk> and compression , in what may be called , comparatively speaking , the immediate vicinity of the earth itself ; and , at the same time , it is taken for granted that animal life is and must be essentially incapable of modification at any given unattainable distance from the surface .
now , all such reasoning and from such data must , of course , be simply analogical .
the greatest height ever reached by man was that of 25,000 feet , attained in the <unk> expedition of messieurs <unk> and <unk> .
this is a moderate altitude , even when compared with the eighty miles in question ; and i could not help thinking that the subject admitted room for doubt and great latitude for speculation .
" but , in point of fact , an ascension being made to any given altitude , the <unk> quantity of air surmounted in any farther ascension is by no means in proportion to the additional height ascended ( as may be plainly seen from what has been stated before ) , but in a ratio constantly decreasing .
it is therefore evident that , ascend as high as we may , we can not , literally speaking , arrive at a limit beyond which no atmosphere is to be found .
it must exist , i argued ; although it may exist in a state of infinite rarefaction .
" on the other hand , i was aware that arguments have not been wanting to prove the existence of a real and definite limit to the atmosphere , beyond which there is absolutely no air whatsoever .
but a circumstance which has been left out of view by those who contend for such a limit seemed to me , although no positive refutation of their creed , still a point worthy very serious investigation .
on comparing the intervals between the successive arrivals of <unk> 's comet at its <unk> , after giving credit , in the most exact manner , for all the disturbances due to the attractions of the planets , it appears that the periods are gradually diminishing ; that is to say , the <name> axis of the <unk> ellipse is growing shorter , in a slow but perfectly regular decrease .
now , this is precisely what ought to be the case , if we suppose a resistance experienced from the comet from an extremely rare ethereal medium pervading the regions of its orbit .
for it is evident that such a medium must , in retarding the comet 's velocity , increase its centripetal , by weakening its centrifugal force .
in other words , the sun 's attraction would be constantly attaining greater power , and the comet would be drawn nearer at every revolution .
indeed , there is no other way of accounting for the variation in question .
but again .
the real diameter of the same comet 's <unk> is observed to contract rapidly as it approaches the sun , and <unk> with equal rapidity in its departure towards its <unk> .
was i not justifiable in supposing with m. <unk> , that this apparent condensation of volume has its origin in the compression of the same ethereal medium i have spoken of before , and which is only denser in proportion to its solar vicinity ?
the <unk> phenomenon , also called the <unk> light , was a matter worthy of attention .
this radiance , so apparent in the tropics , and which can not be mistaken for any <unk> lustre , extends from the horizon obliquely upward , and follows generally the direction of the sun 's equator .
it appeared to me evidently in the nature of a rare atmosphere extending from the sun outward , beyond the orbit of <name> at least , and i believed indefinitely farther .
( <unk> ) indeed , this medium i could not suppose confined to the path of the comet 's ellipse , or to the immediate neighborhood of the sun .
it was easy , on the contrary , to imagine it pervading the entire regions of our <unk> system , condensed into what we call atmosphere at the planets themselves , and perhaps at some of them modified by considerations , so to speak , purely geological .
" having adopted this view of the subject , i had little further hesitation .
granting that on my passage i should meet with atmosphere essentially the same as at the surface of the earth , i conceived that , by means of the very ingenious apparatus of m. <unk> , i should readily be enabled to condense it in sufficient quantity for the purposes of respiration .
this would remove the chief obstacle in a journey to the moon .
i had indeed spent some money and great labor in adapting the apparatus to the object intended , and confidently looked forward to its successful application , if i could manage to complete the voyage within any reasonable period .
this brings me back to the rate at which it might be possible to travel .
" it is true that balloons , in the first stage of their <unk> from the earth , are known to rise with a velocity comparatively moderate .
now , the power of elevation lies altogether in the superior lightness of the gas in the balloon compared with the atmospheric air ; and , at first sight , it does not appear probable that , as the balloon acquires altitude , and consequently arrives successively in atmospheric strata of <unk> rapidly diminishing  i say , it does not appear at all reasonable that , in this its progress upwards , the original velocity should be accelerated .
on the other hand , i was not aware that , in any recorded ascension , a diminution was apparent in the absolute rate of ascent ; although such should have been the case , if on account of nothing else , on account of the escape of gas through balloons <unk> , and varnished with no better material than the ordinary varnish .
it seemed , therefore , that the effect of such escape was only sufficient to <unk> the effect of some <unk> power .
i now considered that , provided in my passage i found the medium i had imagined , and provided that it should prove to be actually and essentially what we <unk> atmospheric air , it could make comparatively little difference at what extreme state of rarefaction i should discover it  that is to say , in regard to my power of ascending  for the gas in the balloon would not only be itself subject to rarefaction partially similar ( in proportion to the occurrence of which , i could suffer an escape of so much as would be requisite to prevent explosion ) , but , being what it was , would , at all events , continue specifically lighter than any compound whatever of mere nitrogen and oxygen .
in the meantime , the force of gravitation would be constantly diminishing , in proportion to the squares of the distances , and thus , with a velocity prodigiously <unk> , i should at length arrive in those distant regions where the force of the <unk> attraction would be superseded by that of the moon .
in accordance with these ideas , i did not think it worth while to <unk> myself with more provisions than would be sufficient for a period of forty days .
" there was still , however , another difficulty , which occasioned me some little <unk> .
it has been observed , that , in balloon <unk> to any considerable height , besides the pain attending respiration , great uneasiness is experienced about the head and body , often accompanied with bleeding at the nose , and other symptoms of an alarming kind , and growing more and more inconvenient in proportion to the altitude attained .
( <unk> ) this was a reflection of a nature somewhat startling .
was it not probable that these symptoms would increase indefinitely , or at least until terminated by death itself ?
i finally thought not .
their origin was to be looked for in the progressive removal of the customary atmospheric pressure upon the surface of the body , and consequent <unk> of the superficial blood-vessels  not in any positive <unk> of the animal system , as in the case of difficulty in breathing , where the atmospheric density is chemically insufficient for the due <unk> of blood in a <unk> of the heart .
unless for default of this <unk> , i could see no reason , therefore , why life could not be sustained even in a vacuum ; for the expansion and compression of chest , commonly called breathing , is action purely muscular , and the cause , not the effect , of respiration .
in a word , i conceived that , as the body should become habituated to the want of atmospheric pressure , the sensations of pain would gradually diminish  and to endure them while they continued , i relied with confidence upon the iron hardihood of my constitution .
" thus , may it please your excellencies , i have detailed some , though by no means all , the considerations which led me to form the project of a lunar voyage .
i shall now proceed to lay before you the result of an attempt so apparently audacious in <name> , and , at all events , so utterly unparalleled in the annals of mankind .
" having attained the altitude before mentioned , that is to say three miles and three-quarters , i threw out from the car a quantity of feathers , and found that i still ascended with sufficient rapidity ; there was , therefore , no necessity for discharging any ballast .
i was glad of this , for i wished to retain with me as much weight as i could <name> , for reasons which <name> be explained in the sequel .
i as yet suffered no bodily inconvenience , breathing with great freedom , and feeling no pain whatever in the head .
the cat was lying very demurely upon my coat , which i had taken off , and eyeing the pigeons with an air of nonchalance .
these latter being tied by the leg , to prevent their escape , were busily employed in picking up some grains of rice scattered for them in the bottom of the car .
" at twenty minutes past six o'clock , the barometer showed an elevation of <unk> feet , or five miles to a fraction .
the prospect seemed unbounded .
indeed , it is very easily calculated by means of spherical geometry , what a great extent of the earth 's area i beheld .
the convex surface of any segment of a sphere is , to the entire surface of the sphere itself , as the versed <unk> of the segment to the diameter of the sphere .
now , in my case , the versed <unk>  that is to say , the thickness of the segment beneath me  was about equal to my elevation , or the elevation of the point of sight above the surface .
'as five miles , then , to eight thousand , ' would express the proportion of the earth 's area seen by me .
in other words , i beheld as much as a <unk> part of the whole surface of the globe .
the sea appeared unruffled as a mirror , although , by means of the spy-glass , i could perceive it to be in a state of violent agitation .
the ship was no longer visible , having drifted away , apparently to the eastward .
i now began to experience , at intervals , severe pain in the head , especially about the ears  still , however , breathing with tolerable freedom .
the cat and pigeons seemed to suffer no inconvenience whatsoever .
" at twenty minutes before seven , the balloon entered a long series of dense cloud , which put me to great trouble , by damaging my condensing apparatus and wetting me to the skin .
this was , to be sure , a singular <unk> , for i had not believed it possible that a cloud of this nature could be sustained at so great an elevation .
i thought it best , however , to throw out two <unk> pieces of ballast , reserving still a weight of one hundred and sixty-five pounds .
upon so doing , i soon rose above the difficulty , and perceived immediately , that i had obtained a great increase in my rate of ascent .
in a few seconds after my leaving the cloud , a flash of vivid lightning shot from one end of it to the other , and caused it to kindle up , throughout its vast extent , like a mass of ignited and glowing charcoal .
this , it must be remembered , was in the broad light of day .
no fancy may picture the sublimity which might have been exhibited by a similar phenomenon taking place amid the darkness of the night .
hell itself might have been found a fitting image .
even as it was , my hair stood on end , while i gazed afar down within the yawning abysses , letting imagination descend , as it were , and stalk about in the strange vaulted halls , and ruddy <unk> , and red ghastly chasms of the hideous and unfathomable fire .
i had indeed made a narrow escape .
had the balloon remained a very short while longer within the cloud  that is to say  had not the inconvenience of getting wet , determined me to discharge the ballast , inevitable ruin would have been the consequence .
such perils , although little considered , are perhaps the greatest which must be encountered in balloons .
i had by this time , however , attained too great an elevation to be any longer uneasy on this head .
" i was now rising rapidly , and by seven o'clock the barometer indicated an altitude of no less than nine miles and a half .
i began to find great difficulty in drawing my breath .
my head , too , was excessively painful ; and , having felt for some time a moisture about my cheeks , i at length discovered it to be blood , which was oozing quite fast from the drums of my ears .
my eyes , also , gave me great uneasiness .
upon passing the hand over them they seemed to have protruded from their sockets in no inconsiderable degree ; and all objects in the car , and even the balloon itself , appeared distorted to my vision .
these symptoms were more than i had expected , and occasioned me some alarm .
at this juncture , very <unk> , and without consideration , i threw out from the car three <unk> pieces of ballast .
the accelerated rate of ascent thus obtained , carried me too rapidly , and without sufficient gradation , into a highly rarefied stratum of the atmosphere , and the result had nearly proved fatal to my expedition and to myself .
i was suddenly seized with a spasm which lasted for more than five minutes , and even when this , in a measure , ceased , i could catch my breath only at long intervals , and in a gasping manner  bleeding all the while copiously at the nose and ears , and even slightly at the eyes .
the pigeons appeared distressed in the extreme , and struggled to escape ; while the cat <unk> piteously , and , with her tongue hanging out of her mouth , staggered to and fro in the car as if under the influence of poison .
i now too late discovered the great rashness of which i had been guilty in discharging the ballast , and my agitation was excessive .
i anticipated nothing less than death , and death in a few minutes .
the physical suffering i underwent contributed also to render me nearly incapable of making any exertion for the preservation of my life .
i had , indeed , little power of reflection left , and the violence of the pain in my head seemed to be greatly on the increase .
thus i found that my senses would shortly give way altogether , and i had already clutched one of the valve ropes with the view of attempting a descent , when the recollection of the trick i had played the three creditors , and the possible consequences to myself , should i return , operated to <unk> me for the moment .
i lay down in the bottom of the car , and endeavored to collect my faculties .
in this i so far succeeded as to determine upon the experiment of losing blood .
having no <unk> , however , i was constrained to perform the operation in the best manner i was able , and finally succeeded in opening a vein in my right arm , with the blade of my penknife .
the blood had hardly commenced flowing when i experienced a sensible relief , and by the time i had lost about half a moderate basin full , most of the worst symptoms had abandoned me entirely .
i nevertheless did not think it expedient to attempt getting on my feet immediately ; but , having tied up my arm as well as i could , i lay still for about a quarter of an hour .
at the end of this time i arose , and found myself freer from absolute pain of any kind than i had been during the last hour and a quarter of my ascension .
the difficulty of breathing , however , was diminished in a very slight degree , and i found that it would soon be positively necessary to make use of my condenser .
in the meantime , looking toward the cat , who was again snugly stowed away upon my coat , i discovered to my infinite surprise , that she had taken the opportunity of my <unk> to bring into light a litter of three little kittens .
this was an addition to the number of passengers on my part altogether unexpected ; but i was pleased at the occurrence .
it would afford me a chance of bringing to a kind of test the truth of a surmise , which , more than anything else , had influenced me in attempting this ascension .
i had imagined that the habitual endurance of the atmospheric pressure at the surface of the earth was the cause , or nearly so , of the pain attending animal existence at a distance above the surface .
should the kittens be found to suffer uneasiness in an equal degree with their mother , i must consider my theory in fault , but a failure to do so i should look upon as a strong confirmation of my idea .
" by eight o'clock i had actually attained an elevation of seventeen miles above the surface of the earth .
thus it seemed to me evident that my rate of ascent was not only on the increase , but that the progression would have been apparent in a slight degree even had i not discharged the ballast which i did .
the pains in my head and ears returned , at intervals , with violence , and i still continued to bleed occasionally at the nose ; but , upon the whole , i suffered much less than might have been expected .
i breathed , however , at every moment , with more and more difficulty , and each <unk> was attended with a troublesome spasmodic action of the chest .
i now unpacked the condensing apparatus , and got it ready for immediate use .
" the view of the earth , at this period of my ascension , was beautiful indeed .
to the westward , the northward , and the southward , as far as i could see , lay a boundless sheet of apparently unruffled ocean , which every moment gained a deeper and a deeper tint of blue and began already to assume a slight appearance of <unk> .
at a vast distance to the eastward , although perfectly discernible , extended the islands of great britain , the entire atlantic coasts of <name> and spain , with a small portion of the northern part of the continent of africa .
of individual edifices not a trace could be discovered , and the proudest cities of mankind had utterly faded away from the face of the earth .
from the rock of gibraltar , now dwindled into a dim speck , the dark mediterranean sea , dotted with shining islands as the heaven is dotted with stars , spread itself out to the eastward as far as my vision extended , until its entire mass of waters seemed at length to tumble headlong over the abyss of the horizon , and i found myself listening on tiptoe for the echoes of the mighty cataract .
overhead , the sky was of a <unk> black , and the stars were brilliantly visible .
" the pigeons about this time seeming to undergo much suffering , i determined upon giving them their <name> .
i first untied one of them , a beautiful <unk> pigeon , and placed him upon the rim of the <unk> .
he appeared extremely uneasy , looking anxiously around him , fluttering his wings , and making a loud cooing noise , but could not be persuaded to trust himself from off the car .
i took him up at last , and threw him to about half a dozen yards from the balloon .
he made , however , no attempt to descend as i had expected , but struggled with great vehemence to get back , uttering at the same time very shrill and piercing cries .
he at length succeeded in regaining his former station on the rim , but had hardly done so when his head dropped upon his breast , and he fell dead within the car .
the other one did not prove so unfortunate .
to prevent his following the example of his companion , and accomplishing a return , i threw him downward with all my force , and was pleased to find him continue his descent , with great velocity , making use of his wings with ease , and in a perfectly natural manner .
in a very short time he was out of sight , and i have no doubt he reached home in safety .
puss , who seemed in a great measure recovered from her illness , now made a hearty meal of the dead bird and then went to sleep with much apparent satisfaction .
her kittens were quite lively , and so far evinced not the slightest sign of any uneasiness whatever .
" at a <unk> eight , being no longer able to draw breath without the most intolerable pain , i proceeded forthwith to adjust around the car the apparatus belonging to the condenser .
this apparatus <name> require some little explanation , and your excellencies <name> please to bear in mind that my object , in the first place , was to surround myself and cat entirely with a barricade against the highly rarefied atmosphere in which i was existing , with the intention of introducing within this barricade , by means of my condenser , a quantity of this same atmosphere sufficiently condensed for the purposes of respiration .
with this object in view i had prepared a very strong perfectly <unk> , but flexible <unk> bag .
in this bag , which was of sufficient dimensions , the entire car was in a manner placed .
that is to say , it ( the bag ) was drawn over the whole bottom of the car , up its sides , and so on , along the outside of the ropes , to the upper rim or hoop where the net-work is attached .
having pulled the bag up in this way , and formed a complete enclosure on all sides , and at bottom , it was now necessary to fasten up its top or mouth , by passing its material over the hoop of the net-work  in other words , between the net-work and the hoop .
but if the net-work were separated from the hoop to admit this passage , what was to sustain the car in the meantime ?
now the net-work was not permanently fastened to the hoop , but attached by a series of running loops or <unk> .
i therefore undid only a few of these loops at one time , leaving the car suspended by the remainder .
having thus inserted a portion of the cloth forming the upper part of the bag , i <unk> the loops  not to the hoop , for that would have been impossible , since the cloth now intervened  but to a series of large buttons , affixed to the cloth itself , about three feet below the mouth of the bag , the intervals between the buttons having been made to correspond to the intervals between the loops .
this done , a few more of the loops were unfastened from the rim , a farther portion of the cloth introduced , and the disengaged loops then connected with their proper buttons .
in this way it was possible to insert the whole upper part of the bag between the net-work and the hoop .
it is evident that the hoop would now drop down within the car , while the whole weight of the car itself , with all its contents , would be held up merely by the strength of the buttons .
this , at first sight , would seem an inadequate dependence ; but it was by no means so , for the buttons were not only very strong in themselves , but so close together that a very slight portion of the whole weight was supported by any one of them .
indeed , had the car and contents been three times heavier than they were , i should not have been at all uneasy .
i now raised up the hoop again within the covering of <unk> , and propped it at nearly its former height by means of three light poles prepared for the occasion .
this was done , of course , to keep the bag distended at the top , and to preserve the lower part of the net-work in its proper situation .
all that now remained was to fasten up the mouth of the enclosure ; and this was readily accomplished by gathering the folds of the material together , and twisting them up very tightly on the inside by means of a kind of stationary <unk> .
" in the sides of the covering thus adjusted round the car , had been inserted three circular panes of thick but clear glass , through which i could see without difficulty around me in every horizontal direction .
in that portion of the cloth forming the bottom , was likewise , a fourth window , of the same kind , and corresponding with a small aperture in the floor of the car itself .
this enabled me to see perpendicularly down , but having found it impossible to place any similar contrivance overhead , on account of the peculiar manner of closing up the opening there , and the consequent wrinkles in the cloth , i could expect to see no objects situated directly in my zenith .
this , of course , was a matter of little consequence ; for had i even been able to place a window at top , the balloon itself would have prevented my making any use of it .
" about a foot below one of the side windows was a circular opening , eight inches in diameter , and fitted with a brass rim adapted in its inner edge to the windings of a screw .
in this rim was screwed the large tube of the condenser , the body of the machine being , of course , within the chamber of <unk> .
through this tube a quantity of the rare atmosphere <unk> being drawn by means of a vacuum created in the body of the machine , was thence discharged , in a state of condensation , to mingle with the thin air already in the chamber .
this operation being repeated several times , at length filled the chamber with atmosphere proper for all the purposes of respiration .
but in so confined a space it would , in a short time , necessarily become foul , and unfit for use from frequent contact with the lungs .
it was then ejected by a small valve at the bottom of the car  the dense air readily sinking into the thinner atmosphere below .
to avoid the inconvenience of making a total vacuum at any moment within the chamber , this purification was never accomplished all at once , but in a gradual manner  the valve being opened only for a few seconds , then closed again , until one or two strokes from the pump of the condenser had supplied the place of the atmosphere ejected .
for the sake of experiment i had put the cat and kittens in a small basket , and suspended it outside the car to a button at the bottom , close by the valve , through which i could feed them at any moment when necessary .
i did this at some little risk , and before closing the mouth of the chamber , by reaching under the car with one of the poles before mentioned to which a hook had been attached .
" by the time i had fully completed these arrangements and filled the chamber as explained , it wanted only ten minutes of nine o'clock .
during the whole period of my being thus employed , i endured the most terrible distress from difficulty of respiration , and bitterly did i repent the negligence or rather <unk> , of which i had been guilty , of putting off to the last moment a matter of so much importance .
but having at length accomplished it , i soon began to reap the benefit of my invention .
once again i breathed with perfect freedom and ease  and indeed why should i not ?
i was also <unk> surprised to find myself , in a great measure , relieved from the violent pains which had hitherto tormented me .
a slight headache , accompanied with a sensation of fulness or <unk> about the wrists , the ankles , and the throat , was nearly all of which i had now to complain .
thus it seemed evident that a greater part of the uneasiness attending the removal of atmospheric pressure had actually worn off , as i had expected , and that much of the pain endured for the last two hours should have been attributed altogether to the effects of a deficient respiration .
" at twenty minutes before nine o'clock  that is to say , a short time prior to my closing up the mouth of the chamber , the mercury attained its limit , or ran down , in the barometer , which , as i mentioned before , was one of an extended construction .
it then indicated an altitude on my part of <unk> feet , or five-and-twenty miles , and i consequently surveyed at that time an extent of the earth 's area amounting to no less than the three <unk> part of its entire <unk> .
at nine o'clock i had again lost sight of land to the eastward , but not before i became aware that the balloon was drifting rapidly to the n. n. w. the <unk> of the ocean beneath me was very evident indeed , although my view was often interrupted by the masses of cloud which floated to and fro .
i observed now that even the lightest <unk> never rose to more than ten miles above the level of the sea .
" at half past nine i tried the experiment of throwing out a handful of feathers through the valve .
they did not float as i had expected ; but dropped down perpendicularly , like a bullet , en <unk> , and with the greatest velocity  being out of sight in a very few seconds .
i did not at first know what to make of this extraordinary phenomenon ; not being able to believe that my rate of ascent had , of a sudden , met with so prodigious an <unk> .
but it soon occurred to me that the atmosphere was now far too rare to sustain even the feathers ; that they actually fell , as they appeared to do , with great rapidity ; and that i had been surprised by the united <unk> of their descent and my own elevation .
" by ten o'clock i found that i had very little to occupy my immediate attention .
affairs went <unk> , and i believed the balloon to be going upward with a speed increasing momently although i had no longer any means of ascertaining the progression of the increase .
i suffered no pain or uneasiness of any kind , and enjoyed better spirits than i had at any period since my departure from rotterdam , <unk> myself now in examining the state of my various apparatus , and now in <unk> the atmosphere within the chamber .
this latter point i determined to attend to at regular intervals of forty minutes , more on account of the preservation of my health , than from so frequent a <unk> being absolutely necessary .
in the meanwhile i could not help making anticipations .
fancy revelled in the wild and dreamy regions of the moon .
imagination , feeling herself for once <unk> , roamed at <name> among the <unk> wonders of a shadowy and unstable land .
now there were hoary and <unk> forests , and <unk> precipices , and waterfalls tumbling with a loud noise into abysses without a bottom .
then i came suddenly into still noonday solitudes , where no wind of heaven ever intruded , and where vast meadows of poppies , and slender , <unk> flowers spread themselves out a weary distance , all silent and motionless forever .
then again i journeyed far down away into another country where it was all one dim and vague lake , with a boundary line of clouds .
and out of this melancholy water arose a forest of tall eastern trees , like a wilderness of dreams .
and i have in mind that the shadows of the trees which fell upon the lake remained not on the surface where they fell , but sunk slowly and steadily down , and commingled with the waves , while from the trunks of the trees other shadows were continually coming out , and taking the place of their brothers thus entombed .
" this then , " i said thoughtfully , " is the very reason why the waters of this lake grow blacker with age , and more melancholy as the hours run on . "
but fancies such as these were not the sole possessors of my <name> .
horrors of a nature most stern and most appalling would too frequently <unk> themselves upon my mind , and shake the innermost depths of my soul with the bare supposition of their possibility .
yet i would not suffer my thoughts for any length of time to dwell upon these latter speculations , rightly judging the real and palpable dangers of the voyage sufficient for my undivided attention .
" at five o'clock , p.m. , being engaged in <unk> the atmosphere within the chamber , i took that opportunity of observing the cat and kittens through the valve .
the cat herself appeared to suffer again very much , and i had no hesitation in attributing her uneasiness chiefly to a difficulty in breathing ; but my experiment with the kittens had resulted very strangely .
i had expected , of course , to see them betray a sense of pain , although in a less degree than their mother , and this would have been sufficient to confirm my opinion concerning the habitual endurance of atmospheric pressure .
but i was not prepared to find them , upon close examination , evidently enjoying a high degree of health , breathing with the greatest ease and perfect regularity , and evincing not the slightest sign of any uneasiness whatever .
i could only account for all this by extending my theory , and supposing that the highly rarefied atmosphere around might perhaps not be , as i had taken for granted , chemically insufficient for the purposes of life , and that a person born in such a medium might , possibly , be unaware of any inconvenience attending its <unk> , while , upon removal to the denser strata near the earth , he might endure tortures of a similar nature to those i had so lately experienced .
it has since been to me a matter of deep regret that an awkward accident , at this time , occasioned me the loss of my little family of cats , and deprived me of the insight into this matter which a continued experiment might have afforded .
in passing my hand through the valve , with a cup of water for the old puss , the sleeves of my shirt became entangled in the loop which sustained the basket , and thus , in a moment , loosened it from the bottom .
had the whole actually vanished into air , it could not have shot from my sight in a more abrupt and instantaneous manner .
positively , there could not have intervened the tenth part of a second between the <unk> of the basket and its absolute and total disappearance with all that it contained .
my good wishes followed it to the earth , but of course , i had no <name> that either cat or kittens would ever live to tell the tale of their misfortune .
" at six o'clock , i perceived a great portion of the earth 's visible area to the eastward involved in thick shadow , which continued to advance with great rapidity , until , at five minutes before seven , the whole surface in view was enveloped in the darkness of night .
it was not , however , until long after this time that the rays of the setting sun ceased to <unk> the balloon ; and this circumstance , although of course fully anticipated , did not fail to give me an infinite deal of pleasure .
it was evident that , in the morning , i should behold the rising <unk> many hours at least before the citizens of rotterdam , in spite of their situation so much farther to the eastward , and thus , day after day , in proportion to the height ascended , would i enjoy the light of the sun for a longer and a longer period .
i now determined to keep a journal of my passage , reckoning the days from one to twenty-four hours continuously , without taking into consideration the intervals of darkness .
" at ten o'clock , feeling sleepy , i determined to lie down for the rest of the night ; but here a difficulty presented itself , which , obvious as it may appear , had escaped my attention up to the very moment of which i am now speaking .
if i went to sleep as i proposed , how could the atmosphere in the chamber be <unk> in the <unk> ?
to breathe it for more than an hour , at the farthest , would be a matter of impossibility , or , if even this term could be extended to an hour and a quarter , the most ruinous consequences might ensue .
the consideration of this dilemma gave me no little <unk> ; and it <name> hardly be believed , that , after the dangers i had undergone , i should look upon this business in so serious a light , as to give up all <name> of accomplishing my ultimate design , and finally make up my mind to the necessity of a descent .
but this hesitation was only momentary .
i reflected that man is the veriest slave of custom , and that many points in the routine of his existence are deemed essentially important , which are only so at all by his having rendered them habitual .
it was very certain that i could not do without sleep ; but i might easily bring myself to feel no inconvenience from being awakened at intervals of an hour during the whole period of my repose .
it would require but five minutes at most to <unk> the atmosphere in the fullest manner , and the only real difficulty was to contrive a method of arousing myself at the proper moment for so doing .
but this was a question which , i am willing to confess , occasioned me no little trouble in its solution .
to be sure , i had heard of the student who , to prevent his falling asleep over his books , held in one hand a ball of copper , the din of whose descent into a basin of the same metal on the floor beside his chair , served effectually to startle him up , if , at any moment , he should be overcome with drowsiness .
my own case , however , was very different indeed , and left me no room for any similar idea ; for i did not wish to keep awake , but to be aroused from slumber at regular intervals of time .
i at length hit upon the following expedient , which , simple as it may seem , was hailed by me , at the moment of discovery , as an invention fully equal to that of the telescope , the steam-engine , or the <name> of printing itself .
" it is necessary to premise , that the balloon , at the elevation now attained , continued its course upward with an even and <unk> ascent , and the car consequently followed with a steadiness so perfect that it would have been impossible to detect in it the slightest <unk> whatever .
this circumstance favored me greatly in the project i now determined to adopt .
my supply of water had been put on board in <unk> containing five gallons each , and ranged very securely around the interior of the car .
i unfastened one of these , and taking two ropes tied them tightly across the rim of the <unk> from one side to the other ; placing them about a foot apart and parallel so as to form a kind of shelf , upon which i placed the keg , and steadied it in a horizontal position .
about eight inches immediately below these ropes , and four feet from the bottom of the car i fastened another shelf  but made of thin plank , being the only similar piece of wood i had .
upon this latter shelf , and exactly beneath one of the rims of the keg , a small <unk> pitcher was deposited .
i now bored a hole in the end of the keg over the pitcher , and fitted in a plug of soft wood , cut in a tapering or conical shape .
this plug i pushed in or pulled out , as might happen , until , after a few experiments , it arrived at that exact degree of <unk> , at which the water , oozing from the hole , and falling into the pitcher below , would fill the latter to the brim in the period of sixty minutes .
this , of course , was a matter briefly and easily ascertained , by noticing the proportion of the pitcher filled in any given time .
having arranged all this , the rest of the plan is obvious .
my bed was so contrived upon the floor of the car , as to bring my head , in lying down , immediately below the mouth of the pitcher .
it was evident , that , at the expiration of an hour , the pitcher , getting full , would be forced to run over , and to run over at the mouth , which was somewhat lower than the rim .
it was also evident , that the water thus falling from a height of more than four feet , could not do otherwise than fall upon my face , and that the sure consequences would be , to waken me up instantaneously , even from the soundest slumber in the world .
" it was fully eleven by the time i had completed these arrangements , and i immediately betook myself to bed , with full confidence in the efficiency of my invention .
nor in this matter was i disappointed .
punctually every sixty minutes was i aroused by my trusty <unk> , when , having emptied the pitcher into the <unk> of the keg , and performed the duties of the condenser , i retired again to bed .
these regular interruptions to my slumber caused me even less discomfort than i had anticipated ; and when i finally arose for the day , it was seven o'clock , and the sun had attained many degrees above the line of my horizon .
" <name> 3d .
i found the balloon at an immense height indeed , and the earth 's apparent <unk> increased in a material degree .
below me in the ocean lay a cluster of black specks , which undoubtedly were islands .
far away to the northward i perceived a thin , white , and exceedingly brilliant line , or streak , on the edge of the horizon , and i had no hesitation in supposing it to be the southern disk of the <unk> of the polar sea .
my curiosity was greatly excited , for i had hopes of passing on much farther to the north , and might possibly , at some period , find myself placed directly above the pole itself .
i now lamented that my great elevation would , in this case , prevent my taking as accurate a survey as i could wish .
much , however , might be ascertained .
nothing else of an extraordinary nature occurred during the day .
my apparatus all continued in good order , and the balloon still ascended without any perceptible <unk> .
the cold was intense , and obliged me to wrap up closely in an overcoat .
when darkness came over the earth , i betook myself to bed , although it was for many hours afterward broad daylight all around my immediate situation .
the <unk> was punctual in its duty , and i slept until next morning soundly , with the exception of the periodical interruption .
" <name> 4th .
arose in good health and spirits , and was astonished at the singular change which had taken place in the appearance of the sea .
it had lost , in a great measure , the deep tint of blue it had hitherto worn , being now of a <unk> , and of a lustre dazzling to the eye .
the islands were no longer visible ; whether they had passed down the horizon to the southeast , or whether my increasing elevation had left them out of sight , it is impossible to say .
i was inclined , however , to the latter opinion .
the rim of ice to the northward was growing more and more apparent .
cold by no means so intense .
nothing of importance occurred , and i passed the day in reading , having taken care to supply myself with books .
" <name> 5th .
beheld the singular phenomenon of the sun rising while nearly the whole visible surface of the earth continued to be involved in darkness .
in time , however , the light spread itself over all , and i again saw the line of ice to the northward .
it was now very distinct , and appeared of a much darker <name> than the waters of the ocean .
i was evidently approaching it , and with great rapidity .
fancied i could again distinguish a strip of land to the eastward , and one also to the westward , but could not be certain .
weather moderate .
nothing of any consequence happened during the day .
went early to bed .
" <name> 6th .
was surprised at finding the rim of ice at a very moderate distance , and an immense field of the same material stretching away off to the horizon in the north .
it was evident that if the balloon held its present course , it would soon arrive above the frozen ocean , and i had now little doubt of ultimately seeing the pole .
during the whole of the day i continued to near the ice .
toward night the limits of my horizon very suddenly and materially increased , owing undoubtedly to the earth 's form being that of an <unk> <unk> , and my arriving above the flattened regions in the vicinity of the arctic circle .
when darkness at length overtook me , i went to bed in great anxiety , fearing to pass over the object of so much curiosity when i should have no opportunity of observing it .
" <name> 7th .
arose early , and , to my great <name> , at length beheld what there could be no hesitation in supposing the northern pole itself .
it was there , beyond a doubt , and immediately beneath my feet ; but , alas !
i had now ascended to so vast a distance , that nothing could with accuracy be discerned .
indeed , to judge from the progression of the <name> indicating my various altitudes , respectively , at different periods , between six a.m. on the second of <name> , and twenty minutes before nine a.m. of the same day ( at which time the barometer ran down ) , it might be fairly inferred that the balloon had now , at four o'clock in the morning of <name> the seventh , reached a height of not less , certainly , than <unk> miles above the surface of the sea .
this elevation may appear immense , but the estimate upon which it is calculated gave a result in all probability far inferior to the truth .
at all events i undoubtedly beheld the whole of the earth 's <name> diameter ; the entire northern hemisphere lay beneath me like a chart <unk> projected : and the great circle of the equator itself formed the boundary line of my horizon .
your excellencies may , however , readily imagine that the confined regions hitherto unexplored within the limits of the arctic circle , although situated directly beneath me , and therefore seen without any appearance of being <unk> , were still , in themselves , comparatively too diminutive , and at too great a distance from the point of sight , to admit of any very accurate examination .
nevertheless , what could be seen was of a nature singular and exciting .
<unk> from that huge rim before mentioned , and which , with slight qualification , may be called the limit of human discovery in these regions , one unbroken , or nearly unbroken , sheet of ice continues to extend .
in the first few degrees of this its progress , its surface is very sensibly flattened , farther on depressed into a plane , and finally , becoming not a little concave , it terminates , at the pole itself , in a circular centre , sharply defined , whose apparent diameter <unk> at the balloon an <name> of about sixty-five seconds , and whose dusky <name> , varying in intensity , was , at all times , darker than any other spot upon the visible hemisphere , and occasionally deepened into the most absolute and impenetrable blackness .
farther than this , little could be ascertained .
by twelve o'clock the circular centre had materially decreased in circumference , and by seven <unk> .
i lost sight of it entirely ; the balloon passing over the western limb of the ice , and floating away rapidly in the direction of the equator .
" <name> 8th .
found a sensible diminution in the earth 's apparent diameter , besides a material alteration in its general color and appearance .
the whole visible area partook in different degrees of a tint of pale yellow , and in some portions had acquired a brilliancy even painful to the eye .
my view downward was also considerably impeded by the dense atmosphere in the vicinity of the surface being loaded with clouds , between whose masses i could only now and then obtain a glimpse of the earth itself .
this difficulty of direct vision had troubled me more or less for the last forty-eight hours ; but my present enormous elevation brought closer together , as it were , the floating bodies of vapor , and the inconvenience became , of course , more and more palpable in proportion to my ascent .
nevertheless , i could easily perceive that the balloon now hovered above the range of great lakes in the continent of north <name> , and was holding a course , due south , which would bring me to the tropics .
this circumstance did not fail to give me the most <unk> satisfaction , and i hailed it as a happy omen of ultimate success .
indeed , the direction i had hitherto taken , had filled me with uneasiness ; for it was evident that , had i continued it much longer , there would have been no possibility of my arriving at the moon at all , whose orbit is inclined to the <unk> at only the small <name> of 5 degrees 8 ' 48 " .
" <name> 9th .
to-day the earth 's diameter was greatly diminished , and the color of the surface assumed hourly a deeper tint of yellow .
the balloon kept steadily on her course to the southward , and arrived , at nine p.m. , over the northern edge of the mexican gulf .
" <name> 10th .
i was suddenly aroused from slumber , about five o'clock this morning , by a loud , crackling , and terrific sound , for which i could in no manner account .
it was of very brief duration , but , while it lasted resembled nothing in the world of which i had any previous experience .
it is needless to say that i became excessively alarmed , having , in the first instance , attributed the noise to the bursting of the balloon .
i examined all my apparatus , however , with great attention , and could discover nothing out of order .
spent a great part of the day in meditating upon an occurrence so extraordinary , but could find no means whatever of accounting for it .
went to bed dissatisfied , and in a state of great anxiety and agitation .
" <name> 11th .
found a startling diminution in the apparent diameter of the earth , and a considerable increase , now observable for the first time , in that of the moon itself , which wanted only a few days of being full .
it now required long and excessive labor to condense within the chamber sufficient atmospheric air for the sustenance of life .
" <name> 12th .
a singular alteration took place in regard to the direction of the balloon , and although fully anticipated , afforded me the most unequivocal delight .
having reached , in its former course , about the twentieth parallel of southern latitude , it turned off suddenly , at an acute <name> , to the eastward , and thus proceeded throughout the day , keeping nearly , if not altogether , in the exact plane of the lunar <unk> .
what was worthy of remark , a very perceptible <unk> in the car was a consequence of this change of route  a <unk> which prevailed , in a more or less degree , for a period of many hours .
" <name> 13th .
was again very much alarmed by a repetition of the loud , crackling noise which terrified me on the tenth .
thought long upon the subject , but was unable to form any satisfactory conclusion .
great decrease in the earth 's apparent diameter , which now <unk> from the balloon an <name> of very little more than twenty-five degrees .
the moon could not be seen at all , being nearly in my zenith .
i still continued in the plane of the <unk> , but made little progress to the eastward .
" <name> 14th .
extremely rapid decrease in the diameter of the earth .
to-day i became strongly impressed with the idea , that the balloon was now actually running up the line of <unk> to the point of <unk>  in other words , holding the direct course which would bring it immediately to the moon in that part of its orbit the nearest to the earth .
the moon itself was directly overhead , and consequently hidden from my view .
great and long-continued labor necessary for the condensation of the atmosphere .
" <name> 15th .
not even the outlines of continents and seas could now be traced upon the earth with anything approaching distinctness .
about twelve o'clock i became aware , for the third time , of that appalling sound which had so astonished me before .
it now , however , continued for some moments , and gathered intensity as it continued .
at length , while , stupefied and terror-stricken , i stood in expectation of i knew not what hideous destruction , the car vibrated with excessive violence , and a gigantic and flaming mass of some material which i could not distinguish , came with a voice of a thousand thunders , roaring and booming by the balloon .
when my fears and astonishment had in some degree subsided , i had little difficulty in supposing it to be some mighty volcanic fragment ejected from that world to which i was so rapidly approaching , and , in all probability , one of that singular class of substances occasionally picked up on the earth , and termed <unk> stones for want of a better appellation .
" <name> 16th .
to-day , looking upward as well as i could , through each of the side windows alternately , i beheld , to my great delight , a very small portion of the moon 's disk protruding , as it were , on all sides beyond the huge circumference of the balloon .
my agitation was extreme ; for i had now little doubt of soon reaching the end of my perilous voyage .
indeed , the labor now required by the condenser had increased to a most oppressive degree , and allowed me scarcely any respite from exertion .
sleep was a matter nearly out of the question .
i became quite ill , and my frame trembled with exhaustion .
it was impossible that human nature could endure this state of intense suffering much longer .
during the now brief interval of darkness a <unk> stone again passed in my vicinity , and the frequency of these phenomena began to occasion me much apprehension .
" <name> 17th .
this morning proved an epoch in my voyage .
it <name> be remembered that , on the thirteenth , the earth <unk> an angular breadth of twenty-five degrees .
on the fourteenth this had greatly diminished ; on the fifteenth a still more remarkable decrease was observable ; and , on retiring on the night of the sixteenth , i had noticed an <name> of no more than about seven degrees and fifteen minutes .
what , therefore , must have been my amazement , on awakening from a brief and disturbed slumber , on the morning of this day , the seventeenth , at finding the surface beneath me so suddenly and wonderfully augmented in volume , as to <unk> no less than thirty-nine degrees in apparent angular diameter !
i was thunderstruck !
no words can give any adequate idea of the extreme , the absolute horror and astonishment , with which i was seized possessed , and altogether overwhelmed .
my knees tottered beneath me  my teeth chattered  my hair started up on end .
" the balloon , then , had actually burst ! "
these were the first tumultuous ideas that hurried through my mind : " the balloon had positively burst !  i was falling  falling with the most impetuous , the most unparalleled velocity !
to judge by the immense distance already so quickly passed over , it could not be more than ten minutes , at the farthest , before i should meet the surface of the earth , and be hurled into annihilation ! "
but at length reflection came to my relief .
i paused ; i considered ; and i began to doubt .
the matter was impossible .
i could not in any reason have so rapidly come down .
besides , although i was evidently approaching the surface below me , it was with a speed by no means commensurate with the velocity i had at first so horribly conceived .
this consideration served to calm the <unk> of my mind , and i finally succeeded in regarding the phenomenon in its proper point of view .
in fact , amazement must have fairly deprived me of my senses , when i could not see the vast difference , in appearance , between the surface below me , and the surface of my mother earth .
the latter was indeed over my head , and completely hidden by the balloon , while the moon  the moon itself in all its <name>  lay beneath me , and at my feet .
" the stupor and surprise produced in my mind by this extraordinary change in the posture of affairs was perhaps , after all , that part of the adventure least susceptible of explanation .
for the <unk> in itself was not only natural and inevitable , but had been long actually anticipated as a circumstance to be expected whenever i should arrive at that exact point of my voyage where the attraction of the planet should be superseded by the attraction of the satellite  or , more precisely , where the gravitation of the balloon toward the earth should be less powerful than its gravitation toward the moon .
to be sure i arose from a sound slumber , with all my senses in confusion , to the contemplation of a very startling phenomenon , and one which , although expected , was not expected at the moment .
the revolution itself must , of course , have taken place in an easy and gradual manner , and it is by no means clear that , had i even been awake at the time of the occurrence , i should have been made aware of it by any internal evidence of an inversion  that is to say , by any inconvenience or <unk> , either about my person or about my apparatus .
" it is almost needless to say that , upon coming to a due sense of my situation , and emerging from the terror which had absorbed every faculty of my soul , my attention was , in the first place , wholly directed to the contemplation of the general physical appearance of the moon .
it lay beneath me like a chart  and although i judged it to be still at no inconsiderable distance , the <unk> of its surface were defined to my vision with a most striking and altogether unaccountable distinctness .
the entire absence of ocean or sea , and indeed of any lake or river , or body of water whatsoever , struck me , at first glance , as the most extraordinary feature in its geological condition .
yet , strange to say , i beheld vast level regions of a character decidedly alluvial , although by far the greater portion of the hemisphere in sight was covered with innumerable volcanic mountains , conical in shape , and having more the appearance of artificial than of natural protuberance .
the highest among them does not exceed three and <unk> miles in perpendicular elevation ; but a map of the volcanic districts of the <unk> <unk> would afford to your excellencies a better idea of their general surface than any unworthy description i might think proper to attempt .
the greater part of them were in a state of evident eruption , and gave me fearfully to understand their fury and their power , by the repeated thunders of the <unk> <unk> stones , which now rushed upward by the balloon with a frequency more and more appalling .
" <name> 18th .
to-day i found an enormous increase in the moon 's apparent bulk  and the evidently accelerated velocity of my descent began to fill me with alarm .
it <name> be remembered , that , in the earliest stage of my speculations upon the possibility of a passage to the moon , the existence , in its vicinity , of an atmosphere , dense in proportion to the bulk of the planet , had entered largely into my calculations ; this too in spite of many theories to the contrary , and , it may be added , in spite of a general disbelief in the existence of any lunar atmosphere at all .
but , in addition to what i have already urged in regard to <unk> comet and the <unk> light , i had been strengthened in my opinion by certain observations of mr. <unk> , of <unk> .
he observed the moon when two days and a half old , in the evening soon after sunset , before the dark part was visible , and continued to watch it until it became visible .
the two <unk> appeared tapering in a very sharp faint prolongation , each exhibiting its farthest extremity faintly illuminated by the solar rays , before any part of the dark hemisphere was visible .
soon afterward , the whole dark limb became illuminated .
this prolongation of the <unk> beyond the semicircle , i thought , must have arisen from the <unk> of the sun 's rays by the moon 's atmosphere .
i <unk> , also , the height of the atmosphere ( which could <unk> light enough into its dark hemisphere to produce a twilight more luminous than the light reflected from the earth when the moon is about 32 degrees from the new ) to be <unk> <name> feet ; in this view , i supposed the greatest height capable of <unk> the solar <name> , to be <unk> feet .
my ideas on this topic had also received confirmation by a passage in the <unk> volume of the philosophical transactions , in which it is stated that at an <unk> of jupiter 's satellites , the third disappeared after having been about 1 " or 2 " of time indistinct , and the fourth became <unk> near the limb .
( <unk> ) " <unk> frequently observed saturn , jupiter , and the fixed stars , when approaching the moon to <unk> , to have their circular figure changed into an oval one ; and , in other <unk> , he found no alteration of figure at all .
hence it might be supposed , that at some times and not at others , there is a dense matter <unk> the moon wherein the rays of the stars are <unk> .
" upon the resistance or , more properly , upon the support of an atmosphere , existing in the state of density imagined , i had , of course , entirely depended for the safety of my ultimate descent .
should i then , after all , prove to have been mistaken , i had in consequence nothing better to expect , as a <unk> to my adventure , than being dashed into atoms against the rugged surface of the satellite .
and , indeed , i had now every reason to be terrified .
my distance from the moon was comparatively trifling , while the labor required by the condenser was diminished not at all , and i could discover no indication whatever of a decreasing rarity in the air .
" <name> 19th .
this morning , to my great <name> , about nine o'clock , the surface of the moon being frightfully near , and my apprehensions excited to the utmost , the pump of my condenser at length gave evident tokens of an alteration in the atmosphere .
by ten , i had reason to believe its density considerably increased .
by eleven , very little labor was necessary at the apparatus ; and at twelve o'clock , with some hesitation , i ventured to <unk> the <unk> , when , finding no inconvenience from having done so , i finally threw open the <unk> chamber , and <unk> it from around the car .
as might have been expected , spasms and violent headache were the immediate consequences of an experiment so precipitate and full of danger .
but these and other difficulties attending respiration , as they were by no means so great as to put me in peril of my life , i determined to endure as i best could , in consideration of my leaving them behind me momently in my approach to the denser strata near the moon .
this approach , however , was still impetuous in the extreme ; and it soon became <unk> certain that , although i had probably not been deceived in the expectation of an atmosphere dense in proportion to the mass of the satellite , still i had been wrong in supposing this density , even at the surface , at all adequate to the support of the great weight contained in the car of my balloon .
yet this should have been the case , and in an equal degree as at the surface of the earth , the actual gravity of bodies at either planet supposed in the ratio of the atmospheric condensation .
that it was not the case , however , my precipitous downfall gave testimony enough ; why it was not so , can only be explained by a reference to those possible geological disturbances to which i have formerly alluded .
at all events i was now close upon the planet , and coming down with the most terrible impetuosity .
i lost not a moment , accordingly , in throwing overboard first my ballast , then my <unk> , then my condensing apparatus and <unk> chamber , and finally every article within the car .
but it was all to no purpose .
i still fell with horrible rapidity , and was now not more than half a mile from the surface .
as a last resource , therefore , having got rid of my coat , hat , and boots , i cut loose from the balloon the car itself , which was of no inconsiderable weight , and thus , clinging with both hands to the net-work , i had barely time to observe that the whole country , as far as the eye could reach , was thickly interspersed with diminutive habitations , ere i tumbled headlong into the very heart of a <unk> city , and into the middle of a vast crowd of ugly little people , who none of them uttered a single syllable , or gave themselves the least trouble to render me assistance , but stood , like a parcel of idiots , grinning in a ludicrous manner , and eyeing me and my balloon <unk> , with their arms set <unk> .
i turned from them in contempt , and , gazing upward at the earth so lately left , and left perhaps for ever , beheld it like a huge , dull , copper shield , about two degrees in diameter , fixed <unk> in the heavens overhead , and tipped on one of its edges with a crescent border of the most brilliant gold .
no traces of land or water could be discovered , and the whole was clouded with variable spots , and belted with tropical and equatorial zones .
" thus , may it please your excellencies , after a series of great anxieties , unheard of dangers , and unparalleled escapes , i had , at length , on the nineteenth day of my departure from rotterdam , arrived in safety at the conclusion of a voyage undoubtedly the most extraordinary , and the most momentous , ever accomplished , undertaken , or conceived by any <unk> of earth .
but my adventures yet remain to be related .
and indeed your excellencies may well imagine that , after a residence of five years upon a planet not only deeply interesting in its own peculiar character , but rendered doubly so by its intimate connection , in capacity of satellite , with the world inhabited by man , i may have intelligence for the private ear of the states ' college of astronomers of far more importance than the details , however wonderful , of the mere voyage which so happily concluded .
this is , in fact , the case .
i have much  very much which it would give me the greatest pleasure to communicate .
i have much to say of the climate of the planet ; of its wonderful alternations of heat and cold , of unmitigated and burning <name> for one fortnight , and more than polar <unk> for the next ; of a constant transfer of moisture , by <unk> like that in <unk> , from the point beneath the sun to the point the farthest from it ; of a variable zone of running water , of the people themselves ; of their manners , customs , and political institutions ; of their peculiar physical construction ; of their ugliness ; of their want of ears , those useless appendages in an atmosphere so peculiarly modified ; of their consequent ignorance of the use and properties of speech ; of their substitute for speech in a singular method of <unk> ; of the incomprehensible connection between each particular individual in the moon with some particular individual on the earth  a connection analogous with , and depending upon , that of the orbs of the planet and the satellites , and by means of which the lives and destinies of the inhabitants of the one are <unk> with the lives and destinies of the inhabitants of the other ; and above all , if it so please your excellencies  above all , of those dark and hideous mysteries which lie in the outer regions of the moon  regions which , owing to the almost miraculous accordance of the satellite 's rotation on its own axis with its <unk> revolution about the earth , have never yet been turned , and , by god 's <name> , never shall be turned , to the scrutiny of the telescopes of man .
all this , and more  much more  would i most willingly detail .
but , to be brief , i must have my reward .
i am pining for a return to my family and to my home , and as the price of any farther communication on my part  in consideration of the light which i have it in my power to throw upon many very important branches of physical and metaphysical science  i must solicit , through the influence of your honorable body , a pardon for the crime of which i have been guilty in the death of the creditors upon my departure from rotterdam .
this , then , is the object of the present paper .
its bearer , an inhabitant of the moon , whom i have prevailed upon , and properly instructed , to be my messenger to the earth , <name> await your excellencies ' pleasure , and return to me with the pardon in question , if it can , in any manner , be obtained .
" i have the honor to be , etc. , your excellencies ' very humble servant , " <name> <unk> . "
upon finishing the perusal of this very extraordinary document , professor <unk> , it is said , dropped his pipe upon the ground in the extremity of his surprise , and <unk> <unk> <name> <unk> having taken off his spectacles , wiped them , and deposited them in his pocket , so far forgot both himself and his dignity , as to turn round three times upon his heel in the <unk> of astonishment and admiration .
there was no doubt about the matter  the pardon should be obtained .
so at least swore , with a round oath , professor <unk> , and so finally thought the illustrious <name> <unk> , as he took the arm of his brother in science , and without saying a word , began to make the best of his way home to deliberate upon the measures to be adopted .
having reached the door , however , of the burgomaster 's dwelling , the professor ventured to suggest that as the messenger had thought proper to disappear  no doubt frightened to death by the savage appearance of the <unk> of rotterdam  the pardon would be of little use , as no one but a man of the moon would undertake a voyage to so vast a distance .
to the truth of this observation the burgomaster assented , and the matter was therefore at an end .
not so , however , rumors and speculations .
the letter , having been published , gave rise to a variety of gossip and opinion .
some of the <unk> even made themselves ridiculous by <unk> the whole business ; as nothing better than a hoax .
but hoax , with these sort of people , is , i believe , a general term for all matters above their comprehension .
for my part , i can not conceive upon what data they have founded such an accusation .
let us see what they say : <unk> .
that certain wags in rotterdam have certain especial <unk> to certain <unk> and astronomers .
do n't understand at all .
secondly .
that an odd little dwarf and bottle <unk> , both of whose ears , for some <unk> , have been cut off close to his head , has been missing for several days from the neighboring city of <unk> .
well  what of that ?
thirdly .
that the newspapers which were stuck all over the little balloon were newspapers of holland , and therefore could not have been made in the moon .
they were dirty papers  very dirty  and <unk> , the printer , would take his bible oath to their having been printed in rotterdam .
he was mistaken  undoubtedly  mistaken .
fourthly , that <name> <unk> himself , the drunken villain , and the three very idle gentlemen styled his creditors , were all seen , no longer than two or three days ago , in a <unk> house in the suburbs , having just returned , with money in their pockets , from a trip beyond the sea .
do n't believe it  do n't believe a word of it .
lastly .
that it is an opinion very generally received , or which ought to be generally received , that the college of astronomers in the city of rotterdam , as well as other colleges in all other parts of the world ,  not to mention colleges and astronomers in general ,  are , to say the least of the matter , not a whit better , nor greater , nor wiser than they ought to be .
<unk> end of text <unk> notes to <name> <unk> ( *1 ) note  strictly speaking , there is but little similarity between the above <unk> trifle and the celebrated " <unk> " of mr. locke ; but as both have the character of <unk>  ( although the one is in a tone of banter , the other of downright <name> ) , and as both <unk> are on the same subject , the moon  moreover , as both attempt to give plausibility by scientific detail  the author of " <name> <unk> " thinks it necessary to say , in self-defence , that his own <unk> <unk> was published in the " southern literary messenger " about three weeks before the commencement of mr. l 's in the " new york sun . "
<unk> a likeness which , perhaps , does not exist , some of the new york papers copied " <name> <unk> , " and <unk> it with the " <unk> , " by way of detecting the writer of the one in the writer of the other .
as many more persons were actually <unk> by the " <unk> " than would be willing to acknowledge the fact , it may here afford some little amusement to show why no one should have been <unk> point out those particulars of the story which should have been sufficient to establish its real character .
indeed , however <name> the imagination displayed in this ingenious fiction , it wanted much of the force which might have been given it by a more scrupulous attention to facts and to general analogy .
that the public were misled , even for an instant , merely proves the gross ignorance which is so generally prevalent upon subjects of an astronomical nature .
the moon 's distance from the earth is , in round <name> , <unk> miles .
if we <name> to ascertain how near , apparently , a lens would bring the satellite ( or any distant object ) , we , of course , have but to divide the distance by the <unk> or , more strictly , by the <unk> power of the glass .
mr. l. makes his lens have a power of <unk> times .
by this divide <unk> ( the moon 's real distance ) , and we have five miles and five <unk> , as the apparent distance .
no animal at all could be seen so far ; much less the minute points <unk> in the story .
mr. l. speaks about sir <name> <name> 's perceiving flowers ( the papaver <unk> , etc .
) , and even detecting the color and the shape of the eyes of small birds .
shortly before , too , he has himself observed that the lens would not render perceptible objects of less than eighteen inches in diameter ; but even this , as i have said , is giving the glass by far too great power .
it may be observed , in passing , that this prodigious glass is said to have been <unk> at the <unk> of messrs. <unk> and <name> , in <unk> ; but messrs. h. and <unk> establishment had ceased operations for many years previous to the publication of the hoax .
on <name> 13 , pamphlet edition , speaking of " a hairy veil " over the eyes of a species of bison , the author says : " it immediately occurred to the acute mind of dr. <name> that this was a providential contrivance to protect the eyes of the animal from the great extremes of light and darkness to which all the inhabitants of our side of the moon are periodically subjected . "
but this can not be thought a very " acute " observation of the doctor 's .
the inhabitants of our side of the moon have , evidently , no darkness at all , so there can be nothing of the " extremes " mentioned .
in the absence of the sun they have a light from the earth equal to that of thirteen full <unk> moons .
the <unk> throughout , even when professing to accord with <unk> lunar chart , is entirely at variance with that or any other lunar chart , and even grossly at variance with itself .
the points of the compass , too , are in inextricable confusion ; the writer appearing to be ignorant that , on a lunar map , these are not in accordance with terrestrial points ; the east being to the left , etc .
deceived , perhaps , by the vague titles , mare <unk> , mare <unk> , mare <unk> , etc. , given to the dark spots by former astronomers , mr. l. has entered into details regarding oceans and other large bodies of water in the moon ; whereas there is no astronomical point more positively ascertained than that no such bodies exist there .
in examining the boundary between light and darkness ( in the crescent or <unk> moon ) where this boundary crosses any of the dark places , the line of division is found to be rough and jagged ; but , were these dark places liquid , it would evidently be even .
the description of the wings of the <unk> , on <name> 21 , is but a literal copy of <name> <unk> ' account of the wings of his flying islanders .
this simple fact should have induced suspicion , at least , it might be thought .
on <name> 23 , we have the following : " what a prodigious influence must our thirteen times larger globe have exercised upon this satellite when an embryo in the womb of time , the passive subject of chemical affinity ! "
this is very fine ; but it should be observed that no astronomer would have made such remark , especially to any journal of science ; for the earth , in the sense intended , is not only thirteen , but forty-nine times larger than the moon .
a similar objection applies to the whole of the concluding pages , where , by way of introduction to some discoveries in saturn , the philosophical correspondent enters into a minute schoolboy account of that planet  this to the " edinburgh journal of science ! "
but there is one point , in particular , which should have betrayed the fiction .
let us imagine the power actually possessed of seeing animals upon the moon 's surface  what would first arrest the attention of an observer from the earth ?
certainly neither their shape , size , nor any other such peculiarity , so soon as their remarkable situation .
they would appear to be walking , with heels up and head down , in the manner of flies on a ceiling .
the real observer would have uttered an instant ejaculation of surprise ( however prepared by previous knowledge ) at the <unk> of their position ; the fictitious observer has not even mentioned the subject , but speaks of seeing the entire bodies of such creatures , when it is <unk> that he could have seen only the diameter of their heads !
it might as well be remarked , in conclusion , that the size , and particularly the powers of the <unk> ( for example , their ability to fly in so rare an atmosphere  if , indeed , the moon have any ) , with most of the other fancies in regard to animal and vegetable existence , are at variance , generally , with all analogical reasoning on these themes ; and that analogy here <name> often amount to conclusive demonstration .
it is , perhaps , scarcely necessary to add , that all the suggestions attributed to brewster and <name> , in the beginning of the article , about " a <unk> of artificial light through the <unk> object of vision , " etc. , etc. , belong to that species of <unk> writing which comes , most properly , under the denomination of <unk> .
there is a real and very definite limit to optical discovery among the stars  a limit whose nature need only be stated to be understood .
if , indeed , the casting of large lenses were all that is required , man's ingenuity would ultimately prove equal to the task , and we might have them of any size demanded .
but , unhappily , in proportion to the increase of size in the lens , and consequently of <unk> power , is the diminution of light from the object , by diffusion of its rays .
and for this evil there is no remedy within human ability ; for an object is seen by means of that light alone which proceeds from itself , whether direct or reflected .
thus the only " artificial " light which could avail mr. locke , would be some artificial light which he should be able to <unk> upon the " <unk> object of vision , " but upon the real object to be <unk> wit : upon the moon .
it has been easily calculated that , when the light proceeding from a <name> becomes so diffused as to be as weak as the natural light proceeding from the whole of the stars , in a clear and <unk> night , then the <name> is no longer visible for any practical purpose .
the <name> of <name> 's telescope , lately constructed in england , has a speculum with a reflecting surface of <unk> square inches ; the <name> telescope having one of only <unk> .
the metal of the <name> of <name> 's is 6 feet diameter ; it is 5 1/2 inches thick at the edges , and 5 at the centre .
the weight is 3 tons .
the <unk> length is 50 feet .
i have lately read a singular and somewhat ingenious little book , whose title-page runs thus : " <unk> dans la <unk> ou <name> voyage <unk> fait au <unk> de la <unk> , <unk> <unk> par <name> gonzales , <unk> <unk> , <unk> dit <name> courier <unk> .
mis en notre <unk> par j .
b. d. a. <name> , chez <unk> <unk> , <unk> la <unk> de saint <unk> .
et chez j. <unk> , au premier <unk> de la <unk> du <unk> , <unk> <name> consultations , <unk> . "
pp .
76 .
the writer professes to have translated his work from the english of one mr. <unk> ( <unk> ? )
although there is a terrible <unk> in the statement .
" j ' en ai <unk> , " says he " <unk> de monsieur <unk> , <unk> des <unk> <unk> qui <unk> <unk> dans la <unk> des <unk> <unk> , et sur tout de la philosophic <unk> .
je lui ai cette obligation entre <name> <unk> , de m ' <unk> non <unk> mis en main <unk> <unk> en <unk> , mais encore <name> <unk> du sieur <name> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> pour sa <unk> , sur la version <unk> j ' <unk> que j ' ay <unk> <name> plan de la <unk> . "
after some irrelevant adventures , much in the manner of <name> blas , and which occupy the first thirty pages , the author relates that , being ill during a sea voyage , the crew abandoned him , together with a negro servant , on the island of st. <name> .
to increase the chances of obtaining food , the two separate , and live as far apart as possible .
this brings about a training of birds , to serve the purpose of <unk> between them .
by and by these are taught to <name> parcels of some <unk> this weight is gradually increased .
at length the idea is entertained of uniting the force of a great number of the birds , with a view to raising the author himself .
a machine is contrived for the purpose , and we have a minute description of it , which is materially helped out by a steel engraving .
here we perceive the signor gonzales , with point ruffles and a huge <unk> , seated astride something which resembles very closely a <unk> , and borne aloft by a multitude of wild swans  ( <unk> ) who had strings reaching from their tails to the machine .
the main event detailed in the signor 's narrative depends upon a very important fact , of which the reader is kept in ignorance until near the end of the book .
the <unk> , with whom he had become so familiar , were not really <unk> of st. <name> , but of the moon .
thence it had been their custom , time out of mind , to migrate annually to some portion of the earth .
in proper season , of course , they would return home ; and the author , happening , one day , to require their services for a short voyage , is unexpectedly carried straight tip , and in a very brief period arrives at the satellite .
here he finds , among other odd things , that the people enjoy extreme happiness ; that they have no law ; that they die without pain ; that they are from ten to thirty feet in height ; that they live five thousand years ; that they have an emperor called <unk> ; and that they can jump sixty feet high , when , being out of the <unk> influence , they fly about with fans .
i can not forbear giving a specimen of the general philosophy of the volume .
" i must not forget here , that the stars appeared only on that side of the globe turned toward the moon , and that the closer they were to it the larger they seemed .
i have also me and the earth .
as to the stars , since there was no night where i was , they always had the same appearance ; not brilliant , as usual , but pale , and very nearly like the moon of a morning .
but few of them were visible , and these ten times larger ( as well as i could judge ) than they seem to the inhabitants of the earth .
the moon , which wanted two days of being full , was of a terrible <unk> .
" i must not forget here , that the stars appeared only on that side of the globe turned toward the moon , and that the closer they were to it the larger they seemed .
i have also to inform you that , whether it was calm weather or <name> , i found myself always immediately between the moon and the <unk> i was convinced of this for two <unk> my birds always flew in a straight line ; and because whenever we attempted to rest , we were carried insensibly around the globe of the earth .
for i admit the opinion of <unk> , who maintains that it never ceases to revolve from the east to the west , not upon the poles of the <unk> , commonly called the poles of the world , but upon those of the zodiac , a question of which i propose to speak more at length <unk> , when i shall have leisure to refresh my memory in regard to the <unk> which i learned at <unk> when young , and have since forgotten . "
notwithstanding the blunders <unk> , the book is not without some claim to attention , as affording a naive specimen of the current astronomical notions of the time .
one of these assumed , that the " <unk> power " extended but a short distance from the <unk> surface , and , accordingly , we find our voyager " carried insensibly around the globe , " etc .
there have been other " voyages to the moon , " but none of higher merit than the one just mentioned .
that of bergerac is utterly meaningless .
in the third volume of the " american quarterly review " <name> be found quite an elaborate criticism upon a certain " journey " of the kind in question  a criticism in which it is difficult to say whether the critic most exposes the stupidity of the book , or his own absurd ignorance of astronomy .
i forget the title of the work ; but the means of the voyage are more <unk> ill conceived than are even the <unk> of our friend the signor gonzales .
the adventurer , in digging the earth , happens to discover a peculiar metal for which the moon has a strong attraction , and straightway <unk> of it a box , which , when cast loose from its terrestrial fastenings , flies with him , forthwith , to the satellite .
the " flight of <name> <unk> , " is a <unk> d ' <unk> not altogether contemptible , and has been translated into <name> .
<name> , the hero , was , in fact , the gamekeeper of an <name> peer , whose eccentricities gave rise to the tale .
the " flight " is made on an <unk> back , from hungry hill , a lofty mountain at the end of <unk> bay .
in these various <unk> the aim is always <unk> ; the theme being a description of <unk> customs as compared with ours .
in none is there any effort at plausibility in the details of the voyage itself .
the writers seem , in each instance , to be utterly <unk> in respect to astronomy .
in " <name> <unk> " the design is original , inasmuch as regards an attempt at <unk> , in the application of scientific principles ( so far as the whimsical nature of the subject would permit ) , to the actual passage between the earth and the moon .
( <unk> ) the <unk> light is probably what the ancients called <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  pliny , lib .
2 , p. 26 .
( <unk> ) since the original publication of <name> <unk> , i find that mr. green , of nassau balloon notoriety , and other late <unk> , deny the assertions of humboldt , in this respect , and speak of a decreasing inconvenience ,  precisely in accordance with the theory here urged in a mere spirit of banter .
( <unk> ) <unk> writes that he has several times found , in skies perfectly clear , when even stars of the sixth and seventh magnitude were conspicuous , that , at the same altitude of the moon , at the same elongation from the earth , and with one and the same excellent telescope , the moon and its <unk> did not appear equally lucid at all times .
from the circumstances of the observation , it is evident that the cause of this phenomenon is not either in our air , in the tube , in the moon , or in the eye of the spectator , but must be looked for in something ( an atmosphere ? )
existing about the moon .
the <unk> what ho !
what ho !
this fellow is dancing mad !
he hath been bitten by the <unk> .
  all in the <unk> many years ago , i contracted an intimacy with a mr. <name> legrand .
he was of an ancient <unk> family , and had once been wealthy ; but a series of misfortunes had reduced him to want .
to avoid the mortification consequent upon his disasters , he left new orleans , the city of his forefathers , and took up his residence at sullivan 's island , near charleston , south <name> .
this island is a very singular one .
it consists of little else than the sea sand , and is about three miles long .
its breadth at no point exceeds a quarter of a mile .
it is separated from the main land by a scarcely perceptible creek , oozing its way through a wilderness of reeds and slime , a favorite resort of the marsh hen .
the vegetation , as might be supposed , is scant , or at least <unk> .
no trees of any magnitude are to be seen .
near the western extremity , where fort moultrie stands , and where are some miserable frame buildings , tenanted , during summer , by the fugitives from charleston dust and fever , may be found , indeed , the bristly <unk> ; but the whole island , with the exception of this western point , and a line of hard , white beach on the seacoast , is covered with a dense undergrowth of the sweet <name> , so much prized by the horticulturists of england .
the shrub here often attains the height of fifteen or twenty feet , and forms an almost impenetrable <unk> , <unk> the air with its fragrance .
in the inmost recesses of this <unk> , not far from the eastern or more remote end of the island , legrand had built himself a small hut , which he occupied when i first , by mere accident , made his acquaintance .
this soon ripened into friendship  for there was much in the <unk> to excite interest and esteem .
i found him well educated , with unusual powers of mind , but infected with <unk> , and subject to perverse moods of alternate enthusiasm and melancholy .
he had with him many books , but rarely employed them .
his chief amusements were <unk> and fishing , or sauntering along the beach and through the <unk> , in quest of shells or entomological specimens ;  his collection of the latter might have been envied by a <unk> .
in these excursions he was usually accompanied by an old negro , called jupiter , who had been <unk> before the reverses of the family , but who could be induced , neither by threats nor by promises , to abandon what he considered his right of attendance upon the footsteps of his young " massa <name> . "
it is not improbable that the relatives of legrand , conceiving him to be somewhat unsettled in intellect , had contrived to <unk> this obstinacy into jupiter , with a view to the supervision and guardianship of the wanderer .
the winters in the latitude of sullivan 's island are seldom very severe , and in the fall of the year it is a rare event indeed when a fire is considered necessary .
about the middle of october , 18 , there occurred , however , a day of remarkable <unk> .
just before sunset i scrambled my way through the evergreens to the hut of my friend , whom i had not visited for several weeks  my residence being , at that time , in charleston , a distance of nine miles from the island , while the facilities of passage and <unk> were very far behind those of the present day .
upon reaching the hut i rapped , as was my custom , and getting no reply , sought for the key where i knew it was secreted , unlocked the door and went in .
a fine fire was blazing upon the hearth .
it was a novelty , and by no means an ungrateful one .
i threw off an overcoat , took an arm-chair by the crackling logs , and awaited patiently the arrival of my hosts .
soon after dark they arrived , and gave me a most cordial welcome .
jupiter , grinning from ear to ear , bustled about to prepare some <unk> for supper .
legrand was in one of his fits  how else shall i term them ?  of enthusiasm .
he had found an unknown <unk> , forming a new genus , and , more than this , he had hunted down and secured , with jupiter 's assistance , a scarabæus which he believed to be totally new , but in respect to which he wished to have my opinion on the morrow .
" and why not to-night ? "
i asked , rubbing my hands over the blaze , and wishing the whole tribe of <unk> at the devil .
" ah , if i had only known you were here ! "
said legrand , " but it 's so long since i saw you ; and how could i foresee that you would pay me a visit this very night of all others ?
as i was coming home i met lieutenant g  , from the fort , and , very foolishly , i lent him the bug ; so it <name> be impossible for you to see it until the morning .
stay here to-night , and i <name> send <unk> down for it at sunrise .
it is the loveliest thing in creation ! "
" what ?  sunrise ? "
" nonsense !
no !  the bug .
it is of a brilliant gold color  about the size of a large <unk>  with two jet black spots near one extremity of the back , and another , somewhat longer , at the other .
the antennæ are  " " dey aint no tin in him , massa <name> , i keep a tellin on you , " here interrupted jupiter ; " de bug is a <unk> bug , solid , <unk> bit of him , inside and all , <unk> him wing  <unk> feel half so <unk> a bug in my life . "
" well , suppose it is , <unk> , " replied legrand , somewhat more earnestly , it seemed to me , than the case demanded , " is that any reason for your letting the birds burn ?
the color "  here he turned to me  " is really almost enough to warrant jupiter 's idea .
you never saw a more brilliant metallic lustre than the scales emit  but of this you can not judge till tomorrow .
in the mean time i can give you some idea of the shape . "
saying this , he seated himself at a small table , on which were a pen and ink , but no paper .
he looked for some in a drawer , but found none .
" never mind , " said he at length , " this <name> answer ; " and he <name> from his waistcoat pocket a scrap of what i took to be very dirty <unk> , and made upon it a rough drawing with the pen .
while he did this , i retained my seat by the fire , for i was still chilly .
when the design was complete , he handed it to me without rising .
as i received it , a loud growl was heard , succeeded by a scratching at the door .
jupiter opened it , and a large newfoundland , belonging to legrand , rushed in , leaped upon my shoulders , and loaded me with caresses ; for i had shown him much attention during previous visits .
when his <unk> were over , i looked at the paper , and , to speak the truth , found myself not a little puzzled at what my friend had depicted .
" well ! "
i said , after contemplating it for some minutes , " this is a strange scarabæus , i must confess : new to me : never saw anything like it before  unless it was a skull , or a <unk>  which it more nearly resembles than anything else that has come under my observation . "
" a <unk> ! "
echoed legrand  " oh  yes  well , it has something of that appearance upon paper , no doubt .
the two upper black spots look like eyes , eh ?
and the longer one at the bottom like a mouth  and then the shape of the whole is oval . "
" perhaps so , " said i ; " but , legrand , i fear you are no artist .
i must wait until i see the beetle itself , if i am to form any idea of its personal appearance . "
" well , i do n't know , " said he , a little nettled , " i draw tolerably  should do it at least  have had good masters , and flatter myself that i am not quite a <unk> . "
" but , my dear fellow , you are joking then , " said i , " this is a very passable skull  indeed , i may say that it is a very excellent skull , according to the vulgar notions about such specimens of physiology  and your scarabæus must be the queerest scarabæus in the world if it resembles it .
why , we may get up a very thrilling bit of superstition upon this hint .
i presume you <name> call the bug scarabæus <unk> <unk> , or something of that kind  there are many similar titles in the natural histories .
but where are the antennæ you spoke of ? "
" the antennæ ! "
said legrand , who seemed to be getting unaccountably warm upon the subject ; " i am sure you must see the antennæ .
i made them as distinct as they are in the original insect , and i presume that is sufficient . "
" well , well , " i said , " perhaps you have  still i do n't see them ; " and i handed him the paper without additional remark , not wishing to ruffle his temper ; but i was much surprised at the turn affairs had taken ; his ill humor puzzled me  and , as for the drawing of the beetle , there were positively no antennæ visible , and the whole did bear a very close resemblance to the ordinary cuts of a <unk> .
he received the paper very <unk> , and was about to crumple it , apparently to throw it in the fire , when a casual glance at the design seemed suddenly to rivet his attention .
in an instant his face grew violently red  in another as excessively pale .
for some minutes he continued to <unk> the drawing minutely where he sat .
at length he arose , took a candle from the table , and proceeded to seat himself upon a <unk> in the farthest corner of the room .
here again he made an anxious examination of the paper ; turning it in all directions .
he said nothing , however , and his conduct greatly astonished me ; yet i thought it prudent not to <unk> the growing <unk> of his temper by any comment .
presently he took from his coat pocket a wallet , placed the paper carefully in it , and deposited both in a <unk> , which he locked .
he now grew more composed in his demeanor ; but his original air of enthusiasm had quite disappeared .
yet he seemed not so much sulky as abstracted .
as the evening wore away he became more and more absorbed in reverie , from which no sallies of mine could arouse him .
it had been my intention to pass the night at the hut , as i had frequently done before , but , seeing my host in this mood , i deemed it proper to take leave .
he did not press me to remain , but , as i departed , he shook my hand with even more than his usual cordiality .
it was about a month after this ( and during the interval i had seen nothing of legrand ) when i received a visit , at charleston , from his man , jupiter .
i had never seen the good old negro look so <unk> , and i feared that some serious disaster had befallen my friend .
" well , <unk> , " said i , " what is the matter now ?  how is your master ? "
" why , to speak de <unk> , massa , him not so <name> well as <unk> be . "
" not well !
i am truly sorry to hear it .
what does he complain of ? "
" dar !
dat 's it !  him <unk> plain of <unk>  but him <name> sick for all dat . "
" very sick , jupiter !  why did n't you say so at once ?
is he confined to bed ? "
" no , dat he aint !  he aint find <unk>  dat 's just whar de shoe pinch  my mind is got to be <name> <unk> <unk> poor massa <name> . "
" jupiter , i should like to understand what it is you are talking about .
you say your master is sick .
has n't he told you what ails him ? "
" why , massa , taint <unk> while for to git mad about de matter  massa <name> say <unk> at all aint de matter wid him  but den what make him go about looking dis here way , wid he head down and he soldiers up , and as white as a <unk> ?
and den he keep a <unk> all de time  " " keeps a what , jupiter ? "
" keeps a <unk> wid de <unk> on de slate  de queerest <unk> i <unk> did see .
<unk> gittin to be <unk> , i tell you .
hab for to keep mighty tight eye <unk> him <unk> .
<unk> day he gib me slip fore de sun up and was gone de whole ob de blessed day .
i had a big stick ready cut for to gib him deuced good beating when he did come  but <unk> sich a fool dat i had n't de heart <unk> all  he look so <name> poorly . "
" eh ?  what ?  ah yes !  upon the whole i think you had better not be too severe with the poor fellow  do n't flog him , jupiter  he ca n't very well stand it  but can you form no idea of what has occasioned this illness , or rather this change of conduct ?
has anything unpleasant happened since i saw you ? "
" no , massa , dey aint bin <unk> unpleasant since den  't was fore den i'm feared  't was de <name> day you was dare . "
" how ?
what do you mean ? "
" why , massa , i mean de bug  dare now . "
" the what ? "
" de bug ,  i 'm <name> <unk> dat massa <name> bin bit somewhere <unk> de head by dat <unk> . "
" and what cause have you , jupiter , for such a supposition ? "
" claws <unk> , massa , and mouth too .
i <unk> did see sick a deuced bug  he kick and he bite <unk> ting what cum near him .
massa <name> cotch him fuss , but had for to let him go gin mighty quick , i tell you  den was de time he must <name> got de bite .
i did n't like de look oh de bug <unk> , myself , no how , so i would n't take hold ob him wid my finger , but i cotch him wid a piece ob paper dat i found .
i rap him up in de paper and stuff piece ob it in he <unk>  dat was de way . "
" and you think , then , that your master was really bitten by the beetle , and that the bite made him sick ? "
" i do n't <unk> <unk> about it  i nose it .
what make him dream <unk> de <unk> so much , if taint cause he bit by de <unk> ?
<unk> heerd <unk> dem <unk> fore dis . "
" but how do you know he dreams about gold ? "
" how i know ?
why cause he talk about it in he sleep  dat 's how i nose . "
" well , <unk> , perhaps you are right ; but to what fortunate circumstance am i to attribute the honor of a visit from you to-day ? "
" what de matter , massa ? "
" did you bring any message from mr .
legrand ? "
" no , massa , i bring dis here <unk> ; " and here jupiter handed me a note which ran thus : my dear   why have i not seen you for so long a time ?
i <name> you have not been so foolish as to take offence at any little <unk> of mine ; but no , that is improbable .
since i saw you i have had great cause for anxiety .
i have something to tell you , yet scarcely know how to tell it , or whether i should tell it at all .
i have not been quite well for some days past , and poor old <unk> <unk> me , almost beyond endurance , by his <unk> attentions would you believe it ?  he had prepared a huge stick , the other day , with which to <unk> me for giving him the slip , and spending the day , <unk> , among the hills on the main land .
i verily believe that my ill looks alone saved me a flogging .
i have made no addition to my cabinet since we met .
if you can , in any way , make it convenient , come over with jupiter .
do come .
i wish to see you <unk> , upon business of importance .
i assure you that it is of the highest importance .
ever yours , <name> legrand .
there was something in the tone of this note which gave me great uneasiness .
its whole style differed materially from that of legrand .
what could he be dreaming of ?
what new <unk> possessed his excitable <name> ?
what " business of the highest importance " could he possibly have to transact ?
jupiter 's account of him <unk> no good .
i dreaded lest the continued pressure of misfortune had , at length , fairly unsettled the reason of my friend .
without a moment 's hesitation , therefore , i prepared to accompany the negro .
upon reaching the wharf , i noticed a scythe and three spades , all apparently new , lying in the bottom of the boat in which we were to embark .
" what is the meaning of all this , <unk> ? "
i inquired .
" him <unk> , massa , and spade . "
" very true ; but what are they doing here ? "
" him de <unk> and de spade what massa <name> sis <unk> my buying for him in de town , and de <unk> own lot of money i had to gib for em . "
" but what , in the name of all that is mysterious , is your <unk> <unk> going to do with <unk> and spades ? "
" dat 's more <name> i know , and <unk> take me if i do n't <unk> 't is more <name> he know , too .
but it 's all cum ob do bug . "
finding that no satisfaction was to be obtained of jupiter , whose whole intellect seemed to be absorbed by " de bug , " i now stepped into the boat and made sail .
with a fair and strong breeze we soon ran into the little cove to the northward of fort moultrie , and a walk of some two miles brought us to the hut .
it was about three in the afternoon when we arrived .
legrand had been awaiting us in eager expectation .
he grasped my hand with a nervous <unk> which alarmed me and strengthened the suspicions already entertained .
his countenance was pale even to <unk> , and his <unk> eyes glared with unnatural lustre .
after some inquiries respecting his health , i asked him , not knowing what better to say , if he had yet obtained the scarabæus from lieutenant g   .
" oh , yes , " he replied , coloring violently , " i got it from him the next morning .
nothing should tempt me to part with that scarabæus .
do you know that jupiter is quite right about it ? "
" in what way ? "
i asked , with a sad <unk> at heart .
" in supposing it to be a bug of real gold . "
he said this with an air of profound seriousness , and i felt inexpressibly shocked .
" this bug is to make my fortune , " he continued , with a triumphant smile , " to <unk> me in my family possessions .
is it any wonder , then , that i prize it ?
since fortune has thought fit to bestow it upon me , i have only to use it properly and i shall arrive at the gold of which it is the index .
jupiter ; bring me that scarabæus ! "
" what !
de bug , massa ?
i 'd rudder not go fer <unk> dat bug  you mus git him for your own self . "
hereupon legrand arose , with a grave and stately air , and brought me the beetle from a glass case in which it was enclosed .
it was a beautiful scarabæus , and , at that time , unknown to naturalists  of course a great prize in a scientific point of view .
there were two round , black spots near one extremity of the back , and a long one near the other .
the scales were exceedingly hard and glossy , with all the appearance of burnished gold .
the weight of the insect was very remarkable , and , taking all things into consideration , i could hardly blame jupiter for his opinion respecting it ; but what to make of legrand 's <unk> with that opinion , i could not , for the life of me , tell .
" i sent for you , " said he , in a <unk> tone , when i had completed my examination of the beetle , " i sent for you , that i might have your counsel and assistance in <unk> the views of fate and of the bug "  " my dear legrand , " i cried , interrupting him , " you are certainly unwell , and had better use some little precautions .
you shall go to bed , and i <name> remain with you a few days , until you get over this .
you are feverish and "  " feel my pulse , " said he .
i felt it , and , to say the truth , found not the slightest indication of fever .
" but you may be ill and yet have no fever .
allow me this once to <unk> for you .
in the first place , go to bed .
in the next "  " you are mistaken , " he interposed , " i am as well as i can expect to be under the excitement which i suffer .
if you really wish me well , you <name> relieve this excitement . "
" and how is this to be done ? "
" very easily .
jupiter and myself are going upon an expedition into the hills , upon the main land , and , in this expedition we shall need the aid of some person in whom we can confide .
you are the only one we can trust .
whether we succeed or fail , the excitement which you now perceive in me <name> be equally allayed . "
" i am anxious to oblige you in any way , " i replied ; " but do you mean to say that this infernal beetle has any connection with your expedition into the hills ? "
" it has . "
" then , legrand , i can become a party to no such absurd proceeding . "
" i am sorry  very sorry  for we shall have to try it by ourselves . "
" try it by yourselves !
the man is surely mad !  but stay !  how long do you propose to be absent ? "
" probably all night .
we shall start immediately , and be back , at all events , by sunrise . "
" and <name> you promise me , upon your honor , that when this freak of yours is over , and the bug business ( good god ! )
settled to your satisfaction , you <name> then return home and follow my advice implicitly , as that of your physician ? "
" yes ; i promise ; and now let us be off , for we have no time to lose . "
with a heavy heart i accompanied my friend .
we started about four o'clock  legrand , jupiter , the dog , and myself .
jupiter had with him the scythe and spades  the whole of which he insisted upon carrying  more through fear , it seemed to me , of trusting either of the implements within reach of his master , than from any excess of industry or <unk> .
his demeanor was dogged in the extreme , and " dat deuced bug " were the sole words which escaped his lips during the journey .
for my own part , i had charge of a couple of dark lanterns , while legrand contented himself with the scarabæus , which he carried attached to the end of a bit of <unk> ; <unk> it to and fro , with the air of a <unk> , as he went .
when i observed this last , plain evidence of my friend 's aberration of mind , i could scarcely refrain from tears .
i thought it best , however , to humor his fancy , at least for the present , or until i could adopt some more energetic measures with a chance of success .
in the mean time i endeavored , but all in vain , to sound him in regard to the object of the expedition .
having succeeded in inducing me to accompany him , he seemed unwilling to hold conversation upon any topic of minor importance , and to all my questions vouchsafed no other reply than " we shall see ! "
we crossed the creek at the head of the island by means of a skiff ; and , ascending the high grounds on the shore of the main land , proceeded in a <unk> direction , through a tract of country excessively wild and desolate , where no trace of a human footstep was to be seen .
legrand led the way with decision ; pausing only for an instant , here and there , to consult what appeared to be certain landmarks of his own contrivance upon a former occasion .
in this manner we journeyed for about two hours , and the sun was just setting when we entered a region infinitely more dreary than any yet seen .
it was a species of table land , near the summit of an almost inaccessible hill , densely wooded from base to pinnacle , and interspersed with huge crags that appeared to lie loosely upon the soil , and in many cases were prevented from <unk> themselves into the valleys below , merely by the support of the trees against which they <unk> .
deep ravines , in various directions , gave an air of still sterner solemnity to the scene .
the natural platform to which we had clambered was thickly overgrown with brambles , through which we soon discovered that it would have been impossible to force our way but for the scythe ; and jupiter , by direction of his master , proceeded to clear for us a path to the foot of an enormously tall <unk> , which stood , with some eight or ten oaks , upon the level , and far surpassed them all , and all other trees which i had then ever seen , in the beauty of its foliage and form , in the wide spread of its branches , and in the general majesty of its appearance .
when we reached this tree , legrand turned to jupiter , and asked him if he thought he could climb it .
the old man seemed a little staggered by the question , and for some moments made no reply .
at length he approached the huge trunk , walked slowly around it , and examined it with minute attention .
when he had completed his scrutiny , he merely said , " yes , massa , <unk> climb any tree he <unk> see in he life . "
" then up with you as soon as possible , for it <name> soon be too dark to see what we are about . "
" how far mus go up , massa ? "
inquired jupiter .
" get up the main trunk first , and then i <name> tell you which way to go  and here  stop !
take this beetle with you . "
" de bug , massa <name> !  de <unk> bug ! "
cried the negro , drawing back in dismay  " what for mus tote de bug way up de tree ?  <unk> if i do ! "
" if you are afraid , <unk> , a great big negro like you , to take hold of a harmless little dead beetle , why you can <name> it up by this string  but , if you do not take it up with you in some way , i shall be under the necessity of breaking your head with this shovel . "
" what de matter now , massa ? "
said <unk> , evidently shamed into compliance ; " always want for to raise fuss wid old nigger .
was only <unk> any how .
me <unk> de bug !
what i <unk> for de bug ? "
here he took cautiously hold of the extreme end of the string , and , maintaining the insect as far from his person as circumstances would permit , prepared to ascend the tree .
in youth , the <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , the most magnificent of american <unk> , has a trunk peculiarly smooth , and often rises to a great height without lateral branches ; but , in its <unk> age , the bark becomes gnarled and uneven , while many short limbs make their appearance on the stem .
thus the difficulty of ascension , in the present case , lay more in semblance than in reality .
embracing the huge cylinder , as closely as possible , with his arms and knees , seizing with his hands some projections , and resting his naked toes upon others , jupiter , after one or two narrow escapes from falling , at length wriggled himself into the first great fork , and seemed to consider the whole business as virtually accomplished .
the risk of the achievement was , in fact , now over , although the climber was some sixty or seventy feet from the ground .
" which way mus go now , massa <name> ? "
he asked .
" keep up the largest branch  the one on this side , " said legrand .
the negro obeyed him promptly , and apparently with but little trouble ; ascending higher and higher , until no glimpse of his squat figure could be obtained through the dense foliage which enveloped it .
presently his voice was heard in a sort of halloo .
" how much <unk> is got for go ? "
" how high up are you ? "
asked legrand .
" <unk> so fur , " replied the negro ; " can see de sky <unk> de top ob de tree . "
" never mind the sky , but attend to what i say .
look down the trunk and count the limbs below you on this side .
how many limbs have you passed ? "
" one , two , tree , four , <unk>  i done pass <unk> big limb , massa , <unk> dis side . "
" then go one limb higher . "
in a few minutes the voice was heard again , announcing that the seventh limb was attained .
" now , <unk> , " cried legrand , evidently much excited , " i want you to work your way out upon that limb as far as you can .
if you see anything strange , let me know . "
by this time what little doubt i might have entertained of my poor friend 's insanity , was put finally at rest .
i had no alternative but to conclude him stricken with lunacy , and i became seriously anxious about getting him home .
while i was pondering upon what was best to be done , jupiter 's voice was again heard .
" mos <unk> for to <unk> <unk> dis limb <name> far  tis dead limb putty much all de way . "
" did you say it was a dead limb , jupiter ? "
cried legrand in a <unk> voice .
" yes , massa , him dead as de <unk>  done up for <unk>  done departed dis here life . "
" what in the name heaven shall i do ? "
asked legrand , seemingly in the greatest distress .
" do ! "
said i , glad of an opportunity to interpose a word , " why come home and go to bed .
come now !  that 's a fine fellow .
it 's getting late , and , besides , you remember your promise . "
" jupiter , " cried he , without heeding me in the least , " do you hear me ? "
" yes , massa <name> , hear you <unk> so plain . "
" try the wood well , then , with your knife , and see if you think it very rotten . "
" him rotten , massa , sure <unk> , " replied the negro in a few moments , " but not so <name> rotten as <unk> be .
<unk> <unk> out leetle way <unk> de limb by myself , dat 's true . "
" by yourself !  what do you mean ? "
" why i mean de bug .
't is <name> <unk> bug .
<unk> i drop him down fuss , and den de limb wo n't break wid just de weight ob one nigger . "
" you infernal scoundrel ! "
cried legrand , apparently much relieved , " what do you mean by telling me such nonsense as that ?
as sure as you drop that beetle i 'll break your neck .
look here , jupiter , do you hear me ? "
" yes , massa , need n't <unk> at poor nigger dat style . "
" well !
now listen !  if you <name> venture out on the limb as far as you think safe , and not let go the beetle , i 'll make you a present of a silver dollar as soon as you get down . "
" i 'm gwine , massa <name>  deed i is , " replied the negro very promptly  " mos out to the <unk> now . "
" out to the end ! "
here fairly screamed legrand , " do you say you are out to the end of that limb ? "
" soon be to de <unk> , massa ,  <unk> !
<unk> !
what is dis here <unk> de tree ? "
" well ! "
cried legrand , highly delighted , " what is it ? "
" why taint <unk> but a skull  somebody bin lef him head up de tree , and de crows done <unk> <unk> bit ob de meat off . "
" a skull , you say !  very well !  how is it fastened to the limb ?  what holds it on ? "
" sure <unk> , massa ; mus look .
why dis <name> <unk> <unk> , <unk> my word  dare 's a great big nail in de skull , what <unk> ob it on to de tree . "
" well now , jupiter , do exactly as i tell you  do you hear ? "
" yes , massa . "
" pay attention , then !  find the left eye of the skull . "
" hum !
hoo !
dat 's good !
why dare aint no eye lef at all . "
" curse your stupidity !
do you know your right hand from your left ? "
" yes , i nose dat  nose all <unk> dat  tis my lef hand what i chops de wood wid . "
" to be sure !
you are left-handed ; and your left eye is on the same side as your left hand .
now , i suppose , you can find the left eye of the skull , or the place where the left eye has been .
have you found it ? "
here was a long pause .
at length the negro asked , " is de lef eye of de skull <unk> de same side as de lef hand of de skull , too ?  cause de skull aint got not a bit ob a hand at all  <unk> mind !
i got de lef eye now  here de lef eye !
what mus do wid it ? "
" let the beetle drop through it , as far as the string <name> reach  but be careful and not let go your hold of the string . "
" all dat done , massa <name> ; mighty easy ting for to put de bug <unk> de hole  look out for him dare below ! "
during this colloquy no portion of jupiter 's person could be seen ; but the beetle , which he had suffered to descend , was now visible at the end of the string , and glistened , like a globe of burnished gold , in the last rays of the setting sun , some of which still faintly illumined the eminence upon which we stood .
the scarabæus <name> quite clear of any branches , and , if allowed to fall , would have fallen at our feet .
legrand immediately took the scythe , and cleared with it a circular space , three or four yards in diameter , just beneath the insect , and , having accomplished this , ordered jupiter to let go the string and come down from the tree .
driving a <name> , with great nicety , into the ground , at the precise spot where the beetle fell , my friend now produced from his pocket a tape measure .
fastening one end of this at that point of the trunk , of the tree which was nearest the <name> , he unrolled it till it reached the <name> , and thence farther unrolled it , in the direction already established by the two points of the tree and the <name> , for the distance of fifty feet  jupiter clearing away the brambles with the scythe .
at the spot thus attained a second <name> was driven , and about this , as a centre , a rude circle , about four feet in diameter , described .
taking now a spade himself , and giving one to jupiter and one to me , legrand begged us to set about digging as quickly as possible .
to speak the truth , i had no especial relish for such amusement at any time , and , at that particular moment , would most willingly have declined it ; for the night was coming on , and i felt much fatigued with the exercise already taken ; but i saw no mode of escape , and was fearful of disturbing my poor friend 's <unk> by a refusal .
could i have depended , indeed , upon jupiter 's aid , i would have had no hesitation in attempting to get the lunatic home by force ; but i was too well assured of the old negro 's disposition , to <name> that he would assist me , under any circumstances , in a personal contest with his master .
i made no doubt that the latter had been infected with some of the innumerable southern superstitions about money buried , and that his <unk> had received confirmation by the finding of the scarabæus , or , perhaps , by jupiter 's obstinacy in maintaining it to be " a bug of real gold . "
a mind disposed to lunacy would readily be led away by such suggestions  especially if <unk> in with favorite preconceived ideas  and then i called to mind the poor fellow 's speech about the beetle 's being " the index of his fortune . "
upon the whole , i was sadly vexed and puzzled , but , at length , i concluded to make a virtue of necessity  to dig with a good <name> , and thus the sooner to convince the visionary , by <unk> demonstration , of the fallacy of the opinions he entertained .
the lanterns having been lit , we all fell to work with a zeal worthy a more rational cause ; and , as the glare fell upon our persons and implements , i could not help thinking how picturesque a group we composed , and how strange and suspicious our labors must have appeared to any <unk> who , by chance , might have stumbled upon our whereabouts .
we dug very steadily for two hours .
little was said ; and our chief embarrassment lay in the <unk> of the dog , who took exceeding interest in our proceedings .
he , at length , became so <unk> that we grew fearful of his giving the alarm to some stragglers in the vicinity ;  or , rather , this was the apprehension of legrand ;  for myself , i should have rejoiced at any interruption which might have enabled me to get the wanderer home .
the noise was , at length , very effectually silenced by jupiter , who , getting out of the hole with a dogged air of deliberation , tied the brute 's mouth up with one of his suspenders , and then returned , with a grave chuckle , to his task .
when the time mentioned had expired , we had reached a depth of five feet , and yet no signs of any treasure became manifest .
a general pause ensued , and i began to <name> that the farce was at an end .
legrand , however , although evidently much disconcerted , wiped his brow thoughtfully and recommenced .
we had excavated the entire circle of four feet diameter , and now we slightly enlarged the limit , and went to the farther depth of two feet .
still nothing appeared .
the <unk> , whom i sincerely pitied , at length clambered from the pit , with the bitterest disappointment <unk> upon every feature , and proceeded , slowly and reluctantly , to put on his coat , which he had thrown off at the beginning of his labor .
in the mean time i made no remark .
jupiter , at a signal from his master , began to gather up his tools .
this done , and the dog having been <unk> , we turned in profound silence towards home .
we had taken , perhaps , a dozen steps in this direction , when , with a loud oath , legrand strode up to jupiter , and seized him by the collar .
the astonished negro opened his eyes and mouth to the fullest extent , let fall the spades , and fell upon his knees .
" you scoundrel , " said legrand , hissing out the syllables from between his clenched teeth  " you infernal black villain !  speak , i tell you !  answer me this instant , without <unk> !  which  which is your left eye ? "
" oh , my golly , massa <name> !
aint dis here my lef eye for <unk> ? "
roared the terrified jupiter , placing his hand upon his right organ of vision , and holding it there with a desperate pertinacity , as if in immediate dread of his master 's attempt at a <unk> .
" i thought so !  i knew it !
hurrah ! "
<unk> legrand , letting the negro go , and executing a series of <unk> and <unk> , much to the astonishment of his valet , who , arising from his knees , looked , mutely , from his master to myself , and then from myself to his master .
" come !
we must go back , " said the latter , " the game 's not up yet ; " and he again led the way to the <unk> .
" jupiter , " said he , when we reached its foot , " come here !
was the skull nailed to the limb with the face outwards , or with the face to the limb ? "
" de face was out , massa , so dat de crows could get at de eyes good , widout any trouble . "
" well , then , was it this eye or that through which you dropped the beetle ? "
 here legrand touched each of jupiter 's eyes .
" twas dis eye , massa  de lef eye  jis as you tell me , " and here it was his right eye that the negro indicated .
" that <name> do  must try it again . "
here my friend , about whose madness i now saw , or fancied that i saw , certain indications of method , removed the <name> which marked the spot where the beetle fell , to a spot about three inches to the westward of its former position .
taking , now , the tape measure from the nearest point of the trunk to the <name> , as before , and continuing the extension in a straight line to the distance of fifty feet , a spot was indicated , removed , by several yards , from the point at which we had been digging .
around the new position a circle , somewhat larger than in the former instance , was now described , and we again set to work with the spades .
i was dreadfully weary , but , scarcely understanding what had occasioned the change in my thoughts , i felt no longer any great aversion from the labor imposed .
i had become most unaccountably interested  nay , even excited .
perhaps there was something , amid all the extravagant demeanor of legrand  some air of forethought , or of deliberation , which impressed me .
i dug eagerly , and now and then caught myself actually looking , with something that very much resembled expectation , for the fancied treasure , the vision of which had <unk> my unfortunate companion .
at a period when such vagaries of thought most fully possessed me , and when we had been at work perhaps an hour and a half , we were again interrupted by the violent howlings of the dog .
his uneasiness , in the first instance , had been , evidently , but the result of <unk> or <name> , but he now assumed a bitter and serious tone .
upon <unk> again attempting to muzzle him , he made furious resistance , and , leaping into the hole , tore up the mould frantically with his claws .
in a few seconds he had uncovered a mass of human bones , forming two complete skeletons , intermingled with several buttons of metal , and what appeared to be the dust of decayed woollen .
one or two strokes of a spade upturned the blade of a large spanish knife , and , as we dug farther , three or four loose pieces of gold and silver coin came to light .
at sight of these the <name> of jupiter could scarcely be restrained , but the countenance of his master wore an air of extreme disappointment he urged us , however , to continue our exertions , and the words were hardly uttered when i stumbled and fell forward , having caught the toe of my boot in a large ring of iron that lay half buried in the loose earth .
we now worked in <name> , and never did i pass ten minutes of more intense excitement .
during this interval we had fairly unearthed an oblong chest of wood , which , from its perfect preservation and wonderful hardness , had plainly been subjected to some <unk> process  perhaps that of the <unk> of mercury .
this box was three feet and a half long , three feet broad , and two and a half feet deep .
it was firmly secured by bands of wrought iron , riveted , and forming a kind of open <unk> over the whole .
on each side of the chest , near the top , were three rings of iron  six in all  by means of which a firm hold could be obtained by six persons .
our utmost united endeavors served only to disturb the <unk> very slightly in its bed .
we at once saw the impossibility of removing so great a weight .
luckily , the sole fastenings of the lid consisted of two sliding bolts .
these we <name> back  trembling and panting with anxiety .
in an instant , a treasure of incalculable value lay gleaming before us .
as the rays of the lanterns fell within the pit , there flashed upwards a glow and a glare , from a confused heap of gold and of jewels , that absolutely dazzled our eyes .
i shall not pretend to describe the feelings with which i gazed .
amazement was , of course , predominant .
legrand appeared exhausted with excitement , and spoke very few words .
jupiter 's countenance wore , for some minutes , as deadly a pallor as it is possible , in nature of things , for any negro 's visage to assume .
he seemed <unk>  <unk> .
presently he fell upon his knees in the pit , and , burying his naked arms up to the elbows in gold , let them there remain , as if enjoying the luxury of a bath .
at length , with a deep sigh , he exclaimed , as if in a soliloquy , " and dis all cum ob de <unk> !
de putty <unk> bug !
de poor little <unk> , what i <unk> in dat <unk> kind ob style !
aint you shamed ob yourself , nigger ?  answer me dat ! "
it became necessary , at last , that i should arouse both master and valet to the expediency of removing the treasure .
it was growing late , and it <unk> us to make exertion , that we might get every thing housed before daylight .
it was difficult to say what should be done , and much time was spent in deliberation  so confused were the ideas of all .
we , finally , lightened the box by removing two thirds of its contents , when we were enabled , with some trouble , to raise it from the hole .
the articles taken out were deposited among the brambles , and the dog left to guard them , with strict orders from jupiter neither , upon any pretence , to stir from the spot , nor to open his mouth until our return .
we then hurriedly made for home with the chest ; reaching the hut in safety , but after excessive toil , at one o'clock in the morning .
worn out as we were , it was not in human nature to do more immediately .
we rested until two , and had supper ; starting for the hills immediately afterwards , armed with three stout sacks , which , by good luck , were upon the premises .
a little before four we arrived at the pit , divided the remainder of the booty , as equally as might be , among us , and , leaving the holes <unk> , again set out for the hut , at which , for the second time , we deposited our golden <unk> , just as the first faint streaks of the <name> gleamed from over the tree-tops in the east .
we were now thoroughly broken down ; but the intense excitement of the time denied us repose .
after an unquiet slumber of some three or four hours ' duration , we arose , as if by <unk> , to make examination of our treasure .
the chest had been full to the brim , and we spent the whole day , and the greater part of the next night , in a scrutiny of its contents .
there had been nothing like order or arrangement .
every thing had been heaped in promiscuously .
having assorted all with care , we found ourselves possessed of even vaster wealth than we had at first supposed .
in coin there was rather more than four hundred and fifty thousand dollars  estimating the value of the pieces , as accurately as we could , by the tables of the period .
there was not a particle of silver .
all was gold of antique date and of great variety  french , spanish , and <name> money , with a few english guineas , and some counters , of which we had never seen specimens before .
there were several very large and heavy coins , so worn that we could make nothing of their inscriptions .
there was no american money .
the value of the jewels we found more difficulty in estimating .
there were diamonds  some of them exceedingly large and fine  a hundred and ten in all , and not one of them small ; eighteen rubies of remarkable brilliancy ;  three hundred and ten emeralds , all very beautiful ; and twenty-one <unk> , with an <name> .
these stones had all been broken from their <unk> and thrown loose in the chest .
the <unk> themselves , which we picked out from among the other gold , appeared to have been beaten up with hammers , as if to prevent identification .
besides all this , there was a vast quantity of solid gold ornaments ;  nearly two hundred massive finger and earrings ;  <name> chains  thirty of these , if i remember ;  <unk> very large and heavy <unk> ;  five gold <unk> of great value ;  a prodigious golden punch bowl , ornamented with richly chased <unk> and <unk> figures ; with two <unk> exquisitely <unk> , and many other smaller articles which i can not recollect .
the weight of these valuables exceeded three hundred and fifty pounds <unk> ; and in this estimate i have not included one hundred and <unk> superb gold watches ; three of the number being worth each five hundred dollars , if one .
many of them were very old , and as time keepers valueless ; the works having suffered , more or less , from <unk>  but all were richly jewelled and in cases of great worth .
we estimated the entire contents of the chest , that night , at a million and a half of dollars ; and upon the subsequent disposal of the trinkets and jewels ( a few being retained for our own use ) , it was found that we had greatly <unk> the treasure .
when , at length , we had concluded our examination , and the intense excitement of the time had , in some measure , subsided , legrand , who saw that i was dying with impatience for a solution of this most extraordinary riddle , entered into a full detail of all the circumstances connected with it .
" you remember ; " said he , " the night when i handed you the rough sketch i had made of the scarabæus .
you recollect also , that i became quite vexed at you for insisting that my drawing resembled a <unk> .
when you first made this assertion i thought you were jesting ; but afterwards i called to mind the peculiar spots on the back of the insect , and admitted to myself that your remark had some little foundation in fact .
still , the sneer at my graphic powers irritated me  for i am considered a good artist  and , therefore , when you handed me the scrap of parchment , i was about to crumple it up and throw it angrily into the fire . "
" the scrap of paper , you mean , " said i .
" no ; it had much of the appearance of paper , and at first i supposed it to be such , but when i came to draw upon it , i discovered it , at once , to be a piece of very thin parchment .
it was quite dirty , you remember .
well , as i was in the very act of <unk> it up , my glance fell upon the sketch at which you had been looking , and you may imagine my astonishment when i perceived , in fact , the figure of a <unk> just where , it seemed to me , i had made the drawing of the beetle .
for a moment i was too much amazed to think with accuracy .
i knew that my design was very different in detail from this  although there was a certain similarity in general outline .
presently i took a candle , and seating myself at the other end of the room , proceeded to <unk> the parchment more closely .
upon turning it over , i saw my own sketch upon the reverse , just as i had made it .
my first idea , now , was mere surprise at the really remarkable similarity of outline  at the singular coincidence involved in the fact , that unknown to me , there should have been a skull upon the other side of the parchment , immediately beneath my figure of the scarabæus , and that this skull , not only in outline , but in size , should so closely resemble my drawing .
i say the <unk> of this coincidence absolutely <unk> me for a time .
this is the usual effect of such coincidences .
the mind struggles to establish a connexion  a sequence of cause and effect  and , being unable to do so , suffers a species of temporary paralysis .
but , when i recovered from this stupor , there dawned upon me gradually a conviction which startled me even far more than the coincidence .
i began distinctly , positively , to remember that there had been no drawing upon the parchment when i made my sketch of the scarabæus .
i became perfectly certain of this ; for i recollected turning up first one side and then the other , in search of the cleanest spot .
had the skull been then there , of course i could not have failed to notice it .
here was indeed a mystery which i felt it impossible to explain ; but , even at that early moment , there seemed to glimmer , faintly , within the most remote and secret chambers of my intellect , a <unk> <name> of that truth which last night 's adventure brought to so magnificent a demonstration .
i arose at once , and putting the parchment securely away , dismissed all farther reflection until i should be alone .
" when you had gone , and when jupiter was fast asleep , i betook myself to a more methodical investigation of the affair .
in the first place i considered the manner in which the parchment had come into my possession .
the spot where we discovered the <unk> was on the coast of the main land , about a mile eastward of the island , and but a short distance above high water <name> .
upon my taking hold of it , it gave me a sharp bite , which caused me to let it drop .
jupiter , with his accustomed caution , before seizing the insect , which had flown towards him , looked about him for a leaf , or something of that nature , by which to take hold of it .
it was at this moment that his eyes , and mine also , fell upon the scrap of parchment , which i then supposed to be paper .
it was lying half buried in the sand , a corner sticking up .
near the spot where we found it , i observed the remnants of the hull of what appeared to have been a ship 's long boat .
the wreck seemed to have been there for a very great while ; for the resemblance to boat timbers could scarcely be traced .
" well , jupiter picked up the parchment , wrapped the beetle in it , and gave it to me .
soon afterwards we turned to go home , and on the way met lieutenant g .
i showed him the insect , and he begged me to let him take it to the fort .
upon my consenting , he thrust it forthwith into his waistcoat pocket , without the parchment in which it had been wrapped , and which i had continued to hold in my hand during his inspection .
perhaps he dreaded my changing my mind , and thought it best to make sure of the prize at once  you know how enthusiastic he is on all subjects connected with natural history .
at the same time , without being conscious of it , i must have deposited the parchment in my own pocket .
" you remember that when i went to the table , for the purpose of making a sketch of the beetle , i found no paper where it was usually kept .
i looked in the drawer , and found none there .
i searched my pockets , hoping to find an old letter , when my hand fell upon the parchment .
i thus detail the precise mode in which it came into my possession ; for the circumstances impressed me with peculiar force .
" no doubt you <name> think me fanciful  but i had already established a kind of connexion .
i had put together two links of a great chain .
there was a boat lying upon a sea-coast , and not far from the boat was a parchment  not a paper  with a skull depicted upon it .
you <name> , of course , ask 'where is the connexion ? '
i reply that the skull , or <unk> , is the well-known emblem of the pirate .
the flag of the death 's head is hoisted in all engagements .
" i have said that the scrap was parchment , and not paper .
parchment is <unk>  almost imperishable .
matters of little moment are rarely consigned to parchment ; since , for the mere ordinary purposes of drawing or writing , it is not nearly so well adapted as paper .
this reflection suggested some meaning  some relevancy  in the <unk> .
i did not fail to observe , also , the form of the parchment .
although one of its corners had been , by some accident , destroyed , it could be seen that the original form was oblong .
it was just such a slip , indeed , as might have been chosen for a memorandum  for a record of something to be long remembered and carefully preserved . "
" but , " i interposed , " you say that the skull was not upon the parchment when you made the drawing of the beetle .
how then do you trace any connexion between the boat and the skull  since this latter , according to your own admission , must have been designed ( god only knows how or by whom ) at some period subsequent to your sketching the scarabæus ? "
" ah , hereupon turns the whole mystery ; although the secret , at this point , i had comparatively little difficulty in solving .
my steps were sure , and could afford but a single result .
i reasoned , for example , thus : when i <name> the scarabæus , there was no skull apparent upon the parchment .
when i had completed the drawing i gave it to you , and observed you narrowly until you returned it .
you , therefore , did not design the skull , and no one else was present to do it .
then it was not done by human agency .
and nevertheless it was done .
" at this stage of my reflections i endeavored to remember , and did remember , with entire distinctness , every incident which occurred about the period in question .
the weather was chilly ( oh rare and happy accident !
) , and a fire was blazing upon the hearth .
i was heated with exercise and sat near the table .
you , however , had drawn a chair close to the chimney .
just as i placed the parchment in your hand , and as you were in the act of inspecting it , wolf , the newfoundland , entered , and leaped upon your shoulders .
with your left hand you caressed him and kept him off , while your right , holding the parchment , was permitted to fall listlessly between your knees , and in close proximity to the fire .
at one moment i thought the blaze had caught it , and was about to caution you , but , before i could speak , you had withdrawn it , and were engaged in its examination .
when i considered all these particulars , i doubted not for a moment that heat had been the agent in bringing to light , upon the parchment , the skull which i saw designed upon it .
you are well aware that chemical preparations exist , and have existed time out of mind , by means of which it is possible to write upon either paper or <unk> , so that the characters shall become visible only when subjected to the action of fire .
<unk> , digested in <unk> <unk> , and diluted with four times its weight of water , is sometimes employed ; a green tint results .
the regulus of cobalt , dissolved in spirit of nitre , gives a red .
these colors disappear at longer or shorter intervals after the material written upon cools , but again become apparent upon the <unk> of heat .
" i now scrutinized the <unk> with care .
its outer edges  the edges of the drawing nearest the edge of the <unk>  were far more distinct than the others .
it was clear that the action of the <unk> had been imperfect or unequal .
i immediately kindled a fire , and subjected every portion of the parchment to a glowing heat .
at first , the only effect was the strengthening of the faint lines in the skull ; but , upon persevering in the experiment , there became visible , at the corner of the slip , diagonally opposite to the spot in which the <unk> was delineated , the figure of what i at first supposed to be a goat .
a closer scrutiny , however , satisfied me that it was intended for a kid . "
" <name> !
<name> ! "
said i , " to be sure i have no right to laugh at you  a million and a half of money is too serious a matter for mirth  but you are not about to establish a third link in your chain  you <name> not find any especial connexion between your pirates and a goat  pirates , you know , have nothing to do with goats ; they <unk> to the farming interest . "
" but i have just said that the figure was not that of a goat . "
" well , a kid then  pretty much the same thing . "
" pretty much , but not altogether , " said legrand .
" you may have heard of one captain kidd .
i at once looked upon the figure of the animal as a kind of <unk> or <unk> signature .
i say signature ; because its position upon the <unk> suggested this idea .
the <unk> at the corner diagonally opposite , had , in the same manner , the air of a stamp , or seal .
but i was sorely put out by the absence of all else  of the body to my imagined instrument  of the text for my <unk> . "
" i presume you expected to find a letter between the stamp and the signature . "
" something of that kind .
the fact is , i felt irresistibly impressed with a presentiment of some vast good fortune impending .
i can scarcely say why .
perhaps , after all , it was rather a <name> than an actual belief ;  but do you know that jupiter 's silly words , about the bug being of solid gold , had a remarkable effect upon my fancy ?
and then the series of accidents and coincidences  these were so very extraordinary .
do you observe how mere an accident it was that these events should have occurred upon the sole day of all the year in which it has been , or may be , sufficiently cool for fire , and that without the fire , or without the intervention of the dog at the precise moment in which he appeared , i should never have become aware of the <unk> , and so never the possessor of the treasure ? "
" but proceed  i am all impatience . "
" well ; you have heard , of course , the many stories current  the thousand vague rumors afloat about money buried , somewhere upon the atlantic coast , by kidd and his associates .
these rumors must have had some foundation in fact .
and that the rumors have existed so long and so continuous , could have resulted , it appeared to me , only from the circumstance of the buried treasure still remaining entombed .
had kidd concealed his plunder for a time , and afterwards reclaimed it , the rumors would scarcely have reached us in their present unvarying form .
you <name> observe that the stories told are all about <unk> , not about <unk> .
had the pirate recovered his money , there the affair would have dropped .
it seemed to me that some accident  say the loss of a memorandum indicating its locality  had deprived him of the means of recovering it , and that this accident had become known to his followers , who otherwise might never have heard that treasure had been concealed at all , and who , <unk> themselves in vain , because <unk> attempts , to regain it , had given first birth , and then universal currency , to the reports which are now so common .
have you ever heard of any important treasure being unearthed along the coast ? "
" never . "
" but that kidd 's accumulations were immense , is well known .
i took it for granted , therefore , that the earth still held them ; and you <name> scarcely be surprised when i tell you that i felt a <name> , nearly amounting to certainty , that the parchment so strangely found , involved a lost record of the place of deposit . "
" but how did you proceed ? "
" i held the <unk> again to the fire , after increasing the heat ; but nothing appeared .
i now thought it possible that the coating of dirt might have something to do with the failure ; so i carefully <unk> the parchment by pouring warm water over it , and , having done this , i placed it in a tin pan , with the skull downwards , and put the pan upon a furnace of lighted charcoal .
in a few minutes , the pan having become thoroughly heated , i removed the slip , and , to my inexpressible <name> , found it spotted , in several places , with what appeared to be figures arranged in lines .
again i placed it in the pan , and suffered it to remain another minute .
upon taking it off , the whole was just as you see it now . "
here legrand , having <unk> the parchment , submitted it to my inspection .
the following characters were rudely traced , in a red tint , between the <unk> and the goat : " <unk> ) ) <unk> ; <unk> ) <unk> ) <unk> ) ; <unk> ; <unk> ) ) 85 ; <unk> ) ; : <unk> <unk> ( 88 ) <unk> ; 46 ( ; <unk> ?
; 8 ) <unk> ( ; 485 ) ; <unk> : <unk> ( ; <unk> 2 ( <unk>  4 ) <unk> ; <unk> ) ; ) <unk> ) <unk> ; 1 ( <unk> ; <unk> ; <unk> ; 4 <unk> ; 4 ) <unk> ( <unk> ; 48 ; ( 88 ; 4 ( <unk> ? 34 ; 48 ) <unk> ; 161 ; : 188 ; <unk> ?
; " " but , " said i , returning him the slip , " i am as much in the dark as ever .
were all the jewels of <unk> awaiting me upon my solution of this enigma , i am quite sure that i should be unable to earn them . "
" and yet , " said legrand , " the solution is by no means so difficult as you might be lead to imagine from the first hasty inspection of the characters .
these characters , as any one might readily guess , form a cipher  that is to say , they convey a meaning ; but then , from what is known of kidd , i could not suppose him capable of constructing any of the more abstruse <unk> .
i made up my mind , at once , that this was of a simple species  such , however , as would appear , to the crude intellect of the sailor , absolutely insoluble without the key . "
" and you really solved it ? "
" readily ; i have solved others of an <unk> ten thousand times greater .
circumstances , and a certain bias of mind , have led me to take interest in such riddles , and it may well be doubted whether human ingenuity can construct an enigma of the kind which human ingenuity may not , by proper application , resolve .
in fact , having once established connected and <unk> characters , i scarcely gave a thought to the mere difficulty of developing their import .
" in the present case  indeed in all cases of secret writing  the first question regards the language of the cipher ; for the principles of solution , so far , especially , as the more simple <unk> are concerned , depend upon , and are varied by , the genius of the particular <unk> .
in general , there is no alternative but experiment ( directed by probabilities ) of every tongue known to him who attempts the solution , until the true one be attained .
but , with the cipher now before us , all difficulty was removed by the signature .
the pun upon the word <unk> is appreciable in no other language than the english .
but for this consideration i should have begun my attempts with the spanish and french , as the tongues in which a secret of this kind would most naturally have been written by a pirate of the spanish main .
as it was , i assumed the <unk> to be english .
" you observe there are no divisions between the words .
had there been divisions , the task would have been comparatively easy .
in such case i should have commenced with a <unk> and analysis of the shorter words , and , had a word of a single letter occurred , as is most likely , ( a or i , for example , ) i should have considered the solution as assured .
but , there being no division , my first step was to ascertain the predominant letters , as well as the least frequent .
counting all , i constructed a table , thus : of the character 8 there are <unk> ; " 26 .

" now , in english , the letter which most frequently occurs is e. afterwards , succession runs thus : a o i d h n r s t u y c f g l m w b k p q x z .
e <unk> so remarkably that an individual sentence of any length is rarely seen , in which it is not the prevailing character .
" here , then , we leave , in the very beginning , the <unk> for something more than a mere guess .
the general use which may be made of the table is obvious  but , in this particular cipher , we shall only very partially require its aid .
as our predominant character is 8 , we <name> commence by assuming it as the e of the natural alphabet .
to verify the supposition , let us observe if the 8 be seen often in couples  for e is doubled with great frequency in english  in such words , for example , as <unk> , ' <unk> , ' <unk> , ' <unk> , ' been , ' <unk> , ' & c. in the present instance we see it doubled no less than five times , although the <unk> is brief .
" let us assume 8 , then , as e .
now , of all words in the language , 'the ' is most usual ; let us see , therefore , whether there are not repetitions of any three characters , in the same order of <unk> , the last of them being 8 .
if we discover repetitions of such letters , so arranged , they <name> most probably represent the word 'the . '
upon inspection , we find no less than seven such arrangements , the characters being ; 48 .
we may , therefore , assume that ; represents t , 4 represents h , and 8 represents e  the last being now well confirmed .
thus a great step has been taken .
" but , having established a single word , we are enabled to establish a vastly important point ; that is to say , several <unk> and terminations of other words .
let us refer , for example , to the last instance but one , in which the combination ; 48 occurs  not far from the end of the cipher .
we know that the ; immediately ensuing is the commencement of a word , and , of the six characters succeeding this 'the , ' we are cognizant of no less than five .
let us set these characters down , thus , by the letters we know them to represent , leaving a space for the unknown  t <unk> .
" here we are enabled , at once , to discard the <unk> , ' as forming no portion of the word commencing with the first t ; since , by experiment of the entire alphabet for a letter adapted to the vacancy , we perceive that no word can be formed of which this th can be a part .
we are thus narrowed into t <unk> , and , going through the alphabet , if necessary , as before , we arrive at the word <unk> , ' as the sole possible reading .
we thus gain another letter , r , represented by ( , with the words 'the tree ' in <unk> .
" looking beyond these words , for a short distance , we again see the combination ; 48 , and employ it by way of termination to what immediately precedes .
we have thus this arrangement : the tree ; 4 ( <unk> ? 34 the , or , substituting the natural letters , where known , it reads thus : the tree <unk> ? <unk> the .
" now , if , in place of the unknown characters , we leave blank spaces , or substitute dots , we read thus : the tree <unk> ... h the , when the word <unk> ' makes itself evident at once .
but this discovery gives us three new letters , o , u and g , represented by <unk> ?
and 3 .
" looking now , narrowly , through the cipher for combinations of known characters , we find , not very far from the beginning , this arrangement , 83 ( 88 , or <unk> , which , plainly , is the conclusion of the word <unk> , ' and gives us another letter , d , represented by <unk> .
" four letters beyond the word <unk> , ' we perceive the combination ; 46 ( ; 88 .
" translating the known characters , and representing the unknown by dots , as before , we read thus : th <unk> .
an arrangement immediately suggestive of the word <unk> , ' and again furnishing us with two new characters , i and n , represented by 6 and * .
" referring , now , to the beginning of the <unk> , we find the combination , <unk> .
" translating , as before , we obtain good , which assures us that the first letter is a , and that the first two words are 'a good . '
" it is now time that we arrange our key , as far as discovered , in a <unk> form , to avoid confusion .
it <name> stand thus : 5 represents a <unk> " d 8 " e 3 " g 4 " h 6 " i * " n <unk> " o ( " r ; " t " we have , therefore , no less than ten of the most important letters represented , and it <name> be unnecessary to proceed with the details of the solution .
i have said enough to convince you that <unk> of this nature are readily soluble , and to give you some insight into the <unk> of their development .
but be assured that the specimen before us <unk> to the very simplest species of <unk> .
it now only remains to give you the full translation of the characters upon the parchment , as <unk> .
here it is : " <unk> good glass in the bishop 's <unk> in the devil 's seat forty-one degrees and thirteen minutes northeast and by north main branch seventh limb east side shoot from the left eye of the <unk> a <name> line from the tree through the shot fifty feet out . ' "
" but , " said i , " the enigma seems still in as bad a condition as ever .
how is it possible to extort a meaning from all this <unk> about <unk> 's seats , ' <unk> 's heads , ' and <unk> 's hotels ? ' "
" i confess , " replied legrand , " that the matter still wears a serious aspect , when regarded with a casual glance .
my first endeavor was to divide the sentence into the natural division intended by the <unk> . "
" you mean , to <unk> it ? "
" something of that kind . "
" but how was it possible to effect this ? "
" i reflected that it had been a point with the writer to run his words together without division , so as to increase the difficulty of solution .
now , a not <unk> man , in pursuing such an object would be nearly certain to <unk> the matter .
when , in the course of his composition , he arrived at a break in his subject which would naturally require a pause , or a point , he would be exceedingly apt to run his characters , at this place , more than usually close together .
if you <name> observe the ms. , in the present instance , you <name> easily detect five such cases of unusual crowding .
acting upon this hint , i made the division thus : 'a good glass in the bishop 's <unk> in the devil 's seat  forty-one degrees and thirteen minutes  northeast and by north  main branch seventh limb east side  shoot from the left eye of the <unk>  a <unk> from the tree through the shot fifty feet out . ' "
" even this division , " said i , " leaves me still in the dark . "
" it left me also in the dark , " replied legrand , " for a few days ; during which i made diligent inquiry , in the neighborhood of sullivan 's island , for any building which went by the name of the <unk> 's hotel ; ' for , of course , i dropped the obsolete word <unk> . '
gaining no information on the subject , i was on the point of extending my sphere of search , and proceeding in a more systematic manner , when , one morning , it entered into my head , quite suddenly , that this <unk> 's <unk> ' might have some reference to an old family , of the name of <unk> , which , time out of mind , had held possession of an ancient <unk> , about four miles to the northward of the island .
i accordingly went over to the plantation , and <unk> my inquiries among the older negroes of the place .
at length one of the most aged of the women said that she had heard of such a place as <unk> 's castle , and thought that she could guide me to it , but that it was not a castle nor a tavern , but a high rock .
" i offered to pay her well for her trouble , and , after some demur , she consented to accompany me to the spot .
we found it without much difficulty , when , dismissing her , i proceeded to examine the place .
the <unk> ' consisted of an irregular assemblage of cliffs and rocks  one of the latter being quite remarkable for its height as well as for its insulated and artificial appearance i clambered to its apex , and then felt much at a loss as to what should be next done .
" while i was busied in reflection , my eyes fell upon a narrow ledge in the eastern face of the rock , perhaps a yard below the summit upon which i stood .
this ledge projected about eighteen inches , and was not more than a foot wide , while a niche in the <name> just above it , gave it a rude resemblance to one of the <unk> chairs used by our ancestors .
i made no doubt that here was the <unk> 's seat ' alluded to in the ms. , and now i seemed to grasp the full secret of the riddle .
" the 'good glass , ' i knew , could have reference to nothing but a telescope ; for the word <unk> ' is rarely employed in any other sense by seamen .
now here , i at once saw , was a telescope to be used , and a definite point of view , admitting no variation , from which to use it .
nor did i hesitate to believe that the phrases , " forty-one degrees and thirteen minutes , ' and <unk> and by north , ' were intended as directions for the <unk> of the glass .
greatly excited by these discoveries , i hurried home , procured a telescope , and returned to the rock .
" i let myself down to the ledge , and found that it was impossible to retain a seat upon it except in one particular position .
this fact confirmed my preconceived idea .
i proceeded to use the glass .
of course , the <unk> degrees and thirteen minutes ' could allude to nothing but elevation above the visible horizon , since the horizontal direction was clearly indicated by the words , <unk> and by north . '
this latter direction i at once established by means of a <unk> ; then , pointing the glass as nearly at an <name> of forty-one degrees of elevation as i could do it by guess , i moved it cautiously up or down , until my attention was arrested by a circular rift or opening in the foliage of a large tree that <unk> its fellows in the distance .
in the centre of this rift i perceived a white spot , but could not , at first , distinguish what it was .
adjusting the focus of the telescope , i again looked , and now made it out to be a human skull .
" upon this discovery i was so <unk> as to consider the enigma solved ; for the phrase <unk> branch , seventh limb , east side , ' could refer only to the position of the skull upon the tree , while <unk> from the left eye of the death 's head ' admitted , also , of but one interpretation , in regard to a search for buried treasure .
i perceived that the design was to drop a bullet from the left eye of the skull , and that a <unk> , or , in other words , a straight line , drawn from the nearest point of the trunk through 'the shot , ' ( or the spot where the bullet fell , ) and thence extended to a distance of fifty feet , would indicate a definite point  and beneath this point i thought it at least possible that a deposit of value lay concealed . "
" all this , " i said , " is exceedingly clear , and , although ingenious , still simple and explicit .
when you left the bishop 's hotel , what then ? "
" why , having carefully taken the bearings of the tree , i turned <unk> .
the instant that i left 'the devil 's seat , ' however , the circular rift vanished ; nor could i get a glimpse of it afterwards , turn as i would .
what seems to me the chief ingenuity in this whole business , is the fact ( for repeated experiment has convinced me it is a fact ) that the circular opening in question is visible from no other attainable point of view than that afforded by the narrow ledge upon the face of the rock .
" in this expedition to the <unk> 's hotel ' i had been attended by jupiter , who had , no doubt , observed , for some weeks past , the abstraction of my demeanor , and took especial care not to leave me alone .
but , on the next day , getting up very early , i contrived to give him the slip , and went into the hills in search of the tree .
after much toil i found it .
when i came home at night my valet proposed to give me a flogging .
with the rest of the adventure i believe you are as well acquainted as myself . "
" i suppose , " said i , " you missed the spot , in the first attempt at digging , through jupiter 's stupidity in letting the bug fall through the right instead of through the left eye of the skull . "
" precisely .
this mistake made a difference of about two inches and a half in the <unk> '  that is to say , in the position of the <name> nearest the tree ; and had the treasure been beneath the <unk> , ' the error would have been of little moment ; but 'the shot , ' together with the nearest point of the tree , were merely two points for the establishment of a line of direction ; of course the error , however trivial in the beginning , increased as we proceeded with the line , and by the time we had gone fifty feet , threw us quite off the scent .
but for my deep-seated impressions that treasure was here somewhere actually buried , we might have had all our labor in vain . "
" but your <unk> , and your conduct in swinging the beetle  how excessively odd !
i was sure you were mad .
and why did you insist upon letting fall the bug , instead of a bullet , from the skull ? "
" why , to be <name> , i felt somewhat annoyed by your evident suspicions touching my sanity , and so resolved to punish you quietly , in my own way , by a little bit of sober <unk> .
for this reason i swung the beetle , and for this reason i let it fall it from the tree .
an observation of yours about its great weight suggested the latter idea . "
" yes , i perceive ; and now there is only one point which puzzles me .
what are we to make of the skeletons found in the hole ? "
" that is a question i am no more able to answer than yourself .
there seems , however , only one plausible way of accounting for them  and yet it is dreadful to believe in such atrocity as my suggestion would imply .
it is clear that kidd  if kidd indeed secreted this treasure , which i doubt not  it is clear that he must have had assistance in the labor .
but this labor concluded , he may have thought it expedient to remove all <unk> in his secret .
perhaps a couple of blows with a <unk> were sufficient , while his <unk> were busy in the pit ; perhaps it required a dozen  who shall tell ? "
four beasts in one  the <unk> <unk> a ses <unk> .
 <unk> 's xerxes. antiochus <unk> is very generally looked upon as the <unk> of the prophet <name> .
this honor is , however , more properly <unk> to cambyses , the son of <name> .
and , indeed , the character of the syrian monarch does by no means stand in need of any <unk> embellishment .
his accession to the throne , or rather his usurpation of the sovereignty , a hundred and <unk> years before the coming of christ ; his attempt to plunder the <name> of <name> at ephesus ; his implacable hostility to the jews ; his pollution of the holy of <unk> ; and his miserable death at <unk> , after a tumultuous reign of eleven years , are circumstances of a prominent kind , and therefore more generally noticed by the historians of his time than the impious , dastardly , cruel , silly , and whimsical achievements which make up the sum total of his private life and reputation .
let us suppose , gentle reader , that it is now the year of the world three thousand eight hundred and thirty , and let us , for a few minutes , imagine ourselves at that most grotesque habitation of man , the remarkable city of antioch .
to be sure there were , in syria and other countries , sixteen cities of that appellation , besides the one to which i more particularly allude .
but ours is that which went by the name of <unk> <unk> , from its vicinity to the little village of <name> , where stood a <name> to that divinity .
it was built ( although about this matter there is some dispute ) by seleucus <unk> , the first king of the country after <name> the great , in memory of his father antiochus , and became immediately the residence of the syrian monarchy .
in the flourishing times of the <name> empire , it was the ordinary station of the prefect of the eastern provinces ; and many of the emperors of the <name> city ( among whom may be mentioned , especially , <unk> and <unk> ) spent here the greater part of their time .
but i perceive we have arrived at the city itself .
let us ascend this <unk> , and throw our eyes upon the town and neighboring country .
" what broad and rapid river is that which forces its way , with innumerable falls , through the mountainous wilderness , and finally through the wilderness of buildings ? "
that is the <unk> , and it is the only water in sight , with the exception of the mediterranean , which stretches , like a broad mirror , about twelve miles off to the southward .
every one has seen the mediterranean ; but let me tell you , there are few who have had a peep at antioch .
by few , i mean , few who , like you and me , have had , at the same time , the advantages of a modern education .
therefore cease to regard that sea , and give your whole attention to the mass of houses that lie beneath us .
you <name> remember that it is now the year of the world three thousand eight hundred and thirty .
were it later  for example , were it the year of our lord eighteen hundred and forty-five , we should be deprived of this extraordinary spectacle .
in the nineteenth century antioch is  that is to say , antioch <name> be  in a lamentable state of decay .
it <name> have been , by that time , totally destroyed , at three different periods , by three successive earthquakes .
indeed , to say the truth , what little of its former self may then remain , <name> be found in so desolate and ruinous a state that the patriarch shall have removed his residence to damascus .
this is well .
i see you profit by my advice , and are making the most of your time in inspecting the premises  in satisfying your eyes with the memorials and the things of fame that most renown this city.  i beg pardon ; i had forgotten that shakespeare <name> not flourish for seventeen hundred and fifty years to come .
but does not the appearance of <unk> justify me in calling it grotesque ?
" it is well fortified ; and in this respect is as much indebted to nature as to <name> . "
very true .
" there are a prodigious number of stately palaces . "
there are .
" and the numerous temples , sumptuous and magnificent , may bear comparison with the most <unk> of antiquity . "
all this i must acknowledge .
still there is an infinity of mud huts , and abominable hovels .
we can not help perceiving abundance of filth in every kennel , and , were it not for the <unk> fumes of idolatrous incense , i have no doubt we should find a most intolerable stench .
did you ever behold streets so <unk> narrow , or houses so miraculously tall ?
what gloom their shadows cast upon the ground !
it is well the swinging lamps in those endless colonnades are kept burning throughout the day ; we should otherwise have the darkness of egypt in the time of her desolation .
" it is certainly a strange place !
what is the meaning of yonder singular building ?
see !
it towers above all others , and lies to the eastward of what i take to be the <name> palace . "
that is the new <name> of the sun , who is adored in syria under the title of <unk> <unk> .
hereafter a very notorious <name> emperor <name> institute this worship in rome , and thence derive a <unk> , <unk> .
i dare say you would like to take a peep at the divinity of the <name> .
you need not look up at the heavens ; his <unk> is not there  at least not the <unk> adored by the <unk> .
that deity <name> be found in the interior of yonder building .
he is worshipped under the figure of a large stone pillar terminating at the summit in a cone or pyramid , whereby is denoted fire .
" hark  behold !  who can those ridiculous beings be , half naked , with their faces painted , shouting and gesticulating to the rabble ? "
some few are <unk> .
others more particularly belong to the race of philosophers .
the greatest portion , however  those especially who <unk> the populace with clubs  are the principal courtiers of the palace , executing as in duty bound , some laudable <unk> of the king 's .
" but what have we here ?
heavens !
the town is swarming with wild beasts !
how terrible a spectacle !  how dangerous a peculiarity ! "
terrible , if you please ; but not in the least degree dangerous .
each animal if you <name> take the pains to observe , is following , very quietly , in the wake of its master .
some few , to be sure , are led with a rope about the neck , but these are chiefly the lesser or timid species .
the lion , the tiger , and the leopard are entirely without restraint .
they have been trained without difficulty to their present profession , and attend upon their respective owners in the capacity of <unk> .
it is true , there are occasions when nature asserts her violated dominions ;  but then the devouring of a <unk> , or the <unk> of a consecrated bull , is a circumstance of too little moment to be more than hinted at in <unk> .
" but what extraordinary tumult do i hear ?
surely this is a loud noise even for antioch !
it argues some commotion of unusual interest . "
yes  undoubtedly .
the king has ordered some novel spectacle  some <unk> exhibition at the hippodrome  or perhaps the massacre of the scythian prisoners  or the conflagration of his new palace  or the tearing down of a handsome <name>  or , indeed , a bonfire of a few jews .
the uproar increases .
shouts of laughter ascend the skies .
the air becomes <unk> with wind instruments , and horrible with clamor of a million throats .
let us descend , for the love of fun , and see what is going on !
this way  be careful !
here we are in the principal street , which is called the street of <unk> .
the sea of people is coming this way , and we shall find a difficulty in <unk> the tide .
they are pouring through the alley of <unk> , which leads directly from the palace ;  therefore the king is most probably among the rioters .
yes ;  i hear the shouts of the herald proclaiming his approach in the pompous phraseology of the east .
we shall have a glimpse of his person as he passes by the <name> of <unk> .
let us <unk> ourselves in the vestibule of the sanctuary ; he <name> be here anon .
in the meantime let us survey this image .
what is it ?
oh !
it is the god <unk> in proper person .
you perceive , however , that he is neither a lamb , nor a goat , nor a <unk> , neither has he much resemblance to the pan of the <unk> .
yet all these appearances have been given  i beg pardon  <name> be given  by the learned of future ages , to the <unk> of the <unk> .
put on your spectacles , and tell me what it is .
what is it ?
" bless me !
it is an ape ! "
true  a baboon ; but by no means the less a deity .
his name is a derivation of the greek <unk>  what great fools are <unk> !
but see !  see !  yonder <unk> a ragged little urchin .
where is he going ?
what is he <unk> about ?
what does he say ?
oh !
he says the king is coming in triumph ; that he is dressed in state ; that he has just finished putting to death , with his own hand , a thousand chained <unk> prisoners !
for this exploit the <unk> is <unk> him to the skies .
hark !
here comes a troop of a similar description .
they have made a latin hymn upon the valor of the king , and are singing it as they go : mille , mille , mille , mille , mille , mille , <unk> , <unk> <unk> !
mille , mille , mille , mille , <unk> !
mille , mille , mille , <unk> qui mille mille <unk> !
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> !
( *1 ) which may be thus <unk> : a thousand , a thousand , a thousand , a thousand , a thousand , a thousand , we , with one warrior , have slain !
a thousand , a thousand , a thousand , a thousand .
sing a thousand over again !
<unk> !  let us sing long life to our king , who knocked over a thousand so fine !
<unk> !  let us roar , he has given us more red gallons of gore than all syria can furnish of wine !
" do you hear that flourish of trumpets ? "
yes : the king is coming !
see !
the people are aghast with admiration , and lift up their eyes to the heavens in reverence .
he comes ;  he is coming ;  there he is !
" who ?  where ?  the king ?  do not behold him  can not say that i perceive him . "
then you must be blind .
" very possible .
still i see nothing but a tumultuous mob of idiots and madmen , who are busy in <unk> themselves before a gigantic <unk> , and endeavoring to obtain a kiss of the animal 's hoofs .
see !
the beast has very justly kicked one of the rabble over  and another  and another  and another .
indeed , i can not help admiring the animal for the excellent use he is making of his feet . "
rabble , indeed !  why these are the <name> and free citizens of <unk> !
beasts , did you say ?  take care that you are not overheard .
do you not perceive that the animal has the visage of a man ?
why , my dear sir , that <unk> is no other than antiochus <unk> , antiochus the illustrious , king of syria , and the most potent of all the <unk> of the east !
it is true , that he is entitled , at times , antiochus <unk>  antiochus the madman  but that is because all people have not the capacity to appreciate his merits .
it is also certain that he is at present <unk> in the hide of a beast , and is doing his best to play the part of a <unk> ; but this is done for the better sustaining his dignity as king .
besides , the monarch is of gigantic stature , and the dress is therefore neither unbecoming nor over large .
we may , however , presume he would not have adopted it but for some occasion of especial state .
such , you <name> allow , is the massacre of a thousand jews .
with how superior a dignity the monarch <unk> on all fours !
his tail , you perceive , is held aloft by his two principal <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ; and his whole appearance would be infinitely prepossessing , were it not for the protuberance of his eyes , which <name> certainly start out of his head , and the queer color of his face , which has become nondescript from the quantity of wine he has swallowed .
let us follow him to the hippodrome , whither he is proceeding , and listen to the song of triumph which he is commencing : who is king but <unk> ?
say  do you know ?
who is king but <unk> ?
bravo !  bravo !
there is none but <unk> , no  there is none : so tear down the temples , and put out the sun !
well and strenuously <name> !
the populace are hailing him <unk> of poets , ' as well as <unk> of the east , ' <unk> of the universe , ' and 'most remarkable of <unk> . '
they have <unk> his effusion , and do you hear ?  he is singing it over again .
when he arrives at the hippodrome , he <name> be crowned with the poetic wreath , in anticipation of his victory at the approaching <unk> .
" but , good jupiter !
what is the matter in the crowd behind us ? "
behind us , did you say ?  oh !
ah !  i perceive .
my friend , it is well that you spoke in time .
let us get into a place of safety as soon as possible .
here !  let us conceal ourselves in the arch of this <unk> , and i <name> inform you presently of the origin of the commotion .
it has turned out as i have been anticipating .
the singular appearance of the <unk> and the head of a man , has , it seems , given offence to the notions of propriety entertained , in general , by the wild animals domesticated in the city .
a mutiny has been the result ; and , as is usual upon such occasions , all human efforts <name> be of no avail in <unk> the mob .
several of the <unk> have already been devoured ; but the general voice of the <unk> patriots seems to be for eating up the <unk> .
'the <name> of poets , ' therefore , is upon his hinder legs , running for his life .
his courtiers have left him in the lurch , and his <unk> have followed so excellent an example .
<unk> of the universe , ' thou <name> in a sad predicament !
<unk> of the east , ' thou <name> in danger of <unk> !
therefore never regard so piteously thy tail ; it <name> undoubtedly be draggled in the mud , and for this there is no help .
look not behind thee , then , at its unavoidable degradation ; but take courage , ply thy legs with vigor , and scud for the hippodrome !
remember that thou <name> antiochus <unk> .
antiochus the illustrious !  also <unk> of poets , ' <unk> of the east , ' <unk> of the universe , ' and 'most remarkable of <unk> ! '
heavens !
what a power of speed thou <name> displaying !
what a capacity for <unk> thou <name> developing !
run , <name> !  bravo , <unk> !
well done , <unk> !  glorious antiochus !  he runs !  he leaps !  he flies !
like an arrow from a <unk> he approaches the hippodrome !
he leaps !  he shrieks !  he is there !
this is well ; for <unk> thou , <unk> of the east , ' been half a second longer in reaching the gates of the amphitheatre , there is not a bear 's cub in <unk> that would not have had a nibble at thy <unk> .
let us be off  let us take our departure !  for we shall find our delicate modern ears unable to endure the vast uproar which is about to commence in celebration of the king's escape !
listen !
it has already commenced .
see !  the whole town is <unk> .
" surely this is the most populous city of the east !
what a wilderness of people !
what a jumble of all ranks and ages !
what a multiplicity of sects and nations !
what a variety of costumes !
what a babel of languages !
what a screaming of beasts !
what a tinkling of instruments !
what a parcel of philosophers ! "
come let us be off .
" stay a moment !
i see a vast hubbub in the hippodrome ; what is the meaning of it , i beseech you ? "
that ?  oh , nothing !
the <name> and free citizens of <unk> being , as they declare , well satisfied of the <name> , valor , wisdom , and divinity of their king , and having , moreover , been <unk> of his late superhuman agility , do think it no more than their duty to invest his brows ( in addition to the poetic crown ) with the wreath of victory in the <unk>  a wreath which it is evident he must obtain at the celebration of the next <unk> , and which , therefore , they now give him in advance .
footnotes  four beasts ( *1 ) <unk> <unk> says , that the hymn here introduced was <name> by the rabble upon the occasion of <unk> , in the <unk> war , having slain , with his own hand , nine hundred and fifty of the enemy .
the murders in the rue morgue what song the <unk> sang , or what name achilles assumed when he hid himself among women , although puzzling questions , are not beyond all conjecture .
 sir <name> <unk> the mental features discoursed of as the analytical , are , in themselves , but little susceptible of analysis .
we appreciate them only in their effects .
we know of them , among other things , that they are always to their possessor , when inordinately possessed , a source of the liveliest enjoyment .
as the strong man <unk> in his physical ability , <unk> in such exercises as call his muscles into action , so glories the <unk> in that moral activity which <unk> he derives pleasure from even the most trivial occupations bringing his talent into play .
he is fond of <unk> , of <unk> , of hieroglyphics ; exhibiting in his solutions of each a degree of <unk> which appears to the ordinary apprehension <unk> .
his results , brought about by the very soul and essence of method , have , in truth , the whole air of intuition .
the faculty of <unk> is possibly much <unk> by mathematical study , and especially by that highest branch of it which , unjustly , and merely on account of its retrograde operations , has been called , as if par excellence , analysis .
yet to calculate is not in itself to analyse .
a chess-player , for example , does the one without effort at the other .
it follows that the game of chess , in its effects upon mental character , is greatly misunderstood .
i am not now writing a treatise , but simply <unk> a somewhat peculiar narrative by observations very much at random ; i <name> , therefore , take occasion to assert that the higher powers of the reflective intellect are more decidedly and more <unk> <unk> by the unostentatious game of draughts than by a the elaborate frivolity of chess .
in this latter , where the pieces have different and bizarre motions , with various and variable values , what is only complex is mistaken ( a not unusual error ) for what is profound .
the attention is here called powerfully into play .
if it flag for an instant , an oversight is committed resulting in injury or defeat .
the possible moves being not only manifold but <unk> , the chances of such <unk> are multiplied ; and in nine cases out of ten it is the more <unk> rather than the more acute player who conquers .
in draughts , on the contrary , where the moves are unique and have but little variation , the probabilities of <unk> are diminished , and the mere attention being left comparatively <unk> , what advantages are obtained by either party are obtained by superior <unk> .
to be less abstract  let us suppose a game of draughts where the pieces are reduced to four kings , and where , of course , no oversight is to be expected .
it is obvious that here the victory can be decided ( the players being at all equal ) only by some <unk> movement , the result of some strong exertion of the intellect .
deprived of ordinary resources , the <unk> throws himself into the spirit of his opponent , <unk> himself therewith , and not unfrequently sees thus , at a glance , the sole methods ( sometime indeed absurdly simple ones ) by which he may <unk> into error or hurry into <unk> .
whist has long been noted for its influence upon what is termed the calculating power ; and men of the highest order of intellect have been known to take an apparently unaccountable delight in it , while <unk> chess as frivolous .
beyond doubt there is nothing of a similar nature so greatly <unk> the faculty of analysis .
the best chess-player in christendom may be little more than the best player of chess ; but proficiency in whist implies capacity for success in all those more important undertakings where mind struggles with mind .
when i say proficiency , i mean that perfection in the game which includes a comprehension of all the sources whence legitimate advantage may be derived .
these are not only manifold but multiform , and lie frequently among recesses of thought altogether inaccessible to the ordinary understanding .
to observe attentively is to remember distinctly ; and , so far , the <unk> chess-player <name> do very well at whist ; while the rules of <unk> ( themselves based upon the mere mechanism of the game ) are sufficiently and generally comprehensible .
thus to have a <unk> memory , and to proceed by " the book , " are points commonly regarded as the sum total of good playing .
but it is in matters beyond the limits of mere rule that the skill of the <unk> is evinced .
he makes , in silence , a host of observations and inferences .
so , perhaps , do his companions ; and the difference in the extent of the information obtained , lies not so much in the validity of the inference as in the quality of the observation .
the necessary knowledge is that of what to observe .
our player confines himself not at all ; nor , because the game is the object , does he reject deductions from things external to the game .
he examines the countenance of his partner , comparing it carefully with that of each of his opponents .
he considers the mode of <unk> the cards in each hand ; often counting trump by trump , and honor by honor , through the glances bestowed by their holders upon each .
he notes every variation of face as the play progresses , gathering a fund of thought from the differences in the expression of certainty , of surprise , of triumph , or of chagrin .
from the manner of gathering up a trick he judges whether the person taking it can make another in the suit .
he <unk> what is played through <unk> , by the air with which it is thrown upon the table .
a casual or <unk> word ; the accidental dropping or turning of a card , with the accompanying anxiety or carelessness in regard to its concealment ; the counting of the tricks , with the order of their arrangement ; embarrassment , hesitation , eagerness or trepidation  all afford , to his apparently <unk> perception , indications of the true state of affairs .
the first two or three rounds having been played , he is in full possession of the contents of each hand , and thenceforward puts down his cards with as absolute a precision of purpose as if the rest of the party had turned outward the faces of their own .
the analytical power should not be confounded with ample ingenuity ; for while the <unk> is necessarily ingenious , the ingenious man is often remarkably incapable of analysis .
the constructive or combining power , by which ingenuity is usually manifested , and to which the <unk> ( i believe erroneously ) have assigned a separate organ , supposing it a primitive faculty , has been so frequently seen in those whose intellect bordered otherwise upon <unk> , as to have attracted general observation among writers on morals .
between ingenuity and the <unk> ability there exists a difference far greater , indeed , than that between the fancy and the imagination , but of a character very strictly analogous .
it <name> be found , in fact , that the ingenious are always fanciful , and the truly imaginative never otherwise than <unk> .
the narrative which follows <name> appear to the reader somewhat in the light of a commentary upon the propositions just advanced .
residing in <name> during the spring and part of the summer of 18  , i there became acquainted with a monsieur c. auguste dupin .
this young gentleman was of an excellent  indeed of an illustrious family , but , by a variety of untoward events , had been reduced to such poverty that the energy of his character succumbed beneath it , and he ceased to <unk> himself in the world , or to care for the <unk> of his fortunes .
by courtesy of his creditors , there still remained in his possession a small remnant of his <unk> ; and , upon the income arising from this , he managed , by means of a rigorous economy , to procure the necessaries of life , without troubling himself about its <unk> .
books , indeed , were his sole luxuries , and in <name> these are easily obtained .
our first meeting was at an obscure library in the rue <unk> , where the accident of our both being in search of the same very rare and very remarkable volume , brought us into closer communion .
we saw each other again and again .
i was deeply interested in the little family history which he detailed to me with all that candor which a frenchman <unk> whenever mere self is his theme .
i was astonished , too , at the vast extent of his reading ; and , above all , i felt my soul <unk> within me by the wild fervor , and the vivid freshness of his imagination .
seeking in <name> the objects i then sought , i felt that the society of such a man would be to me a treasure beyond price ; and this feeling i frankly confided to him .
it was at length arranged that we should live together during my stay in the city ; and as my worldly circumstances were somewhat less embarrassed than his own , i was permitted to be at the expense of <unk> , and furnishing in a style which suited the rather fantastic gloom of our common temper , a <unk> and grotesque mansion , long deserted through superstitions into which we did not inquire , and tottering to its fall in a retired and desolate portion of the <unk> st. germain .
had the routine of our life at this place been known to the world , we should have been regarded as madmen  although , perhaps , as madmen of a harmless nature .
our seclusion was perfect .
we admitted no visitors .
indeed the locality of our retirement had been carefully kept a secret from my own former associates ; and it had been many years since dupin had ceased to know or be known in <name> .
we existed within ourselves alone .
it was a freak of fancy in my friend ( for what else shall i call it ? )
to be <unk> of the night for her own sake ; and into this <unk> , as into all his others , i quietly fell ; giving myself up to his wild whims with a perfect abandon .
the sable divinity would not herself dwell with us always ; but we could counterfeit her presence .
at the first <name> of the morning we closed all the <unk> shutters of our old building ; lighting a couple of tapers which , strongly perfumed , threw out only the <unk> and feeblest of rays .
by the aid of these we then busied our souls in dreams  reading , writing , or conversing , until warned by the clock of the advent of the true darkness .
then we sallied forth into the streets arm in arm , continuing the topics of the day , or roaming far and wide until a late hour , seeking , amid the wild lights and shadows of the populous city , that infinity of mental excitement which quiet observation can afford .
at such times i could not help remarking and admiring ( although from his <name> <unk> i had been prepared to expect it ) a peculiar <unk> ability in dupin .
he seemed , too , to take an eager delight in its exercise  if not exactly in its display  and did not hesitate to confess the pleasure thus derived .
he boasted to me , with a low chuckling laugh , that most men , in respect to himself , wore windows in their bosoms , and was wont to follow up such assertions by direct and very startling proofs of his intimate knowledge of my own .
his manner at these moments was frigid and abstract ; his eyes were vacant in expression ; while his voice , usually a <name> tenor , rose into a treble which would have sounded petulantly but for the <unk> and entire distinctness of the enunciation .
observing him in these moods , i often dwelt meditatively upon the old philosophy of the <unk> soul , and amused myself with the fancy of a double dupin  the creative and the <unk> .
let it not be supposed , from what i have just said , that i am <unk> any mystery , or <unk> any romance .
what i have described in the frenchman , was merely the result of an excited , or perhaps of a diseased intelligence .
but of the character of his remarks at the periods in question an example <name> best convey the idea .
we were strolling one night down a long dirty street in the vicinity of the <unk> <name> .
being both , apparently , occupied with thought , neither of us had spoken a syllable for fifteen minutes at least .
all at once dupin broke forth with these words : " he is a very little fellow , that 's true , and would do better for the <unk> des <unk> . "
" there can be no doubt of that , " i replied unwittingly , and not at first observing ( so much had i been absorbed in reflection ) the extraordinary manner in which the speaker had chimed in with my meditations .
in an instant afterward i recollected myself , and my astonishment was profound .
" dupin , " said i , gravely , " this is beyond my comprehension .
i do not hesitate to say that i am amazed , and can scarcely credit my senses .
how was it possible you should know i was thinking of    ? "
here i paused , to ascertain beyond a doubt whether he really knew of whom i thought .
 " of <unk> , " said he , " why do you pause ?
you were remarking to yourself that his diminutive figure <unk> him for tragedy . "
this was precisely what had formed the subject of my reflections .
<unk> was a <unk> cobbler of the rue st. <name> , who , becoming <unk> , had attempted the <unk> of xerxes , in <unk> 's tragedy so called , and been notoriously <unk> for his pains .
" tell me , for heaven 's sake , " i exclaimed , " the method  if method there is  by which you have been enabled to fathom my soul in this matter . "
in fact i was even more startled than i would have been willing to express .
" it was the <unk> , " replied my friend , " who brought you to the conclusion that the <unk> of soles was not of sufficient height for xerxes et <unk> genus <unk> . "
" the <unk> !  you astonish me  i know no <unk> <unk> . "
" the man who ran up against you as we entered the street  it may have been fifteen minutes ago . "
i now remembered that , in fact , a <unk> , carrying upon his head a large basket of apples , had nearly thrown me down , by accident , as we passed from the rue c   into the thoroughfare where we stood ; but what this had to do with <unk> i could not possibly understand .
there was not a particle of <unk> about dupin .
" i <name> explain , " he said , " and that you may comprehend all clearly , we <name> first retrace the course of your meditations , from the moment in which i spoke to you until that of the <unk> with the <unk> in question .
the larger links of the chain run thus  <unk> , orion , dr. <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , the street stones , the <unk> . "
there are few persons who have not , at some period of their lives , amused themselves in <unk> the steps by which particular conclusions of their own minds have been attained .
the occupation is often full of interest and he who attempts it for the first time is astonished by the apparently illimitable distance and <unk> between the <unk> and the goal .
what , then , must have been my amazement when i heard the frenchman speak what he had just spoken , and when i could not help acknowledging that he had spoken the truth .
he continued : " we had been talking of horses , if i remember aright , just before leaving the rue c   .
this was the last subject we discussed .
as we crossed into this street , a <unk> , with a large basket upon his head , brushing quickly past us , thrust you upon a pile of <unk> stones collected at a spot where the causeway is undergoing repair .
you stepped upon one of the loose fragments , slipped , slightly strained your ankle , appeared vexed or sulky , muttered a few words , turned to look at the pile , and then proceeded in silence .
i was not particularly attentive to what you did ; but observation has become with me , of late , a species of necessity .
" you kept your eyes upon the ground  glancing , with a <unk> expression , at the holes and ruts in the pavement , ( so that i saw you were still thinking of the stones , ) until we reached the little alley called <unk> , which has been paved , by way of experiment , with the overlapping and riveted blocks .
here your countenance brightened up , and , perceiving your lips move , i could not doubt that you murmured the word <unk> , ' a term very <unk> applied to this species of pavement .
i knew that you could not say to yourself <unk> ' without being brought to think of <unk> , and thus of the theories of <unk> ; and since , when we discussed this subject not very long ago , i mentioned to you how singularly , yet with how little notice , the vague guesses of that <name> greek had met with confirmation in the late nebular <unk> , i felt that you could not avoid casting your eyes upward to the great <unk> in orion , and i certainly expected that you would do so .
you did look up ; and i was now assured that i had correctly followed your steps .
but in that bitter <unk> upon <unk> , which appeared in yesterday 's <unk> , ' the <unk> , making some disgraceful allusions to the cobbler s change of name upon assuming the <unk> , quoted a latin line about which we have often conversed .
i mean the line <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
" i had told you that this was in reference to orion , formerly written <unk> ; and , from certain <unk> connected with this explanation , i was aware that you could not have forgotten it .
it was clear , therefore , that you would not fail to combine the two ideas of orion and <unk> .
that you did combine them i saw by the character of the smile which passed over your lips .
you thought of the poor cobbler 's <unk> .
so far , you had been stooping in your gait ; but now i saw you draw yourself up to your full height .
i was then sure that you reflected upon the diminutive figure of <unk> .
at this point i interrupted your meditations to remark that as , in fact , he was a very little fellow  that <unk>  he would do better at the <unk> des <unk> . "
not long after this , we were looking over an evening edition of the " gazette des <unk> , " when the following paragraphs arrested our attention .
" extraordinary <unk>  this morning , about three o'clock , the inhabitants of the <unk> st. <unk> were aroused from sleep by a succession of terrific shrieks , issuing , apparently , from the fourth story of a house in the rue morgue , known to be in the sole <unk> of one madame l'espanaye , and her daughter mademoiselle <name> l'espanaye .
after some delay , occasioned by a fruitless attempt to procure admission in the usual manner , the gateway was broken in with a crowbar , and eight or ten of the neighbors entered accompanied by two <unk> .
by this time the cries had ceased ; but , as the party rushed up the first flight of stairs , two or more rough voices in angry contention were distinguished and seemed to proceed from the upper part of the house .
as the second landing was reached , these sounds , also , had ceased and everything remained perfectly quiet .
the party spread themselves and hurried from room to room .
upon arriving at a large back chamber in the fourth story , ( the door of which , being found locked , with the key inside , was forced open , ) a spectacle presented itself which struck every one present not less with horror than with astonishment .
" the apartment was in the wildest disorder  the furniture broken and thrown about in all directions .
there was only one bedstead ; and from this the bed had been removed , and thrown into the middle of the floor .
on a chair lay a razor , <unk> with blood .
on the hearth were two or three long and thick tresses of grey human hair , also <unk> in blood , and seeming to have been pulled out by the roots .
upon the floor were found four <unk> , an <unk> of <unk> , three large silver spoons , three smaller of <unk> <unk> , and two bags , containing nearly four thousand francs in gold .
the drawers of a bureau , which stood in one corner were open , and had been , apparently , rifled , although many articles still remained in them .
a small iron safe was discovered under the bed ( not under the bedstead ) .
it was open , with the key still in the door .
it had no contents beyond a few old letters , and other papers of little consequence .
" of madame l'espanaye no traces were here seen ; but an unusual quantity of soot being observed in the fire-place , a search was made in the chimney , and ( horrible to relate ! )
the corpse of the daughter , head downward , was dragged therefrom ; it having been thus forced up the narrow aperture for a considerable distance .
the body was quite warm .
upon examining it , many <unk> were perceived , no doubt occasioned by the violence with which it had been thrust up and disengaged .
upon the face were many severe scratches , and , upon the throat , dark bruises , and deep indentations of finger nails , as if the deceased had been <unk> to death .
" after a thorough investigation of every portion of the house , without farther discovery , the party made its way into a small paved yard in the rear of the building , where lay the corpse of the old <name> , with her throat so entirely cut that , upon an attempt to raise her , the head fell off .
the body , as well as the head , was fearfully mutilated  the former so much so as scarcely to retain any semblance of humanity .
" to this horrible mystery there is not as yet , we believe , the slightest clew . "
the next day 's paper had these additional particulars .
" the tragedy in the rue <unk> many individuals have been examined in relation to this most extraordinary and frightful affair .
[ the word <unk> ' has not yet , in <name> , that levity of import which it conveys with us , ] " but nothing whatever has transpired to throw light upon it .
we give below all the material testimony elicited .

" many other persons , neighbors , gave evidence to the same effect .
no one was spoken of as frequenting the house .

" isidore <unk> , <unk> , <unk> that he was called to the house about three o'clock in the morning , and found some twenty or thirty persons at the gateway , endeavoring to gain admittance .
forced it open , at length , with a bayonet  not with a crowbar .
had but little difficulty in getting it open , on account of its being a double or folding gate , and bolted neither at bottom not top .
the shrieks were continued until the gate was forced  and then suddenly ceased .
they seemed to be screams of some person ( or persons ) in great agony  were loud and drawn out , not short and quick .

upon reaching the first landing , heard two voices in loud and angry contention  the one a gruff voice , the other much <unk>  a very strange voice .

had opened an account with his banking house in the spring of the year  ( eight years previously ) .
made frequent deposits in small sums .
had checked for nothing until the third day before her death , when she took out in person the sum of <unk> francs .
this sum was paid in gold , and a clerk went home with the money .
" <unk> <name> bon , clerk to <unk> et <unk> , <unk> that on the day in question , about noon , he accompanied madame l'espanaye to her residence with the <unk> francs , put up in two bags .

might have been a woman 's voice .
does not understand <name> .
" four of the above-named witnesses , being recalled , deposed that the door of the chamber in which was found the body of mademoiselle l. was locked on the inside when the party reached it .
every thing was perfectly silent  no groans or noises of any kind .
upon forcing the door no person was seen .
the windows , both of the back and front room , were down and firmly fastened from within .
a door between the two rooms was closed , but not locked .
the door leading from the front room into the passage was locked , with the key on the inside .
a small room in the front of the house , on the fourth story , at the head of the passage was open , the door being ajar .
this room was crowded with old beds , boxes , and so forth .
these were carefully removed and searched .
there was not an inch of any portion of the house which was not carefully searched .
sweeps were sent up and down the chimneys .
the house was a four story one , with <unk> ( <unk> ) a trap-door on the roof was nailed down very securely  did not appear to have been opened for years .

" several witnesses , recalled , here testified that the chimneys of all the rooms on the fourth story were too narrow to admit the passage of a human being .
by <unk> ' were meant cylindrical sweeping brushes , such as are employed by those who clean chimneys .
these brushes were passed up and down every <unk> in the house .
there is no back passage by which any one could have descended while the party proceeded up stairs .
the body of mademoiselle l'espanaye was so firmly wedged in the chimney that it could not be got down until four or five of the party united their strength .
" <name> <unk> , physician , <unk> that he was called to view the bodies about <unk> .
they were both then lying on the sacking of the bedstead in the chamber where mademoiselle l. was found .
the corpse of the young <name> was much bruised and <unk> .
the fact that it had been thrust up the chimney would sufficiently account for these appearances .
the throat was greatly chafed .
there were several deep scratches just below the <name> , together with a series of livid spots which were evidently the impression of fingers .
the face was fearfully discolored , and the <unk> protruded .
the tongue had been partially bitten through .
a large bruise was discovered upon the pit of the stomach , produced , apparently , by the pressure of a knee .
in the opinion of m. <unk> , mademoiselle l'espanaye had been <unk> to death by some person or persons unknown .
the corpse of the mother was horribly mutilated .
all the bones of the right leg and arm were more or less shattered .
the left tibia much splintered , as well as all the ribs of the left side .
whole body dreadfully bruised and discolored .
it was not possible to say how the injuries had been inflicted .
a heavy club of wood , or a broad bar of iron  a chair  any large , heavy , and obtuse weapon would have produced such results , if wielded by the hands of a very powerful man .
no woman could have inflicted the blows with any weapon .
the head of the deceased , when seen by witness , was entirely separated from the body , and was also greatly shattered .
the throat had evidently been cut with some very sharp instrument  probably with a razor .
" <unk> <unk> , surgeon , was called with m. <unk> to view the bodies .
corroborated the testimony , and the opinions of m. <unk> .
" nothing farther of importance was elicited , although several other persons were examined .
a murder so mysterious , and so perplexing in all its particulars , was never before committed in <name>  if indeed a murder has been committed at all .
the police are entirely at fault  an unusual occurrence in affairs of this nature .
there is not , however , the shadow of a clew apparent . "
the evening edition of the paper stated that the greatest excitement still continued in the <unk> st. <unk>  that the premises in question had been carefully <unk> , and fresh examinations of witnesses instituted , but all to no purpose .
a postscript , however , mentioned that <unk> <name> bon had been arrested and imprisoned  although nothing appeared to <unk> him , beyond the facts already detailed .
dupin seemed singularly interested in the progress of this affair  at least so i judged from his manner , for he made no comments .
it was only after the announcement that <name> bon had been imprisoned , that he asked me my opinion respecting the murders .
i could merely agree with all <name> in considering them an insoluble mystery .
i saw no means by which it would be possible to trace the murderer .
" we must not judge of the means , " said dupin , " by this shell of an examination .
the parisian police , so much <unk> for <unk> , are cunning , but no more .
there is no method in their proceedings , beyond the method of the moment .
they make a vast parade of measures ; but , not unfrequently , these are so ill adapted to the objects proposed , as to put us in mind of monsieur <unk> 's calling for his <unk>  pour <unk> <unk> la <unk> the results attained by them are not unfrequently surprising , but , for the most part , are brought about by simple diligence and activity .
when these qualities are unavailing , their schemes fail .
<unk> , for example , was a good <unk> and a persevering man .
but , without educated thought , he erred continually by the very intensity of his investigations .
he impaired his vision by holding the object too close .
he might see , perhaps , one or two points with unusual clearness , but in so doing he , necessarily , lost sight of the matter as a whole .
thus there is such a thing as being too profound .
truth is not always in a well .
in fact , as regards the more important knowledge , i do believe that she is invariably superficial .
the depth lies in the valleys where we seek her , and not upon the <unk> where she is found .
the modes and sources of this kind of error are well <unk> in the contemplation of the heavenly bodies .
to look at a <name> by glances  to view it in a <unk> way , by turning toward it the exterior portions of the retina ( more susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the interior ) , is to behold the <name> distinctly  is to have the best appreciation of its lustre  a lustre which grows dim just in proportion as we turn our vision fully upon it .
a greater number of rays actually fall upon the eye in the latter case , but , in the former , there is the more refined capacity for comprehension .
by undue profundity we perplex and <unk> thought ; and it is possible to make even <name> herself vanish from the <unk> by a scrutiny too sustained , too concentrated , or too direct .
" as for these murders , let us enter into some examinations for ourselves , before we make up an opinion respecting them .
an inquiry <name> afford us amusement , " [ i thought this an odd term , so applied , but said nothing ] " and , besides , <name> bon once rendered me a service for which i am not ungrateful .
we <name> go and see the premises with our own eyes .
i know g   , the prefect of police , and shall have no difficulty in obtaining the necessary permission . "
the permission was obtained , and we proceeded at once to the rue morgue .
this is one of those miserable thoroughfares which intervene between the rue <unk> and the rue st. <unk> .
it was late in the afternoon when we reached it ; as this quarter is at a great distance from that in which we resided .
the house was readily found ; for there were still many persons gazing up at the closed shutters , with an <unk> curiosity , from the opposite side of the way .
it was an ordinary parisian house , with a gateway , on one side of which was a glazed <unk> , with a sliding panel in the window , indicating a <unk> de <unk> before going in we walked up the street , turned down an alley , and then , again turning , passed in the rear of the building  dupin , meanwhile examining the whole neighborhood , as well as the house , with a minuteness of attention for which i could see no possible object .
<unk> our steps , we came again to the front of the dwelling , rang , and , having shown our credentials , were admitted by the agents in charge .
we went up stairs  into the chamber where the body of mademoiselle l'espanaye had been found , and where both the deceased still lay .
the <unk> of the room had , as usual , been suffered to exist .
i saw nothing beyond what had been stated in the " gazette des <unk> . "
dupin scrutinized every thing  not excepting the bodies of the victims .
we then went into the other rooms , and into the yard ; a <unk> accompanying us throughout .
the examination occupied us until dark , when we took our departure .
on our way home my companion stepped in for a moment at the office of one of the daily papers .
i have said that the whims of my friend were manifold , and that je <name> <unk> :  for this phrase there is no english equivalent .
it was his humor , now , to decline all conversation on the subject of the murder , until about noon the next day .
he then asked me , suddenly , if i had observed any thing peculiar at the scene of the atrocity .
there was something in his manner of <unk> the word " peculiar , " which caused me to shudder , without knowing why .
" no , nothing peculiar , " i said ; " nothing more , at least , than we both saw stated in the paper . "
" the <unk> , ' " he replied , " has not entered , i fear , into the unusual horror of the thing .
but dismiss the idle opinions of this print .
it appears to me that this mystery is considered insoluble , for the very reason which should cause it to be regarded as easy of solution  i mean for the <unk> character of its features .
the police are confounded by the seeming absence of motive  not for the murder itself  but for the atrocity of the murder .
they are puzzled , too , by the seeming impossibility of <unk> the voices heard in contention , with the facts that no one was discovered up stairs but the assassinated mademoiselle l'espanaye , and that there were no means of egress without the notice of the party ascending .
the wild disorder of the room ; the corpse thrust , with the head downward , up the chimney ; the frightful mutilation of the body of the old <name> ; these considerations , with those just mentioned , and others which i need not mention , have sufficed to <unk> the powers , by putting completely at fault the boasted <unk> , of the government agents .
they have fallen into the gross but common error of <unk> the unusual with the abstruse .
but it is by these deviations from the plane of the ordinary , that reason feels its way , if at all , in its search for the true .
in investigations such as we are now pursuing , it should not be so much asked 'what has occurred , ' as 'what has occurred that has never occurred before . '
in fact , the facility with which i shall arrive , or have arrived , at the solution of this mystery , is in the direct ratio of its apparent <unk> in the eyes of the police . "
i stared at the speaker in mute astonishment .
" i am now awaiting , " continued he , looking toward the door of our apartment  " i am now awaiting a person who , although perhaps not the <unk> of these <unk> , must have been in some measure implicated in their <unk> .
of the worst portion of the crimes committed , it is probable that he is innocent .
i <name> that i am right in this supposition ; for upon it i build my expectation of reading the entire riddle .
i look for the man here  in this room  every moment .
it is true that he may not arrive ; but the probability is that he <name> .
should he come , it <name> be necessary to detain him .
here are pistols ; and we both know how to use them when occasion demands their use . "
i took the pistols , scarcely knowing what i did , or believing what i heard , while dupin went on , very much as if in a soliloquy .
i have already spoken of his abstract manner at such times .
his discourse was addressed to myself ; but his voice , although by no means loud , had that intonation which is commonly employed in speaking to some one at a great distance .
his eyes , vacant in expression , regarded only the wall .
" that the voices heard in contention , " he said , " by the party upon the stairs , were not the voices of the women themselves , was fully proved by the evidence .
this relieves us of all doubt upon the question whether the old <name> could have first destroyed the daughter and afterward have committed suicide .
i speak of this point chiefly for the sake of method ; for the strength of madame l'espanaye would have been utterly unequal to the task of thrusting her daughter 's corpse up the chimney as it was found ; and the nature of the wounds upon her own person entirely <unk> the idea of <unk> .
murder , then , has been committed by some third party ; and the voices of this third party were those heard in contention .
let me now <unk>  not to the whole testimony respecting these voices  but to what was peculiar in that testimony .
did you observe any thing peculiar about it ? "
i remarked that , while all the witnesses agreed in supposing the gruff voice to be that of a frenchman , there was much disagreement in regard to the shrill , or , as one individual termed it , the harsh voice .
" that was the evidence itself , " said dupin , " but it was not the peculiarity of the evidence .
you have observed nothing distinctive .
yet there was something to be observed .
the witnesses , as you remark , agreed about the gruff voice ; they were here unanimous .
but in regard to the shrill voice , the peculiarity is  not that they disagreed  but that , while an italian , an englishman , a spaniard , a <unk> , and a frenchman attempted to describe it , each one spoke of it as that of a foreigner .
each is sure that it was not the voice of one of his own countrymen .
each <unk> it  not to the voice of an individual of any nation with whose language he is conversant  but the converse .
the frenchman supposes it the voice of a spaniard , and 'might have distinguished some words had he been acquainted with the <unk> ' the dutchman maintains it to have been that of a frenchman ; but we find it stated that <unk> understanding french this witness was examined through an <unk> ' the englishman thinks it the voice of a <name> , and <unk> not understand <unk> ' the spaniard 'is sure ' that it was that of an englishman , but <unk> by the intonation ' altogether , <unk> he has no knowledge of the <unk> ' the italian believes it the voice of a russian , but <unk> never conversed with a native of <unk> ' a second frenchman differs , moreover , with the first , and is positive that the voice was that of an italian ; but , not being cognizant of that tongue , is , like the spaniard , <unk> by the intonation . '
now , how strangely unusual must that voice have really been , about which such testimony as this could have been elicited !  in whose tones , even , <unk> of the five great divisions of europe could recognise nothing familiar !
you <name> say that it might have been the voice of an asiatic  of an african .
neither <unk> nor <unk> abound in <name> ; but , without denying the inference , i <name> now merely call your attention to three points .
the voice is termed by one witness <unk> rather than shrill . '
it is represented by two others to have been <unk> and <unk> ' no words  no sounds resembling words  were by any witness mentioned as distinguishable .
" i know not , " continued dupin , " what impression i may have made , so far , upon your own understanding ; but i do not hesitate to say that legitimate deductions even from this portion of the testimony  the portion respecting the gruff and shrill voices  are in themselves sufficient to <unk> a suspicion which should give direction to all farther progress in the investigation of the mystery .
i said <unk> deductions ; ' but my meaning is not thus fully expressed .
i designed to imply that the deductions are the sole proper ones , and that the suspicion arises inevitably from them as the single result .
what the suspicion is , however , i <name> not say just yet .
i merely wish you to bear in mind that , with myself , it was sufficiently forcible to give a definite form  a certain tendency  to my inquiries in the chamber .
" let us now transport ourselves , in fancy , to this chamber .
what shall we first seek here ?
the means of egress employed by the murderers .
it is not too much to say that neither of us believe in <unk> events .
madame and mademoiselle l'espanaye were not destroyed by spirits .
the <unk> of the deed were material , and escaped materially .
then how ?
fortunately , there is but one mode of reasoning upon the point , and that mode must lead us to a definite <unk>  let us examine , each by each , the possible means of egress .
it is clear that the assassins were in the room where mademoiselle l'espanaye was found , or at least in the room adjoining , when the party ascended the stairs .
it is then only from these two apartments that we have to seek issues .
the police have laid bare the floors , the ceilings , and the masonry of the walls , in every direction .
no secret issues could have escaped their vigilance .
but , not trusting to their eyes , i examined with my own .
there were , then , no secret issues .
both doors leading from the rooms into the passage were securely locked , with the keys inside .
let us turn to the chimneys .
these , although of ordinary width for some eight or ten feet above the <unk> , <name> not admit , throughout their extent , the body of a large cat .
the impossibility of egress , by means already stated , being thus absolute , we are reduced to the windows .
through those of the front room no one could have escaped without notice from the crowd in the street .
the murderers must have passed , then , through those of the back room .
now , brought to this conclusion in so unequivocal a manner as we are , it is not our part , as <unk> , to reject it on account of apparent impossibilities .
it is only left for us to prove that these apparent <unk> ' are , in reality , not such .
" there are two windows in the chamber .
one of them is unobstructed by furniture , and is wholly visible .
the lower portion of the other is hidden from view by the head of the unwieldy bedstead which is thrust close up against it .
the former was found securely fastened from within .
it resisted the utmost force of those who endeavored to raise it .
a large <unk> had been pierced in its frame to the left , and a very stout nail was found fitted therein , nearly to the head .
upon examining the other window , a similar nail was seen similarly fitted in it ; and a vigorous attempt to raise this sash , failed also .
the police were now entirely satisfied that egress had not been in these directions .
and , therefore , it was thought a matter of <unk> to withdraw the nails and open the windows .
" my own examination was somewhat more particular , and was so for the reason i have just given  because here it was , i knew , that all apparent impossibilities must be proved to be not such in reality .
" i proceeded to think thus  à <unk> .
the murderers did escape from one of these windows .
this being so , they could not have <unk> the sashes from the inside , as they were found fastened ;  the consideration which put a stop , through its <unk> , to the scrutiny of the police in this quarter .
yet the sashes were fastened .
they must , then , have the power of fastening themselves .
there was no escape from this conclusion .
i stepped to the unobstructed casement , withdrew the nail with some difficulty and attempted to raise the sash .
it resisted all my efforts , as i had anticipated .
a concealed spring must , i now know , exist ; and this <unk> of my idea convinced me that my premises at least , were correct , however mysterious still appeared the circumstances attending the nails .
a careful search soon brought to light the hidden spring .
i pressed it , and , satisfied with the discovery , forbore to <unk> the sash .
" i now replaced the nail and regarded it attentively .
a person passing out through this window might have <unk> it , and the spring would have caught  but the nail could not have been replaced .
the conclusion was plain , and again narrowed in the field of my investigations .
the assassins must have escaped through the other window .
supposing , then , the springs upon each sash to be the same , as was probable , there must be found a difference between the nails , or at least between the modes of their fixture .
getting upon the sacking of the bedstead , i looked over the <unk> minutely at the second casement .
passing my hand down behind the board , i readily discovered and pressed the spring , which was , as i had supposed , identical in character with its neighbor .
i now looked at the nail .
it was as stout as the other , and apparently fitted in the same manner  driven in nearly up to the head .
" you <name> say that i was puzzled ; but , if you think so , you must have misunderstood the nature of the <unk> .
to use a sporting phrase , i had not been once 'at fault . '
the scent had never for an instant been lost .
there was no flaw in any link of the chain .
i had traced the secret to its ultimate result ,  and that result was the <unk> it had , i say , in every respect , the appearance of its fellow in the other window ; but this fact was an absolute <unk> ( conclusive us it might seem to be ) when compared with the consideration that here , at this point , terminated the clew .
'there must be something wrong , ' i said , <unk> the nail . '
i touched it ; and the head , with about a quarter of an inch of the <unk> , came off in my fingers .
the rest of the <unk> was in the <unk> where it had been broken off .
the fracture was an old one ( for its edges were <unk> with rust ) , and had apparently been accomplished by the blow of a hammer , which had partially imbedded , in the top of the bottom sash , the head portion of the nail .
i now carefully replaced this head portion in the indentation whence i had taken it , and the resemblance to a perfect nail was complete  the fissure was invisible .
pressing the spring , i gently raised the sash for a few inches ; the head went up with it , remaining firm in its bed .
i closed the window , and the semblance of the whole nail was again perfect .
" the riddle , so far , was now <unk> .
the assassin had escaped through the window which looked upon the bed .
dropping of its own accord upon his exit ( or perhaps purposely closed ) , it had become fastened by the spring ; and it was the retention of this spring which had been mistaken by the police for that of the nail ,  farther inquiry being thus considered unnecessary .
" the next question is that of the mode of descent .
upon this point i had been satisfied in my walk with you around the building .
about five feet and a half from the casement in question there runs a lightning-rod .
from this <name> it would have been impossible for any one to reach the window itself , to say nothing of entering it .
i observed , however , that the shutters of the fourth story were of the peculiar kind called by parisian carpenters <unk>  a kind rarely employed at the present day , but frequently seen upon very old mansions at lyons and <unk> .
they are in the form of an ordinary door , ( a single , not a folding door ) except that the lower half is latticed or worked in open trellis  thus affording an excellent hold for the hands .
in the present instance these shutters are fully three feet and a half broad .
when we saw them from the rear of the house , they were both about half open  that is to say , they stood off at right angles from the wall .
it is probable that the police , as well as myself , examined the back of the tenement ; but , if so , in looking at these <unk> in the line of their breadth ( as they must have done ) , they did not perceive this great breadth itself , or , at all events , failed to take it into due consideration .
in fact , having once satisfied themselves that no egress could have been made in this quarter , they would naturally bestow here a very cursory examination .
it was clear to me , however , that the shutter belonging to the window at the head of the bed , would , if swung fully back to the wall , reach to within two feet of the lightning-rod .
it was also evident that , by exertion of a very unusual degree of activity and courage , an entrance into the window , from the <name> , might have been thus <unk>  by reaching to the distance of two feet and a half ( we now suppose the shutter open to its whole extent ) a robber might have taken a firm grasp upon the <unk> .
letting go , then , his hold upon the <name> , placing his feet securely against the wall , and springing boldly from it , he might have swung the shutter so as to close it , and , if we imagine the window open at the time , might even have swung himself into the room .
" i wish you to bear especially in mind that i have spoken of a very unusual degree of activity as requisite to success in so hazardous and so difficult a feat .
it is my design to show you , first , that the thing might possibly have been accomplished :  but , secondly and chiefly , i wish to impress upon your understanding the very extraordinary  the almost <unk> character of that agility which could have accomplished it .
" you <name> say , no doubt , using the language of the law , that 'to make out my case , ' i should rather <unk> , than insist upon a full estimation of the activity required in this matter .
this may be the practice in law , but it is not the usage of reason .
my ultimate object is only the truth .
my immediate purpose is to lead you to place in <unk> , that very unusual activity of which i have just spoken with that very peculiar shrill ( or harsh ) and unequal voice , about whose nationality no two persons could be found to agree , and in whose utterance no <unk> could be detected . "
at these words a vague and <unk> <name> of the meaning of dupin flitted over my mind .
i seemed to be upon the verge of comprehension without power to comprehend  men , at times , find themselves upon the brink of remembrance without being able , in the end , to remember .
my friend went on with his discourse .
" you <name> see , " he said , " that i have shifted the question from the mode of egress to that of ingress .
it was my design to convey the idea that both were effected in the same manner , at the same point .
let us now revert to the interior of the room .
let us survey the appearances here .
the drawers of the bureau , it is said , had been rifled , although many articles of apparel still remained within them .
the conclusion here is absurd .
it is a mere guess  a very silly one  and no more .
how are we to know that the articles found in the drawers were not all these drawers had originally contained ?
madame l'espanaye and her daughter lived an exceedingly retired life  saw no company  seldom went out  had little use for numerous changes of <unk> .
those found were at least of as good quality as any likely to be possessed by these ladies .
if a thief had taken any , why did he not take the best  why did he not take all ?
in a word , why did he abandon four thousand francs in gold to <unk> himself with a bundle of linen ?
the gold was abandoned .
nearly the whole sum mentioned by monsieur <unk> , the banker , was discovered , in bags , upon the floor .
i wish you , therefore , to discard from your thoughts the blundering idea of motive , engendered in the brains of the police by that portion of the evidence which speaks of money delivered at the door of the house .
coincidences ten times as remarkable as this ( the delivery of the money , and murder committed within three days upon the party receiving it ) , happen to all of us every hour of our lives , without attracting even momentary notice .
coincidences , in general , are great <unk> in the way of that class of thinkers who have been educated to know nothing of the theory of probabilities  that theory to which the most glorious objects of human research are indebted for the most glorious of illustration .
in the present instance , had the gold been gone , the fact of its delivery three days before would have formed something more than a coincidence .
it would have been <unk> of this idea of motive .
but , under the real circumstances of the case , if we are to suppose gold the motive of this outrage , we must also imagine the <unk> so <unk> an idiot as to have abandoned his gold and his motive together .
" keeping now steadily in mind the points to which i have drawn your attention  that peculiar voice , that unusual agility , and that startling absence of motive in a murder so singularly atrocious as this  let us glance at the butchery itself .
here is a woman strangled to death by <name> strength , and thrust up a chimney , head downward .
ordinary assassins employ no such modes of murder as this .
least of all , do they thus dispose of the murdered .
in the manner of thrusting the corpse up the chimney , you <name> admit that there was something excessively <unk>  something altogether <unk> with our common notions of human action , even when we suppose the actors the most depraved of men .
think , too , how great must have been that strength which could have thrust the body up such an aperture so forcibly that the united vigor of several persons was found barely sufficient to drag it down !  " turn , now , to other indications of the employment of a vigor most marvellous .
on the hearth were thick tresses  very thick tresses  of grey human hair .
these had been torn out by the roots .
you are aware of the great force necessary in tearing thus from the head even twenty or thirty hairs together .
you saw the locks in question as well as myself .
their roots ( a hideous sight ! )
were clotted with fragments of the flesh of the scalp  sure token of the prodigious power which had been exerted in <unk> perhaps half a million of hairs at a time .
the throat of the old <name> was not merely cut , but the head absolutely severed from the body : the instrument was a mere razor .
i wish you also to look at the brutal ferocity of these deeds .
of the bruises upon the body of madame l'espanaye i do not speak .
monsieur <unk> , and his worthy <unk> monsieur <unk> , have pronounced that they were inflicted by some obtuse instrument ; and so far these gentlemen are very correct .
the obtuse instrument was clearly the stone pavement in the yard , upon which the victim had fallen from the window which looked in upon the bed .
this idea , however simple it may now seem , escaped the police for the same reason that the breadth of the shutters escaped them  because , by the affair of the nails , their perceptions had been <unk> sealed against the possibility of the windows having ever been opened at all .
" if now , in addition to all these things , you have properly reflected upon the odd disorder of the chamber , we have gone so far as to combine the ideas of an agility astounding , a strength superhuman , a ferocity brutal , a butchery without motive , a <unk> in horror absolutely alien from humanity , and a voice foreign in tone to the ears of men of many nations , and devoid of all distinct or intelligible <unk> .
what result , then , has ensued ?
what impression have i made upon your fancy ? "
i felt a creeping of the flesh as dupin asked me the question .
" a madman , " i said , " has done this deed  some raving maniac , escaped from a neighboring <unk> de <unk> " " in some respects , " he replied , " your idea is not irrelevant .
but the voices of madmen , even in their wildest paroxysms , are never found to tally with that peculiar voice heard upon the stairs .
madmen are of some nation , and their language , however incoherent in its words , has always the <unk> of <unk> .
besides , the hair of a madman is not such as i now hold in my hand .
i <unk> this little tuft from the rigidly clutched fingers of madame l'espanaye .
tell me what you can make of it . "
" dupin ! "
i said , completely unnerved ; " this hair is most unusual  this is no human hair . "
" i have not asserted that it is , " said he ; " but , before we decide this point , i wish you to glance at the little sketch i have here traced upon this paper .
it is a <unk> drawing of what has been described in one portion of the testimony as <unk> bruises , and deep indentations of finger nails , ' upon the throat of mademoiselle l'espanaye , and in another , ( by messrs. <unk> and <unk> , ) as a <unk> of livid spots , evidently the impression of fingers . '
" you <name> perceive , " continued my friend , spreading out the paper upon the table before us , " that this drawing gives the idea of a firm and fixed hold .
there is no slipping apparent .
each finger has retained  possibly until the death of the victim  the fearful grasp by which it originally imbedded itself .
attempt , now , to place all your fingers , at the same time , in the respective impressions as you see them . "
i made the attempt in vain .
" we are possibly not giving this matter a fair trial , " he said .
" the paper is spread out upon a plane surface ; but the human throat is cylindrical .
here is a billet of wood , the circumference of which is about that of the throat .
wrap the drawing around it , and try the experiment again . "
i did so ; but the difficulty was even more obvious than before .
" this , " i said , " is the <name> of no human hand . "
" read now , " replied dupin , " this passage from cuvier . "
it was a minute anatomical and generally descriptive account of the large fulvous ourang-outang of the east indian islands .
the gigantic stature , the prodigious strength and activity , the wild ferocity , and the imitative propensities of these mammalia are sufficiently well known to all .
i understood the full horrors of the murder at once .
" the description of the digits , " said i , as i made an end of reading , " is in exact accordance with this drawing .
i see that no animal but an ourang-outang , of the species here mentioned , could have impressed the indentations as you have traced them .
this tuft of <name> hair , too , is identical in character with that of the beast of cuvier .
but i can not possibly comprehend the particulars of this frightful mystery .
besides , there were two voices heard in contention , and one of them was unquestionably the voice of a frenchman . "
" true ; and you <name> remember an expression attributed almost unanimously , by the evidence , to this voice ,  the expression , <unk> dieu !  ' this , under the circumstances , has been justly characterized by one of the witnesses ( <unk> , the <unk> , ) as an expression of remonstrance or expostulation .
upon these two words , therefore , i have mainly built my hopes of a full solution of the riddle .
a frenchman was cognizant of the murder .
it is possible  indeed it is far more than probable  that he was innocent of all participation in the bloody transactions which took place .
the ourang-outang may have escaped from him .
he may have traced it to the chamber ; but , under the agitating circumstances which ensued , he could never have <unk> it .
it is still at large .
i <name> not pursue these guesses  for i have no right to call them more  since the shades of reflection upon which they are based are scarcely of sufficient depth to be appreciable by my own intellect , and since i could not pretend to make them intelligible to the understanding of another .
we <name> call them guesses then , and speak of them as such .
if the frenchman in question is indeed , as i suppose , innocent of this atrocity , this advertisement which i left last night , upon our return home , at the office of <unk> <unk> , ' ( a paper devoted to the shipping interest , and much sought by sailors , ) <name> bring him to our residence . "
he handed me a paper , and i read thus : caught  in the bois de boulogne , early in the morning of the  inst. ,  ( the morning of the murder , ) a very large , <name> ourang-outang of the <unk> species .
the owner , ( who is ascertained to be a sailor , belonging to a maltese vessel , ) may have the animal again , upon identifying it satisfactorily , and paying a few charges arising from its capture and keeping .
call at no .
  , rue   , <unk> st. germain  au <unk> " how was it possible , " i asked , " that you should know the man to be a sailor , and belonging to a maltese vessel ? "
" i do not know it , " said dupin .
" i am not sure of it .
here , however , is a small piece of ribbon , which from its form , and from its greasy appearance , has evidently been used in tying the hair in one of those long <unk> of which sailors are so fond .
moreover , this knot is one which few besides sailors can tie , and is peculiar to the maltese .
i picked the ribbon up at the foot of the lightning-rod .
it could not have belonged to either of the deceased .
now if , after all , i am wrong in my induction from this ribbon , that the frenchman was a sailor belonging to a maltese vessel , still i can have done no harm in saying what i did in the advertisement .
if i am in error , he <name> merely suppose that i have been misled by some circumstance into which he <name> not take the trouble to inquire .
but if i am right , a great point is gained .
cognizant although innocent of the murder , the frenchman <name> naturally hesitate about replying to the advertisement  about demanding the ourang-outang .
he <name> reason thus :  'i am innocent ; i am poor ; my ourang-outang is of great value  to one in my circumstances a fortune of itself  why should i lose it through idle apprehensions of danger ?
here it is , within my grasp .
it was found in the bois de boulogne  at a vast distance from the scene of that butchery .
how can it ever be suspected that a brute beast should have done the deed ?
the police are at fault  they have failed to procure the slightest clew .
should they even trace the animal , it would be impossible to prove me cognizant of the murder , or to <unk> me in guilt on account of that cognizance .
above all , i am <unk> the <unk> <unk> me as the possessor of the beast .
i am not sure to what limit his knowledge may extend .
should i avoid claiming a property of so great value , which it is known that i possess , i <name> render the animal at least , liable to suspicion .
it is not my policy to attract attention either to myself or to the beast .
i <name> answer the advertisement , get the ourang-outang , and keep it close until this matter has blown over . ' "
at this moment we heard a step upon the stairs .
" be ready , " said dupin , " with your pistols , but neither use them nor show them until at a signal from myself . "
the front door of the house had been left open , and the visiter had entered , without ringing , and advanced several steps upon the staircase .
now , however , he seemed to hesitate .
presently we heard him descending .
dupin was moving quickly to the door , when we again heard him coming up .
he did not turn back a second time , but stepped up with decision , and rapped at the door of our chamber .
" come in , " said dupin , in a cheerful and hearty tone .
a man entered .
he was a sailor , evidently ,  a tall , stout , and <unk> person , with a certain <unk> expression of countenance , not altogether <unk> .
his face , greatly <unk> , was more than half hidden by <unk> and <unk> he had with him a huge oaken <unk> , but appeared to be otherwise unarmed .
he bowed awkwardly , and bade us " good evening , " in french accents , which , although somewhat <unk> , were still sufficiently indicative of a parisian origin .
" sit down , my friend , " said dupin .
" i suppose you have called about the ourang-outang .
upon my word , i almost envy you the possession of him ; a remarkably fine , and no doubt a very valuable animal .
how old do you suppose him to be ? "
the sailor <name> a long breath , with the air of a man relieved of some intolerable burden , and then replied , in an assured tone : " i have no way of telling  but he ca n't be more than four or five years old .
have you got him here ? "
" oh no , we had no conveniences for keeping him here .
he is at a livery stable in the rue <unk> , just by .
you can get him in the morning .
of course you are prepared to identify the property ? "
" to be sure i am , sir . "
" i shall be sorry to part with him , " said dupin .
" i do n't mean that you should be at all this trouble for nothing , sir , " said the man .
" could n't expect it .
am very willing to pay a reward for the finding of the animal  that is to say , any thing in reason . "
" well , " replied my friend , " that is all very fair , to be sure .
let me think !  what should i have ?
oh !
i <name> tell you .
my reward shall be this .
you shall give me all the information in your power about these murders in the rue morgue . "
dupin said the last words in a very low tone , and very quietly .
just as quietly , too , he walked toward the door , locked it and put the key in his pocket .
he then <name> a pistol from his bosom and placed it , without the least flurry , upon the table .
the sailor 's face flushed up as if he were struggling with suffocation .
he started to his feet and grasped his <unk> , but the next moment he fell back into his seat , trembling violently , and with the countenance of death itself .
he spoke not a word .
i pitied him from the bottom of my heart .
" my friend , " said dupin , in a kind tone , " you are alarming yourself unnecessarily  you are indeed .
we mean you no harm whatever .
i pledge you the honor of a gentleman , and of a frenchman , that we intend you no injury .
i perfectly well know that you are innocent of the atrocities in the rue morgue .
it <name> not do , however , to deny that you are in some measure implicated in them .
from what i have already said , you must know that i have had means of information about this matter  means of which you could never have dreamed .
now the thing stands thus .
you have done nothing which you could have avoided  nothing , certainly , which renders you <unk> .
you were not even guilty of robbery , when you might have robbed with impunity .
you have nothing to conceal .
you have no reason for concealment .
on the other hand , you are bound by every principle of honor to confess all you know .
an innocent man is now imprisoned , charged with that crime of which you can point out the <unk> . "
the sailor had recovered his presence of mind , in a great measure , while dupin uttered these words ; but his original boldness of bearing was all gone .
" so help me god , " said he , after a brief pause , " i <name> tell you all i know about this affair ;  but i do not expect you to believe one half i say  i would be a fool indeed if i did .
still , i am innocent , and i <name> make a clean breast if i die for it . "
what he stated was , in substance , this .
he had lately made a voyage to the indian archipelago .
a party , of which he formed one , landed at borneo , and passed into the interior on an excursion of pleasure .
himself and a companion had captured the ourang-outang .
this companion dying , the animal fell into his own exclusive possession .
after great trouble , occasioned by the <unk> ferocity of his captive during the home voyage , he at length succeeded in lodging it safely at his own residence in <name> , where , not to attract toward himself the unpleasant curiosity of his neighbors , he kept it carefully secluded , until such time as it should recover from a wound in the foot , received from a splinter on board ship .
his ultimate design was to sell it .
returning home from some sailors ' frolic the night , or rather in the morning of the murder , he found the beast occupying his own <unk> , into which it had broken from a closet adjoining , where it had been , as was thought , securely confined .
razor in hand , and fully <unk> , it was sitting before a looking-glass , attempting the operation of shaving , in which it had no doubt previously watched its master through the key-hole of the closet .
terrified at the sight of so dangerous a weapon in the possession of an animal so ferocious , and so well able to use it , the man , for some moments , was at a loss what to do .
he had been accustomed , however , to quiet the creature , even in its <unk> moods , by the use of a whip , and to this he now resorted .
upon sight of it , the ourang-outang sprang at once through the door of the chamber , down the stairs , and thence , through a window , unfortunately open , into the street .
the frenchman followed in despair ; the ape , razor still in hand , occasionally stopping to look back and <unk> at its pursuer , until the latter had nearly come up with it .
it then again made off .
in this manner the <name> continued for a long time .
the streets were profoundly quiet , as it was nearly three o'clock in the morning .
in passing down an alley in the rear of the rue morgue , the fugitive 's attention was arrested by a light gleaming from the open window of madame <unk> chamber , in the fourth story of her house .
rushing to the building , it perceived the lightning <name> , clambered up with inconceivable agility , grasped the shutter , which was thrown fully back against the wall , and , by its means , swung itself directly upon the <unk> of the bed .
the whole feat did not occupy a minute .
the shutter was kicked open again by the ourang-outang as it entered the room .
the sailor , in the meantime , was both rejoiced and perplexed .
he had strong hopes of now <unk> the brute , as it could scarcely escape from the trap into which it had ventured , except by the <name> , where it might be intercepted as it came down .
on the other hand , there was much cause for anxiety as to what it might do in the house .
this latter reflection urged the man still to follow the fugitive .
a lightning <name> is ascended without difficulty , especially by a sailor ; but , when he had arrived as high as the window , which lay far to his left , his career was stopped ; the most that he could accomplish was to reach over so as to obtain a glimpse of the interior of the room .
at this glimpse he nearly fell from his hold through excess of horror .
now it was that those hideous shrieks arose upon the night , which had startled from slumber the inmates of the rue morgue .
madame l'espanaye and her daughter , <unk> in their night clothes , had apparently been occupied in arranging some papers in the iron chest already mentioned , which had been wheeled into the middle of the room .
it was open , and its contents lay beside it on the floor .
the victims must have been sitting with their backs toward the window ; and , from the time <unk> between the ingress of the beast and the screams , it seems probable that it was not immediately perceived .
the <unk> of the shutter would naturally have been attributed to the wind .
as the sailor looked in , the gigantic animal had seized madame l'espanaye by the hair , ( which was loose , as she had been <unk> it , ) and was flourishing the razor about her face , in imitation of the motions of a barber .
the daughter lay prostrate and motionless ; she had swooned .
the screams and struggles of the old <name> ( during which the hair was torn from her head ) had the effect of changing the probably pacific purposes of the ourang-outang into those of wrath .
with one determined sweep of its muscular arm it nearly severed her head from her body .
the sight of blood inflamed its anger into <unk> .
<unk> its teeth , and flashing fire from its eyes , it flew upon the body of the girl , and imbedded its fearful talons in her throat , retaining its grasp until she expired .
its wandering and wild glances fell at this moment upon the head of the bed , over which the face of its master , rigid with horror , was just discernible .
the fury of the beast , who no doubt bore still in mind the dreaded whip , was instantly converted into fear .
conscious of having deserved punishment , it seemed desirous of concealing its bloody deeds , and skipped about the chamber in an agony of nervous agitation ; throwing down and breaking the furniture as it moved , and dragging the bed from the bedstead .
in conclusion , it seized first the corpse of the daughter , and thrust it up the chimney , as it was found ; then that of the old <name> , which it immediately hurled through the window headlong .
as the ape approached the casement with its mutilated burden , the sailor shrank aghast to the <name> , and , rather gliding than clambering down it , hurried at once home  dreading the consequences of the butchery , and gladly abandoning , in his terror , all solicitude about the fate of the ourang-outang .
the words heard by the party upon the staircase were the frenchman 's exclamations of horror and affright , commingled with the fiendish <unk> of the brute .
i have scarcely anything to add .
the ourang-outang must have escaped from the chamber , by the <name> , just before the break of the door .
it must have closed the window as it passed through it .
it was subsequently caught by the owner himself , who obtained for it a very large sum at the <unk> des <unk> <name> <name> was instantly released , upon our narration of the circumstances ( with some comments from dupin ) at the bureau of the prefect of police .
this <unk> , however well disposed to my friend , could not altogether conceal his chagrin at the turn which affairs had taken , and was fain to indulge in a sarcasm or two , about the propriety of every person minding his own business .
" let him talk , " said dupin , who had not thought it necessary to reply .
" let him discourse ; it <name> ease his conscience , i am satisfied with having defeated him in his own castle .
nevertheless , that he failed in the solution of this mystery , is by no means that matter for wonder which he supposes it ; for , in truth , our friend the prefect is somewhat too cunning to be profound .
in his wisdom is no <unk> it is all head and no body , like the pictures of the goddess <name> ,  or , at best , all head and shoulders , like a codfish .
but he is a good creature after all .
i like him especially for one master stroke of cant , by which he has attained his reputation for ingenuity .
i mean the way he has <unk> <unk> ce qui est , et <unk> ce qui <unk> <unk> ' " ( * ) ( * ) <unk>  <unk> heloise .
the mystery of <name> <unk> .
( *1 ) a sequel to " the murders in the rue morgue . "
es <unk> eine <unk> <unk> <unk> , die der <unk> parallel <unk> .

<unk> und <unk> <unk> <unk> die <unk> <unk> , so dass sie <unk> <unk> , und <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sind .
so bei der reformation ; <unk> des <unk> <name> das <unk> <unk> .
there are ideal series of events which run parallel with the real ones .
they rarely coincide .
men and circumstances generally modify the ideal train of events , so that it seems imperfect , and its consequences are equally imperfect .
thus with the reformation ; instead of <unk> came <unk> .
 <unk> .
( <unk> ) moral <unk> .
there are few persons , even among the <unk> thinkers , who have not occasionally been startled into a vague yet thrilling <unk> in the supernatural , by coincidences of so seemingly marvellous a character that , as mere coincidences , the intellect has been unable to receive them .
such sentiments  for the <unk> of which i speak have never the full force of thought  such sentiments are seldom thoroughly stifled unless by reference to the doctrine of chance , or , as it is technically termed , the <unk> of probabilities .
now this <unk> is , in its essence , purely mathematical ; and thus we have the anomaly of the most rigidly exact in science applied to the shadow and <unk> of the most <unk> in speculation .
the extraordinary details which i am now called upon to make public , <name> be found to form , as regards sequence of time , the primary branch of a series of scarcely intelligible coincidences , whose secondary or concluding branch <name> be recognized by all readers in the late murder of <name> <name> rogers , at new york .
when , in an article entitled " the murders in the rue morgue , " i endeavored , about a year ago , to <unk> some very remarkable features in the mental character of my friend , the <unk> c. auguste dupin , it did not occur to me that i should ever resume the subject .
this <unk> of character constituted my design ; and this design was thoroughly fulfilled in the wild train of circumstances brought to instance dupin 's <unk> .
i might have adduced other examples , but i should have proven no more .
late events , however , in their surprising development , have startled me into some farther details , which <name> <name> with them the air of extorted confession .
hearing what i have lately heard , it would be indeed strange should i remain silent in regard to what i both heard and saw so long ago .
upon the winding up of the tragedy involved in the deaths of madame l'espanaye and her daughter , the <unk> dismissed the affair at once from his attention , and relapsed into his old habits of moody reverie .
prone , at all times , to abstraction , i readily fell in with his humor ; and , continuing to occupy our chambers in the <unk> saint germain , we gave the future to the winds , and slumbered tranquilly in the present , weaving the dull world around us into dreams .
but these dreams were not altogether uninterrupted .
it may readily be supposed that the part played by my friend , in the drama at the rue morgue , had not failed of its impression upon the fancies of the parisian police .
with its emissaries , the name of dupin had grown into a household word .
the simple character of those <unk> by which he had <unk> the mystery never having been explained even to the prefect , or to any other individual than myself , of course it is not surprising that the affair was regarded as little less than miraculous , or that the <unk> 's analytical abilities acquired for him the credit of intuition .
his frankness would have led him to <unk> every inquirer of such prejudice ; but his indolent humor forbade all farther agitation of a topic whose interest to himself had long ceased .
it thus happened that he found himself the <unk> of the political eyes ; and the cases were not few in which attempt was made to engage his services at the prefecture .
one of the most remarkable instances was that of the murder of a young girl named <name> rogêt .
this event occurred about two years after the atrocity in the rue morgue .
<name> , whose <name> and family name <name> at once arrest attention from their resemblance to those of the unfortunate " <unk> , " was the only daughter of the widow <name> rogêt .
the father had died during the child 's infancy , and from the period of his death , until within eighteen months before the assassination which forms the subject of our narrative , the mother and daughter had dwelt together in the rue <unk> saint <unk> ; ( <unk> ) madame there keeping a pension , assisted by <name> .
affairs went on thus until the latter had attained her twenty-second year , when her great beauty attracted the notice of a <unk> , who occupied one of the shops in the basement of the <unk> <name> , and whose custom lay chiefly among the desperate adventurers <unk> that neighborhood .
monsieur <name> blanc ( <unk> ) was not unaware of the advantages to be derived from the attendance of the fair <name> in his <unk> ; and his liberal proposals were accepted eagerly by the girl , although with somewhat more of hesitation by madame .
the anticipations of the shopkeeper were realized , and his rooms soon became notorious through the charms of the <unk> <unk> .
she had been in his employ about a year , when her admirers were thrown <unk> confusion by her sudden disappearance from the shop .
monsieur <name> blanc was unable to account for her absence , and madame rogêt was distracted with anxiety and terror .
the public papers immediately took up the theme , and the police were upon the point of making serious investigations , when , one fine morning , after the lapse of a week , <name> , in good health , but with a somewhat saddened air , made her <unk> at her usual counter in the <unk> .
all inquiry , except that of a private character , was of course immediately hushed .
monsieur <name> blanc professed total ignorance , as before .
<name> , with madame , replied to all questions , that the last week had been spent at the house of a relation in the country .
thus the affair died away , and was generally forgotten ; for the girl , ostensibly to relieve herself from the impertinence of curiosity , soon bade a final adieu to the <unk> , and sought the shelter of her mother 's residence in the rue <unk> saint <unk> .
it was about five months after this return home , that her friends were alarmed by her sudden disappearance for the second time .
three days elapsed , and nothing was heard of her .
on the fourth her corpse was found floating in the seine , * near the shore which is opposite the <unk> of the rue saint <name> , and at a point not very far distant from the secluded neighborhood of the barrière du roule .
( <unk> ) the atrocity of this murder , ( for it was at once evident that murder had been committed , ) the youth and beauty of the victim , and , above all , her previous notoriety , conspired to produce intense excitement in the minds of the sensitive <unk> .
i can call to mind no similar occurrence producing so general and so intense an effect .
for several weeks , in the discussion of this one absorbing theme , even the momentous political topics of the day were forgotten .
the prefect made unusual exertions ; and the powers of the whole parisian police were , of course , <unk> to the utmost extent .
upon the first discovery of the corpse , it was not supposed that the murderer would be able to elude , for more than a very brief period , the inquisition which was immediately set on foot .
it was not until the expiration of a week that it was deemed necessary to offer a reward ; and even then this reward was limited to a thousand francs .
in the mean time the investigation proceeded with vigor , if not always with judgment , and numerous individuals were examined to no purpose ; while , owing to the continual absence of all clue to the mystery , the popular excitement greatly increased .
at the end of the tenth day it was thought advisable to double the sum originally proposed ; and , at length , the second week having elapsed without leading to any discoveries , and the prejudice which always exists in <name> against the police having given vent to itself in several serious <unk> , the prefect took it upon himself to offer the sum of twenty thousand francs " for the conviction of the assassin , " or , if more than one should prove to have been implicated , " for the conviction of any one of the assassins . "
in the proclamation setting forth this reward , a full pardon was promised to any accomplice who should come forward in evidence against his fellow ; and to the whole was appended , wherever it appeared , the private placard of a committee of citizens , offering ten thousand francs , in addition to the amount proposed by the prefecture .
the entire reward thus stood at no less than thirty thousand francs , which <name> be regarded as an extraordinary sum when we consider the humble condition of the girl , and the great frequency , in large cities , of such atrocities as the one described .
no one doubted now that the mystery of this murder would be immediately brought to light .
but although , in one or two instances , arrests were made which promised <unk> , yet nothing was elicited which could <unk> the parties suspected ; and they were discharged forthwith .
strange as it may appear , the third week from the discovery of the body had passed , and passed without any light being thrown upon the subject , before even a rumor of the events which had so agitated the public mind , reached the ears of dupin and myself .
engaged in researches which absorbed our whole attention , it had been nearly a month since either of us had gone abroad , or received a visiter , or more than glanced at the leading political articles in one of the daily papers .
the first intelligence of the murder was brought us by g   , in person .
he called upon us early in the afternoon of the thirteenth of july , 18  , and remained with us until late in the night .
he had been piqued by the failure of all his endeavors to ferret out the assassins .
his reputation  so he said with a peculiarly parisian air  was at stake .
even his honor was concerned .
the eyes of the public were upon him ; and there was really no sacrifice which he would not be willing to make for the development of the mystery .
he concluded a somewhat droll speech with a compliment upon what he was pleased to term the tact of dupin , and made him a direct , and certainly a liberal proposition , the precise nature of which i do not feel myself at <name> to disclose , but which has no bearing upon the proper subject of my narrative .
the compliment my friend <unk> as best he could , but the proposition he accepted at once , although its advantages were altogether provisional .
this point being settled , the prefect broke forth at once into explanations of his own views , <unk> them with long comments upon the evidence ; of which latter we were not yet in possession .
he discoursed much , and beyond doubt , <unk> ; while i hazarded an occasional suggestion as the night wore drowsily away .
dupin , sitting steadily in his accustomed arm-chair , was the embodiment of respectful attention .
he wore spectacles , during the whole interview ; and an occasional signal glance beneath their green glasses , sufficed to convince me that he slept not the less soundly , because silently , throughout the seven or eight <unk> hours which immediately preceded the departure of the prefect .
in the morning , i procured , at the prefecture , a full report of all the evidence elicited , and , at the various newspaper offices , a copy of every paper in which , from first to last , had been published any decisive information in regard to this sad affair .
freed from all that was positively <unk> , this mass of information stood thus : <name> rogêt left the residence of her mother , in the rue <unk> st. <unk> , about nine o'clock in the morning of <name> <name> the twenty-second , 18  .
in going out , she gave notice to a monsieur <name> st. eustache , ( <unk> ) and to him only , of her intent intention to spend the day with an aunt who resided in the rue des <unk> .
the rue des <unk> is a short and narrow but populous thoroughfare , not far from the banks of the river , and at a distance of some two miles , in the most direct course possible , from the pension of madame rogêt .
st. eustache was the accepted suitor of <name> , and lodged , as well as took his meals , at the pension .
he was to have gone for his betrothed at dusk , and to have escorted her home .
in the afternoon , however , it came on to rain heavily ; and , supposing that she would remain all night at her aunt 's , ( as she had done under similar circumstances before , ) he did not think it necessary to keep his promise .
as night <name> on , madame rogêt ( who was an infirm old <name> , seventy years of age , ) was heard to express a fear " that she should never see <name> again ; " but this observation attracted little attention at the time .
on monday , it was ascertained that the girl had not been to the rue des <unk> ; and when the day elapsed without tidings of her , a tardy search was instituted at several points in the city , and its environs .
it was not , however until the fourth day from the period of disappearance that any thing satisfactory was ascertained respecting her .
on this day , ( wednesday , the <unk> of <name> , ) a monsieur beauvais , ( <unk> ) who , with a friend , had been making inquiries for <name> near the barrière du roule , on the shore of the seine which is opposite the rue <unk> st. <unk> , was informed that a corpse had just been towed ashore by some fishermen , who had found it floating in the river .
upon seeing the body , beauvais , after some hesitation , identified it as that of the <unk> .
his friend recognized it more promptly .
the face was suffused with dark blood , some of which issued from the mouth .
no foam was seen , as in the case of the merely drowned .
there was no <unk> in the cellular tissue .
about the throat were bruises and impressions of fingers .
the arms were bent over on the chest and were rigid .
the right hand was clenched ; the left partially open .
on the left wrist were two circular <unk> , apparently the effect of ropes , or of a rope in more than one <unk> .
a part of the right wrist , also , was much chafed , as well as the back throughout its extent , but more especially at the shoulder-blades .
in bringing the body to the shore the fishermen had attached to it a rope ; but none of the <unk> had been effected by this .
the flesh of the neck was much swollen .
there were no cuts apparent , or bruises which appeared the effect of blows .
a piece of lace was found tied so tightly around the neck as to be hidden from sight ; it was completely buried in the flesh , and was <unk> by a knot which lay just under the left ear .
this alone would have sufficed to produce death .
the medical testimony spoke confidently of the virtuous character of the deceased .
she had been subjected , it said , to brutal violence .
the corpse was in such condition when found , that there could have been no difficulty in its recognition by friends .
the dress was much torn and otherwise disordered .
in the outer garment , a slip , about a foot wide , had been torn upward from the bottom hem to the waist , but not torn off .
it was wound three times around the waist , and secured by a sort of hitch in the back .
the dress immediately beneath the frock was of fine muslin ; and from this a slip eighteen inches wide had been torn entirely out  torn very evenly and with great care .
it was found around her neck , fitting loosely , and secured with a hard knot .
over this muslin slip and the slip of lace , the strings of a bonnet were attached ; the bonnet being appended .
the knot by which the strings of the bonnet were fastened , was not a <name> 's , but a slip or sailor 's knot .
after the recognition of the corpse , it was not , as usual , taken to the morgue , ( this formality being superfluous , ) but hastily interred not far front the spot at which it was brought ashore .
through the exertions of beauvais , the matter was industriously hushed up , as far as possible ; and several days had elapsed before any public emotion resulted .
a weekly paper , ( <unk> ) however , at length took up the theme ; the corpse was <unk> , and a <unk> instituted ; but nothing was elicited beyond what has been already noted .
the clothes , however , were now submitted to the mother and friends of the deceased , and fully identified as those worn by the girl upon leaving home .
meantime , the excitement increased hourly .
several individuals were arrested and discharged .
st. eustache fell especially under suspicion ; and he failed , at first , to give an intelligible account of his whereabouts during the <name> on which <name> left home .
subsequently , however , he submitted to monsieur g   , <unk> , accounting satisfactorily for every hour of the day in question .
as time passed and no discovery ensued , a thousand contradictory rumors were circulated , and <unk> busied themselves in suggestions .
among these , the one which attracted the most notice , was the idea that <name> rogêt still lived  that the corpse found in the seine was that of some other unfortunate .
it <name> be proper that i submit to the reader some passages which embody the suggestion alluded to .
these passages are literal translations from l'etoile , ( <unk> ) a paper conducted , in general , with much ability .
" mademoiselle rogêt left her mother 's house on <name> morning , <name> the twenty-second , 18  , with the ostensible purpose of going to see her aunt , or some other connexion , in the rue des <unk> .
from that hour , nobody is proved to have seen her .
there is no trace or tidings of her at all ... .
there has no person , whatever , come forward , so far , who saw her at all , on that day , after she left her mother 's door ... . now , though we have no evidence that <name> rogêt was in the land of the living after nine o'clock on <name> , <name> the twenty-second , we have proof that , up to that hour , she was alive .
on wednesday noon , at twelve , a female body was discovered afloat on the shore of the barrière de roule .
this was , even if we presume that <name> rogêt was thrown into the river within three hours after she left her mother 's house , only three days from the time she left her home  three days to an hour .
but it is folly to suppose that the murder , if murder was committed on her body , could have been consummated soon enough to have enabled her murderers to throw the body into the river before midnight .
those who are guilty of such horrid crimes , choose darkness rather the light ... .
thus we see that if the body found in the river was that of <name> rogêt , it could only have been in the water two and a half days , or three at the outside .
all experience has shown that drowned bodies , or bodies thrown into the water immediately after death by violence , require from six to ten days for decomposition to take place to bring them to the top of the water .
even where a cannon is fired over a corpse , and it rises before at least five or six days ' immersion , it sinks again , if let alone .
now , we ask , what was there in this cave to cause a departure from the ordinary course of nature ? ...
if the body had been kept in its mangled state on shore until tuesday night , some trace would be found on shore of the murderers .
it is a doubtful point , also , whether the body would be so soon afloat , even were it thrown in after having been dead two days .
and , furthermore , it is exceedingly improbable that any villains who had committed such a murder as is here supposed , would have throw the body in without weight to sink it , when such a precaution could have so easily been taken . "
the editor here proceeds to argue that the body must have been in the water " not three days merely , but , at least , five times three days , " because it was so far decomposed that beauvais had great difficulty in recognizing it .
this latter point , however , was fully <unk> .
i continue the translation : " what , then , are the facts on which m. beauvais says that he has no doubt the body was that of <name> rogêt ?
he ripped up the gown sleeve , and says he found marks which satisfied him of the identity .
the public generally supposed those marks to have consisted of some description of scars .
he rubbed the arm and found hair upon it  something as indefinite , we think , as can readily be imagined  as little conclusive as finding an arm in the sleeve .
m. beauvais did not return that night , but sent word to madame rogêt , at seven o'clock , on wednesday evening , that an investigation was still in progress respecting her daughter .
if we allow that madame rogêt , from her age and grief , could not go over , ( which is allowing a great deal , ) there certainly must have been some one who would have thought it worth while to go over and attend the investigation , if they thought the body was that of <name> .
nobody went over .
there was nothing said or heard about the matter in the rue <unk> st. <unk> , that reached even the occupants of the same building .
m. st. eustache , the lover and intended husband of <name> , who boarded in her mother 's house , <unk> that he did not hear of the discovery of the body of his intended until the next morning , when m. beauvais came into his chamber and told him of it .
for an item of news like this , it strikes us it was very coolly received . "
in this way the journal endeavored to create the impression of an apathy on the part of the relatives of <name> , inconsistent with the supposition that these relatives believed the corpse to be hers .
its insinuations amount to this :  that <name> , with the <unk> of her friends , had <unk> herself from the city for reasons involving a charge against her <name> ; and that these friends , upon the discovery of a corpse in the seine , somewhat resembling that of the girl , had availed themselves of the opportunity to impress press the public with the belief of her death .
but l'etoile was again <unk> .
it was distinctly proved that no apathy , such as was imagined , existed ; that the old <name> was exceedingly feeble , and so agitated as to be unable to attend to any duty , that st. eustache , so far from receiving the news coolly , was distracted with grief , and bore himself so frantically , that m. beauvais prevailed upon a friend and relative to take charge of him , and prevent his attending the examination at the <unk> .
moreover , although it was stated by l'etoile , that the corpse was <unk> at the public expense  that an advantageous offer of private sculpture was absolutely declined by the family  and that no member of the family attended the ceremonial :  although , i say , all this was asserted by l'etoile in furtherance of the impression it designed to convey  yet all this was satisfactorily <unk> .
in a subsequent number of the paper , an attempt was made to throw suspicion upon beauvais himself .
the editor says : " now , then , a change comes over the matter .
we are told that on one occasion , while a madame b   was at madame rogêt 's house , m. beauvais , who was going out , told her that a <unk> was expected there , and she , madame b. , must not say anything to the <unk> until he returned , but let the matter be for him ... .
in the present posture of affairs , m. beauvais appears to have the whole matter looked up in his head .
a single step can not be taken without m. beauvais ; for , go which way you <name> , you run against him ... . for some reason , he determined that nobody shall have any thing to do with the proceedings but himself , and he has <unk> the male relatives out of the way , according to their representations , in a very singular manner .
he seems to have been very much averse to permitting the relatives to see the body . "
by the following fact , some color was given to the suspicion thus thrown upon beauvais .
a visiter at his office , a few days prior to the girl's disappearance , and during the absence of its occupant , had observed a rose in the key-hole of the door , and the name " <name> " inscribed upon a slate which <name> near at hand .
the general impression , so far as we were enabled to <unk> it from the newspapers , seemed to be , that <name> had been the victim of a gang of desperadoes  that by these she had been borne across the river , <unk> and murdered .
<name> <unk> , ( <unk> ) however , a print of extensive influence , was <name> in <unk> this popular idea .
i quote a passage or two from its columns : " we are persuaded that pursuit has hitherto been on a false scent , so far as it has been directed to the barrière du roule .
it is impossible that a person so well known to thousands as this young woman was , should have passed three blocks without some one having seen her ; and any one who saw her would have remembered it , for she interested all who knew her .
it was when the streets were full of people , when she went out ... .
it is impossible that she could have gone to the barrière du roule , or to the rue des <unk> , without being recognized by a dozen persons ; yet no one has come forward who saw her outside of her mother 's door , and there is no evidence , except the testimony concerning her expressed intentions , that she did go out at all .
her gown was torn , bound round her , and tied ; and by that the body was carried as a bundle .
if the murder had been committed at the barrière du roule , there would have been no necessity for any such arrangement .
the fact that the body was found floating near the barrière , is no proof as to where it was thrown into the water ... .. a piece of one of the unfortunate girl 's petticoats , two feet long and one foot wide , was torn out and tied under her <name> around the back of her head , probably to prevent screams .
this was done by fellows who had no pocket-handkerchief . "
a day or two before the prefect called upon us , however , some important information reached the police , which seemed to overthrow , at least , the chief portion of <name> <unk> 's argument .
two small boys , sons of a madame deluc , while roaming among the woods near the barrière du roule , chanced to penetrate a close thicket , within which were three or four large stones , forming a kind of seat , with a back and footstool .
on the upper stone lay a white petticoat ; on the second a silk scarf .
a parasol , gloves , and a pocket-handkerchief were also here found .
the handkerchief bore the name " <name> rogêt . "
fragments of dress were discovered on the brambles around .
the earth was trampled , the bushes were broken , and there was every evidence of a struggle .
between the thicket and the river , the fences were found taken down , and the ground bore evidence of some heavy burthen having been dragged along it .
a weekly paper , <name> <unk> , ( <unk> ) had the following comments upon this discovery  comments which merely echoed the sentiment of the whole parisian press : " the things had all evidently been there at least three or four weeks ; they were all mildewed down hard with the action of the rain and stuck together from mildew .
the grass had grown around and over some of them .
the silk on the parasol was strong , but the threads of it were run together within .
the upper part , where it had been doubled and folded , was all mildewed and rotten , and tore on its being opened ... ..
the pieces of her frock torn out by the bushes were about three inches wide and six inches long .
one part was the hem of the frock , and it had been mended ; the other piece was part of the skirt , not the hem .
they looked like strips torn off , and were on the thorn bush , about a foot from the ground ... ..
there can be no doubt , therefore , that the spot of this appalling outrage has been discovered . "
consequent upon this discovery , new evidence appeared .
madame deluc testified that she keeps a roadside inn not far from the bank of the river , opposite the barrière du roule .
the neighborhood is secluded  particularly so .
it is the usual <name> resort of blackguards from the city , who cross the river in boats .
about three o'clock , in the afternoon of the <name> in question , a young girl arrived at the inn , accompanied by a young man of dark complexion .
the two remained here for some time .
on their departure , they took the road to some thick woods in the vicinity .
madame deluc 's attention was called to the dress worn by the girl , on account of its resemblance to one worn by a deceased relative .
a scarf was particularly noticed .
soon after the departure of the couple , a gang of <unk> made their appearance , behaved <unk> , ate and drank without making payment , followed in the route of the young man and girl , returned to the inn about dusk , and <unk> the river as if in great haste .
it was soon after dark , upon this same evening , that madame deluc , as well as her eldest son , heard the screams of a female in the vicinity of the inn .
the screams were violent but brief .
madame d. recognized not only the scarf which was found in the thicket , but the dress which was discovered upon the corpse .
an omnibus driver , <unk> , ( <unk> ) now also testified that he saw <name> rogêt cross a ferry on the seine , on the <name> in question , in company with a young man of dark complexion .
he , <unk> , knew <name> , and could not be mistaken in her identity .
the articles found in the thicket were fully identified by the relatives of <name> .
the items of evidence and information thus collected by myself , from the newspapers , at the suggestion of dupin , embraced only one more point  but this was a point of seemingly vast consequence .
it appears that , immediately after the discovery of the clothes as above described , the lifeless , or nearly lifeless body of st. eustache , <unk> betrothed , was found in the vicinity of what all now supposed the scene of the outrage .
a phial labelled " <unk> , " and emptied , was found near him .
his breath gave evidence of the poison .
he died without speaking .
upon his person was found a letter , briefly stating his love for <name> , with his design of <unk> .
" i need scarcely tell you , " said dupin , as he finished the perusal of my notes , " that this is a far more intricate case than that of the rue morgue ; from which it differs in one important respect .
this is an ordinary , although an atrocious instance of crime .
there is nothing peculiarly <unk> about it .
you <name> observe that , for this reason , the mystery has been considered easy , when , for this reason , it should have been considered difficult , of solution .
thus ; at first , it was thought unnecessary to offer a reward .
the <unk> of g   were able at once to comprehend how and why such an atrocity might have been committed .
they could picture to their imaginations a mode  many modes  and a motive  many motives ; and because it was not impossible that either of these numerous modes and motives could have been the actual one , they have taken it for granted that one of them must .
but the case with which these variable fancies were entertained , and the very plausibility which each assumed , should have been understood as indicative rather of the difficulties than of the facilities which must attend <unk> .
i have before observed that it is by prominences above the plane of the ordinary , that reason feels her way , if at all , in her search for the true , and that the proper question in cases such as this , is not so much 'what has occurred ? '
as 'what has occurred that has never occurred before ? '
in the investigations at the house of madame l'espanaye , ( <unk> ) the agents of g   were discouraged and confounded by that very <unk> which , to a properly regulated intellect , would have afforded the surest omen of success ; while this same intellect might have been plunged in despair at the ordinary character of all that met the eye in the case of the <unk> , and yet told of nothing but easy triumph to the <unk> of the prefecture .
" in the case of madame l'espanaye and her daughter there was , even at the beginning of our investigation , no doubt that murder had been committed .
the idea of suicide was excluded at once .
here , too , we are freed , at the commencement , from all supposition of <unk> .
the body found at the barrière du roule , was found under such circumstances as to leave us no room for embarrassment upon this important point .
but it has been suggested that the corpse discovered , is not that of the <name> rogêt for the conviction of whose assassin , or assassins , the reward is offered , and respecting whom , solely , our agreement has been arranged with the prefect .
we both know this gentleman well .
it <name> not do to trust him too far .
if , <unk> our inquiries from the body found , and thence tracing a murderer , we yet discover this body to be that of some other individual than <name> ; or , if starting from the living <name> , we find her , yet find her <unk>  in either case we lose our labor ; since it is monsieur g   with whom we have to deal .
for our own purpose , therefore , if not for the purpose of justice , it is indispensable that our first step should be the determination of the identity of the corpse with the <name> rogêt who is missing .
" with the public the arguments of l'etoile have had weight ; and that the journal itself is convinced of their importance would appear from the manner in which it commences one of its essays upon the subject  <unk> of the morning papers of the day , ' it says , 'speak of the conclusive article in monday 's <unk> . '
to me , this article appears conclusive of little beyond the zeal of its <unk> .
we should bear in mind that , in general , it is the object of our newspapers rather to create a sensation  to make a point  than to further the cause of truth .
the latter end is only pursued when it seems coincident with the former .
the print which merely falls in with ordinary opinion ( however well founded this opinion may be ) earns for itself no credit with the mob .
the mass of the people regard as profound only him who suggests pungent contradictions of the general idea .
in <unk> , not less than in literature , it is the <unk> which is the most immediately and the most universally appreciated .
in both , it is of the lowest order of merit .
" what i mean to say is , that it is the mingled <unk> and <unk> of the idea , that <name> rogêt still lives , rather than any true plausibility in this idea , which have suggested it to l'etoile , and secured it a favorable reception with the public .
let us examine the heads of this journal 's argument ; endeavoring to avoid the <unk> with which it is originally set forth .
" the first aim of the writer is to show , from the brevity of the interval between <name> 's disappearance and the finding of the floating corpse , that this corpse can not be that of <name> .
the reduction of this interval to its smallest possible <unk> , becomes thus , at once , an object with the <unk> .
in the rash pursuit of this object , he rushes into mere assumption at the outset .
'it is folly to suppose , ' he says , 'that the murder , if murder was committed on her body , could have been consummated soon enough to have enabled her murderers to throw the body into the river before midnight . '
we demand at once , and very naturally , why ?
why is it folly to suppose that the murder was committed within five minutes after the girl 's quitting her mother 's house ?
why is it folly to suppose that the murder was committed at any given period of the day ?
there have been <unk> at all hours .
but , had the murder taken place at any moment between nine o'clock in the morning of <name> , and a quarter before midnight , there would still have been time enough 'to throw the body into the river before midnight . '
this assumption , then , amounts precisely to this  that the murder was not committed on <name> at all  and , if we allow l'etoile to assume this , we may permit it any liberties whatever .
the paragraph beginning 'it is folly to suppose that the murder , etc. , ' however it appears as printed in l'etoile , may be imagined to have existed actually thus in the <name> of its <unk>  'it is folly to suppose that the murder , if murder was committed on the body , could have been committed soon enough to have enabled her murderers to throw the body into the river before midnight ; it is folly , we say , to suppose all this , and to suppose at the same time , ( as we are resolved to suppose , ) that the body was not thrown in until after midnight '  a sentence sufficiently inconsequential in itself , but not so utterly preposterous as the one printed .
" were it my purpose , " continued dupin , " merely to make out a case against this passage of l'etoile 's argument , i might safely leave it where it is .
it is not , however , with l'etoile that we have to do , but with the truth .
the sentence in question has but one meaning , as it stands ; and this meaning i have fairly stated : but it is material that we go behind the mere words , for an idea which these words have obviously intended , and failed to convey .
it was the design of the journalist to say that , at whatever period of the day or night of <name> this murder was committed , it was improbable that the assassins would have ventured to bear the corpse to the river before midnight .
and herein lies , really , the assumption of which i complain .
it is assumed that the murder was committed at such a position , and under such circumstances , that the bearing it to the river became necessary .
now , the assassination might have taken place upon the river 's brink , or on the river itself ; and , thus , the throwing the corpse in the water might have been resorted to , at any period of the day or night , as the most obvious and most immediate mode of disposal .
you <name> understand that i suggest nothing here as probable , or as <unk> with my own opinion .
my design , so far , has no reference to the facts of the case .
i wish merely to caution you against the whole tone of l'etoile 's suggestion , by calling your attention to its ex parte character at the outset .
" having prescribed thus a limit to suit its own preconceived notions ; having assumed that , if this were the body of <name> , it could have been in the water but a very brief time ; the journal goes on to say : 'all experience has shown that drowned bodies , or bodies thrown into the water immediately after death by violence , require from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the top of the water .
even when a cannon is fired over a corpse , and it rises before at least five or six days ' immersion , it sinks again if let alone . '
" these assertions have been tacitly received by every paper in <name> , with the exception of <name> <unk> .
( <unk> ) this latter print endeavors to combat that portion of the paragraph which has reference to <unk> bodies ' only , by <unk> some five or six instances in which the bodies of individuals known to be drowned were found floating after the lapse of less time than is insisted upon by l'etoile .
but there is something excessively <unk> in the attempt on the part of <name> <unk> , to <unk> the general assertion of l'etoile , by a <unk> of particular instances <unk> against that assertion .
had it been possible to <unk> fifty instead of five examples of bodies found floating at the end of two or three days , these fifty examples could still have been properly regarded only as exceptions to l'etoile 's rule , until such time as the rule itself should be <unk> .
admitting the rule , ( and this <name> <unk> does not deny , insisting merely upon its exceptions , ) the argument of l'etoile is suffered to remain in full force ; for this argument does not pretend to involve more than a question of the probability of the body having risen to the surface in less than three days ; and this probability <name> be in favor of l'etoile 's position until the instances so <unk> adduced shall be sufficient in number to establish an <unk> rule .
" you <name> see at once that all argument upon this head should be urged , if at all , against the rule itself ; and for this end we must examine the <unk> of the rule .
now the human body , in general , is neither much lighter nor much heavier than the water of the seine ; that is to say , the specific gravity of the human body , in its natural condition , is about equal to the bulk of fresh water which it <unk> .
the bodies of fat and fleshy persons , with small bones , and of women generally , are lighter than those of the <name> and <unk> , and of men ; and the specific gravity of the water of a river is somewhat influenced by the presence of the tide from sea .
but , leaving this tide out of question , it may be said that very few human bodies <name> sink at all , even in fresh water , of their own accord .
almost any one , falling into a river , <name> be enabled to float , if he suffer the specific gravity of the water fairly to be adduced in comparison with his own  that is to say , if he suffer his whole person to be immersed , with as little exception as possible .
the proper position for one who can not swim , is the upright position of the <name> on land , with the head thrown fully back , and immersed ; the mouth and nostrils alone remaining above the surface .
thus circumstanced , we shall find that we float without difficulty and without exertion .
it is evident , however , that the <unk> of the body , and of the bulk of water displaced , are very nicely balanced , and that a trifle <name> cause either to preponderate .
an arm , for instance , uplifted from the water , and thus deprived of its support , is an additional weight sufficient to <unk> the whole head , while the accidental aid of the smallest piece of timber <name> enable us to elevate the head so as to look about .
now , in the struggles of one unused to swimming , the arms are invariably thrown upwards , while an attempt is made to keep the head in its usual perpendicular position .
the result is the immersion of the mouth and nostrils , and the <unk> , during efforts to breathe while beneath the surface , of water into the lungs .
much is also received into the stomach , and the whole body becomes heavier by the difference between the weight of the air originally <unk> these cavities , and that of the fluid which now fills them .
this difference is sufficient to cause the body to sink , as a general rule ; but is insufficient in the cases of individuals with small bones and an abnormal quantity of flaccid or fatty matter .
such individuals float even after drowning .
" the corpse , being supposed at the bottom of the river , <name> there remain until , by some means , its specific gravity again becomes less than that of the bulk of water which it <unk> .
this effect is brought about by decomposition , or otherwise .
the result of decomposition is the generation of gas , <unk> the cellular tissues and all the cavities , and giving the puffed appearance which is so horrible .
when this distension has so far progressed that the bulk of the corpse is materially increased without a corresponding increase of mass or weight , its specific gravity becomes less than that of the water displaced , and it forthwith makes its appearance at the surface .
but decomposition is modified by innumerable circumstances  is hastened or retarded by innumerable agencies ; for example , by the heat or cold of the season , by the mineral impregnation or purity of the water , by its depth or <unk> , by its currency or <unk> , by the temperament of the body , by its infection or freedom from disease before death .
thus it is evident that we can assign no period , with any thing like accuracy , at which the corpse shall rise through decomposition .
under certain conditions this result would be brought about within an hour ; under others , it might not take place at all .
there are chemical <unk> by which the animal frame can be preserved forever from corruption ; the <unk> of mercury is one .
but , apart from decomposition , there may be , and very usually is , a generation of gas within the stomach , from the <unk> <unk> of vegetable matter ( or within other cavities from other causes ) sufficient to induce a distension which <name> bring the body to the surface .
the effect produced by the firing of a cannon is that of simple vibration .
this may either loosen the corpse from the soft mud or ooze in which it is imbedded , thus permitting it to rise when other agencies have already prepared it for so doing ; or it may overcome the tenacity of some <unk> portions of the cellular tissue ; allowing the cavities to <unk> under the influence of the gas .
" having thus before us the whole philosophy of this subject , we can easily test by it the assertions of l'etoile .
'all experience shows , ' says this paper , 'that drowned bodies , or bodies thrown into the water immediately after death by violence , require from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the top of the water .
even when a cannon is fired over a corpse , and it rises before at least five or six days ' immersion , it sinks again if let alone . '
" the whole of this paragraph must now appear a tissue of <unk> and <unk> .
all experience does not show that <unk> <unk> require from six to ten days for sufficient decomposition to take place to bring them to the surface .
both science and experience show that the period of their rising is , and necessarily must be , indeterminate .
if , moreover , a body has risen to the surface through firing of cannon , it <name> not <unk> again if let alone , ' until decomposition has so far progressed as to permit the escape of the generated gas .
but i wish to call your attention to the distinction which is made between <unk> bodies , ' and <unk> thrown into the water immediately after death by violence . '
although the writer admits the distinction , he yet includes them all in the same category .
i have shown how it is that the body of a drowning man becomes specifically heavier than its bulk of water , and that he would not sink at all , except for the struggles by which he <unk> his arms above the surface , and his gasps for breath while beneath the surface  gasps which supply by water the place of the original air in the lungs .
but these struggles and these gasps would not occur in the body <unk> into the water immediately after death by violence . '
thus , in the latter instance , the body , as a general rule , would not sink at all  a fact of which l'etoile is evidently ignorant .
when decomposition had proceeded to a very great extent  when the flesh had in a great measure left the bones  then , indeed , but not till then , should we lose sight of the corpse .
" and now what are we to make of the argument , that the body found could not be that of <name> rogêt , because , three days only having elapsed , this body was found floating ?
if drowned , being a woman , she might never have sunk ; or having sunk , might have reappeared in twenty-four hours , or less .
but no one supposes her to have been drowned ; and , dying before being thrown into the river , she might have been found floating at any period afterwards whatever .
" 'but , ' says l'etoile , 'if the body had been kept in its mangled state on shore until tuesday night , some trace would be found on shore of the murderers . '
here it is at first difficult to perceive the intention of the <unk> .
he means to anticipate what he imagines would be an objection to his theory  viz : that the body was kept on shore two days , suffering rapid decomposition  more rapid than if immersed in water .
he supposes that , had this been the case , it might have appeared at the surface on the wednesday , and thinks that only under such circumstances it could so have appeared .
he is accordingly in haste to show that it was not kept on shore ; for , if so , 'some trace would be found on shore of the murderers . '
i presume you smile at the <unk> .
you can not be made to see how the mere duration of the corpse on the shore could operate to multiply traces of the assassins .
nor can i .
" 'and furthermore it is exceedingly improbable , ' continues our journal , 'that any villains who had committed such a murder as is here supposed , would have thrown the body in without weight to sink it , when such a precaution could have so easily been taken . '
observe , here , the laughable confusion of thought !
no one  not even l'etoile  disputes the murder committed on the body found .
the marks of violence are too obvious .
it is our <unk> 's object merely to show that this body is not <name> 's .
he wishes to prove that <name> is not assassinated  not that the corpse was not .
yet his observation proves only the latter point .
here is a corpse without weight attached .
murderers , casting it in , would not have failed to attach a weight .
therefore it was not thrown in by murderers .
this is all which is proved , if any thing is .
the question of identity is not even approached , and l'etoile has been at great pains merely to <unk> now what it has admitted only a moment before .
'we are perfectly convinced , ' it says , 'that the body found was that of a murdered female . '
" nor is this the sole instance , even in this division of his subject , where our <unk> unwittingly reasons against himself .
his evident object , i have already said , is to reduce , us much as possible , the interval between <name> 's disappearance and the finding of the corpse .
yet we find him urging the point that no person saw the girl from the moment of her leaving her mother 's house .
'we have no evidence , ' he says , 'that <name> rogêt was in the land of the living after nine o'clock on <name> , <name> the twenty-second . '
as his argument is obviously an ex parte one , he should , at least , have left this matter out of sight ; for had any one been known to see <name> , say on monday , or on tuesday , the interval in question would have been much reduced , and , by his own <unk> , the probability much diminished of the corpse being that of the <unk> .
it is , nevertheless , amusing to observe that l'etoile insists upon its point in the full belief of its <unk> its general argument .
" <unk> now that portion of this argument which has reference to the identification of the corpse by beauvais .
in regard to the hair upon the arm , l'etoile has been obviously <unk> .
m. beauvais , not being an idiot , could never have urged , in identification of the corpse , simply hair upon its arm .
no arm is without hair .
the generality of the expression of l'etoile is a mere perversion of the witness ' phraseology .
he must have spoken of some peculiarity in this hair .
it must have been a peculiarity of color , of quantity , of length , or of situation .
" 'her foot , ' says the journal , 'was small  so are thousands of feet .
her garter is no proof whatever  nor is her shoe  for shoes and <unk> are sold in packages .
the same may be said of the flowers in her hat .
one thing upon which m. beauvais strongly insists is , that the clasp on the garter found , had been set back to take it in .
this amounts to nothing ; for most women find it proper to take a pair of <unk> home and fit them to the size of the limbs they are to <unk> , rather than to try them in the store where they purchase . '
here it is difficult to suppose the <unk> in <name> .
had m. beauvais , in his search for the body of <name> , discovered a corpse corresponding in general size and appearance to the missing girl , he would have been warranted ( without reference to the question of <unk> at all ) in forming an opinion that his search had been successful .
if , in addition to the point of general size and contour , he had found upon the arm a peculiar hairy appearance which he had observed upon the living <name> , his opinion might have been justly strengthened ; and the increase of <unk> might well have been in the ratio of the peculiarity , or <unk> , of the hairy <name> .
if , the feet of <name> being small , those of the corpse were also small , the increase of probability that the body was that of <name> would not be an increase in a ratio merely arithmetical , but in one highly geometrical , or accumulative .
add to all this shoes such as she had been known to wear upon the day of her disappearance , and , although these shoes may be <unk> in packages , ' you so far <unk> the probability as to verge upon the certain .
what , of itself , would be no evidence of identity , becomes through its <unk> position , proof most sure .
give us , then , flowers in the hat corresponding to those worn by the missing girl , and we seek for nothing farther .
if only one flower , we seek for nothing farther  what then if two or three , or more ?
each successive one is multiple evidence  proof not added to proof , but multiplied by hundreds or thousands .
let us now discover , upon the deceased , <unk> such as the living used , and it is almost folly to proceed .
but these <unk> are found to be tightened , by the setting back of a clasp , in just such a manner as her own had been tightened by <name> , shortly previous to her leaving home .
it is now madness or hypocrisy to doubt .
what l'etoile says in respect to this <unk> of the garter 's being an usual occurrence , shows nothing beyond its own pertinacity in error .
the elastic nature of the <unk> is <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
what is made to adjust itself , must of necessity require foreign adjustment but rarely .
it must have been by an accident , in its strictest sense , that these <unk> of <name> needed the tightening described .
they alone would have amply established her identity .
but it is not that the corpse was found to have the <unk> of the missing girl , or found to have her shoes , or her bonnet , or the flowers of her bonnet , or her feet , or a peculiar <name> upon the arm , or her general size and appearance  it is that the corpse had each , and all collectively .
could it be proved that the editor of l'etoile really entertained a doubt , under the circumstances , there would be no need , in his case , of a commission de <unk> <unk> .
he has thought it sagacious to <name> the small talk of the lawyers , who , for the most part , content themselves with echoing the rectangular precepts of the courts .
i would here observe that very much of what is rejected as evidence by a court , is the best of evidence to the intellect .
for the court , guiding itself by the general principles of evidence  the recognized and booked principles  is averse from <unk> at particular instances .
and this steadfast <unk> to principle , with rigorous disregard of the conflicting exception , is a sure mode of attaining the maximum of attainable truth , in any long sequence of time .
the practice , in mass , is therefore philosophical ; but it is not the less certain that it <unk> vast individual error .
( <unk> ) " in respect to the insinuations levelled at beauvais , you <name> be willing to dismiss them in a breath .
you have already <unk> the true character of this good gentleman .
he is a <unk> , with much of romance and little of wit .
any one so constituted <name> readily so conduct himself , upon occasion of real excitement , as to render himself liable to suspicion on the part of the over acute , or the <unk> .
m. beauvais ( as it appears from your notes ) had some personal interviews with the editor of l'etoile , and offended him by venturing an opinion that the corpse , notwithstanding the theory of the editor , was , in sober fact , that of <name> .
'he <unk> , ' says the paper , 'in asserting the corpse to be that of <name> , but can not give a circumstance , in addition to those which we have commented upon , to make others believe . '
now , without <unk> to the fact that stronger evidence 'to make others believe , ' could never have been adduced , it may be remarked that a man may very well be understood to believe , in a case of this kind , without the ability to advance a single reason for the belief of a second party .
nothing is more vague than impressions of individual identity .
each man recognizes his neighbor , yet there are few instances in which any one is prepared to give a reason for his recognition .
the editor of l'etoile had no right to be offended at m. beauvais ' unreasoning belief .
" the suspicious circumstances which invest him , <name> be found to tally much better with my hypothesis of romantic <unk> , than with the <unk> 's suggestion of guilt .
once adopting the more charitable interpretation , we shall find no difficulty in comprehending the rose in the key-hole ; the <unk> ' upon the slate ; the <unk> the male relatives out of the way ; ' the <unk> to permitting them to see the body ; ' the caution given to madame b   , that she must hold no conversation with the <unk> until his return ( beauvais ' ) ; and , lastly , his apparent determination 'that nobody should have anything to do with the proceedings except himself . '
it seems to me unquestionable that beauvais was a suitor of <name> 's ; that she <unk> with him ; and that he was ambitious of being thought to enjoy her fullest intimacy and confidence .
i shall say nothing more upon this point ; and , as the evidence fully <unk> the assertion of l'etoile , touching the matter of apathy on the part of the mother and other relatives  an apathy inconsistent with the supposition of their believing the corpse to be that of the <unk>  we shall now proceed as if the question of identity were settled to our perfect satisfaction . "
" and what , " i here demanded , " do you think of the opinions of <name> <unk> ? "
" that , in spirit , they are far more worthy of attention than any which have been <unk> upon the subject .
the deductions from the premises are philosophical and acute ; but the premises , in two instances , at least , are founded in imperfect observation .
<name> <unk> wishes to intimate that <name> was seized by some gang of low ruffians not far from her mother 's door .
'it is impossible , ' it urges , 'that a person so well known to thousands as this young woman was , should have passed three blocks without some one having seen her . '
this is the idea of a man long resident in <name>  a public man  and one whose walks to and fro in the city , have been mostly limited to the vicinity of the public offices .
he is aware that he seldom passes so far as a dozen blocks from his own bureau , without being recognized and accosted .
and , knowing the extent of his personal acquaintance with others , and of others with him , he compares his notoriety with that of the <unk> , finds no great difference between them , and reaches at once the conclusion that she , in her walks , would be equally liable to recognition with himself in his .
this could only be the case were her walks of the same unvarying , methodical character , and within the same species of limited region as are his own .
he passes to and fro , at regular intervals , within a confined <unk> , abounding in individuals who are led to observation of his person through interest in the kindred nature of his occupation with their own .
but the walks of <name> may , in general , be supposed <unk> .
in this particular instance , it <name> be understood as most probable , that she proceeded upon a route of more than average diversity from her accustomed ones .
the parallel which we imagine to have existed in the mind of <name> <unk> would only be sustained in the event of the two individuals ' traversing the whole city .
in this case , granting the personal acquaintances to be equal , the chances would be also equal that an equal number of personal <unk> would be made .
for my own part , i should hold it not only as possible , but as very far more than probable , that <name> might have proceeded , at any given period , by any one of the many routes between her own residence and that of her aunt , without meeting a single individual whom she knew , or by whom she was known .
in viewing this question in its full and proper light , we must hold steadily in mind the great disproportion between the personal acquaintances of even the most noted individual in <name> , and the entire population of <name> itself .
" but whatever force there may still appear to be in the suggestion of <name> <unk> , <name> be much diminished when we take into consideration the hour at which the girl went abroad .
'it was when the streets were full of people , ' says <name> <unk> , 'that she went out . '
but not so .
it was at nine o'clock in the morning .
now at nine o'clock of every morning in the week , with the exception of <name> , the streets of the city are , it is true , thronged with people .
at nine on <name> , the populace are chiefly within doors preparing for church .
no observing person can have failed to notice the peculiarly deserted air of the town , from about eight until ten on the morning of every sabbath .
between ten and eleven the streets are thronged , but not at so early a period as that designated .
" there is another point at which there seems a deficiency of observation on the part of <name> <unk> .
'a piece , ' it says , 'of one of the unfortunate girl 's petticoats , two feet long , and one foot wide , was torn out and tied under her <name> , and around the back of her head , probably to prevent screams .
this was done , by fellows who had no <unk> . '
whether this idea is , or is not well founded , we <name> endeavor to see hereafter ; but by <unk> who have no <unk> ' the editor intends the lowest class of ruffians .
these , however , are the very description of people who <name> always be found to have handkerchiefs even when destitute of shirts .
you must have had occasion to observe how absolutely indispensable , of late years , to the thorough blackguard , has become the pocket-handkerchief . "
" and what are we to think , " i asked , " of the article in <name> <unk> ? "
" that it is a vast pity its <unk> was not born a parrot  in which case he would have been the most illustrious parrot of his race .
he has merely repeated the individual items of the already published opinion ; collecting them , with a laudable industry , from this paper and from that .
'the things had all evidently been there , ' he says , 'at least , three or four weeks , and there can be no doubt that the spot of this appalling outrage has been discovered . '
the facts here <unk> by <name> <unk> , are very far indeed from removing my own doubts upon this subject , and we <name> examine them more particularly hereafter in connexion with another division of the theme .
" at present we must occupy ourselves with other investigations you can not fail to have remarked the extreme <unk> of the examination of the corpse .
to be sure , the question of identity was readily determined , or should have been ; but there were other points to be ascertained .
had the body been in any respect <unk> ?
had the deceased any articles of jewelry about her person upon leaving home ?
if so , had she any when found ?
these are important questions utterly untouched by the evidence ; and there are others of equal moment , which have met with no attention .
we must endeavor to satisfy ourselves by personal inquiry .
the case of st. eustache must be <unk> .
i have no suspicion of this person ; but let us proceed methodically .
we <name> ascertain beyond a doubt the validity of the <unk> in regard to his whereabouts on the <name> .
<unk> of this character are readily made matter of <unk> .
should there be nothing wrong here , however , we <name> dismiss st. eustache from our investigations .
his suicide , however <unk> of suspicion , were there found to be deceit in the <unk> , is , without such deceit , in no respect an unaccountable circumstance , or one which need cause us to <unk> from the line of ordinary analysis .
" in that which i now propose , we <name> discard the interior points of this tragedy , and concentrate our attention upon its outskirts .
not the least usual error , in investigations such as this , is the limiting of inquiry to the immediate , with total disregard of the collateral or circumstantial events .
it is the <unk> of the courts to confine evidence and discussion to the bounds of apparent relevancy .
yet experience has shown , and a true philosophy <name> always show , that a vast , perhaps the larger portion of truth , arises from the seemingly irrelevant .
it is through the spirit of this principle , if not precisely through its letter , that modern science has resolved to calculate upon the unforeseen .
but perhaps you do not comprehend me .
the history of human knowledge has so uninterruptedly shown that to collateral , or incidental , or accidental events we are indebted for the most numerous and most valuable discoveries , that it has at length become necessary , in any prospective view of improvement , to make not only large , but the largest allowances for inventions that shall arise by chance , and quite out of the range of ordinary expectation .
it is no longer philosophical to base , upon what has been , a vision of what is to be .
accident is admitted as a portion of the <unk> .
we make chance a matter of absolute calculation .
we subject the <unk> for and <unk> , to the mathematical <unk> of the schools .
" i repeat that it is no more than fact , that the larger portion of all truth has sprung from the collateral ; and it is but in accordance with the spirit of the principle involved in this fact , that i would divert inquiry , in the present case , from the trodden and hitherto <unk> ground of the event itself , to the contemporary circumstances which surround it .
while you ascertain the validity of the <unk> , i <name> examine the newspapers more generally than you have as yet done .
so far , we have only <unk> the field of investigation ; but it <name> be strange indeed if a comprehensive survey , such as i propose , of the public prints , <name> not afford us some minute points which shall establish a direction for inquiry . "
in pursuance of dupin 's suggestion , i made scrupulous examination of the affair of the <unk> .
the result was a firm conviction of their validity , and of the consequent innocence of st. eustache .
in the mean time my friend occupied himself , with what seemed to me a minuteness altogether <unk> , in a scrutiny of the various newspaper files .
at the end of a week he placed before me the following extracts : " about three years and a half ago , a disturbance very similar to the present , was caused by the disappearance of this same <name> rogêt , from the <unk> of monsieur <name> blanc , in the <unk> <name> .
at the end of a week , however , she <unk> at her customary <unk> , as well as ever , with the exception of a slight paleness not altogether usual .
it was given out by monsieur <name> blanc and her mother , that she had merely been on a visit to some friend in the country ; and the affair was speedily hushed up .
we presume that the present absence is a freak of the same nature , and that , at the expiration of a week , or perhaps of a month , we shall have her among us again . "
 evening paper  monday <name> 23 .
( <unk> ) " an evening journal of yesterday , refers to a former mysterious disappearance of mademoiselle rogêt .
it is well known that , during the week of her absence from <name> blanc 's <unk> , she was in the company of a young naval officer , much noted for his <unk> .
a quarrel , it is supposed , <unk> led to her return home .
we have the name of the <unk> in question , who is , at present , stationed in <name> , but , for obvious reasons , forbear to make it public . "
 <name> <unk>  tuesday morning , <name> 24 .
( <unk> ) " an outrage of the most atrocious character was perpetrated near this city the day before yesterday .
a gentleman , with his wife and daughter , engaged , about dusk , the services of six young men , who were idly rowing a boat to and fro near the banks of the seine , to convey him across the river .
upon reaching the opposite shore , the three passengers stepped out , and had proceeded so far as to be beyond the view of the boat , when the daughter discovered that she had left in it her parasol .
she returned for it , was seized by the gang , carried out into the stream , gagged , brutally treated , and finally taken to the shore at a point not far from that at which she had originally entered the boat with her parents .
the villains have escaped for the time , but the police are upon their trail , and some of them <name> soon be taken . "
 morning paper  <name> 25 .
( <unk> ) " we have received one or two communications , the object of which is to fasten the crime of the late atrocity upon <unk> ; ( <unk> ) but as this gentleman has been fully <unk> by a loyal inquiry , and as the arguments of our several correspondents appear to be more zealous than profound , we do not think it advisable to make them public . "
 morning paper  <name> 28 .
( <unk> ) " we have received several forcibly written communications , apparently from various sources , and which go far to render it a matter of certainty that the unfortunate <name> rogêt has become a victim of one of the numerous bands of blackguards which infest the vicinity of the city upon <name> .
our own opinion is decidedly in favor of this supposition .
we shall endeavor to make room for some of these arguments hereafter . "
 evening paper  tuesday , <name> 31 .
( <unk> ) " on monday , one of the <unk> connected with the revenue service , saw a empty boat floating down the seine .
sails were lying in the bottom of the boat .
the <unk> towed it under the barge office .
the next morning it was taken from thence , without the knowledge of any of the officers .
the rudder is now at the barge office . "
 <name> diligence  thursday , <name> 26 .
upon reading these various extracts , they not only seemed to me irrelevant , but i could perceive no mode in which any one of them could be brought to bear upon the matter in hand .
i waited for some explanation from dupin .
" it is not my present design , " he said , " to dwell upon the first and second of those extracts .
i have copied them chiefly to show you the extreme <unk> of the police , who , as far as i can understand from the prefect , have not troubled themselves , in any respect , with an examination of the naval officer alluded to .
yet it is mere folly to say that between the first and second disappearance of <name> , there is no <unk> connection .
let us admit the first elopement to have resulted in a quarrel between the lovers , and the return home of the betrayed .
we are now prepared to view a second elopement ( if we know that an elopement has again taken place ) as indicating a renewal of the <unk> 's advances , rather than as the result of new proposals by a second individual  we are prepared to regard it as a <unk> up ' of the old <unk> , rather than as the commencement of a new one .
the chances are ten to one , that he who had once <unk> with <name> , would again propose an elopement , rather than that she to whom proposals of elopement had been made by one individual , should have them made to her by another .
and here let me call your attention to the fact , that the time <unk> between the first ascertained , and the second supposed elopement , is a few months more than the general period of the <unk> of our men-of-war .
had the lover been interrupted in his first <unk> by the necessity of departure to sea , and had he seized the first moment of his return to renew the base designs not yet altogether accomplished  or not yet altogether accomplished by him ?  of all these things we know nothing .
" you <name> say , however , that , in the second instance , there was no elopement as imagined .
certainly not  but are we prepared to say that there was not the frustrated design ?
beyond st. eustache , and perhaps beauvais , we find no recognized , no open , no honorable suitors of <name> .
of none other is there any thing said .
who , then , is the secret lover , of whom the relatives ( at least most of them ) know nothing , but whom <name> meets upon the morning of <name> , and who is so deeply in her confidence , that she hesitates not to remain with him until the shades of the evening descend , amid the solitary groves of the barrière du roule ?
who is that secret lover , i ask , of whom , at least , most of the relatives know nothing ?
and what means the singular prophecy of madame rogêt on the morning of <name> 's departure ?  'i fear that i shall never see <name> again . '
" but if we can not imagine madame rogêt privy to the design of elopement , may we not at least suppose this design entertained by the girl ?
upon quitting home , she gave it to be understood that she was about to visit her aunt in the rue des <unk> and st. eustache was requested to call for her at dark .
now , at first glance , this fact strongly <unk> against my suggestion ;  but let us reflect .
that she did meet some companion , and proceed with him across the river , reaching the barrière du roule at so late an hour as three o'clock in the afternoon , is known .
but in consenting so to accompany this individual , ( for whatever purpose  to her mother known or unknown ,  ) she must have thought of her expressed intention when leaving home , and of the surprise and suspicion aroused in the bosom of her <unk> suitor , st. eustache , when , calling for her , at the hour appointed , in the rue des <unk> , he should find that she had not been there , and when , moreover , upon returning to the pension with this alarming intelligence , he should become aware of her continued absence from home .
she must have thought of these things , i say .
she must have foreseen the chagrin of st. eustache , the suspicion of all .
she could not have thought of returning to brave this suspicion ; but the suspicion becomes a point of trivial importance to her , if we suppose her not intending to return .
" we may imagine her thinking thus  'i am to meet a certain person for the purpose of elopement , or for certain other purposes known only to myself .
it is necessary that there be no chance of interruption  there must be sufficient time given us to elude pursuit  i <name> give it to be understood that i shall visit and spend the day with my aunt at the rue des <unk>  i well tell st. eustache not to call for me until dark  in this way , my absence from home for the longest possible period , without causing suspicion or anxiety , <name> be accounted for , and i shall gain more time than in any other manner .
if i bid st. eustache call for me at dark , he <name> be sure not to call before ; but , if i wholly neglect to bid him call , my time for escape <name> be diminished , since it <name> be expected that i return the earlier , and my absence <name> the sooner excite anxiety .
now , if it were my design to return at all  if i had in contemplation merely a stroll with the individual in question  it would not be my policy to bid st. eustache call ; for , calling , he <name> be sure to ascertain that i have played him false  a fact of which i might keep him for ever in ignorance , by leaving home without <unk> him of my intention , by returning before dark , and by then stating that i had been to visit my aunt in the rue des <unk> .
but , as it is my design never to return  or not for some weeks  or not until certain <unk> are effected  the gaining of time is the only point about which i need give myself any concern . '
" you have observed , in your notes , that the most general opinion in relation to this sad affair is , and was from the first , that the girl had been the victim of a gang of blackguards .
now , the popular opinion , under certain conditions , is not to be disregarded .
when arising of itself  when manifesting itself in a strictly spontaneous manner  we should look upon it as analogous with that intuition which is the <unk> of the individual man of genius .
in ninety-nine cases from the hundred i would abide by its decision .
but it is important that we find no palpable traces of suggestion .
the opinion must be rigorously the public 's own ; and the distinction is often exceedingly difficult to perceive and to maintain .
in the present instance , it appears to me that this <unk> opinion ' in respect to a gang , has been <unk> by the collateral event which is detailed in the third of my extracts .
all <name> is excited by the discovered corpse of <name> , a girl young , beautiful and notorious .
this corpse is found , bearing marks of violence , and floating in the river .
but it is now made known that , at the very period , or about the very period , in which it is supposed that the girl was assassinated , an outrage similar in nature to that endured by the deceased , although less in extent , was perpetuated , by a gang of young ruffians , upon the person of a second young female .
is it wonderful that the one known atrocity should influence the popular judgment in regard to the other unknown ?
this judgment awaited direction , and the known outrage seemed so <unk> to afford it !
<name> , too , was found in the river ; and upon this very river was this known outrage committed .
the connexion of the two events had about it so much of the palpable , that the true wonder would have been a failure of the populace to appreciate and to seize it .
but , in fact , the one atrocity , known to be so committed , is , if any thing , evidence that the other , committed at a time nearly coincident , was not so committed .
it would have been a miracle indeed , if , while a gang of ruffians were <unk> , at a given locality , a most unheard-of wrong , there should have been another similar gang , in a similar locality , in the same city , under the same circumstances , with the same means and appliances , engaged in a wrong of precisely the same aspect , at precisely the same period of time !
yet in what , if not in this marvellous train of coincidence , does the accidentally suggested opinion of the populace call upon us to believe ?
" before proceeding farther , let us consider the supposed scene of the assassination , in the thicket at the barrière du roule .
this thicket , although dense , was in the close vicinity of a public road .
within were three or four large stones , forming a kind of seat with a back and footstool .
on the upper stone was discovered a white petticoat ; on the second , a silk scarf .
a parasol , gloves , and a pocket-handkerchief , were also here found .
the handkerchief bore the name , <unk> rogêt . '
fragments of dress were seen on the branches around .
the earth was trampled , the bushes were broken , and there was every evidence of a violent struggle .
" notwithstanding the <unk> with which the discovery of this thicket was received by the press , and the unanimity with which it was supposed to indicate the precise scene of the outrage , it must be admitted that there was some very good reason for doubt .
that it was the scene , i may or i may not believe  but there was excellent reason for doubt .
had the true scene been , as <name> <unk> suggested , in the neighborhood of the rue <unk> st. <unk> , the <unk> of the crime , supposing them still resident in <name> , would naturally have been stricken with terror at the public attention thus acutely directed into the proper channel ; and , in certain classes of minds , there would have arisen , at once , a sense of the necessity of some exertion to <unk> this attention .
and thus , the thicket of the barrière du roule having been already suspected , the idea of placing the articles where they were found , might have been naturally entertained .
there is no real evidence , although <name> <unk> so supposes , that the articles discovered had been more than a very few days in the thicket ; while there is much circumstantial proof that they could not have remained there , without attracting attention , during the twenty days <unk> between the fatal <name> and the afternoon upon which they were found by the boys .
'they were all mildewed down hard , ' says <name> <unk> , adopting the opinions of its predecessors , 'with the action of the rain , and stuck together from mildew .
the grass had grown around and over some of them .
the silk of the parasol was strong , but the threads of it were run together within .
the upper part , where it bad been doubled and folded , was all mildewed and rotten , and tore on being opened . '
in respect to the grass having <unk> around and over some of them , ' it is obvious that the fact could only have been ascertained from the words , and thus from the recollections , of two small boys ; for these boys removed the articles and took them home before they had been seen by a third party .
but grass <name> grow , especially in warm and damp weather , ( such as was that of the period of the murder , ) as much as two or three inches in a single day .
a parasol lying upon a newly <unk> ground , might , in a single week , be entirely concealed from sight by the <unk> grass .
and touching that mildew upon which the editor of <name> <unk> so pertinaciously insists , that he employs the word no less than three times in the brief paragraph just quoted , is he really unaware of the nature of this mildew ?
is he to be told that it is one of the many classes of fungus , of which the most ordinary feature is its <unk> and <unk> within twenty-four hours ?
" thus we see , at a glance , that what has been most triumphantly adduced in support of the idea that the articles bad been 'for at least three or four weeks ' in the thicket , is most absurdly null as regards any evidence of that fact .
on the other hand , it is exceedingly difficult to believe that these articles could have remained in the thicket specified , for a longer period than a single week  for a longer period than from one <name> to the next .
those who know any thing of the vicinity of <name> , know the extreme difficulty of finding seclusion unless at a great distance from its suburbs .
such a thing as an unexplored , or even an unfrequently visited recess , amid its woods or groves , is not for a moment to be imagined .
let any one who , being at heart a lover of nature , is yet chained by duty to the dust and heat of this great metropolis  let any such one attempt , even during the <unk> , to <unk> his thirst for solitude amid the scenes of natural loveliness which immediately surround us .
at every second step , he <name> find the growing charm dispelled by the voice and personal intrusion of some ruffian or party of carousing blackguards .
he <name> seek privacy amid the <unk> foliage , all in vain .
here are the very nooks where the unwashed most abound  here are the temples most <unk> .
with sickness of the heart the wanderer <name> flee back to the polluted <name> as to a less odious because less incongruous sink of pollution .
but if the vicinity of the city is so beset during the working days of the week , how much more so on the sabbath !
it is now especially that , released from the claims of labor , or deprived of the customary opportunities of crime , the town blackguard seeks the precincts of the town , not through love of the rural , which in his heart he despises , but by way of escape from the restraints and <unk> of society .
he desires less the fresh air and the green trees , than the utter license of the country .
here , at the road-side inn , or beneath the foliage of the woods , he <unk> , <unk> by any eye except those of his boon companions , in all the mad excess of a counterfeit hilarity  the joint offspring of <name> and of rum .
i say nothing more than what must be obvious to every dispassionate observer , when i repeat that the circumstance of the articles in question having remained undiscovered , for a longer period  than from one <name> to another , in any thicket in the immediate neighborhood of <name> , is to be looked upon as little less than miraculous .
" but there are not wanting other grounds for the suspicion that the articles were placed in the thicket with the view of <unk> attention from the real scene of the outrage .
and , first , let me direct your notice to the date of the discovery of the articles .
<unk> this with the date of the fifth extract made by myself from the newspapers .
you <name> find that the discovery followed , almost immediately , the urgent communications sent to the evening paper .
these communications , although various and apparently from various sources , tended all to the same point  viz. , the directing of attention to a gang as the <unk> of the outrage , and to the neighborhood of the barrière du roule as its scene .
now here , of course , the suspicion is not that , in consequence of these communications , or of the public attention by them directed , the articles were found by the boys ; but the suspicion might and may well have been , that the articles were not before found by the boys , for the reason that the articles had not before been in the thicket ; having been deposited there only at so late a period as at the date , or shortly prior to the date of the communications by the guilty authors of these communications themselves .
" this thicket was a singular  an exceedingly singular one .
it was unusually dense .
within its naturally walled enclosure were three extraordinary stones , forming a seat with a back and footstool .
and this thicket , so full of a natural <name> , was in the immediate vicinity , within a few rods , of the dwelling of madame deluc , whose boys were in the habit of closely examining the <unk> about them in search of the bark of the <unk> .
would it be a rash wager  a wager of one thousand to one  that a day never passed over the heads of these boys without finding at least one of them <unk> in the <unk> hall , and <unk> upon its natural throne ?
those who would hesitate at such a wager , have either never been boys themselves , or have forgotten the boyish nature .
i repeat  it is exceedingly hard to comprehend how the articles could have remained in this thicket undiscovered , for a longer period than one or two days ; and that thus there is good ground for suspicion , in spite of the <unk> ignorance of <name> <unk> , that they were , at a comparatively late date , deposited where found .
" but there are still other and stronger reasons for believing them so deposited , than any which i have as yet urged .
and , now , let me beg your notice to the highly artificial arrangement of the articles .
on the upper stone lay a white petticoat ; on the second a silk scarf ; scattered around , were a parasol , gloves , and a pocket-handkerchief bearing the name , <unk> rogêt . '
here is just such an arrangement as would naturally be made by a not <unk> person wishing to dispose the articles naturally .
but it is by no means a really natural arrangement .
i should rather have looked to see the things all lying on the ground and trampled under foot .
in the narrow limits of that bower , it would have been scarcely possible that the petticoat and scarf should have retained a position upon the stones , when subjected to the brushing to and fro of many struggling persons .
'there was evidence , ' it is said , 'of a struggle ; and the earth was trampled , the bushes were broken , '  but the petticoat and the scarf are found deposited as if upon shelves .
'the pieces of the frock torn out by the bushes were about three inches wide and six inches long .
one part was the hem of the frock and it had been mended .
they looked like strips torn off . '
here , <unk> , <name> <unk> has employed an exceedingly suspicious phrase .
the pieces , as described , do indeed 'look like strips torn off ; ' but purposely and by hand .
it is one of the rarest of accidents that a piece is <unk> off , ' from any garment such as is now in question , by the agency of a thorn .
from the very nature of such fabrics , a thorn or nail becoming entangled in them , tears them rectangularly  divides them into two longitudinal rents , at right angles with each other , and meeting at an apex where the thorn enters  but it is scarcely possible to conceive the piece <unk> off . '
i never so knew it , nor did you .
to tear a piece off from such fabric , two distinct forces , in different directions , <name> be , in almost every case , required .
if there be two edges to the fabric  if , for example , it be a pocket-handkerchief , and it is desired to tear from it a slip , then , and then only , <name> the one force serve the purpose .
but in the present case the question is of a dress , presenting but one edge .
to tear a piece from the interior , where no edge is presented , could only be effected by a miracle through the agency of thorns , and no one thorn could accomplish it .
but , even where an edge is presented , two thorns <name> be necessary , operating , the one in two distinct directions , and the other in one .
and this in the supposition that the edge is <unk> .
if hemmed , the matter is nearly out of the question .
we thus see the numerous and great obstacles in the way of pieces being <unk> off ' through the simple agency of <unk> ; ' yet we are required to believe not only that one piece but that many have been so torn .
'and one part , ' too , 'was the hem of the frock ! '
another piece was <unk> of the skirt , not the hem , '  that is to say , was torn completely out through the agency of thorns , from the <unk> interior of the dress !
these , i say , are things which one may well be pardoned for <unk> ; yet , taken <unk> , they form , perhaps , less of reasonable ground for suspicion , than the one startling circumstance of the articles ' having been left in this thicket at all , by any murderers who had enough precaution to think of removing the corpse .
you <name> not have apprehended me rightly , however , if you suppose it my design to deny this thicket as the scene of the outrage .
there might have been a wrong here , or , more possibly , an accident at madame deluc 's .
but , in fact , this is a point of minor importance .
we are not engaged in an attempt to discover the scene , but to produce the <unk> of the murder .
what i have adduced , notwithstanding the minuteness with which i have adduced it , has been with the view , first , to show the folly of the positive and headlong assertions of <name> <unk> , but secondly and chiefly , to bring you , by the most natural route , to a further contemplation of the doubt whether this assassination has , or has not been , the work of a gang .
" we <name> resume this question by mere allusion to the revolting details of the surgeon examined at the inquest .
it is only necessary to say that is published inferences , in regard to the number of ruffians , have been properly ridiculed as unjust and totally <unk> , by all the reputable anatomists of <name> .
not that the matter might not have been as inferred , but that there was no ground for the inference :  was there not much for another ?
" let us reflect now upon 'the traces of a struggle ; ' and let me ask what these traces have been supposed to demonstrate .
a gang .
but do they not rather demonstrate the absence of a gang ?
what struggle could have taken place  what struggle so violent and so enduring as to have left its <unk> ' in all directions  between a weak and defenceless girl and the gang of ruffians imagined ?
the silent grasp of a few rough arms and all would have been over .
the victim must have been absolutely passive at their <name> .
you <name> here bear in mind that the arguments urged against the thicket as the scene , are applicable in chief part , only against it as the scene of an outrage committed by more than a single individual .
if we imagine but one <unk> , we can conceive , and thus only conceive , the struggle of so violent and so obstinate a nature as to have left the <unk> ' apparent .
" and again .
i have already mentioned the suspicion to be excited by the fact that the articles in question were suffered to remain at all in the thicket where discovered .
it seems almost impossible that these evidences of guilt should have been accidentally left where found .
there was sufficient presence of mind ( it is supposed ) to remove the corpse ; and yet a more positive evidence than the corpse itself ( whose features might have been quickly obliterated by decay , ) is allowed to lie conspicuously in the scene of the outrage  i allude to the handkerchief with the name of the deceased .
if this was accident , it was not the accident of a gang .
we can imagine it only the accident of an individual .
let us see .
an individual has committed the murder .
he is alone with the ghost of the departed .
he is appalled by what lies motionless before him .
the fury of his passion is over , and there is abundant room in his heart for the natural awe of the deed .
his is none of that confidence which the presence of <name> inevitably inspires .
he is alone with the dead .
he trembles and is bewildered .
yet there is a necessity for disposing of the corpse .
he bears it to the river , but leaves behind him the other evidences of guilt ; for it is difficult , if not impossible to <name> all the burthen at once , and it <name> be easy to return for what is left .
but in his <unk> journey to the water his fears <unk> within him .
the sounds of life <unk> his path .
a dozen times he hears or fancies the step of an observer .
even the very lights from the city bewilder him .
yet , in time and by long and frequent pauses of deep agony , he reaches the river 's brink , and disposes of his ghastly charge  perhaps through the medium of a boat .
but now what treasure does the world hold  what threat of vengeance could it hold out  which would have power to urge the return of that lonely murderer over that <unk> and perilous path , to the thicket and its blood chilling recollections ?
he returns not , let the consequences be what they may .
he could not return if he would .
his sole thought is immediate escape .
he turns his back forever upon those dreadful <unk> and <unk> as from the wrath to come .
" but how with a gang ?
their number would have inspired them with confidence ; if , indeed confidence is ever wanting in the breast of the <unk> blackguard ; and of <unk> blackguards alone are the supposed gangs ever constituted .
their number , i say , would have prevented the bewildering and unreasoning terror which i have imagined to <unk> the single man .
could we suppose an oversight in one , or two , or three , this oversight would have been remedied by a fourth .
they would have left nothing behind them ; for their number would have enabled them to <name> all at once .
there would have been no need of return .
" consider now the circumstance that in the outer garment of the corpse when found , 'a slip , about a foot wide had been torn upward from the bottom hem to the waist wound three times round the waist , and secured by a sort of hitch in the back . '
this was done with the obvious design of affording a handle by which to <name> the body .
but would any number of men have dreamed of resorting to such an expedient ?
to three or four , the limbs of the corpse would have afforded not only a sufficient , but the best possible hold .
the device is that of a single individual ; and this brings us to the fact that <unk> the thicket and the river , the rails of the fences were found taken down , and the ground bore evident traces of some heavy burden having been dragged along it ! '
but would a number of men have put themselves to the superfluous trouble of taking down a fence , for the purpose of dragging through it a corpse which they might have lifted over any fence in an instant ?
would a number of men have so dragged a corpse at all as to have left evident traces of the dragging ?
" and here we must refer to an observation of <name> <unk> ; an observation upon which i have already , in some measure , commented .
'a piece , ' says this journal , 'of one of the unfortunate girl 's petticoats was torn out and tied under her <name> , and around the back of her head , probably to prevent screams .
this was done by fellows who had no <unk> . '
" i have before suggested that a genuine blackguard is never without a pocket-handkerchief .
but it is not to this fact that i now especially <unk> .
that it was not through want of a handkerchief for the purpose imagined by <name> <unk> , that this bandage was employed , is rendered apparent by the handkerchief left in the thicket ; and that the object was not 'to prevent screams ' appears , also , from the bandage having been employed in preference to what would so much better have answered the purpose .
but the language of the evidence speaks of the strip in question as <unk> around the neck , fitting loosely , and secured with a hard knot . '
these words are sufficiently vague , but differ materially from those of <name> <unk> .
the slip was eighteen inches wide , and therefore , although of muslin , would form a strong band when folded or <unk> longitudinally .
and thus <unk> it was discovered .
my inference is this .
the solitary murderer , having borne the corpse , for some distance , ( whether from the thicket or elsewhere ) by means of the bandage hitched around its middle , found the weight , in this mode of procedure , too much for his strength .
he resolved to drag the burthen  the evidence goes to show that it was dragged .
with this object in view , it became necessary to attach something like a rope to one of the extremities .
it could be best attached about the neck , where the head would prevent its slipping off .
and , now , the murderer bethought him , unquestionably , of the bandage about the loins .
he would have used this , but for its <unk> about the corpse , the hitch which embarrassed it , and the reflection that it had not been <unk> off ' from the garment .
it was easier to tear a new slip from the petticoat .
he tore it , made it fast about the neck , and so dragged his victim to the brink of the river .
that this <unk> , ' only attainable with trouble and delay , and but imperfectly answering its purpose  that this bandage was employed at all , <unk> that the necessity for its employment sprang from circumstances arising at a period when the handkerchief was no longer attainable  that is to say , arising , as we have imagined , after quitting the thicket , ( if the thicket it was ) , and on the road between the thicket and the river .
" but the evidence , you <name> say , of madame deluc , ( ! )
points especially to the presence of a gang , in the vicinity of the thicket , at or about the epoch of the murder .
this i <name> .
i doubt if there were not a dozen gangs , such as described by madame deluc , in and about the vicinity of the barrière du roule at or about the period of this tragedy .
but the gang which has drawn upon itself the pointed <unk> , although the somewhat tardy and very suspicious evidence of madame deluc , is the only gang which is represented by that honest and scrupulous old <name> as having eaten her cakes and swallowed her <name> , without putting themselves to the trouble of making her payment .
et <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
" but what is the precise evidence of madame deluc ?
'a gang of <unk> made their appearance , behaved <unk> , ate and drank without making payment , followed in the route of the young man and girl , returned to the inn about dusk , and recrossed the river as if in great haste . '
" now this 'great haste ' very possibly seemed greater haste in the eyes of madame deluc , since she dwelt <unk> and <unk> upon her violated cakes and ale  cakes and ale for which she might still have entertained a faint <name> of compensation .
why , otherwise , since it was about dusk , should she make a point of the haste ?
it is no cause for wonder , surely , that even a gang of blackguards should make haste to get home , when a wide river is to be crossed in small boats , when storm <unk> , and when night approaches .
" i say approaches ; for the night had not yet arrived .
it was only about dusk that the indecent haste of these <unk> ' offended the sober eyes of madame deluc .
but we are told that it was upon this very evening that madame deluc , as well as her eldest son , <unk> the screams of a female in the vicinity of the inn . '
and in what words does madame deluc designate the period of the evening at which these screams were heard ?
'it was soon after dark , ' she says .
but <unk> after dark , ' is , at least , dark ; and <unk> dusk ' is as certainly daylight .
thus it is abundantly clear that the gang quitted the barrière du roule prior to the screams overheard ( ? )
by madame deluc .
and although , in all the many reports of the evidence , the relative expressions in question are distinctly and invariably employed just as i have employed them in this conversation with yourself , no notice whatever of the gross discrepancy has , as yet , been taken by any of the public journals , or by any of the <unk> of police .
" i shall add but one to the arguments against a gang ; but this one has , to my own understanding at least , a weight altogether irresistible .
under the circumstances of large reward offered , and full pardon to any king 's evidence , it is not to be imagined , for a moment , that some member of a gang of low ruffians , or of any body of men , would not long ago have betrayed his accomplices .
each one of a gang so placed , is not so much greedy of reward , or anxious for escape , as fearful of betrayal .
he betrays eagerly and early that he may not himself be betrayed .
that the secret has not been <unk> , is the very best of proof that it is , in fact , a secret .
the horrors of this dark deed are known only to one , or two , living human beings , and to god .
" let us sum up now the meagre yet certain fruits of our long analysis .
we have attained the idea either of a fatal accident under the roof of madame deluc , or of a murder perpetrated , in the thicket at the barrière du roule , by a lover , or at least by an intimate and secret associate of the deceased .
this associate is of swarthy complexion .
this complexion , the <unk> ' in the bandage , and the <unk> 's knot , ' with which the <unk> is tied , point to a seaman .
his companionship with the deceased , a <name> , but not an abject young girl , <unk> him as above the grade of the common sailor .
here the well written and urgent communications to the journals are much in the way of <unk> .
the circumstance of the first elopement , as mentioned by <name> <unk> , tends to blend the idea of this seaman with that of the <unk> officer ' who is first known to have led the unfortunate into crime .
" and here , most <unk> , comes the consideration of the continued absence of him of the dark complexion .
let me pause to observe that the complexion of this man is dark and swarthy ; it was no common <unk> which constituted the sole point of remembrance , both as regards <unk> and madame deluc .
but why is this man absent ?
was he murdered by the gang ?
if so , why are there only traces of the assassinated girl ?
the scene of the two outrages <name> naturally be supposed identical .
and where is his corpse ?
the assassins would most probably have disposed of both in the same way .
but it may be said that this man lives , and is deterred from making himself known , through dread of being charged with the murder .
this consideration might be supposed to operate upon him now  at this late period  since it has been given in evidence that he was seen with <name>  but it would have had no force at the period of the deed .
the first impulse of an innocent man would have been to announce the outrage , and to aid in identifying the ruffians .
this policy would have suggested .
he had been seen with the girl .
he had crossed the river with her in an open ferry-boat .
the <unk> of the assassins would have appeared , even to an idiot , the surest and sole means of relieving himself from suspicion .
we can not suppose him , on the night of the fatal <name> , both innocent himself and <unk> of an outrage committed .
yet only under such circumstances is it possible to imagine that he would have failed , if alive , in the <unk> of the assassins .
" and what means are ours , of attaining the truth ?
we shall find these means multiplying and gathering distinctness as we proceed .
let us sift to the bottom this affair of the first elopement .
let us know the full history of 'the officer , ' with his present circumstances , and his whereabouts at the precise period of the murder .
let us carefully compare with each other the various communications sent to the evening paper , in which the object was to <unk> a gang .
this done , let us compare these communications , both as regards style and ms. , with those sent to the morning paper , at a previous period , and insisting so vehemently upon the guilt of <unk> .
and , all this done , let us again compare these various communications with the known <unk> .
of the officer .
let us endeavor to ascertain , by repeated <unk> of madame deluc and her boys , as well as of the omnibus driver , <unk> , something more of the personal appearance and bearing of the 'man of dark complexion . '
queries , skilfully directed , <name> not fail to <unk> , from some of these parties , information on this particular point ( or upon others )  information which the parties themselves may not even be aware of possessing .
and let us now trace the boat picked up by the <unk> on the morning of monday the twenty-third of <name> , and which was removed from the <unk> , without the cognizance of the officer in attendance , and without the rudder , at some period prior to the discovery of the corpse .
with a proper caution and perseverance we shall infallibly trace this boat ; for not only can the <unk> who picked it up identify it , but the rudder is at hand .
the rudder of a <unk> would not have been abandoned , without inquiry , by one altogether at ease in heart .
and here let me pause to insinuate a question .
there was no advertisement of the picking up of this boat .
it was silently taken to the <unk> , and as silently removed .
but its owner or employer  how happened he , at so early a period as tuesday morning , to be informed , without the agency of advertisement , of the locality of the boat taken up on monday , unless we imagine some connexion with the navy  some personal permanent connexion leading to cognizance of its minute in interests  its petty local news ?
" in speaking of the lonely assassin dragging his burden to the shore , i have already suggested the probability of his <unk> himself of a boat .
now we are to understand that <name> rogêt was precipitated from a boat .
this would naturally have been the case .
the corpse could not have been trusted to the shallow waters of the shore .
the peculiar marks on the back and shoulders of the victim tell of the bottom ribs of a boat .
that the body was found without weight is also <unk> of the idea .
if thrown from the shore a weight would have been attached .
we can only account for its absence by supposing the murderer to have neglected the precaution of supplying himself with it before pushing off .
in the act of <unk> the corpse to the water , he would unquestionably have noticed his oversight ; but then no remedy would have been at hand .
any risk would have been preferred to a return to that accursed shore .
having rid himself of his ghastly charge , the murderer would have hastened to the city .
there , at some obscure wharf , he would have leaped on land .
but the boat  would he have secured it ?
he would have been in too great haste for such things as securing a boat .
moreover , in fastening it to the wharf , he would have felt as if securing evidence against himself .
his natural thought would have been to cast from him , as far as possible , all that had held connection with his crime .
he would not only have fled from the wharf , but he would not have permitted the boat to remain .
assuredly he would have cast it adrift .
let us pursue our <unk>  in the morning , the wretch is stricken with unutterable horror at finding that the boat has been picked up and detained at a locality which he is in the daily habit of frequenting  at a locality , perhaps , which his duty compels him to frequent .
the next night , without daring to ask for the rudder , he removes it .
now where is that <unk> boat ?
let it be one of our first purposes to discover .
with the first glimpse we obtain of it , the <name> of our success shall begin .
this boat shall guide us , with a rapidity which <name> surprise even ourselves , to him who employed it in the midnight of the fatal sabbath .
<unk> <name> rise upon <unk> , and the murderer <name> be traced . "
[ for reasons which we shall not specify , but which to many readers <name> appear obvious , we have taken the <name> of here omitting , from the <unk> .
placed in our hands , such portion as details the following up of the apparently slight clew obtained by dupin .
we feel it advisable only to state , in brief , that the result desired was brought to pass ; and that the prefect fulfilled punctually , although with reluctance , the terms of his compact with the <unk> .
mr. poe 's article concludes with the following <unk>  <unk> .
( <unk> ) ] it <name> be understood that i speak of coincidences and no more .
what i have said above upon this topic must suffice .
in my own heart there dwells no <name> in <unk> .
that nature and its god are two , no man who thinks , <name> deny .
that the latter , creating the former , can , at <name> , control or modify it , is also unquestionable .
i say " at <name> ; " for the question is of <name> , and not , as the insanity of logic has assumed , of power .
it is not that the deity can not modify his laws , but that we insult him in imagining a possible necessity for modification .
in their origin these laws were fashioned to embrace all contingencies which could lie in the future .
with god all is now .
i repeat , then , that i speak of these things only as of coincidences .
and farther : in what i relate it <name> be seen that between the fate of the unhappy <name> <name> rogers , so far as that fate is known , and the fate of one <name> rogêt up to a certain epoch in her history , there has existed a parallel in the contemplation of whose wonderful <unk> the reason becomes embarrassed .
i say all this <name> be seen .
but let it not for a moment be supposed that , in proceeding with the sad narrative of <name> from the epoch just mentioned , and in tracing to its <unk> the mystery which enshrouded her , it is my covert design to hint at an extension of the parallel , or even to suggest that the measures adopted in <name> for the discovery of the assassin of a <unk> , or measures founded in any similar <unk> , would produce any similar result .
for , in respect to the latter branch of the supposition , it should be considered that the most trifling variation in the facts of the two cases might give rise to the most important <unk> , by <unk> thoroughly the two courses of events ; very much as , in arithmetic , an error which , in its own individuality , may be inappreciable , produces , at length , by dint of multiplication at all points of the process , a result enormously at variance with truth .
and , in regard to the former branch , we must not fail to hold in view that the very <unk> of probabilities to which i have referred , forbids all idea of the extension of the parallel :  forbids it with a <unk> strong and decided just in proportion as this parallel has already been long-drawn and exact .
this is one of those anomalous propositions which , seemingly appealing to thought altogether apart from the mathematical , is yet one which only the mathematician can fully entertain .
nothing , for example , is more difficult than to convince the merely general reader that the fact of <unk> having been thrown twice in succession by a player at dice , is sufficient cause for betting the largest odds that <unk> <name> not be thrown in the third attempt .
a suggestion to this effect is usually rejected by the intellect at once .
it does not appear that the two throws which have been completed , and which lie now absolutely in the past , can have influence upon the throw which exists only in the future .
the chance for throwing <unk> seems to be precisely as it was at any ordinary time  that is to say , subject only to the influence of the various other throws which may be made by the dice .
and this is a reflection which appears so exceedingly obvious that attempts to <unk> it are received more frequently with a derisive smile than with anything like respectful attention .
the error here involved  a gross error <unk> of mischief  i can not pretend to expose within the limits assigned me at present ; and with the philosophical it needs no exposure .
it may be sufficient here to say that it forms one of an infinite series of mistakes which arise in the path or reason through her propensity for seeking truth in detail .
footnotes  <name> rogêt ( *1 ) upon the original publication of " <name> <unk> , " the <unk> now appended were considered unnecessary ; but the lapse of several years since the tragedy upon which the tale is based , renders it expedient to give them , and also to say a few words in explanation of the general design .
a young girl , <name> <name> rogers , was murdered in the vicinity of new york ; and , although her death occasioned an intense and <unk> excitement , the mystery attending it had remained <unk> at the period when the present paper was written and published ( november , 1842 ) .
herein , under pretence of relating the fate of a parisian <unk> , the author has followed in minute detail , the essential , while merely <unk> the <unk> facts of the real murder of <name> rogers .
thus all argument founded upon the fiction is applicable to the truth : and the investigation of the truth was the object .
the " mystery of <name> <unk> " was composed at a distance from the scene of the atrocity , and with no other means of investigation than the newspapers afforded .
thus much escaped the writer of which he could have availed himself had he been upon the spot , and visited the localities .
it may not be improper to record , nevertheless , that the confessions of two persons , ( one of them the madame deluc of the narrative ) made , at different periods , long subsequent to the publication , confirmed , in full , not only the general conclusion , but absolutely all the chief hypothetical details by which that conclusion was attained .

by the energy of an agent at charleston , <unk> , we are enabled to be the first to furnish the public with a detailed account of this most extraordinary voyage , which was performed between saturday , the 6th instant , at 11 , a.m. , and 2 , p.m. , on tuesday , the 9th instant , by sir <unk> <unk> ; mr. osborne , a nephew of lord <unk> 's ; mr. <unk> <name> and mr. <name> holland , the well-known <unk> ; mr. <name> ainsworth , author of " <name> <unk> , " & c. ; and mr. <unk> , the <unk> of the late unsuccessful flying machine  with two seamen from <unk>  in all , eight persons .
the particulars furnished below may be relied on as authentic and accurate in every respect , as , with a slight exception , they are copied verbatim from the joint diaries of mr. <unk> <name> and mr. <name> ainsworth , to whose politeness our agent is also indebted for much verbal information respecting the balloon itself , its construction , and other matters of interest .
the only alteration in the ms. received , has been made for the purpose of throwing the hurried account of our agent , mr. forsyth , into a connected and intelligible form .
" the balloon .
" two very decided failures , of late  those of mr. <unk> and sir <name> <unk>  had much weakened the public interest in the subject of aerial navigation .
mr. <unk> 's scheme ( which at first was considered very feasible even by men of science , ) was founded upon the principle of an inclined plane , started from an eminence by an <unk> force , applied and continued by the revolution of <unk> vanes , in form and number resembling the vanes of a windmill .
but , in all the experiments made with models at the <name> gallery , it was found that the operation of these fans not only did not <unk> the machine , but actually impeded its flight .
the only propelling force it ever exhibited , was the mere impetus acquired from the descent of the inclined plane ; and this impetus carried the machine farther when the vanes were at rest , than when they were in motion  a fact which sufficiently <unk> their <unk> ; and in the absence of the propelling , which was also the sustaining power , the whole fabric would necessarily descend .
this consideration led sir <name> <unk> to think only of adapting a propeller to some machine having of itself an independent power of support  in a word , to a balloon ; the idea , however , being novel , or original , with sir <name> , only so far as regards the mode of its application to practice .
he exhibited a model of his invention at the <unk> institution .
the propelling principle , or power , was here , also , applied to interrupted surfaces , or vanes , put in revolution .
these vanes were four in number , but were found entirely ineffectual in moving the balloon , or in aiding its ascending power .
the whole project was thus a complete failure .
" it was at this juncture that mr. <unk> <name> ( whose voyage from dover to <unk> in the balloon , " nassau , " occasioned so much excitement in 1837 , ) conceived the idea of employing the principle of the <unk> screw for the purpose of <unk> through the air  rightly attributing the failure of mr. <unk> 's scheme , and of sir <name> <unk> 's , to the interruption of surface in the independent vanes .
he made the first public experiment at <name> 's rooms , but afterward removed his model to the <name> gallery .
" like sir <name> <unk> 's balloon , his own was an <unk> .
its length was thirteen feet six inches  height , six feet eight inches .
it contained about three hundred and twenty cubic feet of gas , which , if pure hydrogen , would support twenty-one pounds upon its first inflation , before the gas has time to <unk> or escape .
the weight of the whole machine and apparatus was seventeen pounds  leaving about four pounds to spare .
beneath the centre of the balloon , was a frame of light wood , about nine feet long , and rigged on to the balloon itself with a network in the customary manner .
from this framework was suspended a wicker basket or car .
" the screw consists of an axis of hollow brass tube , eighteen inches in length , through which , upon a <unk> inclined at fifteen degrees , pass a series of steel wire radii , two feet long , and thus projecting a foot on either side .
these radii are connected at the outer extremities by two bands of flattened wire  the whole in this manner forming the framework of the screw , which is completed by a covering of oiled silk cut into <unk> , and tightened so as to present a tolerably uniform surface .
at each end of its axis this screw is supported by pillars of hollow brass tube descending from the hoop .
in the lower ends of these tubes are holes in which the <unk> of the axis revolve .
from the end of the axis which is next the car , proceeds a shaft of steel , connecting the screw with the <unk> of a piece of spring machinery fixed in the car .
by the operation of this spring , the screw is made to revolve with great rapidity , communicating a progressive motion to the whole .
by means of the rudder , the machine was readily turned in any direction .
the spring was of great power , compared with its dimensions , being capable of raising forty-five pounds upon a barrel of four inches diameter , after the first turn , and gradually increasing as it was wound up .
it weighed , altogether , eight pounds six ounces .
the rudder was a light frame of cane covered with silk , shaped somewhat like a <unk> , and was about three feet long , and at the widest , one foot .
its weight was about two ounces .
it could be turned flat , and directed upwards or downwards , as well as to the right or left ; and thus enabled the <unk> to transfer the resistance of the air which in an inclined position it must generate in its passage , to any side upon which he might <name> to act ; thus determining the balloon in the opposite direction .
" this model ( which , through want of time , we have necessarily described in an imperfect manner , ) was put in action at the <name> gallery , where it accomplished a velocity of five miles per hour ; although , strange to say , it excited very little interest in comparison with the previous complex machine of mr. <unk>  so resolute is the world to despise anything which carries with it an air of simplicity .
to accomplish the great <unk> of <unk> navigation , it was very generally supposed that some exceedingly complicated application must be made of some unusually profound principle in <unk> .
" so well satisfied , however , was mr. <name> of the ultimate success of his invention , that he determined to construct immediately , if possible , a balloon of sufficient capacity to test the question by a voyage of some extent  the original design being to cross the british channel , as before , in the nassau balloon .
to <name> out his views , he <unk> and obtained the patronage of sir <unk> <unk> and mr. osborne , two gentlemen well known for scientific acquirement , and especially for the interest they have exhibited in the progress of <unk> .
the project , at the <name> of mr. osborne , was kept a profound secret from the public  the only persons entrusted with the design being those actually engaged in the construction of the machine , which was built ( under the superintendence of mr. <name> , mr. holland , sir <unk> <unk> , and mr. osborne , ) at the seat of the latter gentleman near <unk> , in wales .
mr. <unk> , accompanied by his friend mr. ainsworth , was admitted to a private view of the balloon , on saturday last  when the two gentlemen made final arrangements to be included in the adventure .
we are not informed for what reason the two seamen were also included in the party  but , in the course of a day or two , we shall put our readers in possession of the minutest particulars respecting this extraordinary voyage .
" the balloon is composed of silk , varnished with the liquid gum <unk> .
it is of vast dimensions , containing more than 40,000 cubic feet of gas ; but as coal gas was employed in place of the more expensive and inconvenient hydrogen , the supporting power of the machine , when fully inflated , and immediately after inflation , is not more than about <unk> pounds .
the coal gas is not only much less costly , but is easily procured and managed .
" for its introduction into common use for purposes of <unk> , we are indebted to mr. <name> green .
up to his discovery , the process of inflation was not only exceedingly expensive , but uncertain .
two , and even three days , have frequently been wasted in futile attempts to procure a sufficiency of hydrogen to fill a balloon , from which it had great tendency to escape , owing to its extreme <unk> , and its affinity for the surrounding atmosphere .
in a balloon sufficiently perfect to retain its contents of <unk> unaltered , in quantity or amount , for six months , an equal quantity of hydrogen could not be maintained in equal purity for six weeks .
" the supporting power being estimated at <unk> pounds , and the united weights of the party amounting only to about 1200 , there was left a surplus of <unk> , of which again 1200 was exhausted by ballast , arranged in bags of different sizes , with their respective weights marked upon them  by cordage , <unk> , telescopes , barrels containing provision for a fortnight , <unk> , cloaks , <unk> , and various other indispensable matters , including a <unk> , contrived for warming coffee by means of <unk> , so as to dispense altogether with fire , if it should be judged prudent to do so .
all these articles , with the exception of the ballast , and a few trifles , were suspended from the hoop overhead .
the car is much smaller and lighter , in proportion , than the one appended to the model .
it is formed of a light wicker , and is wonderfully strong , for so frail looking a machine .
its rim is about four feet deep .
the rudder is also very much larger , in proportion , than that of the model ; and the screw is considerably smaller .
the balloon is furnished besides with a grapnel , and a <unk> ; which latter is of the most indispensable importance .
a few words , in explanation , <name> here be necessary for such of our readers as are not conversant with the details of <unk> .
" as soon as the balloon quits the earth , it is subjected to the influence of many circumstances tending to create a difference in its weight ; augmenting or diminishing its ascending power .
for example , there may be a deposition of dew upon the silk , to the extent , even , of several hundred pounds ; ballast has then to be thrown out , or the machine may descend .
this ballast being discarded , and a clear <name> <unk> the dew , and at the same time expanding the gas in the silk , the whole <name> again rapidly ascend .
to check this ascent , the only recourse is , ( or rather was , until mr. green 's invention of the <unk> , ) the permission of the escape of gas from the valve ; but , in the loss of gas , is a proportionate general loss of ascending power ; so that , in a comparatively brief period , the <unk> balloon must necessarily exhaust all its resources , and come to the earth .
this was the great obstacle to voyages of length .
" the <unk> remedies the difficulty in the simplest manner conceivable .
it is merely a very long rope which is suffered to trail from the car , and the effect of which is to prevent the balloon from changing its level in any material degree .
if , for example , there should be a deposition of moisture upon the silk , and the machine begins to descend in consequence , there <name> be no necessity for discharging ballast to remedy the increase of weight , for it is remedied , or counteracted , in an exactly just proportion , by the deposit on the ground of just so much of the end of the rope as is necessary .
if , on the other hand , any circumstances should cause undue levity , and consequent ascent , this levity is immediately counteracted by the additional weight of rope upraised from the earth .
thus , the balloon can neither ascend or descend , except within very narrow limits , and its resources , either in gas or ballast , remain comparatively unimpaired .
when passing over an expanse of water , it becomes necessary to employ small <unk> of copper or wood , filled with liquid ballast of a lighter nature than water .
these float , and serve all the purposes of a mere rope on land .
another most important office of the <unk> , is to point out the direction of the balloon .
the rope drags , either on land or sea , while the balloon is free ; the latter , consequently , is always in advance , when any progress whatever is made : a comparison , therefore , by means of the compass , of the relative positions of the two objects , <name> always indicate the course .
in the same way , the <name> formed by the rope with the vertical axis of the machine , indicates the velocity .
when there is no <name>  in other words , when the rope hangs perpendicularly , the whole apparatus is stationary ; but the larger the <name> , that is to say , the farther the balloon precedes the end of the rope , the greater the velocity ; and the converse .
" as the original design was to cross the british channel , and alight as near <name> as possible , the voyagers had taken the precaution to prepare themselves with passports directed to all parts of the continent , <unk> the nature of the expedition , as in the case of the nassau voyage , and <unk> the adventurers to <unk> from the usual formalities of office : unexpected events , however , rendered these passports superfluous .
" the inflation was commenced very quietly at daybreak , on saturday morning , the 6th instant , in the court-yard of <unk> house , mr. osborne 's seat , about a mile from <unk> , in north wales ; and at 7 minutes past 11 , every thing being ready for departure , the balloon was set free , rising gently but steadily , in a direction nearly south ; no use being made , for the first half hour , of either the screw or the rudder .
we proceed now with the journal , as <unk> by mr. forsyth from the joint <unk> .
of mr. <unk> <name> , and mr. ainsworth .
the body of the journal , as given , is in the <unk> of mr. <name> , and a p. s. is appended , each day , by mr. ainsworth , who has in preparation , and <name> shortly give the public a more minute , and no doubt , a <unk> interesting account of the voyage .

" saturday , <name> the <unk>  every preparation likely to embarrass us , having been made over night , we commenced the inflation this morning at daybreak ; but owing to a thick fog , which encumbered the folds of the silk and rendered it unmanageable , we did not get through before nearly eleven o'clock .
cut loose , then , in high spirits , and rose gently but steadily , with a light breeze at north , which bore us in the direction of the british channel .
found the ascending force greater than we had expected ; and as we arose higher and so got clear of the cliffs , and more in the sun 's rays , our ascent became very rapid .
i did not wish , however , to lose gas at so early a period of the adventure , and so concluded to ascend for the present .
we soon ran out our <unk> ; but even when we had raised it clear of the earth , we still went up very rapidly .
the balloon was unusually steady , and looked beautifully .
in about ten minutes after starting , the barometer indicated an altitude of 15,000 feet .
the weather was remarkably fine , and the view of the subjacent country  a most romantic one when seen from any point ,  was now especially sublime .
the numerous deep gorges presented the appearance of lakes , on account of the dense <unk> with which they were filled , and the pinnacles and crags to the south east , piled in inextricable confusion , resembling nothing so much as the giant cities of eastern fable .
we were rapidly approaching the mountains in the south ; but our elevation was more than sufficient to enable us to pass them in safety .
in a few minutes we soared over them in fine style ; and mr. ainsworth , with the seamen , was surprised at their apparent want of altitude when viewed from the car , the tendency of great elevation in a balloon being to reduce inequalities of the surface below , to nearly a dead level .
at half-past eleven still proceeding nearly south , we obtained our first view of the bristol channel ; and , in fifteen minutes afterward , the line of breakers on the coast appeared immediately beneath us , and we were fairly out at sea .
we now resolved to let off enough gas to bring our <unk> , with the buoys affixed , into the water .
this was immediately done , and we commenced a gradual descent .
in about twenty minutes our first buoy dipped , and at the touch of the second soon afterwards , we remained stationary as to elevation .
we were all now anxious to test the efficiency of the rudder and screw , and we put them both into requisition forthwith , for the purpose of altering our direction more to the eastward , and in a line for <name> .
by means of the rudder we instantly effected the necessary change of direction , and our course was brought nearly at right angles to that of the wind ; when we set in motion the spring of the screw , and were rejoiced to find it <unk> us readily as desired .
upon this we gave nine hearty cheers , and dropped in the sea a bottle , enclosing a slip of parchment with a brief account of the principle of the invention .
hardly , however , had we done with our rejoicings , when an unforeseen accident occurred which discouraged us in no little degree .
the steel <name> connecting the spring with the propeller was suddenly jerked out of place , at the car end , ( by a swaying of the car through some movement of one of the two seamen we had taken up , ) and in an instant <name> dangling out of reach , from the pivot of the axis of the screw .
while we were endeavoring to regain it , our attention being completely absorbed , we became involved in a strong current of wind from the east , which bore us , with rapidly increasing force , towards the atlantic .
we soon found ourselves driving out to sea at the rate of not less , certainly , than fifty or sixty miles an hour , so that we came up with cape clear , at some forty miles to our north , before we had secured the <name> , and had time to think what we were about .
it was now that mr. ainsworth made an extraordinary , but to my fancy , a by no means unreasonable or <unk> proposition , in which he was instantly seconded by mr .
holland  viz .
: that we should take advantage of the strong <name> which bore us on , and in place of beating back to <name> , make an attempt to reach the coast of north <name> .
after slight reflection i gave a willing assent to this bold proposition , which ( strange to say ) met with objection from the two seamen only .
as the stronger party , however , we overruled their fears , and kept resolutely upon our course .
we steered due west ; but as the trailing of the buoys materially impeded our progress , and we had the balloon abundantly at command , either for ascent or descent , we first threw out fifty pounds of ballast , and then wound up ( by means of a windlass ) so much of the rope as brought it quite clear of the sea .
we perceived the effect of this manoeuvre immediately , in a vastly increased rate of progress ; and , as the <name> freshened , we flew with a velocity nearly inconceivable ; the <unk> flying out behind the car , like a <unk> from a vessel .
it is needless to say that a very short time sufficed us to lose sight of the coast .
we passed over innumerable vessels of all kinds , a few of which were endeavoring to beat up , but the most of them lying to .
we occasioned the greatest excitement on board all  an excitement greatly <unk> by ourselves , and especially by our two men , who , now under the influence of a <unk> of <name> , seemed resolved to give all scruple , or fear , to the wind .
many of the vessels fired signal guns ; and in all we were saluted with loud cheers ( which we heard with surprising distinctness ) and the waving of caps and handkerchiefs .
we kept on in this manner throughout the day , with no material incident , and , as the shades of night closed around us , we made a rough estimate of the distance traversed .
it could not have been less than five hundred miles , and was probably much more .
the propeller was kept in constant operation , and , no doubt , aided our progress materially .
as the sun went down , the <name> freshened into an absolute hurricane , and the ocean beneath was clearly visible on account of its <unk> .
the wind was from the east all night , and gave us the brightest omen of success .
we suffered no little from cold , and the dampness of the atmosphere was most unpleasant ; but the ample space in the car enabled us to lie down , and by means of cloaks and a few blankets , we did sufficiently well .
" p.s .
( by mr .
ainsworth . )
the last nine hours have been unquestionably the most exciting of my life .
i can conceive nothing more <unk> than the strange peril and novelty of an adventure such as this .
may god <name> that we succeed !
i ask not success for mere safety to my insignificant person , but for the sake of human knowledge and  for the vastness of the triumph .
and yet the feat is only so evidently feasible that the sole wonder is why men have <unk> to attempt it before .
one single <name> such as now <unk> us  let such a tempest whirl forward a balloon for four or five days ( these gales often last longer ) and the voyager <name> be easily borne , in that period , from coast to coast .
in view of such a <name> the broad atlantic becomes a mere lake .
i am more struck , just now , with the supreme silence which reigns in the sea beneath us , notwithstanding its agitation , than with any other phenomenon presenting itself .
the waters give up no voice to the heavens .
the immense flaming ocean <unk> and is tortured <unk> .
the mountainous surges suggest the idea of innumerable dumb gigantic fiends struggling in impotent agony .
in a night such as is this to me , a man lives  lives a whole century of ordinary life  nor would i forego this rapturous delight for that of a whole century of ordinary existence .
" <name> , the seventh .
[ mr. <name> 's ms. ] this morning the <name> , by 10 , had subsided to an eight or nine  knot breeze , ( for a vessel at sea , ) and bears us , perhaps , thirty miles per hour , or more .
it has <unk> , however , very considerably to the north ; and now , at sundown , we are holding our course due west , principally by the screw and rudder , which answer their purposes to admiration .
i regard the project as thoroughly successful , and the easy navigation of the air in any direction ( not exactly in the teeth of a <name> ) as no longer <unk> .
we could not have made head against the strong wind of yesterday ; but , by ascending , we might have got out of its influence , if requisite .
against a pretty stiff breeze , i feel convinced , we can make our way with the propeller .
at noon , to-day , ascended to an elevation of nearly 25,000 feet , by discharging ballast .
did this to search for a more direct current , but found none so favorable as the one we are now in .
we have an abundance of gas to take us across this small pond , even should the voyage last three weeks .
i have not the slightest fear for the result .
the difficulty has been strangely exaggerated and <unk> .
i can choose my current , and should i find all currents against me , i can make very tolerable headway with the propeller .
we have had no incidents worth recording .
the night promises fair .
p.s .
[ by mr .
ainsworth . ]
i have little to record , except the fact ( to me quite a surprising one ) that , at an elevation equal to that of <unk> , i experienced neither very intense cold , nor headache , nor difficulty of breathing ; neither , i find , did mr. <name> , nor mr. holland , nor sir <unk> .
mr. osborne complained of <unk> of the chest  but this soon wore off .
we have flown at a great rate during the day , and we must be more than half way across the atlantic .
we have passed over some twenty or thirty vessels of various kinds , and all seem to be delightfully astonished .
crossing the ocean in a balloon is not so difficult a feat after all .
<unk> <unk> pro <unk> .
mem :  at 25,000 feet elevation the sky appears nearly black , and the stars are distinctly visible ; while the sea does not seem convex ( as one might suppose ) but absolutely and most unequivocally concave .
( *1 ) " monday , the 8th .
[ mr. <name> 's ms. ] this morning we had again some little trouble with the <name> of the propeller , which must be entirely <unk> , for fear of serious accident  i mean the steel <name>  not the vanes .
the latter could not be improved .
the wind has been blowing steadily and strongly from the north-east all day and so far fortune seems bent upon <unk> us .
just before day , we were all somewhat alarmed at some odd noises and <unk> in the balloon , accompanied with the apparent rapid subsidence of the whole machine .
these phenomena were occasioned by the expansion of the gas , through increase of heat in the atmosphere , and the consequent <unk> of the minute particles of ice with which the network had become encrusted during the night .
threw down several bottles to the vessels below .
saw one of them picked up by a large ship  seemingly one of the new york line packets .
endeavored to make out her name , but could not be sure of it .
mr. osborne 's telescope made it out something like " <unk> . "
it is now 12 , at night , and we are still going nearly west , at a rapid pace .
the sea is peculiarly phosphorescent .
" p.s .
[ by mr .
ainsworth . ]
it is now 2 , a.m. , and nearly calm , as well as i can judge  but it is very difficult to determine this point , since we move with the air so completely .
i have not slept since quitting <unk> , but can stand it no longer , and must take a nap .
we can not be far from the american coast .
" tuesday , the <unk> .
[ mr. ainsworth 's ms. ] one , p.m. we are in full view of the low coast of south <name> .
the great problem is accomplished .
we have crossed the atlantic  fairly and easily crossed it in a balloon !
god be praised !
who shall say that anything is impossible hereafter ? "
the journal here ceases .
some particulars of the descent were communicated , however , by mr. ainsworth to mr. forsyth .
it was nearly dead calm when the voyagers first came in view of the coast , which was immediately recognized by both the seamen , and by mr. osborne .
the latter gentleman having acquaintances at fort moultrie , it was immediately resolved to descend in its vicinity .
the balloon was brought over the beach ( the tide being out and the sand hard , smooth , and admirably adapted for a descent , ) and the grapnel let go , which took firm hold at once .
the inhabitants of the island , and of the fort , thronged out , of course , to see the balloon ; but it was with the greatest difficulty that any one could be made to credit the actual voyage  the crossing of the atlantic .
the grapnel caught at 2 , p.m. , precisely ; and thus the whole voyage was completed in seventy-five hours ; or rather less , counting from shore to shore .
no serious accident occurred .
no real danger was at any time apprehended .
the balloon was exhausted and secured without trouble ; and when the ms. from which this narrative is compiled was despatched from charleston , the party were still at fort moultrie .
their farther intentions were not ascertained ; but we can safely promise our readers some additional information either on monday or in the course of the next day , at farthest .
this is unquestionably the most stupendous , the most interesting , and the most important undertaking , ever accomplished or even attempted by man .
what magnificent events may ensue , it would be useless now to think of determining .
( *1 ) <unk>  mr .
ainsworth has not attempted to account for this phenomenon , which , however , is quite susceptible of explanation .
a line dropped from an elevation of 25,000 feet , perpendicularly to the surface of the earth ( or sea ) , would form the perpendicular of a <unk> triangle , of which the base would extend from the right <name> to the horizon , and the <unk> from the horizon to the balloon .
but the 25,000 feet of altitude is little or nothing , in comparison with the extent of the prospect .
in other words , the base and <unk> of the supposed triangle would be so long when compared with the perpendicular , that the two former may be regarded as nearly parallel .
in this manner the horizon of the <unk> would appear to be on a level with the car .
but , as the point immediately beneath him seems , and is , at a great distance below him , it seems , of course , also , at a great distance below the horizon .
hence the impression of concavity ; and this impression must remain , until the elevation shall bear so great a proportion to the extent of prospect , that the apparent parallelism of the base and <unk> disappears  when the earth 's real <unk> must become apparent .
ms. found in a bottle qui <unk> plus <unk> moment a <unk> <unk> plus <unk> a <unk> .
 <unk>  <unk> .
of my country and of my family i have little to say .
ill usage and length of years have driven me from the one , and <unk> me from the other .
hereditary wealth afforded me an education of no common order , and a contemplative turn of mind enabled me to <unk> the stores which early study very diligently garnered <unk>  beyond all things , the study of the <name> <unk> gave me great delight ; not from any <unk> admiration of their eloquent madness , but from the ease with which my habits of rigid thought enabled me to detect their <unk> .
i have often been reproached with the <unk> of my genius ; a deficiency of imagination has been <unk> to me as a crime ; and the <unk> of my opinions has at all times rendered me notorious .
indeed , a strong relish for physical philosophy has , i fear , <unk> my mind with a very common error of this age  i mean the habit of referring occurrences , even the least susceptible of such reference , to the principles of that science .
upon the whole , no person could be less liable than myself to be led away from the severe precincts of truth by the <unk> <unk> of superstition .
i have thought proper to premise thus much , lest the incredible tale i have to tell should be considered rather the raving of a crude imagination , than the positive experience of a mind to which the reveries of fancy have been a dead letter and a <unk> .
after many years spent in foreign travel , i sailed in the year 18  , from the port of <unk> , in the <name> and populous island of java , on a voyage to the archipelago of the <unk> islands .
i went as passenger  having no other inducement than a kind of nervous restlessness which haunted me as a fiend .
our vessel was a beautiful ship of about four hundred tons , <unk> , and built at bombay of <unk> teak .
she was freighted with <unk> and oil , from the <unk> islands .
we had also on board <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and a few cases of opium .
the stowage was clumsily done , and the vessel consequently crank .
we got under way with a mere breath of wind , and for many days stood along the eastern coast of java , without any other incident to beguile the monotony of our course than the occasional meeting with some of the small <unk> of the archipelago to which we were bound .
one evening , leaning over the <unk> , i observed a very singular , isolated cloud , to the n.w .
it was remarkable , as well for its color , as from its being the first we had seen since our departure from <unk> .
i watched it attentively until sunset , when it spread all at once to the eastward and westward , <unk> in the horizon with a narrow strip of vapor , and looking like a long line of low beach .
my notice was soon afterwards attracted by the <unk> appearance of the moon , and the peculiar character of the sea .
the latter was undergoing a rapid change , and the water seemed more than usually transparent .
although i could distinctly see the bottom , yet , heaving the lead , i found the ship in fifteen fathoms .
the air now became intolerably hot , and was loaded with spiral <unk> similar to those arising from heat iron .
as night came on , every breath of wind died away , an more entire calm it is impossible to conceive .
the flame of a candle burned upon the poop without the least perceptible motion , and a long hair , held between the finger and thumb , <name> without the possibility of detecting a vibration .
however , as the captain said he could perceive no indication of danger , and as we were drifting in bodily to shore , he ordered the sails to be furled , and the anchor let go .
no watch was set , and the crew , consisting principally of malays , stretched themselves deliberately upon deck .
i went below  not without a full presentiment of evil .
indeed , every appearance warranted me in <unk> a <unk> .
i told the captain my fears ; but he paid no attention to what i said , and left me without <unk> to give a reply .
my uneasiness , however , prevented me from sleeping , and about midnight i went upon <unk>  as i placed my foot upon the upper step of the <unk> , i was startled by a loud , humming noise , like that occasioned by the rapid revolution of a <unk> , and before i could ascertain its meaning , i found the ship quivering to its centre .
in the next instant , a wilderness of foam hurled us upon our <unk> , and , rushing over us fore and aft , swept the entire decks from stem to stern .
the extreme fury of the blast proved , in a great measure , the salvation of the ship .
although completely <unk> , yet , as her masts had gone by the board , she rose , after a minute , heavily from the sea , and , staggering awhile beneath the immense pressure of the tempest , finally righted .
by what miracle i escaped destruction , it is impossible to say .
stunned by the shock of the water , i found myself , upon recovery , jammed in between the <unk> and rudder .
with great difficulty i gained my feet , and looking dizzily around , was , at first , struck with the idea of our being among breakers ; so terrific , beyond the wildest imagination , was the whirlpool of mountainous and foaming ocean within which we were engulfed .
after a while , i heard the voice of an old swede , who had shipped with us at the moment of our leaving port .
i <unk> to him with all my strength , and presently he came reeling aft .
we soon discovered that we were the sole survivors of the accident .
all on deck , with the exception of ourselves , had been swept overboard ;  the captain and mates must have perished as they slept , for the cabins were <unk> with water .
without assistance , we could expect to do little for the security of the ship , and our exertions were at first paralyzed by the momentary expectation of going down .
our cable had , of course , parted like <unk> , at the first breath of the hurricane , or we should have been instantaneously overwhelmed .
we <unk> with frightful velocity before the sea , and the water made clear breaches over us .
the <unk> of our stern was shattered excessively , and , in almost every respect , we had received considerable injury ; but to our extreme <name> we found the pumps <unk> , and that we had made no great shifting of our ballast .
the main fury of the blast had already blown over , and we apprehended little danger from the violence of the wind ; but we looked forward to its total cessation with dismay ; well believing , that , in our shattered condition , we should inevitably perish in the tremendous swell which would ensue .
but this very just apprehension seemed by no means likely to be soon verified .
for five entire days and nights  during which our only subsistence was a small quantity of <unk> , procured with great difficulty from the forecastle  the hulk flew at a rate defying <unk> , before rapidly succeeding flaws of wind , which , without equalling the first violence of the <unk> , were still more terrific than any tempest i had before encountered .
our course for the first four days was , with trifling variations , s.e .
and by s. ; and we must have run down the coast of new <unk>  on the fifth day the cold became extreme , although the wind had hauled round a point more to the <unk>  the sun arose with a sickly yellow lustre , and clambered a very few degrees above the horizon  emitting no decisive <unk>  there were no clouds apparent , yet the wind was upon the increase , and blew with a fitful and unsteady fury .
about noon , as nearly as we could guess , our attention was again arrested by the appearance of the sun .
it gave out no light , properly so called , but a dull and sullen glow without reflection , as if all its rays were polarized .
just before sinking within the <unk> sea , its central fires suddenly went out , as if hurriedly extinguished by some unaccountable power .
it was a dim , <unk> rim , alone , as it rushed down the unfathomable ocean .
we waited in vain for the arrival of the sixth day  that day to me has not arrived  to the swede , never did arrive .
thenceforward we were enshrouded in <unk> darkness , so that we could not have seen an object at twenty paces from the ship .
eternal night continued to envelop us , all <unk> by the phosphoric <unk> to which we had been accustomed in the tropics .
we observed too , that , although the tempest continued to rage with <unk> violence , there was no longer to be discovered the usual appearance of surf , or foam , which had hitherto attended us .
all around were horror , and thick gloom , and a black sweltering desert of <unk>  superstitious terror crept by degrees into the spirit of the old swede , and my own soul was wrapped up in silent wonder .
we neglected all care of the ship , as worse than useless , and securing ourselves , as well as possible , to the stump of the <unk> , looked out bitterly into the world of ocean .
we had no means of calculating time , nor could we form any guess of our situation .
we were , however , well aware of having made farther to the southward than any previous navigators , and felt great amazement at not meeting with the usual <unk> of ice .
in the meantime every moment threatened to be our last  every mountainous <unk> hurried to overwhelm us .
the swell surpassed anything i had imagined possible , and that we were not instantly buried is a miracle .
my companion spoke of the lightness of our cargo , and reminded me of the excellent qualities of our ship ; but i could not help feeling the utter hopelessness of <name> itself , and prepared myself gloomily for that death which i thought nothing could defer beyond an hour , as , with every knot of way the ship made , the swelling of the black stupendous seas became more dismally appalling .
at times we gasped for breath at an elevation beyond the albatross  at times became dizzy with the velocity of our descent into some watery hell , where the air grew stagnant , and no sound disturbed the slumbers of the <unk> .
we were at the bottom of one of these abysses , when a quick scream from my companion broke fearfully upon the night .
" see !
see ! "
cried he , shrieking in my ears , " almighty god !
see !
see ! "
as he spoke , i became aware of a dull , sullen glare of red light which streamed down the sides of the vast chasm where we lay , and threw a fitful brilliancy upon our deck .
casting my eyes upwards , i beheld a spectacle which froze the current of my blood .
at a terrific height directly above us , and upon the very verge of the precipitous descent , hovered a gigantic ship of , perhaps , four thousand tons .
although <unk> upon the summit of a wave more than a hundred times her own altitude , her apparent size exceeded that of any ship of the line or east <unk> in existence .
her huge hull was of a deep dingy black , <unk> by any of the customary carvings of a ship .
a single row of brass cannon protruded from her open ports , and dashed from their polished surfaces the fires of innumerable <unk> , which swung to and fro about her rigging .
but what mainly inspired us with horror and astonishment , was that she bore up under a press of sail in the very teeth of that supernatural sea , and of that ungovernable hurricane .
when we first discovered her , her bows were alone to be seen , as she rose slowly from the dim and horrible gulf beyond her .
for a moment of intense terror she paused upon the giddy pinnacle , as if in contemplation of her own sublimity , then trembled and tottered , and  came down .
at this instant , i know not what sudden self-possession came over my spirit .
staggering as far aft as i could , i awaited fearlessly the ruin that was to overwhelm .
our own vessel was at length ceasing from her struggles , and sinking with her head to the sea .
the shock of the descending mass struck her , consequently , in that portion of her frame which was already under water , and the inevitable result was to hurl me , with irresistible violence , upon the rigging of the stranger .
as i fell , the ship hove in stays , and went about ; and to the confusion ensuing i attributed my escape from the notice of the crew .
with little difficulty i made my way unperceived to the main hatchway , which was partially open , and soon found an opportunity of secreting myself in the hold .
why i did so i can hardly tell .
an indefinite sense of awe , which at first sight of the navigators of the ship had taken hold of my mind , was perhaps the principle of my concealment .
i was unwilling to trust myself with a race of people who had offered , to the cursory glance i had taken , so many points of vague novelty , doubt , and apprehension .
i therefore thought proper to contrive a hiding-place in the hold .
this i did by removing a small portion of the <unk> , in such a manner as to afford me a convenient retreat between the huge timbers of the ship .
i had scarcely completed my work , when a footstep in the hold forced me to make use of it .
a man passed by my place of concealment with a feeble and unsteady gait .
i could not see his face , but had an opportunity of observing his general appearance .
there was about it an evidence of great age and infirmity .
his knees tottered beneath a load of years , and his entire frame quivered under the burthen .
he muttered to himself , in a low broken tone , some words of a language which i could not understand , and groped in a corner among a pile of <unk> instruments , and decayed charts of navigation .
his manner was a wild mixture of the <unk> of second childhood , and the solemn dignity of a god .
he at length went on deck , and i saw him no more .
* * * * * a feeling , for which i have no name , has taken possession of my soul  a sensation which <name> admit of no analysis , to which the lessons of bygone times are inadequate , and for which i fear futurity itself <name> offer me no key .
to a mind constituted like my own , the latter consideration is an evil .
i shall never  i know that i shall never  be satisfied with regard to the nature of my conceptions .
yet it is not wonderful that these conceptions are indefinite , since they have their origin in sources so utterly novel .
a new sense  a new entity is added to my soul .
* * * * * it is long since i first trod the deck of this terrible ship , and the rays of my <name> are , i think , gathering to a focus .
incomprehensible men !
wrapped up in meditations of a kind which i can not divine , they pass me by unnoticed .
concealment is utter folly on my part , for the people <name> not see .
it was but just now that i passed directly before the eyes of the mate  it was no long while ago that i ventured into the captain 's own private cabin , and took thence the materials with which i write , and have written .
i shall from time to time continue this journal .
it is true that i may not find an opportunity of transmitting it to the world , but i <name> not fall to make the endeavour .
at the last moment i <name> enclose the ms. in a bottle , and cast it within the sea .
* * * * * an incident has occurred which has given me new room for meditation .
are such things the operation of <unk> chance ?
i had ventured upon deck and thrown myself down , without attracting any notice , among a pile of <unk> and old sails in the bottom of the yawl .
while musing upon the <unk> of my fate , i unwittingly <unk> with a <unk> the edges of a <unk> <unk> which lay near me on a barrel .
the <unk> is now bent upon the ship , and the thoughtless touches of the brush are spread out into the word discovery .
i have made many observations lately upon the structure of the vessel .
although well armed , she is not , i think , a ship of war .
her rigging , build , and general equipment , all negative a supposition of this kind .
what she is not , i can easily perceive  what she is i fear it is impossible to say .
i know not how it is , but in scrutinizing her strange model and singular cast of spars , her huge size and overgrown suits of canvas , her severely simple bow and <unk> stern , there <name> occasionally flash across my mind a sensation of familiar things , and there is always mixed up with such indistinct shadows of recollection , an unaccountable memory of old foreign chronicles and ages long ago .
* * * * * i have been looking at the timbers of the ship .
she is built of a material to which i am a stranger .
there is a peculiar character about the wood which strikes me as rendering it unfit for the purpose to which it has been applied .
i mean its extreme <unk> , considered independently by the <unk> condition which is a consequence of navigation in these seas , and apart from the <unk> attendant upon age .
it <name> appear perhaps an observation somewhat <unk> , but this wood would have every characteristic of spanish oak , if spanish oak were distended by any unnatural means .
in reading the above sentence a curious <unk> of an old weather-beaten dutch navigator comes full upon my recollection .
" it is as sure , " he was wont to say , when any doubt was entertained of his veracity , " as sure as there is a sea where the ship itself <name> grow in bulk like the living body of the seaman . "
* * * * * about an hour ago , i made bold to thrust myself among a group of the crew .
they paid me no manner of attention , and , although i stood in the very midst of them all , seemed utterly unconscious of my presence .
like the one i had at first seen in the hold , they all bore about them the marks of a hoary old age .
their knees trembled with infirmity ; their shoulders were bent double with <unk> ; their shrivelled skins rattled in the wind ; their voices were low , tremulous and broken ; their eyes glistened with the <unk> of years ; and their gray hairs streamed terribly in the tempest .
around them , on every part of the deck , lay scattered mathematical instruments of the most quaint and obsolete construction .
* * * * * i mentioned some time ago the bending of a <unk> .
from that period the ship , being thrown dead off the wind , has continued her terrific course due south , with every rag of canvas packed upon her , from her trucks to her lower <unk> booms , and rolling every moment her <unk> <unk> into the most appalling hell of water which it can enter into the mind of a man to imagine .
i have just left the deck , where i find it impossible to maintain a footing , although the crew seem to experience little inconvenience .
it appears to me a miracle of miracles that our enormous bulk is not swallowed up at once and forever .
we are surely doomed to hover continually upon the brink of eternity , without taking a final plunge into the abyss .
from billows a thousand times more stupendous than any i have ever seen , we glide away with the facility of the <unk> <unk> ; and the colossal waters rear their heads above us like demons of the deep , but like demons confined to simple threats and forbidden to destroy .
i am led to attribute these frequent escapes to the only natural cause which can account for such <unk>  i must suppose the ship to be within the influence of some strong current , or impetuous <unk> .
* * * * * i have seen the captain face to face , and in his own cabin  but , as i expected , he paid me no attention .
although in his appearance there is , to a casual observer , nothing which might <unk> him more or less than <unk> a feeling of irrepressible reverence and awe mingled with the sensation of wonder with which i regarded him .
in stature he is nearly my own height ; that is , about five feet eight inches .
he is of a <unk> and compact frame of body , neither robust nor remarkably otherwise .
but it is the <unk> of the expression which reigns upon the face  it is the intense , the wonderful , the thrilling evidence of old age , so utter , so extreme , which excites within my spirit a sense  a sentiment ineffable .
his forehead , although little wrinkled , seems to bear upon it the stamp of a myriad of <unk>  his gray hairs are records of the past , and his <unk> eyes are <unk> of the future .
the cabin floor was thickly strewn with strange , <unk> <unk> , and mouldering instruments of science , and obsolete long-forgotten charts .
his head was bowed down upon his hands , and he <unk> , with a fiery unquiet eye , over a paper which i took to be a commission , and which , at all events , bore the signature of a monarch .
he muttered to himself , as did the first seaman whom i saw in the hold , some low <unk> syllables of a foreign tongue , and although the speaker was close at my elbow , his voice seemed to reach my ears from the distance of a mile .
* * * * * the ship and all in it are imbued with the spirit of <unk> .
the crew glide to and fro like the ghosts of buried centuries ; their eyes have an eager and uneasy meaning ; and when their fingers fall athwart my path in the wild glare of the <unk> , i feel as i have never felt before , although i have been all my life a dealer in antiquities , and have imbibed the shadows of fallen columns at <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , until my very soul has become a ruin .
* * * * * when i look around me i feel ashamed of my former apprehensions .
if i trembled at the blast which has hitherto attended us , shall i not stand aghast at a warring of wind and ocean , to convey any idea of which the words tornado and <unk> are trivial and <unk> ?
all in the immediate vicinity of the ship is the blackness of eternal night , and a chaos of <unk> water ; but , about a league on either side of us , may be seen , indistinctly and at intervals , stupendous ramparts of ice , towering away into the desolate sky , and looking like the walls of the universe .
* * * * * as i imagined , the ship proves to be in a current ; if that appellation can properly be given to a tide which , howling and shrieking by the white ice , thunders on to the southward with a velocity like the headlong dashing of a cataract .
* * * * * to conceive the horror of my sensations is , i presume , utterly impossible ; yet a curiosity to penetrate the mysteries of these awful regions , <unk> even over my despair , and <name> reconcile me to the most hideous aspect of death .
it is evident that we are hurrying onwards to some exciting knowledge  some <unk> secret , whose attainment is destruction .
perhaps this current leads us to the southern pole itself .
it must be confessed that a supposition apparently so wild has every probability in its favor .
* * * * * the crew pace the deck with unquiet and tremulous step ; but there is upon their countenances an expression more of the eagerness of <name> than of the apathy of despair .
in the meantime the wind is still in our poop , and , as we <name> a crowd of canvas , the ship is at times lifted bodily from out the sea  oh , horror upon horror !
the ice opens suddenly to the right , and to the left , and we are whirling dizzily , in immense concentric circles , round and round the borders of a gigantic amphitheatre , the summit of whose walls is lost in the darkness and the distance .
but little time <name> be left me to ponder upon my <name>  the circles rapidly grow small  we are plunging madly within the grasp of the whirlpool  and amid a roaring , and bellowing , and thundering of ocean and of tempest , the ship is quivering , oh god !
and  going down .
note.  the " ms. found in a bottle , " was originally published in 1831 , and it was not until many years afterwards that i became acquainted with the maps of <unk> , in which the ocean is represented as rushing , by four mouths , into the ( northern ) polar gulf , to be absorbed into the bowels of the earth ; the pole itself being represented by a black rock , towering to a prodigious height .
the oval portrait the chateau into which my valet had ventured to make forcible entrance , rather than permit me , in my desperately wounded condition , to pass a night in the open air , was one of those piles of commingled gloom and grandeur which have so long frowned among the <unk> , not less in fact than in the fancy of mrs. <unk> .
to all appearance it had been temporarily and very lately abandoned .
we established ourselves in one of the smallest and least sumptuously furnished apartments .
it lay in a remote turret of the building .
its decorations were <name> , yet tattered and antique .
its walls were <name> with tapestry and <unk> with manifold and multiform <unk> trophies , together with an unusually great number of very spirited modern paintings in frames of <name> golden <unk> .
in these paintings , which depended from the walls not only in their main surfaces , but in very many nooks which the bizarre architecture of the chateau rendered necessary  in these paintings my incipient delirium , perhaps , had caused me to take deep interest ; so that i bade <name> to close the heavy shutters of the room  since it was already night  to light the tongues of a tall <unk> which stood by the head of my bed  and to throw open far and wide the fringed curtains of black <name> which enveloped the bed itself .
i wished all this done that i might resign myself , if not to sleep , at least alternately to the contemplation of these pictures , and the perusal of a small volume which had been found upon the pillow , and which <unk> to criticise and describe them .
long  long i read  and devoutly , <unk> i gazed .
rapidly and gloriously the hours flew by and the deep midnight came .
the position of the <unk> displeased me , and <unk> my hand with difficulty , rather than disturb my slumbering valet , i placed it so as to throw its rays more fully upon the book .
but the action produced an effect altogether <unk> .
the rays of the numerous candles ( for there were many ) now fell within a niche of the room which had hitherto been thrown into deep shade by one of the <unk> .
i thus saw in vivid light a picture all unnoticed before .
it was the portrait of a young girl just ripening into womanhood .
i glanced at the painting hurriedly , and then closed my eyes .
why i did this was not at first apparent even to my own perception .
but while my lids remained thus shut , i ran over in my mind my reason for so shutting them .
it was an impulsive movement to gain time for thought  to make sure that my vision had not deceived me  to calm and subdue my fancy for a more sober and more certain gaze .
in a very few moments i again looked fixedly at the painting .
that i now saw aright i could not and would not doubt ; for the first flashing of the candles upon that canvas had seemed to <unk> the dreamy stupor which was stealing over my senses , and to startle me at once into waking life .
the portrait , i have already said , was that of a young girl .
it was a mere head and shoulders , done in what is technically termed a <unk> manner ; much in the style of the favorite heads of sully .
the arms , the bosom , and even the ends of the radiant hair melted imperceptibly into the vague yet deep shadow which formed the <unk> of the whole .
the frame was oval , richly gilded and <unk> in <unk> .
as a thing of <name> nothing could be more admirable than the painting itself .
but it could have been neither the execution of the work , nor the immortal beauty of the countenance , which had so suddenly and so vehemently moved me .
least of all , could it have been that my fancy , shaken from its half slumber , had mistaken the head for that of a living person .
i saw at once that the peculiarities of the design , of the <unk> , and of the frame , must have instantly dispelled such idea  must have prevented even its momentary entertainment .
thinking earnestly upon these points , i remained , for an hour perhaps , half sitting , half reclining , with my vision riveted upon the portrait .
at length , satisfied with the true secret of its effect , i fell back within the bed .
i had found the spell of the picture in an absolute <unk> of expression , which , at first startling , finally confounded , subdued , and appalled me .
with deep and reverent awe i replaced the <unk> in its former position .
the cause of my deep agitation being thus shut from view , i sought eagerly the volume which discussed the paintings and their histories .
turning to the number which designated the oval portrait , i there read the vague and quaint words which follow : " she was a maiden of rarest beauty , and not more lovely than full of glee .
and evil was the hour when she saw , and loved , and wedded the painter .
he , passionate , studious , austere , and having already a bride in his <name> ; she a maiden of rarest beauty , and not more lovely than full of glee ; all light and smiles , and <unk> as the young <name> ; loving and <unk> all things ; hating only the <name> which was her rival ; dreading only the pallet and brushes and other untoward instruments which deprived her of the countenance of her lover .
it was thus a terrible thing for this <name> to hear the painter speak of his <name> to portray even his young bride .
but she was humble and obedient , and sat meekly for many weeks in the dark , high <unk> where the light dripped upon the pale canvas only from overhead .
but he , the painter , took <name> in his work , which went on from hour to hour , and from day to day .
and he was a passionate , and wild , and moody man , who became lost in reveries ; so that he would not see that the light which fell so ghastly in that lone turret withered the health and the spirits of his bride , who pined visibly to all but him .
yet she smiled on and still on , <unk> , because she saw that the painter ( who had high renown ) took a <unk> and burning pleasure in his task , and wrought day and night to <unk> her who so loved him , yet who grew daily more <unk> and weak .
and in sooth some who beheld the portrait spoke of its resemblance in low words , as of a mighty <name> , and a proof not less of the power of the painter than of his deep love for her whom he depicted so <unk> well .
but at length , as the labor <name> nearer to its conclusion , there were admitted none into the turret ; for the painter had grown wild with the ardor of his work , and turned his eyes from canvas merely , even to regard the countenance of his wife .
and he would not see that the tints which he spread upon the canvas were drawn from the cheeks of her who sate beside him .
and when many weeks had passed , and but little remained to do , save one brush upon the mouth and one tint upon the eye , the spirit of the <name> again flickered up as the flame within the socket of the lamp .
and then the brush was given , and then the tint was placed ; and , for one moment , the painter stood entranced before the work which he had wrought ; but in the next , while he yet gazed , he grew tremulous and very pallid , and aghast , and crying with a loud voice , 'this is indeed life itself ! '
turned suddenly to regard his beloved :  she was dead ! "

seneca .
at <name> , just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of 18 , i was enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and a <unk> , in company with my friend c. auguste dupin , in his little back library , or <unk> , au <unk> , no .
33 , rue <unk> , <unk> st. germain .
for one hour at least we had maintained a profound silence ; while each , to any casual observer , might have seemed intently and exclusively occupied with the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the chamber .
for myself , however , i was mentally discussing certain topics which had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier period of the evening ; i mean the affair of the rue morgue , and the mystery attending the murder of <name> rogêt .
i looked upon it , therefore , as something of a coincidence , when the door of our apartment was thrown open and admitted our old acquaintance , monsieur g  , the prefect of the parisian police .
we gave him a hearty welcome ; for there was nearly half as much of the entertaining as of the contemptible about the man , and we had not seen him for several years .
we had been sitting in the dark , and dupin now arose for the purpose of lighting a lamp , but sat down again , without doing so , upon g. 's saying that he had called to consult us , or rather to ask the opinion of my friend , about some official business which had occasioned a great deal of trouble .
" if it is any point requiring reflection , " observed dupin , as he <unk> to <unk> the wick , " we shall examine it to better purpose in the dark . "
" that is another of your odd notions , " said the prefect , who had a fashion of calling every thing " odd " that was beyond his comprehension , and thus lived amid an absolute legion of " oddities . "
" very true , " said dupin , as he supplied his visiter with a pipe , and rolled towards him a comfortable chair .
" and what is the difficulty now ? "
i asked .
" nothing more in the assassination way , i <name> ? "
" oh no ; nothing of that nature .
the fact is , the business is very simple indeed , and i make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently well ourselves ; but then i thought dupin would like to hear the details of it , because it is so excessively odd . "
" simple and odd , " said dupin .
" why , yes ; and not exactly that , either .
the fact is , we have all been a good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple , and yet <unk> us altogether . "
" perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at fault , " said my friend .
" what nonsense you do talk ! "
replied the prefect , laughing heartily .
" perhaps the mystery is a little too plain , " said dupin .
" oh , good heavens !
who ever heard of such an idea ? "
" a little too self-evident . "
" <name> !
<name> !
<name>  <name> !
<name> !
<name> !  ho !
ho !
ho ! "
roared our visiter , profoundly amused , " oh , dupin , you <name> be the death of me yet ! "
" and what , after all , is the matter on hand ? "
i asked .
" why , i <name> tell you , " replied the prefect , as he gave a long , steady and contemplative puff , and settled himself in his chair .
" i <name> tell you in a few words ; but , before i begin , let me caution you that this is an affair demanding the greatest secrecy , and that i should most probably lose the position i now hold , were it known that i confided it to any one . "
" proceed , " said i .
" or not , " said dupin .
" well , then ; i have received personal information , from a very high quarter , that a certain document of the last importance , has been <unk> from the <name> apartments .
the individual who <unk> it is known ; this beyond a doubt ; he was seen to take it .
it is known , also , that it still remains in his possession . "
" how is this known ? "
asked dupin .
" it is clearly inferred , " replied the prefect , " from the nature of the document , and from the <unk> of certain results which would at once arise from its passing out of the robber 's possession ; that is to say , from his employing it as he must design in the end to employ it . "
" be a little more explicit , " i said .
" well , i may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holder a certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immensely valuable . "
the prefect was fond of the cant of diplomacy .
" still i do not quite understand , " said dupin .
" no ?
well ; the disclosure of the document to a third person , who shall be nameless , would bring in question the honor of a personage of most exalted station ; and this fact gives the holder of the document an ascendancy over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are so <unk> . "
" but this ascendancy , " i interposed , " would depend upon the <unk> knowledge of the loser 's knowledge of the robber .
who would dare  " " the thief , " said g. , " is the minister d  , who dares all things , those unbecoming as well as those becoming a man .
the method of the theft was not less ingenious than bold .
the document in question  a letter , to be <name>  had been received by the personage robbed while alone in the <name> boudoir .
during its perusal she was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of the other exalted personage from whom especially it was her wish to conceal it .
after a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in a drawer , she was forced to place it , open as it was , upon a table .
the address , however , was uppermost , and , the contents thus <unk> , the letter escaped notice .
at this juncture enters the minister d  .
his lynx eye immediately perceives the paper , <unk> the handwriting of the address , observes the confusion of the personage addressed , and fathoms her secret .
after some business transactions , hurried through in his ordinary manner , he produces a letter somewhat similar to the one in question , opens it , pretends to read it , and then places it in close <unk> to the other .
again he <unk> , for some fifteen minutes , upon the public affairs .
at length , in taking leave , he takes also from the table the letter to which he had no claim .
its rightful owner saw , but , of course , dared not call attention to the act , in the presence of the third personage who stood at her elbow .
the minister <unk> ; leaving his own letter  one of no importance  upon the table . "
" here , then , " said dupin to me , " you have precisely what you demand to make the ascendancy complete  the robber 's knowledge of the <unk> knowledge of the robber . "
" yes , " replied the prefect ; " and the power thus attained has , for some months past , been wielded , for political purposes , to a very dangerous extent .
the personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced , every day , of the necessity of <unk> her letter .
but this , of course , can not be done openly .
in fine , driven to despair , she has committed the matter to me . "
" than whom , " said dupin , amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke , " no more sagacious agent could , i suppose , be desired , or even imagined . "
" you flatter me , " replied the prefect ; " but it is possible that some such opinion may have been entertained . "
" it is clear , " said i , " as you observe , that the letter is still in possession of the minister ; since it is this possession , and not any employment of the letter , which <unk> the power .
with the employment the power departs . "
" true , " said g. ; " and upon this conviction i proceeded .
my first care was to make thorough search of the minister 's hotel ; and here my chief embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his knowledge .
beyond all things , i have been warned of the danger which would result from giving him reason to suspect our design . "
" but , " said i , " you are quite au fait in these investigations .
the parisian police have done this thing often before . "
" o yes ; and for this reason i did not despair .
the habits of the minister gave me , too , a great advantage .
he is frequently absent from home all night .
his servants are by no means numerous .
they sleep at a distance from their master 's apartment , and , being chiefly <unk> , are readily made drunk .
i have keys , as you know , with which i can open any chamber or cabinet in <name> .
for three months a night has not passed , during the greater part of which i have not been engaged , personally , in <unk> the d  hotel .
my honor is interested , and , to mention a great secret , the reward is enormous .
so i did not abandon the search until i had become fully satisfied that the thief is a more astute man than myself .
i fancy that i have investigated every nook and corner of the premises in which it is possible that the paper can be concealed . "
" but is it not possible , " i suggested , " that although the letter may be in possession of the minister , as it unquestionably is , he may have concealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises ? "
" this is barely possible , " said dupin .
" the present peculiar condition of affairs at court , and especially of those intrigues in which d  is known to be involved , would render the instant <unk> of the document  its susceptibility of being produced at a moment 's notice  a point of nearly equal importance with its possession . "
" its susceptibility of being produced ? "
said i .
" that is to say , of being destroyed , " said dupin .
" true , " i observed ; " the paper is clearly then upon the premises .
as for its being upon the person of the minister , we may consider that as out of the question . "
" entirely , " said the prefect .
" he has been twice waylaid , as if by <unk> , and his person rigorously searched under my own inspection . "
" you might have spared yourself this trouble , " said dupin .
" d  , i presume , is not altogether a fool , and , if not , must have anticipated these <unk> , as a matter of course . "
" not altogether a fool , " said g. , " but then he 's a poet , which i take to be only one remove from a fool . "
" true , " said dupin , after a long and thoughtful whiff from his <unk> , " although i have been guilty of certain <unk> myself . "
" suppose you detail , " said i , " the particulars of your search . "
" why the fact is , we took our time , and we searched every where .
i have had long experience in these affairs .
i took the entire building , room by room ; devoting the nights of a whole week to each .
we examined , first , the furniture of each apartment .
we opened every possible drawer ; and i presume you know that , to a properly trained police agent , such a thing as a secret drawer is impossible .
any man is a dolt who permits a <unk> ' drawer to escape him in a search of this kind .
the thing is so plain .
there is a certain amount of bulk  of space  to be accounted for in every cabinet .
then we have accurate rules .
the fiftieth part of a line could not escape us .
after the cabinets we took the chairs .
the cushions we <unk> with the fine long needles you have seen me employ .
from the tables we removed the tops . "
" why so ? "
" sometimes the top of a table , or other similarly arranged piece of furniture , is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article ; then the leg is excavated , the article deposited within the cavity , and the top replaced .
the bottoms and tops of <unk> are employed in the same way . "
" but could not the cavity be detected by sounding ? "
i asked .
" by no means , if , when the article is deposited , a sufficient <unk> of cotton be placed around it .
besides , in our case , we were obliged to proceed without noise . "
" but you could not have removed  you could not have taken to pieces all articles of furniture in which it would have been possible to make a deposit in the manner you mention .
a letter may be compressed into a thin spiral roll , not differing much in shape or bulk from a large <unk> , and in this form it might be inserted into the rung of a chair , for example .
you did not take to pieces all the chairs ? "
" certainly not ; but we did better  we examined the <unk> of every chair in the hotel , and , indeed the <unk> of every description of furniture , by the aid of a most powerful microscope .
had there been any traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect it instantly .
a single grain of <unk> , for example , would have been as obvious as an apple .
any disorder in the <unk>  any unusual gaping in the joints  would have sufficed to insure detection . "
" i presume you looked to the mirrors , between the boards and the plates , and you <unk> the beds and the <unk> , as well as the curtains and carpets . "
" that of course ; and when we had absolutely completed every particle of the furniture in this way , then we examined the house itself .
we divided its entire surface into compartments , which we numbered , so that none might be missed ; then we scrutinized each individual square inch throughout the premises , including the two houses immediately adjoining , with the microscope , as before . "
" the two houses adjoining ! "
i exclaimed ; " you must have had a great deal of trouble . "
" we had ; but the reward offered is prodigious ! "
" you include the grounds about the houses ? "
" all the grounds are paved with brick .
they gave us comparatively little trouble .
we examined the moss between the bricks , and found it undisturbed . "
" you looked among d  's papers , of course , and into the books of the library ? "
" certainly ; we opened every package and parcel ; we not only opened every book , but we turned over every leaf in each volume , not contenting ourselves with a mere shake , according to the fashion of some of our police officers .
we also measured the thickness of every <unk> , with the most accurate <unk> , and applied to each the most jealous scrutiny of the microscope .
had any of the <unk> been recently meddled with , it would have been utterly impossible that the fact should have escaped observation .
some five or six volumes , just from the hands of the <unk> , we carefully <unk> , longitudinally , with the needles . "
" you explored the floors beneath the carpets ? "
" beyond doubt .
we removed every carpet , and examined the boards with the microscope . "
" and the paper on the walls ? "
" yes . "
" you looked into the cellars ? "
" we did . "
" then , " i said , " you have been making a <unk> , and the letter is not upon the premises , as you suppose . "
" i fear you are right there , " said the prefect .
" and now , dupin , what would you advise me to do ? "
" to make a thorough <unk> of the premises . "
" that is absolutely needless , " replied g  .
" i am not more sure that i breathe than i am that the letter is not at the hotel . "
" i have no better advice to give you , " said dupin .
" you have , of course , an accurate description of the letter ? "
" oh yes ! "
 and here the prefect , producing a <unk> proceeded to read aloud a minute account of the internal , and especially of the external appearance of the missing document .
soon after finishing the perusal of this description , he took his departure , more entirely depressed in spirits than i had ever known the good gentleman before .
in about a month afterwards he paid us another visit , and found us occupied very nearly as before .
he took a pipe and a chair and entered into some ordinary conversation .
at length i said ,  " well , but g  , what of the <unk> letter ?
i presume you have at last made up your mind that there is no such thing as <unk> the minister ? "
" confound him , say i  yes ; i made the <unk> , however , as dupin suggested  but it was all labor lost , as i knew it would be . "
" how much was the reward offered , did you say ? "
asked dupin .
" why , a very great deal  a very liberal reward  i do n't like to say how much , precisely ; but one thing i <name> say , that i would n't mind giving my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any one who could obtain me that letter .
the fact is , it is becoming of more and more importance every day ; and the reward has been lately doubled .
if it were <unk> , however , i could do no more than i have done . "
" why , yes , " said dupin , <unk> , between the whiffs of his <unk> , " i really  think , g  , you have not exerted yourself  to the utmost in this matter .
you might  do a little more , i think , eh ? "
" how ?  in what way ? '
" why  puff , puff  you might  puff , puff  employ counsel in the matter , eh ?  puff , puff , puff .
do you remember the story they tell of <unk> ? "
" no ; <name> <unk> ! "
" to be sure !
<name> him and welcome .
but , once upon a time , a certain <name> miser conceived the design of <unk> upon this <unk> for a medical opinion .
getting up , for this purpose , an ordinary conversation in a private company , he <unk> his case to the physician , as that of an imaginary individual .
" 'we <name> suppose , ' said the miser , 'that his symptoms are such and such ; now , doctor , what would you have directed him to take ? '
" 'take ! '
said <unk> , 'why , take advice , to be sure . ' "
" but , " said the prefect , a little <unk> , " i am perfectly willing to take advice , and to pay for it .
i would really give fifty thousand francs to any one who would aid me in the matter . "
" in that case , " replied dupin , opening a drawer , and producing a <unk> , " you may as well fill me up a check for the amount mentioned .
when you have signed it , i <name> hand you the letter . "
i was astounded .
the prefect appeared absolutely <unk> .
for some minutes he remained speechless and motionless , looking incredulously at my friend with open mouth , and eyes that seemed starting from their sockets ; then , apparently recovering himself in some measure , he seized a pen , and after several pauses and vacant stares , finally filled up and signed a check for fifty thousand francs , and handed it across the table to dupin .
the latter examined it carefully and deposited it in his pocket-book ; then , <unk> an <unk> , took thence a letter and gave it to the prefect .
this <unk> grasped it in a perfect agony of <name> , opened it with a trembling hand , cast a rapid glance at its contents , and then , scrambling and struggling to the door , rushed at length <unk> from the room and from the house , without having uttered a syllable since dupin had requested him to fill up the check .
when he had gone , my friend entered into some explanations .
" the parisian police , " he said , " are exceedingly able in their way .
they are persevering , ingenious , cunning , and thoroughly versed in the knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to demand .
thus , when g  detailed to us his mode of searching the premises at the hotel d  , i felt entire confidence in his having made a satisfactory investigation  so far as his labors extended . "
" so far as his labors extended ? "
said i .
" yes , " said dupin .
" the measures adopted were not only the best of their kind , but carried out to absolute perfection .
had the letter been deposited within the range of their search , these fellows would , beyond a question , have found it . "
i merely laughed  but he seemed quite serious in all that he said .
" the measures , then , " he continued , " were good in their kind , and well executed ; their defect lay in their being <unk> to the case , and to the man .
a certain set of highly ingenious resources are , with the prefect , a sort of <unk> bed , to which he forcibly <unk> his designs .
but he perpetually <unk> by being too deep or too shallow , for the matter in hand ; and many a schoolboy is a better <unk> than he .
i knew one about eight years of age , whose success at guessing in the game of 'even and odd ' attracted universal admiration .
this game is simple , and is played with marbles .
one player holds in his hand a number of these toys , and demands of another whether that number is even or odd .
if the guess is right , the <unk> wins one ; if wrong , he loses one .
the boy to whom i allude won all the marbles of the school .
of course he had some principle of guessing ; and this lay in mere observation and <unk> of the astuteness of his opponents .
for example , an <unk> simpleton is his opponent , and , holding up his closed hand , asks , 'are they even or odd ? '
our schoolboy replies , <unk> , ' and loses ; but upon the second trial he wins , for he then says to himself , 'the simpleton had them even upon the first trial , and his amount of cunning is just sufficient to make him have them odd upon the second ; i <name> therefore guess odd ; '  he guesses odd , and wins .
now , with a simpleton a degree above the first , he would have reasoned thus : 'this fellow finds that in the first instance i guessed odd , and , in the second , he <name> propose to himself , upon the first impulse , a simple variation from even to odd , as did the first simpleton ; but then a second thought <name> suggest that this is too simple a variation , and finally he <name> decide upon putting it even as before .
i <name> therefore guess even ; '  he guesses even , and wins .
now this mode of reasoning in the schoolboy , whom his fellows termed <unk> , '  what , in its last analysis , is it ? "
" it is merely , " i said , " an identification of the <unk> 's intellect with that of his opponent . "
" it is , " said dupin ; " and , upon inquiring , of the boy by what means he effected the thorough identification in which his success consisted , i received answer as follows : 'when i wish to find out how wise , or how stupid , or how good , or how wicked is any one , or what are his thoughts at the moment , i fashion the expression of my face , as accurately as possible , in accordance with the expression of his , and then wait to see what thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart , as if to match or correspond with the expression . '
this response of the schoolboy lies at the bottom of all the <unk> profundity which has been attributed to <unk> , to la <unk> , to machiavelli , and to <unk> . "
" and the identification , " i said , " of the <unk> 's intellect with that of his opponent , depends , if i understand you aright , upon the accuracy with which the opponent 's intellect is <unk> . "
" for its practical value it depends upon this , " replied dupin ; " and the prefect and his cohort fail so frequently , first , by default of this identification , and , secondly , by <unk> , or rather through <unk> , of the intellect with which they are engaged .
they consider only their own ideas of ingenuity ; and , in searching for anything hidden , <unk> only to the modes in which they would have hidden it .
they are right in this much  that their own ingenuity is a faithful representative of that of the mass ; but when the cunning of the individual <unk> is diverse in character from their own , the <unk> <unk> them , of course .
this always happens when it is above their own , and very usually when it is below .
they have no variation of principle in their investigations ; at best , when urged by some unusual emergency  by some extraordinary reward  they extend or exaggerate their old modes of practice , without touching their principles .
what , for example , in this case of d  , has been done to vary the principle of action ?
what is all this boring , and <unk> , and sounding , and scrutinizing with the microscope and dividing the surface of the building into registered square inches  what is it all but an exaggeration of the application of the one principle or set of principles of search , which are based upon the one set of notions regarding human ingenuity , to which the prefect , in the long routine of his duty , has been accustomed ?
do you not see he has taken it for granted that all men proceed to conceal a letter ,  not exactly in a <unk> hole bored in a <unk>  but , at least , in some out-of-the-way hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought which would urge a man to secrete a letter in a <unk> bored in a <unk> ?
and do you not see also , that such <unk> nooks for concealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions , and would be adopted only by ordinary intellects ; for , in all cases of concealment , a disposal of the article concealed  a disposal of it in this <unk> manner ,  is , in the very first instance , <unk> and presumed ; and thus its discovery depends , not at all upon the <unk> , but altogether upon the mere care , <name> , and determination of the seekers ; and where the case is of importance  or , what amounts to the same thing in the <unk> eyes , when the reward is of magnitude ,  the qualities in question have never been known to fail .
you <name> now understand what i meant in suggesting that , had the <unk> letter been hidden any where within the limits of the prefect 's examination  in other words , had the principle of its concealment been comprehended within the principles of the prefect  its discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond question .
this <unk> , however , has been thoroughly mystified ; and the remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the minister is a fool , because he has acquired renown as a poet .
all fools are poets ; this the prefect feels ; and he is merely guilty of a non <unk> <unk> in thence <unk> that all poets are fools . "
" but is this really the poet ? "
i asked .
" there are two brothers , i know ; and both have attained reputation in letters .
the minister i believe has written <unk> on the <unk> <unk> .
he is a mathematician , and no poet . "
" you are mistaken ; i know him well ; he is both .
as poet and mathematician , he would reason well ; as mere mathematician , he could not have reasoned at all , and thus would have been at the <name> of the prefect . "
" you surprise me , " i said , " by these opinions , which have been contradicted by the voice of the world .
you do not mean to set at naught the <unk> idea of centuries .
the mathematical reason has long been regarded as the reason par excellence . "
" <unk> y a à <unk> , ' " replied dupin , quoting from <unk> , " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> convention <unk> est une <unk> , car elle a <unk> au plus grand <unk> . '
the mathematicians , i <name> you , have done their best to <unk> the popular error to which you allude , and which is none the less an error for its <unk> as truth .
with an <name> worthy a better cause , for example , they have <unk> the term <unk> ' into application to algebra .
the french are the <unk> of this particular deception ; but if a term is of any importance  if words derive any value from <unk>  then <unk> ' conveys <unk> ' about as much as , in latin , <unk> ' implies <unk> , ' <unk> ' <unk> , ' or <unk> <unk> , ' a set of <unk> . "
" you have a quarrel on hand , i see , " said i , " with some of the <unk> of <name> ; but proceed . "
" i dispute the <unk> , and thus the value , of that reason which is cultivated in any especial form other than the <unk> logical .
i dispute , in particular , the reason <unk> by mathematical study .
the mathematics are the science of form and quantity ; mathematical reasoning is merely logic applied to observation upon form and quantity .
the great error lies in supposing that even the truths of what is called pure algebra , are abstract or general truths .
and this error is so <unk> that i am confounded at the universality with which it has been received .
mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth .
what is true of relation  of form and quantity  is often grossly false in regard to morals , for example .
in this latter science it is very usually untrue that the aggregated parts are equal to the whole .
in chemistry also the axiom fails .
in the consideration of motive it fails ; for two motives , each of a given value , have not , necessarily , a value when united , equal to the sum of their values apart .
there are numerous other mathematical truths which are only truths within the limits of relation .
but the mathematician argues , from his finite truths , through habit , as if they were of an absolutely general <unk>  as the world indeed imagines them to be .
<name> , in his very learned <unk> , ' mentions an analogous source of error , when he says that <unk> the pagan fables are not believed , yet we forget ourselves continually , and make inferences from them as existing realities . '
with the <unk> , however , who are pagans themselves , the <unk> fables ' are believed , and the inferences are made , not so much through lapse of memory , as through an unaccountable <unk> of the brains .
in short , i never yet encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal roots , or one who did not <unk> hold it as a point of his <name> that <unk> was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q .
say to one of these gentlemen , by way of experiment , if you please , that you believe occasions may occur where <unk> is not altogether equal to q , and , having made him understand what you mean , get out of his reach as speedily as convenient , for , beyond doubt , he <name> endeavor to knock you down .
" i mean to say , " continued dupin , while i merely laughed at his last observations , " that if the minister had been no more than a mathematician , the prefect would have been under no necessity of giving me this check .
i know him , however , as both mathematician and poet , and my measures were adapted to his capacity , with reference to the circumstances by which he was surrounded .
i knew him as a courtier , too , and as a bold <unk> .
such a man , i considered , could not fail to be aware of the ordinary <unk> modes of action .
he could not have failed to anticipate  and events have proved that he did not fail to anticipate  the <unk> to which he was subjected .
he must have foreseen , i reflected , the secret investigations of his premises .
his frequent <unk> from home at night , which were hailed by the prefect as certain aids to his success , i regarded only as <unk> , to afford opportunity for thorough search to the police , and thus the sooner to impress them with the conviction to which g  , in fact , did finally arrive  the conviction that the letter was not upon the premises .
i felt , also , that the whole train of thought , which i was at some pains in <unk> to you just now , concerning the invariable principle of <unk> action in searches for articles concealed  i felt that this whole train of thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the minister .
it would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary nooks of concealment .
he could not , i reflected , be so weak as not to see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would be as open as his commonest closets to the eyes , to the <unk> , to the <unk> , and to the <unk> of the prefect .
i saw , in fine , that he would be driven , as a matter of course , to simplicity , if not deliberately induced to it as a matter of choice .
you <name> remember , perhaps , how desperately the prefect laughed when i suggested , upon our first interview , that it was just possible this mystery troubled him so much on account of its being so very self-evident . "
" yes , " said i , " i remember his merriment well .
i really thought he would have fallen into convulsions . "
" the material world , " continued dupin , " abounds with very strict analogies to the immaterial ; and thus some color of truth has been given to the <unk> dogma , that metaphor , or simile , may be made to strengthen an argument , as well as to embellish a description .
the principle of the vis <unk> , for example , seems to be identical in physics and metaphysics .
it is not more true in the former , that a large body is with more difficulty set in motion than a smaller one , and that its subsequent momentum is commensurate with this difficulty , than it is , in the latter , that intellects of the vaster capacity , while more forcible , more constant , and more eventful in their movements than those of inferior grade , are yet the less readily moved , and more embarrassed and full of hesitation in the first few steps of their progress .
again : have you ever noticed which of the street signs , over the <unk> , are the most attractive of attention ? "
" i have never given the matter a thought , " i said .
" there is a game of puzzles , " he resumed , " which is played upon a map .
one party playing requires another to find a given word  the name of town , river , state or empire  any word , in short , upon the motley and perplexed surface of the chart .
a novice in the game generally seeks to embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered names ; but the <unk> selects such words as stretch , in large characters , from one end of the chart to the other .
these , like the <unk> lettered signs and <unk> of the street , escape observation by dint of being excessively obvious ; and here the physical oversight is precisely analogous with the moral <unk> by which the intellect suffers to pass unnoticed those considerations which are too <unk> and too palpably self-evident .
but this is a point , it appears , somewhat above or beneath the understanding of the prefect .
he never once thought it probable , or possible , that the minister had deposited the letter immediately beneath the nose of the whole world , by way of best preventing any portion of that world from perceiving it .
" but the more i reflected upon the daring , dashing , and discriminating ingenuity of d  ; upon the fact that the document must always have been at hand , if he intended to use it to good purpose ; and upon the decisive evidence , obtained by the prefect , that it was not hidden within the limits of that dignitary 's ordinary search  the more satisfied i became that , to conceal this letter , the minister had resorted to the comprehensive and sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it at all .
" full of these ideas , i prepared myself with a pair of green spectacles , and called one fine morning , quite by accident , at the <unk> hotel .
i found d  at home , yawning , lounging , and <unk> , as usual , and pretending to be in the last extremity of <unk> .
he is , perhaps , the most really energetic human being now alive  but that is only when nobody sees him .
" to be even with him , i complained of my weak eyes , and lamented the necessity of the spectacles , under cover of which i cautiously and thoroughly surveyed the whole apartment , while seemingly intent only upon the conversation of my host .
" i paid especial attention to a large writing-table near which he sat , and upon which lay confusedly , some miscellaneous letters and other papers , with one or two musical instruments and a few books .
here , however , after a long and very deliberate scrutiny , i saw nothing to excite particular suspicion .
" at length my eyes , in going the circuit of the room , fell upon a trumpery <unk> <unk> of pasteboard , that <name> dangling by a dirty blue ribbon , from a little brass knob just beneath the middle of the <unk> .
in this rack , which had three or four compartments , were five or six visiting cards and a solitary letter .
this last was much soiled and crumpled .
it was torn nearly in two , across the middle  as if a design , in the first instance , to tear it entirely up as worthless , had been altered , or stayed , in the second .
it had a large black seal , bearing the d  cipher very conspicuously , and was addressed , in a diminutive female hand , to d  , the minister , himself .
it was thrust carelessly , and even , as it seemed , contemptuously , into one of the uppermost divisions of the rack .
" no sooner had i glanced at this letter , than i concluded it to be that of which i was in search .
to be sure , it was , to all appearance , radically different from the one of which the prefect had read us so minute a description .
here the seal was large and black , with the d  cipher ; there it was small and red , with the ducal arms of the s  family .
here , the address , to the minister , diminutive and feminine ; there the <unk> , to a certain <name> personage , was <unk> bold and decided ; the size alone formed a point of correspondence .
but , then , the <unk> of these differences , which was excessive ; the dirt ; the soiled and torn condition of the paper , so inconsistent with the true methodical habits of d  , and so suggestive of a design to <unk> the beholder into an idea of the <unk> of the document ; these things , together with the <unk> situation of this document , full in the view of every visiter , and thus exactly in accordance with the conclusions to which i had previously arrived ; these things , i say , were strongly <unk> of suspicion , in one who came with the intention to suspect .
" i protracted my visit as long as possible , and , while i maintained a most animated discussion with the minister upon a topic which i knew well had never failed to interest and excite him , i kept my attention really riveted upon the letter .
in this examination , i committed to memory its external appearance and arrangement in the rack ; and also fell , at length , upon a discovery which set at rest whatever trivial doubt i might have entertained .
in scrutinizing the edges of the paper , i observed them to be more chafed than seemed necessary .
they presented the broken appearance which is manifested when a stiff paper , having been once folded and pressed with a <unk> , is <unk> in a reversed direction , in the same creases or edges which had formed the original fold .
this discovery was sufficient .
it was clear to me that the letter had been turned , as a glove , inside out , <unk> , and <unk> .
i bade the minister good morning , and took my departure at once , leaving a gold <unk> upon the table .
" the next morning i called for the <unk> , when we resumed , quite eagerly , the conversation of the preceding day .
while thus engaged , however , a loud report , as if of a pistol , was heard immediately beneath the windows of the hotel , and was succeeded by a series of fearful screams , and the shoutings of a terrified mob .
d  rushed to a casement , threw it open , and looked out .
in the meantime , i stepped to the <unk> took the letter , put it in my pocket , and replaced it by a <unk> , ( so far as regards <unk> , ) which i had carefully prepared at my lodgings  imitating the d  cipher , very readily , by means of a seal formed of bread .
" the disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic behavior of a man with a musket .
he had fired it among a crowd of women and children .
it proved , however , to have been without ball , and the fellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a drunkard .
when he had gone , d  came from the window , whither i had followed him immediately upon securing the object in view .
soon afterwards i bade him farewell .
the pretended lunatic was a man in my own pay . "
" but what purpose had you , " i asked , " in replacing the letter by a <unk> ?
would it not have been better , at the first visit , to have seized it openly , and departed ? "
" d  , " replied dupin , " is a desperate man , and a man of nerve .
his hotel , too , is not without attendants devoted to his interests .
had i made the wild attempt you suggest , i might never have left the <unk> presence alive .
the good people of <name> might have heard of me no more .
but i had an object apart from these considerations .
you know my political <unk> .
in this matter , i act as a partisan of the <name> concerned .
for eighteen months the minister has had her in his power .
she has now him in hers  since , being unaware that the letter is not in his possession , he <name> proceed with his exactions as if it was .
thus <name> he inevitably commit himself , at once , to his political destruction .
his downfall , too , <name> not be more precipitate than awkward .
it is all very well to talk about the <unk> <unk> <unk> ; but in all kinds of climbing , as <unk> said of singing , it is far more easy to get up than to come down .
in the present instance i have no sympathy  at least no pity  for him who descends .
he is that <unk> <unk> , an unprincipled man of genius .
i confess , however , that i should like very well to know the precise character of his thoughts , when , being defied by her whom the prefect terms 'a certain <unk> he is reduced to opening the letter which i left for him in the <unk> . "
" how ?
did you put any thing particular in it ? "
" why  it did not seem altogether right to leave the interior blank  that would have been insulting .
d  , at vienna once , did me an evil turn , which i told him , quite <unk> , that i should remember .
so , as i knew he would feel some curiosity in regard to the identity of the person who had outwitted him , i thought it a pity not to give him a clue .
he is well acquainted with my ms. , and i just copied into the middle of the blank sheet the words  " '   <name> <unk> si <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , est <unk> de <unk> .
they are to be found in <unk> 's <unk> . ' "
the <unk> tale of scheherazade truth is stranger than fiction .
old saying .
having had occasion , lately , in the course of some oriental investigations , to consult the <unk> <unk> , a work which ( like the <unk> of <unk> <unk> ) is scarcely known at all , even in europe ; and which has never been quoted , to my knowledge , by any american  if we except , perhaps , the author of the " curiosities of american literature " ;  having had occasion , i say , to turn over some pages of the first  mentioned very remarkable work , i was not a little astonished to discover that the literary world has hitherto been strangely in error respecting the fate of the vizier 's daughter , scheherazade , as that fate is depicted in the " arabian nights " ; and that the <unk> there given , if not altogether inaccurate , as far as it goes , is at least to blame in not having gone very much farther .
for full information on this interesting topic , i must refer the inquisitive reader to the " <unk> " itself , but in the meantime , i shall be pardoned for giving a summary of what i there discovered .
it <name> be remembered , that , in the usual version of the tales , a certain monarch having good cause to be jealous of his <name> , not only puts her to death , but makes a vow , by his beard and the prophet , to espouse each night the most beautiful maiden in his dominions , and the next morning to deliver her up to the executioner .
having fulfilled this vow for many years to the letter , and with a religious punctuality and method that conferred great credit upon him as a man of devout feeling and excellent sense , he was interrupted one afternoon ( no doubt at his prayers ) by a visit from his grand vizier , to whose daughter , it appears , there had occurred an idea .
her name was scheherazade , and her idea was , that she would either redeem the land from the <unk> tax upon its beauty , or perish , after the approved fashion of all <unk> , in the attempt .
accordingly , and although we do not find it to be <unk> ( which makes the sacrifice more <unk> ) , she <unk> her father , the grand vizier , to make an offer to the king of her hand .
this hand the king eagerly accepts  ( he had intended to take it at all events , and had put off the matter from day to day , only through fear of the vizier ) ,  but , in accepting it now , he gives all parties very distinctly to understand , that , grand vizier or no grand vizier , he has not the slightest design of giving up one <unk> of his vow or of his privileges .
when , therefore , the fair scheherazade insisted upon marrying the king , and did actually marry him despite her father 's excellent advice not to do any thing of the kind  when she would and did marry him , i say , <name> i , <unk> i , it was with her beautiful black eyes as thoroughly open as the nature of the case would allow .
it seems , however , that this politic damsel ( who had been reading machiavelli , beyond doubt ) , had a very ingenious little plot in her mind .
on the night of the wedding , she contrived , upon i forget what <unk> pretence , to have her sister occupy a couch sufficiently near that of the <name> pair to admit of easy conversation from bed to bed ; and , a little before <unk> , she took care to awaken the good monarch , her husband ( who bore her none the worse <name> because he intended to wring her neck on the morrow ) ,  she managed to awaken him , i say , ( although on account of a capital conscience and an easy digestion , he slept well ) by the profound interest of a story ( about a rat and a black cat , i think ) which she was <unk> ( all in an undertone , of course ) to her sister .
when the day broke , it so happened that this history was not altogether finished , and that scheherazade , in the nature of things could not finish it just then , since it was high time for her to get up and be <unk>  a thing very little more pleasant than hanging , only a trifle more genteel .
the king 's curiosity , however , prevailing , i am sorry to say , even over his sound religious principles , induced him for this once to postpone the fulfilment of his vow until next morning , for the purpose and with the <name> of hearing that night how it fared in the end with the black cat ( a black cat , i think it was ) and the rat .
the night having arrived , however , the <name> scheherazade not only put the finishing stroke to the black cat and the rat ( the rat was blue ) but before she well knew what she was about , found herself deep in the intricacies of a narration , having reference ( if i am not altogether mistaken ) to a pink horse ( with green wings ) that went , in a violent manner , by clockwork , and was wound up with an indigo key .
with this history the king was even more profoundly interested than with the other  and , as the day broke before its conclusion ( notwithstanding all the <name> 's endeavors to get through with it in time for the <unk> ) , there was again no resource but to postpone that ceremony as before , for twenty-four hours .
the next night there happened a similar accident with a similar result ; and then the next  and then again the next ; so that , in the end , the good monarch , having been <unk> deprived of all opportunity to keep his vow during a period of no less than one thousand and one nights , either forgets it altogether by the expiration of this time , or gets himself <unk> of it in the regular way , or ( what is more probable ) breaks it outright , as well as the head of his father <unk> .
at all events , scheherazade , who , being <unk> descended from <name> , fell heir , perhaps , to the whole seven baskets of talk , which the latter <name> , we all know , picked up from under the trees in the garden of <unk> , i say , finally triumphed , and the tariff upon beauty was <unk> .
now , this conclusion ( which is that of the story as we have it upon record ) is , no doubt , excessively proper and pleasant  but alas !
like a great many pleasant things , is more pleasant than true , and i am indebted altogether to the " <unk> " for the means of correcting the error .
" <name> <unk> , " says a french proverb , " est <unk> du bien , " and , in mentioning that scheherazade had inherited the seven baskets of talk , i should have added that she put them out at compound interest until they amounted to <unk> .
" my dear sister , " said she , on the <unk> night , ( i quote the language of the " <unk> " at this point , verbatim ) " my dear sister , " said she , " now that all this little difficulty about the <unk> has blown over , and that this odious tax is so happily <unk> , i feel that i have been guilty of great indiscretion in withholding from you and the king ( who i am sorry to say , snores  a thing no gentleman would do ) the full conclusion of <unk> the sailor .
this person went through numerous other and more interesting adventures than those which i related ; but the truth is , i felt sleepy on the particular night of their narration , and so was seduced into cutting them short  a grievous piece of misconduct , for which i only trust that allah <name> forgive me .
but even yet it is not too late to remedy my great neglect  and as soon as i have given the king a pinch or two in order to wake him up so far that he may stop making that horrible noise , i <name> forthwith entertain you ( and him if he pleases ) with the sequel of this very remarkable story . "
hereupon the sister of scheherazade , as i have it from the " <unk> , " expressed no very particular intensity of gratification ; but the king , having been sufficiently pinched , at length ceased snoring , and finally said , " hum ! "
and then " hoo ! "
when the <name> , understanding these words ( which are no doubt arabic ) to signify that he was all attention , and would do his best not to snore any more  the <name> , i say , having arranged these matters to her satisfaction , re-entered thus , at once , into the history of <unk> the sailor : " 'at length , in my old age , [ these are the words of <unk> himself , as <unk> by scheherazade ]  'at length , in my old age , and after enjoying many years of tranquillity at home , i became once more possessed of a <name> of visiting foreign countries ; and one day , without <unk> any of my family with my design , i packed up some bundles of such merchandise as was most precious and least bulky , and , engaged a <name> to <name> them , went with him down to the sea-shore , to await the arrival of any chance vessel that might convey me out of the kingdom into some region which i had not as yet explored .
" <unk> deposited the packages upon the sands , we sat down beneath some trees , and looked out into the ocean in the <name> of perceiving a ship , but during several hours we saw none whatever .
at length i fancied that i could hear a singular buzzing or humming sound ; and the <name> , after listening awhile , declared that he also could distinguish it .
presently it grew louder , and then still louder , so that we could have no doubt that the object which caused it was approaching us .
at length , on the edge of the horizon , we discovered a black speck , which rapidly increased in size until we made it out to be a vast monster , swimming with a great part of its body above the surface of the sea .
it came toward us with inconceivable swiftness , throwing up huge waves of foam around its breast , and illuminating all that part of the sea through which it passed , with a long line of fire that extended far off into the distance .
" 'as the thing <name> near we saw it very distinctly .
its length was equal to that of three of the loftiest trees that grow , and it was as wide as the great hall of audience in your palace , o most sublime and <unk> of the <unk> .
its body , which was unlike that of ordinary fishes , was as solid as a rock , and of a <unk> blackness throughout all that portion of it which floated above the water , with the exception of a narrow blood-red streak that completely <unk> it .
the belly , which floated beneath the surface , and of which we could get only a glimpse now and then as the monster rose and fell with the billows , was entirely covered with metallic scales , of a color like that of the moon in <name> weather .
the back was flat and nearly white , and from it there extended upwards of six spines , about half the length of the whole body .
" 'the horrible creature had no mouth that we could perceive , but , as if to make up for this deficiency , it was provided with at least four score of eyes , that protruded from their sockets like those of the green <unk> , and were arranged all around the body in two rows , one above the other , and parallel to the blood-red streak , which seemed to answer the purpose of an eyebrow .
two or three of these dreadful eyes were much larger than the others , and had the appearance of solid gold .
" <unk> this beast approached us , as i have before said , with the greatest rapidity , it must have been moved altogether by <unk>  for it had neither fins like a fish nor <unk> like a duck , nor wings like the <unk> which is blown along in the manner of a vessel ; nor yet did it writhe itself forward as do the eels .
its head and its tail were shaped precisely alike , only , not far from the latter , were two small holes that served for nostrils , and through which the monster puffed out its thick breath with prodigious violence , and with a shrieking , disagreeable noise .
" 'our terror at beholding this hideous thing was very great , but it was even surpassed by our astonishment , when upon getting a nearer look , we perceived upon the creature 's back a vast number of animals about the size and shape of men , and altogether much resembling them , except that they wore no garments ( as men do ) , being supplied ( by nature , no doubt ) with an ugly uncomfortable covering , a good deal like cloth , but fitting so tight to the skin , as to render the poor wretches <unk> awkward , and put them apparently to severe pain .
on the very tips of their heads were certain <unk> boxes , which , at first sight , i thought might have been intended to answer as turbans , but i soon discovered that they were excessively heavy and solid , and i therefore concluded they were contrivances designed , by their great weight , to keep the heads of the animals steady and safe upon their shoulders .
around the necks of the creatures were fastened black collars , ( badges of <unk> , no doubt , ) such as we keep on our dogs , only much wider and infinitely <unk> , so that it was quite impossible for these poor victims to move their heads in any direction without moving the body at the same time ; and thus they were doomed to perpetual contemplation of their noses  a view <unk> and <unk> in a wonderful , if not positively in an awful degree .
" 'when the monster had nearly reached the shore where we stood , it suddenly pushed out one of its eyes to a great extent , and emitted from it a terrible flash of fire , accompanied by a dense cloud of smoke , and a noise that i can compare to nothing but thunder .
as the smoke cleared away , we saw one of the odd <unk> standing near the head of the large beast with a trumpet in his hand , through which ( putting it to his mouth ) he presently addressed us in loud , harsh , and disagreeable accents , that , perhaps , we should have mistaken for language , had they not come altogether through the nose .
" <unk> thus evidently spoken to , i was at a loss how to reply , as i could in no manner understand what was said ; and in this difficulty i turned to the <name> , who was near <unk> through affright , and demanded of him his opinion as to what species of monster it was , what it wanted , and what kind of creatures those were that so swarmed upon its back .
to this the <name> replied , as well as he could for trepidation , that he had once before heard of this <unk> ; that it was a cruel demon , with bowels of sulphur and blood of fire , created by evil genii as the means of inflicting misery upon mankind ; that the things upon its back were vermin , such as sometimes infest cats and dogs , only a little larger and more savage ; and that these vermin had their uses , however evil  for , through the torture they caused the beast by their nibbling and <unk> , it was goaded into that degree of wrath which was requisite to make it roar and commit ill , and so fulfil the <unk> and malicious designs of the wicked genii .
" this account determined me to take to my heels , and , without once even looking behind me , i ran at full speed up into the hills , while the <name> ran equally fast , although nearly in an opposite direction , so that , by these means , he finally made his escape with my bundles , of which i have no doubt he took excellent care  although this is a point i can not determine , as i do not remember that i ever beheld him again .
" 'for myself , i was so hotly pursued by a swarm of the <unk> ( who had come to the shore in boats ) that i was very soon overtaken , bound hand and foot , and conveyed to the beast , which immediately swam out again into the middle of the sea .
" 'i now bitterly repented my folly in quitting a comfortable home to peril my life in such adventures as this ; but regret being useless , i made the best of my condition , and exerted myself to secure the goodwill of the <unk> that owned the trumpet , and who appeared to exercise authority over his fellows .
i succeeded so well in this endeavor that , in a few days , the creature bestowed upon me various tokens of his favor , and in the end even went to the trouble of teaching me the rudiments of what it was vain enough to <unk> its language ; so that , at length , i was enabled to converse with it readily , and came to make it comprehend the ardent <name> i had of seeing the world .
" <unk> <unk> squeak , <unk> , <unk> diddle , grunt <unk> grumble , hiss , <unk> , <unk> , ' said he to me , one day after dinner  but i beg a thousand pardons , i had forgotten that your majesty is not conversant with the dialect of the <unk> ( so the <unk> were called ; i presume because their language formed the connecting link between that of the horse and that of the rooster ) .
with your permission , i <name> translate .
<unk> <unk> , ' and so forth :  that is to say , 'i am happy to find , my dear <unk> , that you are really a very excellent fellow ; we are now about doing a thing which is called <unk> the globe ; and since you are so desirous of seeing the world , i <name> strain a point and give you a free passage upon back of the beast . ' "
when the <name> scheherazade had proceeded thus far , relates the " <unk> , " the king turned over from his left side to his right , and said : " it is , in fact , very surprising , my dear <name> , that you omitted , hitherto , these latter adventures of <unk> .
do you know i think them exceedingly entertaining and strange ? "
the king having thus expressed himself , we are told , the fair scheherazade resumed her history in the following words : " <unk> went on in this manner with his narrative to the <unk>  'i thanked the <unk> for its kindness , and soon found myself very much at home on the beast , which swam at a prodigious rate through the ocean ; although the surface of the latter is , in that part of the world , by no means flat , but round like a <unk> , so that we went  so to say  either up hill or down hill all the time . '
" that i think , was very singular , " interrupted the king .
" nevertheless , it is quite true , " replied scheherazade .
" i have my doubts , " rejoined the king ; " but , pray , be so good as to go on with the story . "
" i <name> , " said the <name> .
" 'the beast , ' continued <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> , as i have related , up hill and down hill until , at length , we arrived at an island , many hundreds of miles in circumference , but which , nevertheless , had been built in the middle of the sea by a colony of little things like caterpillars ' " ( *1 ) " hum ! "
said the king .
" <unk> this island , ' said <unk>  ( for scheherazade , it must be understood , took no notice of her husband 's <unk> ejaculation ) <unk> this island , we came to another where the forests were of solid stone , and so hard that they shivered to pieces the <unk> axes with which we endeavoured to cut them down . " '
( <unk> ) " hum ! "
said the king , again ; but scheherazade , paying him no attention , continued in the language of <unk> .
" <unk> beyond this last island , we reached a country where there was a cave that ran to the distance of thirty or forty miles within the bowels of the earth , and that contained a greater number of far more spacious and more magnificent palaces than are to be found in all damascus and bagdad .
from the roofs of these palaces there <name> myriads of gems , liked diamonds , but larger than men ; and in among the streets of towers and pyramids and temples , there flowed immense rivers as black as <name> , and swarming with fish that had no eyes . ' "
( <unk> ) " hum ! "
said the king .
" 'we then swam into a region of the sea where we found a lofty mountain , down whose sides there streamed torrents of melted metal , some of which were twelve miles wide and sixty miles long ( <unk> ) ; while from an abyss on the summit , issued so vast a quantity of ashes that the sun was entirely blotted out from the heavens , and it became darker than the darkest midnight ; so that when we were even at the distance of a hundred and fifty miles from the mountain , it was impossible to see the whitest object , however close we held it to our eyes . ' "
( <unk> ) " hum ! "
said the king .
" 'after quitting this coast , the beast continued his voyage until we met with a land in which the nature of things seemed reversed  for we here saw a great lake , at the bottom of which , more than a hundred feet beneath the surface of the water , there flourished in full leaf a forest of tall and luxuriant trees . ' "
( <unk> ) " hoo ! "
said the king .
" some hundred miles farther on brought us to a climate where the atmosphere was so dense as to sustain iron or steel , just as our own does feather . ' "
( <unk> ) " fiddle de <name> , " said the king .
" proceeding still in the same direction , we presently arrived at the most magnificent region in the whole world .
through it there <unk> a glorious river for several thousands of miles .
this river was of unspeakable depth , and of a transparency richer than that of <name> .
it was from three to six miles in width ; and its banks which arose on either side to twelve hundred feet in perpendicular height , were crowned with <unk> trees and perpetual <unk> flowers , that made the whole territory one gorgeous garden ; but the name of this luxuriant land was the kingdom of horror , and to enter it was inevitable death ' " ( <unk> ) " humph ! "
said the king .
" 'we left this kingdom in great haste , and , after some days , came to another , where we were astonished to perceive myriads of monstrous animals with horns resembling <unk> upon their heads .
these hideous beasts dig for themselves vast caverns in the soil , of a funnel shape , and line the sides of them with , rocks , so disposed one upon the other that they fall instantly , when trodden upon by other animals , thus <unk> them into the monster 's dens , where their blood is immediately sucked , and their carcasses afterwards hurled contemptuously out to an immense distance from " the caverns of death . " ' "
( <unk> ) " pooh ! "
said the king .
" <unk> our progress , we perceived a district with vegetables that grew not upon any soil but in the air .
( <unk> ) there were others that sprang from the substance of other vegetables ; ( <unk> ) others that derived their substance from the bodies of living animals ; ( <unk> ) and then again , there were others that glowed all over with intense fire ; ( <unk> ) others that moved from place to place at pleasure , ( <unk> ) and what was still more wonderful , we discovered flowers that lived and breathed and moved their limbs at <name> and had , moreover , the detestable passion of mankind for <unk> other creatures , and confining them in horrid and solitary prisons until the fulfillment of appointed tasks . ' "
( <unk> ) " pshaw ! "
said the king .
" <unk> this land , we soon arrived at another in which the bees and the birds are mathematicians of such genius and erudition , that they give daily instructions in the science of geometry to the wise men of the empire .
the king of the place having offered a reward for the solution of two very difficult problems , they were solved upon the spot  the one by the bees , and the other by the birds ; but the king keeping their solution a secret , it was only after the most profound researches and labor , and the writing of an infinity of big books , during a long series of years , that the <unk> at length arrived at the identical solutions which had been given upon the spot by the bees and by the birds . ' "
( <unk> ) " oh my ! "
said the king .
" 'we had scarcely lost sight of this empire when we found ourselves close upon another , from whose shores there flew over our heads a flock of fowls a mile in breadth , and two hundred and forty miles long ; so that , although they flew a mile during every minute , it required no less than four hours for the whole flock to pass over us  in which there were several millions of millions of fowl . ' "
( <unk> ) " oh <unk> ! "
said the king .
" 'no sooner had we got rid of these birds , which occasioned us great annoyance , than we were terrified by the appearance of a fowl of another kind , and infinitely larger than even the <unk> which i met in my former voyages ; for it was bigger than the biggest of the domes on your <unk> , oh , most <unk> of <unk> .
this terrible fowl had no head that we could perceive , but was fashioned entirely of belly , which was of a prodigious <unk> and <unk> , of a <unk> substance , smooth , shining and striped with various colors .
in its talons , the monster was bearing away to his eyrie in the heavens , a house from which it had knocked off the roof , and in the interior of which we distinctly saw human beings , who , beyond doubt , were in a state of frightful despair at the horrible fate which awaited them .
we shouted with all our might , in the <name> of frightening the bird into letting go of its prey , but it merely gave a snort or puff , as if of rage and then let fall upon our heads a heavy sack which proved to be filled with sand ! ' "
" stuff ! "
said the king .
" 'it was just after this adventure that we encountered a continent of immense extent and prodigious solidity , but which , nevertheless , was supported entirely upon the back of a sky-blue cow that had no fewer than four hundred horns . ' "
( <unk> ) " that , now , i believe , " said the king , " because i have read something of the kind before , in a book . "
" 'we passed immediately beneath this continent , ( swimming in between the legs of the cow ) , and , after some hours , found ourselves in a wonderful country indeed , which , i was informed by the <unk> , was his own native land , inhabited by things of his own species .
this elevated the <unk> very much in my esteem , and in fact , i now began to feel ashamed of the contemptuous familiarity with which i had treated him ; for i found that the <unk> in general were a nation of the most powerful magicians , who lived with worms in their <name> , ( <unk> ) which , no doubt , served to stimulate them by their painful <unk> and <unk> to the most miraculous efforts of imagination ! ' "
" nonsense ! "
said the king .
" <unk> the magicians , were domesticated several animals of very singular kinds ; for example , there was a huge horse whose bones were iron and whose blood was boiling water .
in place of corn , he had black stones for his usual food ; and yet , in spite of so hard a diet , he was so strong and swift that he would drag a load more weighty than the grandest <name> in this city , at a rate surpassing that of the flight of most birds . ' "
( <unk> ) " <unk> ! "
said the king .
" 'i saw , also , among these people a hen without feathers , but bigger than a camel ; instead of flesh and bone she had iron and brick ; her blood , like that of the horse , ( to whom , in fact , she was nearly related , ) was boiling water ; and like him she ate nothing but wood or black stones .
this hen brought forth very frequently , a hundred chickens in the day ; and , after birth , they took up their residence for several weeks within the stomach of their mother . ' "
( <unk> ) " <unk> !
lal ! "
said the king .
" 'one of this nation of mighty <unk> created a man out of brass and wood , and leather , and endowed him with such ingenuity that he would have beaten at chess , all the race of mankind with the exception of the great <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
( <unk> ) another of these magi constructed ( of like material ) a creature that put to shame even the genius of him who made it ; for so great were its reasoning powers that , in a second , it performed calculations of so vast an extent that they would have required the united labor of fifty thousand fleshy men for a year .
( <unk> ) but a still more wonderful <unk> fashioned for himself a mighty thing that was neither man nor beast , but which had brains of lead , <unk> with a black matter like pitch , and fingers that it employed with such incredible speed and dexterity that it would have had no trouble in writing out twenty thousand copies of the koran in an hour , and this with so exquisite a precision , that in all the copies there should not be found one to vary from another by the breadth of the finest hair .
this thing was of prodigious strength , so that it erected or <unk> the mightiest empires at a breath ; but its powers were exercised equally for evil and for good . ' "
" ridiculous ! "
said the king .
" <unk> this nation of <unk> there was also one who had in his veins the blood of the <unk> ; for he made no scruple of sitting down to smoke his <unk> in a red-hot oven until his dinner was thoroughly roasted upon its floor .
( <unk> ) another had the faculty of converting the common metals into gold , without even looking at them during the process .
( <unk> ) another had such a delicacy of touch that he made a wire so fine as to be invisible .
( <unk> ) another had such quickness of perception that he counted all the separate motions of an elastic body , while it was springing backward and forward at the rate of nine hundred millions of times in a second . ' "
( <unk> ) " absurd ! "
said the king .
" <unk> of these magicians , by means of a fluid that nobody ever yet saw , could make the corpses of his friends <unk> their arms , kick out their legs , fight , or even get up and dance at his <name> .
( <unk> ) another had cultivated his voice to so great an extent that he could have made himself heard from one end of the world to the other .
( <unk> ) another had so long an arm that he could sit down in damascus and <unk> a letter at bagdad  or indeed at any distance whatsoever .
( <unk> ) another commanded the lightning to come down to him out of the heavens , and it came at his call ; and served him for a plaything when it came .
another took two loud sounds and out of them made a silence .
another constructed a deep darkness out of two brilliant lights .
( <unk> ) another made ice in a red-hot furnace .
( <unk> ) another directed the sun to paint his portrait , and the sun did .
( <unk> ) another took this <unk> with the moon and the planets , and having first weighed them with scrupulous accuracy , <unk> into their depths and found out the solidity of the substance of which they were made .
but the whole nation is , indeed , of so surprising a <unk> ability , that not even their infants , nor their commonest cats and dogs have any difficulty in seeing objects that do not exist at all , or that for twenty millions of years before the birth of the nation itself had been blotted out from the face of creation . " '
( <unk> ) analogous experiments in respect to sound produce analogous results .
" preposterous ! "
said the king .
" 'the wives and daughters of these incomparably great and wise magi , ' " continued scheherazade , without being in any manner disturbed by these frequent and most <unk> interruptions on the part of her husband  " 'the wives and daughters of these eminent <unk> are every thing that is accomplished and refined ; and would be every thing that is interesting and beautiful , but for an unhappy <unk> that <unk> them , and from which not even the miraculous powers of their husbands and fathers has , hitherto , been adequate to save .
some <unk> come in certain shapes , and some in others  but this of which i speak has come in the shape of a <unk> . ' "
" a what ? "
said the king .
" 'a <unk> ' " said scheherazade .
" 'one of the evil genii , who are perpetually upon the watch to inflict ill , has put it into the heads of these accomplished ladies that the thing which we describe as personal beauty consists altogether in the protuberance of the region which lies not very far below the small of the back .
perfection of loveliness , they say , is in the direct ratio of the extent of this lump .
having been long possessed of this idea , and <unk> being cheap in that country , the days have long gone by since it was possible to distinguish a woman from a dromedary ' " " stop ! "
said the king  " i ca n't stand that , and i wo n't .
you have already given me a dreadful headache with your lies .
the day , too , i perceive , is beginning to break .
how long have we been married ?  my conscience is getting to be troublesome again .
and then that dromedary touch  do you take me for a fool ?
upon the whole , you might as well get up and be <unk> . "
these words , as i learn from the " <unk> , " both grieved and astonished scheherazade ; but , as she knew the king to be a man of scrupulous integrity , and quite unlikely to forfeit his word , she submitted to her fate with a good <name> .
she derived , however , great consolation , ( during the tightening of the <unk> , ) from the reflection that much of the history remained still untold , and that the <unk> of her brute of a husband had <unk> for him a most righteous reward , in depriving him of many inconceivable adventures .
a descent into the <unk> .
the ways of god in nature , as in providence , are not as our ways ; nor are the models that we frame any way commensurate to the vastness , profundity , and <unk> of his works , which have a depth in them greater than the well of <unk> .
<name> <unk> .
we had now reached the summit of the loftiest crag .
for some minutes the old man seemed too much exhausted to speak .
" not long ago , " said he at length , " and i could have guided you on this route as well as the youngest of my sons ; but , about three years past , there happened to me an event such as never happened to mortal man  or at least such as no man ever survived to tell of  and the six hours of deadly terror which i then endured have broken me up body and soul .
you suppose me a very old man  but i am not .
it took less than a single day to change these hairs from a <unk> black to white , to weaken my limbs , and to <unk> my nerves , so that i tremble at the least exertion , and am frightened at a shadow .
do you know i can scarcely look over this little <name> without getting giddy ? "
the " little <name> , " upon whose edge he had so carelessly thrown himself down to rest that the <unk> portion of his body <name> over it , while he was only kept from falling by the tenure of his elbow on its extreme and slippery edge  this " little <name> " arose , a sheer unobstructed precipice of black shining rock , some fifteen or sixteen hundred feet from the world of crags beneath us .
nothing would have tempted me to within half a dozen yards of its brink .
in truth so deeply was i excited by the perilous position of my companion , that i fell at full length upon the ground , clung to the shrubs around me , and dared not even glance upward at the sky  while i struggled in vain to divest myself of the idea that the very foundations of the mountain were in danger from the fury of the winds .
it was long before i could reason myself into sufficient courage to sit up and look out into the distance .
" you must get over these fancies , " said the guide , " for i have brought you here that you might have the best possible view of the scene of that event i mentioned  and to tell you the whole story with the spot just under your eye . "
" we are now , " he continued , in that <unk> manner which distinguished him  " we are now close upon the norwegian coast  in the <unk> degree of latitude  in the great province of <unk>  and in the dreary district of <unk> .
the mountain upon whose top we sit is <unk> , the cloudy .
now raise yourself up a little higher  hold on to the grass if you feel giddy  so  and look out , beyond the belt of vapor beneath us , into the sea . "
i looked dizzily , and beheld a wide expanse of ocean , whose waters wore so inky a <name> as to bring at once to my mind the <unk> <unk> account of the mare <unk> .
a panorama more <unk> desolate no human imagination can conceive .
to the right and left , as far as the eye could reach , there lay outstretched , like ramparts of the world , lines of <unk> black and <unk> <name> , whose character of gloom was but the more forcibly illustrated by the surf which reared high up against its white and ghastly crest , howling and shrieking forever .
just opposite the promontory upon whose apex we were placed , and at a distance of some five or six miles out at sea , there was visible a small , <unk> island ; or , more properly , its position was discernible through the wilderness of surge in which it was enveloped .
about two miles nearer the land , arose another of smaller size , hideously <unk> and barren , and encompassed at various intervals by a cluster of dark rocks .
the appearance of the ocean , in the space between the more distant island and the shore , had something very unusual about it .
although , at the time , so strong a <name> was blowing landward that a brig in the remote offing lay to under a <unk> <unk> , and constantly plunged her whole hull out of sight , still there was here nothing like a regular swell , but only a short , quick , angry cross dashing of water in every direction  as well in the teeth of the wind as otherwise .
of foam there was little except in the immediate vicinity of the rocks .
" the island in the distance , " resumed the old man , " is called by the <unk> <unk> .
the one midway is <unk> .
that a mile to the northward is <unk> .
yonder are <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
farther off  between <unk> and <unk>  are <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
these are the true names of the places  but why it has been thought necessary to name them at all , is more than either you or i can understand .
do you hear anything ?
do you see any change in the water ? "
we had now been about ten minutes upon the top of <unk> , to which we had ascended from the interior of <unk> , so that we had caught no glimpse of the sea until it had burst upon us from the summit .
as the old man spoke , i became aware of a loud and gradually increasing sound , like the moaning of a vast herd of buffaloes upon an american prairie ; and at the same moment i perceived that what seamen term the chopping character of the ocean beneath us , was rapidly changing into a current which set to the eastward .
even while i gazed , this current acquired a monstrous velocity .
each moment added to its speed  to its headlong impetuosity .
in five minutes the whole sea , as far as <unk> , was lashed into ungovernable fury ; but it was between <unk> and the coast that the main uproar held its sway .
here the vast bed of the waters , seamed and scarred into a thousand conflicting channels , burst suddenly into <unk> convulsion  heaving , boiling , hissing  <unk> in gigantic and innumerable <unk> , and all whirling and plunging on to the eastward with a rapidity which water never elsewhere assumes except in precipitous <unk> .
in a few minutes more , there came over the scene another radical alteration .
the general surface grew somewhat more smooth , and the <unk> , one by one , disappeared , while prodigious streaks of foam became apparent where none had been seen before .
these streaks , at length , spreading out to a great distance , and entering into combination , took unto themselves the <unk> motion of the subsided <unk> , and seemed to form the germ of another more vast .
suddenly  very suddenly  this assumed a distinct and definite existence , in a circle of more than a mile in diameter .
the edge of the whirl was represented by a broad belt of gleaming spray ; but no particle of this slipped into the mouth of the terrific funnel , whose interior , as far as the eye could fathom it , was a smooth , shining , and <unk> wall of water , inclined to the horizon at an <name> of some forty-five degrees , speeding dizzily round and round with a swaying and sweltering motion , and sending forth to the winds an appalling voice , half shriek , half roar , such as not even the mighty cataract of niagara ever lifts up in its agony to heaven .
the mountain trembled to its very base , and the rock rocked .
i threw myself upon my face , and clung to the scant herbage in an excess of nervous agitation .
" this , " said i at length , to the old man  " this can be nothing else than the great whirlpool of the <unk> . "
" so it is sometimes termed , " said he .
" we <unk> call it the <unk> , from the island of <unk> in the midway . "
the ordinary accounts of this vortex had by no means prepared me for what i saw .
that of <name> ramus , which is perhaps the most circumstantial of any , can not impart the faintest <name> either of the magnificence , or of the horror of the scene  or of the wild bewildering sense of the novel which <unk> the beholder .
i am not sure from what point of view the writer in question surveyed it , nor at what time ; but it could neither have been from the summit of <unk> , nor during a storm .
there are some passages of his description , nevertheless , which may be quoted for their details , although their effect is exceedingly feeble in conveying an impression of the spectacle .
" between <unk> and <unk> , " he says , " the depth of the water is between thirty-six and forty fathoms ; but on the other side , toward ver ( <unk> ) this depth decreases so as not to afford a convenient passage for a vessel , without the risk of splitting on the rocks , which happens even in the <unk> weather .
when it is flood , the stream runs up the country between <unk> and <unk> with a boisterous rapidity ; but the roar of its impetuous ebb to the sea is scarce equalled by the loudest and most dreadful cataracts ; the noise being heard several leagues off , and the <unk> or pits are of such an extent and depth , that if a ship comes within its attraction , it is inevitably absorbed and carried down to the bottom , and there beat to pieces against the rocks ; and when the water <unk> , the fragments thereof are thrown up again .
but these intervals of <unk> are only at the turn of the ebb and flood , and in calm weather , and last but a quarter of an hour , its violence gradually returning .
when the stream is most boisterous , and its fury heightened by a storm , it is dangerous to come within a norway mile of it .
boats , yachts , and ships have been carried away by not guarding against it before they were within its reach .
it likewise happens frequently , that whales come too near the stream , and are overpowered by its violence ; and then it is impossible to describe their howlings and <unk> in their fruitless struggles to <unk> themselves .
a bear once , attempting to swim from <unk> to <unk> , was caught by the stream and borne down , while he roared terribly , so as to be heard on shore .
large stocks of firs and pine trees , after being absorbed by the current , rise again broken and torn to such a degree as if bristles grew upon them .
this plainly shows the bottom to consist of <unk> rocks , among which they are whirled to and fro .
this stream is regulated by the flux and <unk> of the sea  it being constantly high and low water every six hours .
in the year <unk> , early in the morning of <unk> <name> , it raged with such noise and impetuosity that the very stones of the houses on the coast fell to the ground . "
in regard to the depth of the water , i could not see how this could have been ascertained at all in the immediate vicinity of the vortex .
the " forty fathoms " must have reference only to portions of the channel close upon the shore either of <unk> or <unk> .
the depth in the centre of the <unk> must be immeasurably greater ; and no better proof of this fact is necessary than can be obtained from even the <unk> glance into the abyss of the whirl which may be had from the highest crag of <unk> .
looking down from this pinnacle upon the howling <unk> below , i could not help smiling at the simplicity with which the honest <name> ramus records , as a matter difficult of belief , the anecdotes of the whales and the bears ; for it appeared to me , in fact , a self-evident thing , that the largest ship of the line in existence , coming within the influence of that deadly attraction , could resist it as little as a feather the hurricane , and must disappear bodily and at once .
the attempts to account for the phenomenon  some of which , i remember , seemed to me sufficiently plausible in perusal  now wore a very different and unsatisfactory aspect .
the idea generally received is that this , as well as three smaller <unk> among the <unk> islands , " have no other cause than the collision of waves rising and falling , at flux and <unk> , against a ridge of rocks and shelves , which confines the water so that it <unk> itself like a cataract ; and thus the higher the flood rises , the deeper must the fall be , and the natural result of all is a whirlpool or vortex , the prodigious <unk> of which is sufficiently known by lesser experiments . "
 these are the words of the <unk> britannica .
<unk> and others imagine that in the centre of the channel of the <unk> is an abyss penetrating the globe , and issuing in some very remote part  the gulf of <unk> being somewhat decidedly named in one instance .
this opinion , idle in itself , was the one to which , as i gazed , my imagination most readily assented ; and , mentioning it to the guide , i was rather surprised to hear him say that , although it was the view almost universally entertained of the subject by the <unk> , it nevertheless was not his own .
as to the former notion he confessed his inability to comprehend it ; and here i agreed with him  for , however conclusive on paper , it becomes altogether unintelligible , and even absurd , amid the thunder of the abyss .
" you have had a good look at the whirl now , " said the old man , " and if you <name> creep round this crag , so as to get in its <name> , and <unk> the roar of the water , i <name> tell you a story that <name> convince you i ought to know something of the <unk> . "
i placed myself as desired , and he proceeded .
" myself and my two brothers once owned a <unk> smack of about seventy tons burthen , with which we were in the habit of fishing among the islands beyond <unk> , nearly to <unk> .
in all violent eddies at sea there is good fishing , at proper opportunities , if one has only the courage to attempt it ; but among the whole of the <unk> <unk> , we three were the only ones who made a regular business of going out to the islands , as i tell you .
the usual grounds are a great way lower down to the southward .
there fish can be got at all hours , without much risk , and therefore these places are preferred .
the choice spots over here among the rocks , however , not only yield the finest variety , but in far greater abundance ; so that we often got in a single day , what the more timid of the craft could not scrape together in a week .
in fact , we made it a matter of desperate speculation  the risk of life standing instead of labor , and courage answering for capital .
" we kept the smack in a cove about five miles higher up the coast than this ; and it was our practice , in fine weather , to take advantage of the fifteen minutes ' slack to push across the main channel of the <unk> , far above the pool , and then drop down upon anchorage somewhere near <unk> , or <unk> , where the eddies are not so violent as elsewhere .
here we used to remain until nearly time for <unk> again , when we weighed and made for home .
we never set out upon this expedition without a steady side wind for going and coming  one that we felt sure would not fail us before our return  and we seldom made a <unk> upon this point .
twice , during six years , we were forced to stay all night at anchor on account of a dead calm , which is a rare thing indeed just about here ; and once we had to remain on the grounds nearly a week , starving to death , owing to a <name> which blew up shortly after our arrival , and made the channel too boisterous to be thought of .
upon this occasion we should have been driven out to sea in spite of everything , ( for the <unk> threw us round and round so violently , that , at length , we fouled our anchor and dragged it ) if it had not been that we drifted into one of the innumerable cross currents  here to-day and gone to-morrow  which drove us under the <name> of <unk> , where , by good luck , we brought up .
" i could not tell you the twentieth part of the difficulties we encountered 'on the grounds '  it is a bad spot to be in , even in good weather  but we made shift always to run the gauntlet of the <unk> itself without accident ; although at times my heart has been in my mouth when we happened to be a minute or so behind or before the slack .
the wind sometimes was not as strong as we thought it at starting , and then we made rather less way than we could wish , while the current rendered the smack unmanageable .
my eldest brother had a son eighteen years old , and i had two stout boys of my own .
these would have been of great assistance at such times , in using the sweeps , as well as afterward in fishing  but , somehow , although we ran the risk ourselves , we had not the heart to let the young ones get into the danger  for , after all is said and done , it was a horrible danger , and that is the truth .
" it is now within a few days of three years since what i am going to tell you occurred .
it was on the tenth day of july , 18 , a day which the people of this part of the world <name> never forget  for it was one in which blew the most terrible hurricane that ever came out of the heavens .
and yet all the morning , and indeed until late in the afternoon , there was a gentle and steady breeze from the south-west , while the sun shone brightly , so that the oldest seaman among us could not have foreseen what was to follow .
" the three of us  my two brothers and myself  had crossed over to the islands about two o'clock p. m. , and had soon nearly loaded the smack with fine fish , which , we all remarked , were more plenty that day than we had ever known them .
it was just seven , by my watch , when we weighed and started for home , so as to make the worst of the <unk> at slack water , which we knew would be at eight .
" we set out with a fresh wind on our starboard quarter , and for some time spanked along at a great rate , never dreaming of danger , for indeed we saw not the slightest reason to apprehend it .
all at once we were taken aback by a breeze from over <unk> .
this was most unusual  something that had never happened to us before  and i began to feel a little uneasy , without exactly knowing why .
we put the boat on the wind , but could make no headway at all for the eddies , and i was upon the point of proposing to return to the anchorage , when , looking astern , we saw the whole horizon covered with a singular <unk> cloud that rose with the most amazing velocity .
" in the meantime the breeze that had headed us off fell away , and we were dead <unk> , drifting about in every direction .
this state of things , however , did not last long enough to give us time to think about it .
in less than a minute the storm was upon us  in less than two the sky was entirely overcast  and what with this and the driving spray , it became suddenly so dark that we could not see each other in the smack .
" such a hurricane as then blew it is folly to attempt describing .
the oldest seaman in norway never experienced any thing like it .
we had let our sails go by the run before it cleverly took us ; but , at the first puff , both our masts went by the board as if they had been sawed off  the mainmast taking with it my youngest brother , who had lashed himself to it for safety .
" our boat was the lightest feather of a thing that ever sat upon water .
it had a complete flush deck , with only a small hatch near the bow , and this hatch it had always been our custom to <unk> down when about to cross the <unk> , by way of precaution against the chopping seas .
but for this circumstance we should have <unk> at once  for we lay entirely buried for some moments .
how my elder brother escaped destruction i can not say , for i never had an opportunity of ascertaining .
for my part , as soon as i had let the foresail run , i threw myself flat on deck , with my feet against the narrow gunwale of the bow , and with my hands grasping a <unk> near the foot of the <unk> .
it was mere instinct that prompted me to do this  which was undoubtedly the very best thing i could have done  for i was too much <unk> to think .
" for some moments we were completely <unk> , as i say , and all this time i held my breath , and clung to the bolt .
when i could stand it no longer i raised myself upon my knees , still keeping hold with my hands , and thus got my head clear .
presently our little boat gave herself a shake , just as a dog does in coming out of the water , and thus rid herself , in some measure , of the seas .
i was now trying to get the better of the stupor that had come over me , and to collect my senses so as to see what was to be done , when i felt somebody grasp my arm .
it was my elder brother , and my heart leaped for <name> , for i had made sure that he was overboard  but the next moment all this <name> was turned into horror  for he put his mouth close to my ear , and screamed out the word <unk> ! ' " no one ever <name> know what my feelings were at that moment .
i shook from head to foot as if i had had the most violent fit of the ague .
i knew what he meant by that one word well enough  i knew what he wished to make me understand .
with the wind that now drove us on , we were bound for the whirl of the <unk> , and nothing could save us !
" you perceive that in crossing the <unk> channel , we always went a long way up above the whirl , even in the <unk> weather , and then had to wait and watch carefully for the slack  but now we were driving right upon the pool itself , and in such a hurricane as this !
'to be sure , ' i thought , 'we shall get there just about the slack  there is some little <name> in that '  but in the next moment i cursed myself for being so great a fool as to dream of <name> at all .
i knew very well that we were doomed , had we been ten times a <unk> ship .
" by this time the first fury of the tempest had spent itself , or perhaps we did not feel it so much , as we <unk> before it , but at all events the seas , which at first had been kept down by the wind , and lay flat and frothing , now got up into absolute mountains .
a singular change , too , had come over the heavens .
around in every direction it was still as black as pitch , but nearly overhead there burst out , all at once , a circular rift of clear sky  as clear as i ever saw  and of a deep bright blue  and through it there blazed forth the full moon with a lustre that i never before knew her to wear .
she lit up every thing about us with the greatest distinctness  but , oh god , what a scene it was to light up !
" i now made one or two attempts to speak to my brother  but , in some manner which i could not understand , the din had so increased that i could not make him hear a single word , although i screamed at the top of my voice in his ear .
presently he shook his head , looking as pale as death , and held up one of his finger , as if to say 'listen !
' " at first i could not make out what he meant  but soon a hideous thought flashed upon me .
i dragged my watch from its <unk> .
it was not going .
i glanced at its face by the moonlight , and then burst into tears as i flung it far away into the ocean .
it had run down at seven o'clock !
we were behind the time of the slack , and the whirl of the <unk> was in full fury !  " when a boat is well built , properly trimmed , and not deep laden , the waves in a strong <name> , when she is going large , seem always to slip from beneath her  which appears very strange to a landsman  and this is what is called riding , in sea phrase .
well , so far we had ridden the swells very cleverly ; but presently a gigantic sea happened to take us right under the counter , and bore us with it as it rose  up  up  as if into the sky .
i would not have believed that any wave could rise so high .
and then down we came with a sweep , a slide , and a plunge , that made me feel sick and dizzy , as if i was falling from some lofty <unk> in a dream .
but while we were up i had thrown a quick glance around  and that one glance was all sufficient .
i saw our exact position in an instant .
the <unk> whirlpool was about a quarter of a mile dead ahead  but no more like the every-day <unk> , than the whirl as you now see it is like a <unk> .
if i had not known where we were , and what we had to expect , i should not have recognised the place at all .
as it was , i involuntarily closed my eyes in horror .
the lids clenched themselves together as if in a spasm .
" it could not have been more than two minutes afterward until we suddenly felt the waves subside , and were enveloped in foam .
the boat made a sharp half turn to larboard , and then shot off in its new direction like a thunderbolt .
at the same moment the roaring noise of the water was completely drowned in a kind of shrill shriek  such a sound as you might imagine given out by the <unk> of many thousand <unk> , letting off their steam all together .
we were now in the belt of surf that always surrounds the whirl ; and i thought , of course , that another moment would plunge us into the abyss  down which we could only see indistinctly on account of the amazing velocity with which we wore borne along .
the boat did not seem to sink into the water at all , but to skim like an <unk> upon the surface of the surge .
her starboard side was next the whirl , and on the larboard arose the world of ocean we had left .
it stood like a huge writhing wall between us and the horizon .
" it may appear strange , but now , when we were in the very jaws of the gulf , i felt more composed than when we were only approaching it .
having made up my mind to <name> no more , i got rid of a great deal of that terror which <unk> me at first .
i suppose it was despair that strung my nerves .
" it may look like boasting  but what i tell you is truth  i began to reflect how magnificent a thing it was to die in such a manner , and how foolish it was in me to think of so paltry a consideration as my own individual life , in view of so wonderful a manifestation of god 's power .
i do believe that i blushed with shame when this idea crossed my mind .
after a little while i became possessed with the keenest curiosity about the whirl itself .
i positively felt a wish to explore its depths , even at the sacrifice i was going to make ; and my principal grief was that i should never be able to tell my old companions on shore about the mysteries i should see .
these , no doubt , were singular fancies to occupy a man 's mind in such extremity  and i have often thought since , that the revolutions of the boat around the pool might have rendered me a little <unk> .
" there was another circumstance which tended to restore my self-possession ; and this was the cessation of the wind , which could not reach us in our present situation  for , as you saw yourself , the belt of surf is considerably lower than the general bed of the ocean , and this latter now towered above us , a high , black , mountainous ridge .
if you have never been at sea in a heavy <name> , you can form no idea of the confusion of mind occasioned by the wind and spray together .
they blind , <unk> , and strangle you , and take away all power of action or reflection .
but we were now , in a great measure , rid of these annoyances  just as <unk> <unk> in prison are allowed petty indulgences , forbidden them while their doom is yet uncertain .
" how often we made the circuit of the belt it is impossible to say .
we <unk> round and round for perhaps an hour , flying rather than floating , getting gradually more and more into the middle of the surge , and then nearer and nearer to its horrible inner edge .
all this time i had never let go of the <unk> .
my brother was at the stern , holding on to a small empty <unk> which had been securely lashed under the coop of the counter , and was the only thing on deck that had not been swept overboard when the <name> first took us .
as we approached the brink of the pit he let go his hold upon this , and made for the ring , from which , in the agony of his terror , he endeavored to force my hands , as it was not large enough to afford us both a secure grasp .
i never felt deeper grief than when i saw him attempt this act  although i knew he was a madman when he did it  a raving maniac through sheer fright .
i did not care , however , to contest the point with him .
i knew it could make no difference whether either of us held on at all ; so i let him have the bolt , and went astern to the cask .
this there was no great difficulty in doing ; for the smack flew round steadily enough , and upon an even keel  only swaying to and fro , with the immense sweeps and <unk> of the whirl .
scarcely had i secured myself in my new position , when we gave a wild lurch to starboard , and rushed headlong into the abyss .
i muttered a hurried prayer to god , and thought all was over .
" as i felt the sickening sweep of the descent , i had instinctively tightened my hold upon the barrel , and closed my eyes .
for some seconds i dared not open them  while i expected instant destruction , and wondered that i was not already in my <unk> with the water .
but moment after moment elapsed .
i still lived .
the sense of falling had ceased ; and the motion of the vessel seemed much as it had been before , while in the belt of foam , with the exception that she now lay more along .
i took courage , and looked once again upon the scene .
" never shall i forget the sensations of awe , horror , and admiration with which i gazed about me .
the boat appeared to be hanging , as if by magic , midway down , upon the interior surface of a funnel vast in circumference , prodigious in depth , and whose perfectly smooth sides might have been mistaken for <name> , but for the bewildering rapidity with which they spun around , and for the gleaming and ghastly radiance they shot forth , as the rays of the full moon , from that circular rift amid the clouds which i have already described , streamed in a flood of golden <name> along the black walls , and far away down into the inmost recesses of the abyss .
" at first i was too much confused to observe anything accurately .
the general burst of terrific grandeur was all that i beheld .
when i recovered myself a little , however , my gaze fell instinctively downward .
in this direction i was able to obtain an unobstructed view , from the manner in which the smack <name> on the inclined surface of the pool .
she was quite upon an even keel  that is to say , her deck lay in a plane parallel with that of the water  but this latter sloped at an <name> of more than forty-five degrees , so that we seemed to be lying upon our <unk> .
i could not help observing , nevertheless , that i had scarcely more difficulty in maintaining my hold and footing in this situation , than if we had been upon a dead level ; and this , i suppose , was owing to the speed at which we revolved .
" the rays of the moon seemed to search the very bottom of the profound gulf ; but still i could make out nothing distinctly , on account of a thick mist in which everything there was enveloped , and over which there <name> a magnificent rainbow , like that narrow and tottering bridge which <unk> say is the only pathway between time and eternity .
this mist , or spray , was no doubt occasioned by the <unk> of the great walls of the funnel , as they all met together at the bottom  but the yell that went up to the heavens from out of that mist , i dare not attempt to describe .
" our first slide into the abyss itself , from the belt of foam above , had carried us a great distance down the slope ; but our farther descent was by no means proportionate .
round and round we swept  not with any uniform movement  but in <unk> swings and jerks , that sent us sometimes only a few hundred yards  sometimes nearly the complete circuit of the whirl .
our progress downward , at each revolution , was slow , but very perceptible .
" looking about me upon the wide waste of liquid <name> on which we were thus borne , i perceived that our boat was not the only object in the embrace of the whirl .
both above and below us were visible fragments of vessels , large masses of building timber and trunks of trees , with many smaller articles , such as pieces of house furniture , broken boxes , barrels and staves .
i have already described the unnatural curiosity which had taken the place of my original terrors .
it appeared to grow upon me as i <name> nearer and nearer to my dreadful doom .
i now began to watch , with a strange interest , the numerous things that floated in our company .
i must have been delirious  for i even sought amusement in speculating upon the relative <unk> of their several <unk> toward the foam below .
'this fir tree , ' i found myself at one time saying , 'will certainly be the next thing that takes the awful plunge and disappears , '  and then i was disappointed to find that the wreck of a dutch merchant ship overtook it and went down before .
at length , after making several guesses of this nature , and being deceived in all  this fact  the fact of my invariable <unk>  set me upon a train of reflection that made my limbs again tremble , and my heart beat heavily once more .
" it was not a new terror that thus affected me , but the <name> of a more exciting <name> .
this <name> arose partly from memory , and partly from present observation .
i called to mind the great variety of buoyant matter that strewed the coast of <unk> , having been absorbed and then thrown forth by the <unk> .
by far the greater number of the articles were shattered in the most extraordinary way  so chafed and roughened as to have the appearance of being stuck full of splinters  but then i distinctly recollected that there were some of them which were not disfigured at all .
now i could not account for this difference except by supposing that the roughened fragments were the only ones which had been completely absorbed  that the others had entered the whirl at so late a period of the tide , or , for some reason , had descended so slowly after entering , that they did not reach the bottom before the turn of the flood came , or of the ebb , as the case might be .
i conceived it possible , in either instance , that they might thus be whirled up again to the level of the ocean , without undergoing the fate of those which had been drawn in more early , or absorbed more rapidly .
i made , also , three important observations .
the first was , that , as a general rule , the larger the bodies were , the more rapid their descent  the second , that , between two masses of equal extent , the one spherical , and the other of any other shape , the superiority in speed of descent was with the sphere  the third , that , between two masses of equal size , the one cylindrical , and the other of any other shape , the cylinder was absorbed the more slowly .
since my escape , i have had several conversations on this subject with an old <unk> of the district ; and it was from him that i learned the use of the words <unk> ' and <unk> . '
he explained to me  although i have forgotten the explanation  how what i observed was , in fact , the natural consequence of the forms of the floating fragments  and showed me how it happened that a cylinder , swimming in a vortex , offered more resistance to its <unk> , and was drawn in with greater difficulty than an equally bulky body , of any form whatever .
( *1 ) " there was one startling circumstance which went a great way in enforcing these observations , and rendering me anxious to turn them to account , and this was that , at every revolution , we passed something like a barrel , or else the yard or the mast of a vessel , while many of these things , which had been on our level when i first opened my eyes upon the wonders of the whirlpool , were now high up above us , and seemed to have moved but little from their original station .
" i no longer hesitated what to do .
i resolved to lash myself securely to the water cask upon which i now held , to cut it loose from the counter , and to throw myself with it into the water .
i attracted my brother's attention by signs , pointed to the floating barrels that came near us , and did everything in my power to make him understand what i was about to do .
i thought at length that he comprehended my design  but , whether this was the case or not , he shook his head despairingly , and refused to move from his station by the <unk> .
it was impossible to reach him ; the emergency admitted of no delay ; and so , with a bitter struggle , i resigned him to his fate , fastened myself to the cask by means of the lashings which secured it to the counter , and precipitated myself with it into the sea , without another moment 's hesitation .
" the result was precisely what i had hoped it might be .
as it is myself who now tell you this tale  as you see that i did escape  and as you are already in possession of the mode in which this escape was effected , and must therefore anticipate all that i have farther to say  i <name> bring my story quickly to conclusion .
it might have been an hour , or <unk> , after my quitting the smack , when , having descended to a vast distance beneath me , it made three or four wild <unk> in rapid succession , and , bearing my loved brother with it , plunged headlong , at once and forever , into the chaos of foam below .
the barrel to which i was attached sunk very little farther than half the distance between the bottom of the gulf and the spot at which i leaped overboard , before a great change took place in the character of the whirlpool .
the slope of the sides of the vast funnel became momently less and less steep .
the <unk> of the whirl grew , gradually , less and less violent .
by degrees , the froth and the rainbow disappeared , and the bottom of the gulf seemed slowly to <unk> .
the sky was clear , the winds had gone down , and the full moon was setting <unk> in the west , when i found myself on the surface of the ocean , in full view of the shores of <unk> , and above the spot where the pool of the <unk> had been .
it was the hour of the slack  but the sea still heaved in mountainous waves from the effects of the hurricane .
i was borne violently into the channel of the <unk> , and in a few minutes was hurried down the coast into the <unk> ' of the fishermen .
a boat picked me up  exhausted from fatigue  and ( now that the danger was removed ) speechless from the memory of its horror .
those who <name> me on board were my old mates and daily companions  but they knew me no more than they would have known a traveller from the <unk> .
my hair which had been <unk> the day before , was as white as you see it now .
they say too that the whole expression of my countenance had changed .
i told them my story  they did not believe it .
i now tell it to you  and i can scarcely expect you to put more <name> in it than did the <name> fishermen of <unk> . "
<name> kempelen and his discovery after the very minute and elaborate paper by arago , to say nothing of the summary in <unk> 's journal , ' with the detailed statement just published by lieutenant <unk> , it <name> not be supposed , of course , that in offering a few hurried remarks in reference to <name> <unk> discovery , i have any design to look at the subject in a scientific point of view .
my object is simply , in the first place , to say a few words of <name> kempelen himself ( with whom , some years ago , i had the honor of a slight personal acquaintance ) , since every thing which concerns him must necessarily , at this moment , be of interest ; and , in the second place , to look in a general way , and <unk> , at the results of the discovery .
it may be as well , however , to premise the cursory observations which i have to offer , by denying , very decidedly , what seems to be a general impression ( <unk> , as usual in a case of this kind , from the newspapers ) , viz .
: that this discovery , astounding as it unquestionably is , is <unk> .
by reference to the <unk> of sir humphrey davy ' ( <unk> and <unk> , london , pp .
150 ) , it <name> be seen at pp .
53 and 82 , that this illustrious chemist had not only conceived the idea now in question , but had actually made no inconsiderable progress , experimentally , in the very identical analysis now so triumphantly brought to an issue by <name> kempelen , who although he makes not the slightest allusion to it , is , without doubt ( i say it unhesitatingly , and can prove it , if required ) , indebted to the <unk> ' for at least the first hint of his own undertaking .
the paragraph from the <unk> and <unk> , ' which is now going the rounds of the press , and which <unk> to claim the invention for a mr. <unk> , of <unk> , maine , appears to me , i confess , a little <unk> , for several reasons ; although there is nothing either impossible or very improbable in the statement made .
i need not go into details .
my opinion of the paragraph is founded principally upon its manner .
it does not look true .
persons who are <unk> facts , are seldom so particular as mr. <unk> seems to be , about day and date and precise location .
besides , if mr. <unk> actually did come upon the discovery he says he did , at the period designated  nearly eight years ago  how happens it that he took no steps , on the instant , to reap the immense benefits which the merest <unk> must have known would have resulted to him individually , if not to the world at large , from the discovery ?
it seems to me quite incredible that any man of common understanding could have discovered what mr. <unk> says he did , and yet have subsequently acted so like a baby  so like an owl  as mr. <unk> admits that he did .
<unk> , who is mr. <unk> ?
and is not the whole paragraph in the <unk> and <unk> ' a <unk> got up to 'make a talk ' ?
it must be confessed that it has an amazingly <unk> .
very little dependence is to be placed upon it , in my humble opinion ; and if i were not well aware , from experience , how very easily men of science are mystified , on points out of their usual range of inquiry , i should be profoundly astonished at finding so eminent a chemist as professor <unk> , discussing mr. <unk> 's ( or is it mr .
<unk> 's ? )
pretensions to the discovery , in so serious a tone .
but to return to the <unk> ' of sir humphrey davy .
this pamphlet was not designed for the public eye , even upon the decease of the writer , as any person at all conversant with authorship may satisfy himself at once by the slightest inspection of the style .
at <name> 13 , for example , near the middle , we read , in reference to his researches about the protoxide of <unk> : 'in less than half a minute the respiration being continued , diminished gradually and were succeeded by analogous to gentle pressure on all the muscles . '
that the respiration was not <unk> , ' is not only clear by the subsequent <unk> , but by the use of the plural , 'were . '
the sentence , no doubt , was thus intended : 'in less than half a minute , the respiration [ being continued , these feelings ] diminished gradually , and were succeeded by [ a sensation ] analogous to gentle pressure on all the muscles . '
a hundred similar instances go to show that the ms. so <unk> published , was merely a rough note-book , meant only for the writer 's own eye , but an inspection of the pamphlet <name> convince almost any thinking person of the truth of my suggestion .
the fact is , sir humphrey davy was about the last man in the world to commit himself on scientific topics .
not only had he a more than ordinary dislike to <unk> , but he was <unk> afraid of appearing <unk> ; so that , however fully he might have been convinced that he was on the right track in the matter now in question , he would never have spoken out , until he had every thing ready for the most practical demonstration .
i verily believe that his last moments would have been rendered wretched , could he have suspected that his wishes in regard to burning this <unk> ' ( full of crude speculations ) would have been unattended to ; as , it seems , they were .
i say 'his wishes , ' for that he meant to include this note-book among the miscellaneous papers directed 'to be burnt , ' i think there can be no manner of doubt .
whether it escaped the flames by good fortune or by bad , yet remains to be seen .
that the passages quoted above , with the other similar ones referred to , gave <name> kempelen the hint , i do not in the slightest degree question ; but i repeat , it yet remains to be seen whether this momentous discovery itself ( momentous under any circumstances ) <name> be of service or <unk> to mankind at large .
that <name> kempelen and his immediate friends <name> reap a <name> harvest , it would be folly to doubt for a moment .
they <name> scarcely be so weak as not to <unk> , ' in time , by large purchases of houses and land , with other property of intrinsic value .
in the brief account of <name> kempelen which appeared in the <unk> journal , ' and has since been extensively copied , several <unk> of the <name> original seem to have been made by the translator , who professes to have taken the passage from a late number of the <unk> <unk> . '
<unk> ' has evidently been <unk> ( as it often is ) , and what the translator renders by <unk> , ' is probably <unk> , ' which , in its true version , <unk> , ' would give a totally different complexion to the whole account ; but , of course , much of this is merely guess , on my part .
<name> kempelen , however , is by no means 'a <unk> , ' in appearance , at least , whatever he may be in fact .
my acquaintance with him was casual altogether ; and i am scarcely warranted in saying that i know him at all ; but to have seen and conversed with a man of so prodigious a notoriety as he has attained , or <name> attain in a few days , is not a small matter , as times go .
'the literary world ' speaks of him , confidently , as a native of <unk> ( misled , perhaps , by the account in 'the home journal ' ) but i am pleased in being able to state positively , since i have it from his own lips , that he was born in <unk> , in the state of new york , although both his parents , i believe , are of <unk> descent .
the family is connected , in some way , with maelzel , of <unk> memory .
in person , he is short and stout , with large , fat , blue eyes , <name> hair and whiskers , a wide but pleasing mouth , fine teeth , and i think a <name> nose .
there is some defect in one of his feet .
his address is <name> , and his whole manner noticeable for <unk> .
altogether , he looks , speaks , and acts as little like 'a <unk> ' as any man i ever saw .
we were <unk> for a week about six years ago , at <name> 's hotel , in providence , rhode island ; and i presume that i conversed with him , at various times , for some three or four hours altogether .
his principal topics were those of the day , and nothing that fell from him led me to suspect his scientific attainments .
he left the hotel before me , intending to go to new york , and thence to <unk> ; it was in the latter city that his great discovery was first made public ; or , rather , it was there that he was first suspected of having made it .
this is about all that i personally know of the now immortal <name> kempelen ; but i have thought that even these few details would have interest for the public .
there can be little question that most of the marvellous rumors afloat about this affair are pure inventions , entitled to about as much credit as the story of aladdin 's lamp ; and yet , in a case of this kind , as in the case of the discoveries in california , it is clear that the truth may be stranger than fiction .
the following anecdote , at least , is so well authenticated , that we may receive it implicitly .
<name> kempelen had never been even tolerably well off during his residence at <unk> ; and often , it was well known , he had been put to extreme shifts in order to raise trifling sums .
when the great excitement occurred about the forgery on the house of <unk> & co. , suspicion was directed toward <name> kempelen , on account of his having purchased a considerable property in <unk> <name> , and his refusing , when questioned , to explain how he became possessed of the purchase money .
he was at length arrested , but nothing decisive appearing against him , was in the end set at <name> .
the police , however , kept a strict watch upon his movements , and thus discovered that he left home frequently , taking always the same road , and invariably giving his watchers the slip in the neighborhood of that labyrinth of narrow and crooked passages known by the flash name of the <unk> . '
finally , by dint of great perseverance , they traced him to a <name> in an old house of seven stories , in an alley called <unk> ,  and , coming upon him suddenly , found him , as they imagined , in the midst of his <unk> operations .
his agitation is represented as so excessive that the officers had not the slightest doubt of his guilt .
after <unk> him , they searched his room , or rather rooms , for it appears he occupied all the <unk> .
opening into the <name> where they caught him , was a closet , ten feet by eight , fitted up with some chemical apparatus , of which the object has not yet been ascertained .
in one corner of the closet was a very small furnace , with a glowing fire in it , and on the fire a kind of duplicate crucible  two <unk> connected by a tube .
one of these <unk> was nearly full of lead in a state of fusion , but not reaching up to the aperture of the tube , which was close to the brim .
the other crucible had some liquid in it , which , as the officers entered , seemed to be furiously <unk> in vapor .
they relate that , on finding himself taken , kempelen seized the <unk> with both hands ( which were encased in gloves that afterwards turned out to be <unk> ) , and threw the contents on the tiled floor .
it was now that they <unk> him ; and before proceeding to ransack the premises they searched his person , but nothing unusual was found about him , excepting a paper parcel , in his <unk> , containing what was afterward ascertained to be a mixture of antimony and some unknown substance , in nearly , but not quite , equal proportions .
all attempts at analyzing the unknown substance have , so far , failed , but that it <name> ultimately be analyzed , is not to be doubted .
passing out of the closet with their prisoner , the officers went through a sort of <unk> , in which nothing material was found , to the chemist 's <unk> .
they here rummaged some drawers and boxes , but discovered only a few papers , of no importance , and some good coin , silver and gold .
at length , looking under the bed , they saw a large , common hair trunk , without hinges , <unk> , or lock , and with the top lying carelessly across the bottom portion .
upon attempting to draw this trunk out from under the bed , they found that , with their united strength ( there were three of them , all powerful men ) , they 'could not stir it one inch . '
much astonished at this , one of them crawled under the bed , and looking into the trunk , said : 'no wonder we could n't move it  why it 's full to the brim of old bits of brass ! '
putting his feet , now , against the wall so as to get a good purchase , and pushing with all his force , while his companions pulled with all theirs , the trunk , with much difficulty , was slid out from under the bed , and its contents examined .
the supposed brass with which it was filled was all in small , smooth pieces , varying from the size of a pea to that of a dollar ; but the pieces were irregular in shape , although more or less <unk> , upon the whole , 'very much as lead looks when thrown upon the ground in a molten state , and there suffered to grow cool . '
now , not one of these officers for a moment suspected this metal to be any thing but brass .
the idea of its being gold never entered their brains , of course ; how could such a wild fancy have entered it ?
and their astonishment may be well conceived , when the next day it became known , all over <unk> , that the <unk> of brass ' which they had carted so contemptuously to the police office , without putting themselves to the trouble of <unk> the smallest scrap , was not only gold  real gold  but gold far finer than any employed in <unk> , in fact , absolutely pure , virgin , without the slightest appreciable alloy .
i need not go over the details of <name> kempelen 's confession ( as far as it went ) and release , for these are familiar to the public .
that he has actually realized , in spirit and in effect , if not to the letter , the old <unk> of the philosopher 's stone , no sane person is at <name> to doubt .
the opinions of arago are , of course , entitled to the greatest consideration ; but he is by no means infallible ; and what he says of <unk> , in his report to the academy , must be taken cum <unk> <unk> .
the simple truth is , that up to this period all analysis has failed ; and until <name> kempelen chooses to let us have the key to his own published enigma , it is more than probable that the matter <name> remain , for years , in <unk> quo .
all that as yet can fairly be said to be known is , that <unk> gold can be made at <name> , and very readily from lead in connection with certain other substances , in kind and in proportions , unknown . '
speculation , of course , is busy as to the immediate and ultimate results of this discovery  a discovery which few thinking persons <name> hesitate in referring to an increased interest in the matter of gold generally , by the late developments in california ; and this reflection brings us inevitably to another  the exceeding <unk> of <name> <unk> analysis .
if many were prevented from <unk> to california , by the mere apprehension that gold would so materially diminish in value , on account of its <unk> in the mines there , as to render the speculation of going so far in search of it a doubtful one  what impression <name> be wrought now , upon the minds of those about to emigrate , and especially upon the minds of those actually in the mineral region , by the announcement of this astounding discovery of <name> kempelen ?
a discovery which declares , in so many words , that beyond its intrinsic worth for manufacturing purposes ( whatever that worth may be ) , gold now is , or at least soon <name> be ( for it can not be supposed that <name> kempelen can long retain his secret ) , of no greater value than lead , and of far inferior value to silver .
it is , indeed , exceedingly difficult to speculate <unk> upon the consequences of the discovery , but one thing may be positively maintained  that the announcement of the discovery six months ago would have had material influence in regard to the settlement of california .
in europe , as yet , the most noticeable results have been a rise of two hundred per cent .
in the price of lead , and nearly twenty-five per cent .
that of silver .
mesmeric revelation whatever doubt may still envelop the <unk> of mesmerism , its startling facts are now almost universally admitted .
of these latter , those who doubt , are your mere <unk> by profession  an unprofitable and disreputable tribe .
there can be no more absolute waste of time than the attempt to prove , at the present day , that man , by mere exercise of <name> , can so impress his fellow , as to cast him into an abnormal condition , of which the phenomena resemble very closely those of death , or at least resemble them more nearly than they do the phenomena of any other normal condition within our cognizance ; that , while in this state , the person so impressed employs only with effort , and then feebly , the external organs of sense , yet perceives , with keenly refined perception , and through channels supposed unknown , matters beyond the scope of the physical organs ; that , moreover , his intellectual faculties are wonderfully exalted and <unk> ; that his sympathies with the person so impressing him are profound ; and , finally , that his susceptibility to the impression increases with its frequency , while , in the same proportion , the peculiar phenomena elicited are more extended and more pronounced .
i say that these  which are the laws of mesmerism in its general features  it would be <unk> to demonstrate ; nor shall i inflict upon my readers so needless a demonstration ; to-day .
my purpose at present is a very different one indeed .
i am impelled , even in the teeth of a world of prejudice , to detail without comment the very remarkable substance of a colloquy , occurring between a <unk> and myself .
i had been long in the habit of <unk> the person in question , ( mr. <unk> , ) and the usual acute susceptibility and exaltation of the mesmeric perception had supervened .
for many months he had been laboring under confirmed <unk> , the more distressing effects of which had been relieved by my <unk> ; and on the night of wednesday , the fifteenth instant , i was summoned to his bedside .
the invalid was suffering with acute pain in the region of the heart , and breathed with great difficulty , having all the ordinary symptoms of <unk> .
in spasms such as these he had usually found relief from the application of mustard to the nervous centres , but to-night this had been attempted in vain .
as i entered his room he greeted me with a cheerful smile , and although evidently in much bodily pain , appeared to be , mentally , quite at ease .
" i sent for you to-night , " he said , " not so much to administer to my bodily ailment , as to satisfy me concerning certain <unk> impressions which , of late , have occasioned me much anxiety and surprise .
i need not tell you how sceptical i have hitherto been on the topic of the soul 's immortality .
i can not deny that there has always existed , as if in that very soul which i have been denying , a vague <unk> of its own existence .
but this <unk> at no time amounted to conviction .
with it my reason had nothing to do .
all attempts at logical inquiry resulted , indeed , in leaving me more sceptical than before .
i had been advised to study cousin .
i studied him in his own works as well as in those of his european and american echoes .
the <unk> <name> ' of mr. <unk> , for example , was placed in my hands .
i read it with profound attention .
throughout i found it logical , but the portions which were not merely logical were unhappily the initial arguments of the <unk> hero of the book .
in his summing up it seemed evident to me that the <unk> had not even succeeded in convincing himself .
his end had plainly forgotten his beginning , like the government of <unk> .
in short , i was not long in perceiving that if man is to be intellectually convinced of his own immortality , he <name> never be so convinced by the mere <unk> which have been so long the fashion of the <unk> of england , of <name> , and of germany .
<unk> may amuse and exercise , but take no hold on the mind .
here upon earth , at least , philosophy , i am persuaded , <name> always in vain call upon us to look upon qualities as things .
the <name> may assent  the soul  the intellect , never .
" i repeat , then , that i only half felt , and never intellectually believed .
but latterly there has been a certain deepening of the feeling , until it has come so nearly to resemble the acquiescence of reason , that i find it difficult to distinguish between the two .
i am enabled , too , plainly to trace this effect to the mesmeric influence .
i can not better explain my meaning than by the hypothesis that the mesmeric exaltation enables me to perceive a train of <unk> which , in my abnormal existence , convinces , but which , in full accordance with the mesmeric phenomena , does not extend , except through its effect , into my normal condition .
in <unk> , the reasoning and its conclusion  the cause and its effect  are present together .
in my natural state , the cause vanishing , the effect only , and perhaps only partially , remains .
" these considerations have led me to think that some good results might ensue from a series of <unk> questions propounded to me while <unk> .
you have often observed the profound <unk> evinced by the <unk>  the extensive knowledge he displays upon all points relating to the mesmeric condition itself ; and from this <unk> may be deduced hints for the proper conduct of a catechism . "
i consented of course to make this experiment .
a few passes threw mr. <unk> into the mesmeric sleep .
his breathing became immediately more easy , and he seemed to suffer no physical uneasiness .
the following conversation then ensued :  v. in the dialogue representing the patient , and p. myself .
 p. are you asleep ?
 v. yes  no i would rather sleep more soundly .
p. [ after a few more <unk> ] do you sleep now ?
v. yes .
p. how do you think your present illness <name> result ?
v. [ after a long hesitation and speaking as if with effort . ]
i must die .
p. does the idea of death afflict you ?
v. [ very quickly . ]
no  no !
p. are you pleased with the prospect ?
v. if i were awake i should like to die , but now it is no matter .
the mesmeric condition is so near death as to content me .
p. i wish you would explain yourself , mr. <unk> .
v. i am willing to do so , but it requires more effort than i feel able to make .
you do not question me properly .
p. what then shall i ask ?
v. you must begin at the beginning .
p. the beginning !
but where is the beginning ?
v. you know that the beginning is god .
[ this was said in a low , fluctuating tone , and with every sign of the most profound veneration . ]
p. what then is god ?
v. [ hesitating for many <unk> ] i can not tell .
p. is not god spirit ?
v. while i was awake i knew what you meant by " spirit , " but now it seems only a word  such for instance as truth , beauty  a quality , i mean .
p. is not god immaterial ?
v. there is no <unk>  it is a mere word .
that which is not matter , is not at all  unless qualities are things .
p. is god , then , material ?
v. no .
[ this reply startled me very <unk> ] p. what then is he ?
v. [ after a long pause , and <unk> ] i see  but it is a thing difficult to tell .
[ another long <unk> ] he is not spirit , for he exists .
nor is he matter , as you understand it .
but there are gradations of matter of which man knows nothing ; the <unk> impelling the finer , the finer pervading the <unk> .
the atmosphere , for example , impels the electric principle , while the electric principle <unk> the atmosphere .
these gradations of matter increase in rarity or <unk> , until we arrive at a matter <unk>  without particles  <unk>  one and here the law of <unk> and <unk> is modified .
the ultimate , or <unk> matter , not only <unk> all things but impels all things  and thus is all things within itself .
this matter is god .
what men attempt to embody in the word " thought , " is this matter in motion .
p. the <unk> maintain that all action is <unk> to motion and thinking , and that the latter is the origin of the former .
v. yes ; and i now see the confusion of idea .
motion is the action of mind  not of thinking .
the <unk> matter , or god , in quiescence , is ( as nearly as we can conceive it ) what men call mind .
and the power of <unk> ( equivalent in effect to human volition ) is , in the <unk> matter , the result of its unity and <unk> ; how i know not , and now clearly see that i shall never know .
but the <unk> matter , set in motion by a law , or quality , existing within itself , is thinking .
p. can you give me no more precise idea of what you term the <unk> matter ?
v. the matters of which man is cognizant , escape the senses in gradation .
we have , for example , a metal , a piece of wood , a drop of water , the atmosphere , a gas , <unk> , electricity , the <unk> ether .
now we call all these things matter , and embrace all matter in one general definition ; but in spite of this , there can be no two ideas more essentially distinct than that which we attach to a metal , and that which we attach to the <unk> ether .
when we reach the latter , we feel an almost irresistible inclination to class it with spirit , or with <unk> .
the only consideration which <unk> us is our <name> of its atomic constitution ; and here , even , we have to seek aid from our notion of an atom , as something possessing in infinite minuteness , solidity , <unk> , weight .
destroy the idea of the atomic constitution and we should no longer be able to regard the ether as an entity , or at least as matter .
for want of a better word we might term it spirit .
take , now , a step beyond the <unk> ether  conceive a matter as much more rare than the ether , as this ether is more rare than the metal , and we arrive at once ( in spite of all the school dogmas ) at a unique mass  an <unk> matter .
for although we may admit infinite littleness in the atoms themselves , the infinitude of littleness in the spaces between them is an absurdity .
there <name> be a point  there <name> be a degree of rarity , at which , if the atoms are sufficiently numerous , the interspaces must vanish , and the mass absolutely coalesce .
but the consideration of the atomic constitution being now taken away , the nature of the mass inevitably glides into what we conceive of spirit .
it is clear , however , that it is as fully matter as before .
the truth is , it is impossible to conceive spirit , since it is impossible to imagine what is not .
when we flatter ourselves that we have formed its <name> , we have merely deceived our understanding by the consideration of infinitely <unk> matter .
p. there seems to me an insurmountable objection to the idea of absolute <unk> ;  and that is the very slight resistance experienced by the heavenly bodies in their revolutions through space  a resistance now ascertained , it is true , to exist in some degree , but which is , nevertheless , so slight as to have been quite overlooked by the sagacity even of <name> .
we know that the resistance of bodies is , chiefly , in proportion to their density .
absolute <unk> is absolute density .
where there are no interspaces , there can be no yielding .
an ether , absolutely dense , would put an infinitely more effectual stop to the progress of a <name> than would an ether of <unk> or of iron .
v. your objection is answered with an ease which is nearly in the ratio of its apparent <unk>  as regards the progress of the <name> , it can make no difference whether the <name> passes through the ether or the ether through it .
there is no astronomical error more unaccountable than that which <unk> the known retardation of the comets with the idea of their passage through an ether : for , however rare this ether be supposed , it would put a stop to all <unk> revolution in a very far <unk> period than has been admitted by those astronomers who have endeavored to slur over a point which they found it impossible to comprehend .
the retardation actually experienced is , on the other hand , about that which might be expected from the friction of the ether in the instantaneous passage through the orb .
in the one case , the retarding force is momentary and complete within itself  in the other it is <unk> accumulative .
p. but in all this  in this identification of mere matter with god  is there nothing of irreverence ?
[ i was forced to repeat this question before the <unk> fully comprehended my meaning . ]
v. can you say why matter should be less <unk> than mind ?
but you forget that the matter of which i speak is , in all respects , the very " mind " or " spirit " of the schools , so far as regards its high capacities , and is , moreover , the " matter " of these schools at the same time .
god , with all the powers attributed to spirit , is but the perfection of matter .
p. you assert , then , that the <unk> matter , in motion , is thought ?
v. in general , this motion is the universal thought of the universal mind .
this thought creates .
all created things are but the thoughts of god .
p. you say , " in general . "
v. yes .
the universal mind is god .
for new <unk> , matter is necessary .
p. but you now speak of " mind " and " matter " as do the <unk> .
v. yes  to avoid confusion .
when i say " mind , " i mean the <unk> or ultimate matter ; by " matter , " i intend all else .
p. you were saying that " for new <unk> matter is necessary . "
v. yes ; for mind , existing <unk> , is merely god .
to create individual , thinking beings , it was necessary to incarnate portions of the divine mind .
thus man is <unk> .
divested of <unk> <unk> , he were god .
now , the particular motion of the <unk> portions of the <unk> matter is the thought of man ; as the motion of the whole is that of god .
p. you say that divested of the body man <name> be god ?
v. [ after much <unk> ] i could not have said this ; it is an absurdity .
p. [ referring to my <unk> ] you did say that " divested of <unk> <unk> man were god . "
v. and this is true .
man thus divested would be god  would be <unk> .
but he can never be thus divested  at least never <name> be  else we must imagine an action of god returning upon itself  a purposeless and futile action .
man is a creature .
creatures are thoughts of god .
it is the nature of thought to be <unk> .
p. i do not comprehend .
you say that man <name> never put off the body ?
v. i say that he <name> never be <unk> .
p. explain .
v. there are two bodies  the rudimental and the complete ; corresponding with the two conditions of the worm and the butterfly .
what we call " death , " is but the painful metamorphosis .
our present incarnation is progressive , preparatory , temporary .
our future is perfected , ultimate , immortal .
the ultimate life is the full design .
p. but of the worm 's metamorphosis we are palpably cognizant .
v. we , certainly  but not the worm .
the matter of which our rudimental body is composed , is within the <name> of the organs of that body ; or , more distinctly , our rudimental organs are adapted to the matter of which is formed the rudimental body ; but not to that of which the ultimate is composed .
the ultimate body thus escapes our rudimental senses , and we perceive only the shell which falls , in decaying , from the inner form ; not that inner form itself ; but this inner form , as well as the shell , is appreciable by those who have already acquired the ultimate life .
p. you have often said that the mesmeric state very nearly resembles death .
how is this ?
v. when i say that it resembles death , i mean that it resembles the ultimate life ; for when i am entranced the senses of my rudimental life are in abeyance , and i perceive external things directly , without organs , through a medium which i shall employ in the ultimate , <unk> life .
p. <unk> ?
v. yes ; organs are contrivances by which the individual is brought into sensible relation with particular classes and forms of matter , to the exclusion of other classes and forms .
the organs of man are adapted to his rudimental condition , and to that only ; his ultimate condition , being <unk> , is of unlimited comprehension in all points but one  the nature of the volition of god  that is to say , the motion of the <unk> matter .
you <name> have a distinct idea of the ultimate body by conceiving it to be entire <name> .
this it is not ; but a <name> of this nature <name> bring you near a comprehension of what it is .
a luminous body imparts vibration to the <unk> ether .
the vibrations generate similar ones within the retina ; these again communicate similar ones to the optic nerve .
the nerve conveys similar ones to the <name> ; the <name> , also , similar ones to the <unk> matter which <unk> it .
the motion of this latter is thought , of which perception is the first <unk> .
this is the mode by which the mind of the rudimental life communicates with the external world ; and this external world is , to the rudimental life , limited , through the <unk> of its organs .
but in the ultimate , <unk> life , the external world reaches the whole body , ( which is of a substance having affinity to <name> , as i have said , ) with no other intervention than that of an infinitely rarer ether than even the <unk> ; and to this ether  in unison with it  the whole body <unk> , setting in motion the <unk> matter which <unk> it .
it is to the absence of <unk> organs , therefore , that we must attribute the nearly unlimited perception of the ultimate life .
to rudimental beings , organs are the cages necessary to confine them until <unk> .
p. you speak of rudimental " beings . "
are there other rudimental thinking beings than man ?
v. the multitudinous <unk> of rare matter into <unk> , planets , suns , and other bodies which are neither <unk> , suns , nor planets , is for the sole purpose of supplying <unk> for the <unk> of the organs of an infinity of rudimental beings .
but for the necessity of the rudimental , prior to the ultimate life , there would have been no bodies such as these .
each of these is tenanted by a distinct variety of organic , rudimental , thinking creatures .
in all , the organs vary with the features of the place tenanted .
at death , or metamorphosis , these creatures , enjoying the ultimate life  immortality  and cognizant of all secrets but the one , act all things and pass everywhere by mere volition :  <unk> , not the stars , which to us seem the sole <unk> , and for the accommodation of which we blindly deem space created  but that space itself  that infinity of which the truly substantive vastness swallows up the <unk>  blotting them out as <unk> from the perception of the angels .
p. you say that " but for the necessity of the rudimental life " there would have been no stars .
but why this necessity ?
v. in the inorganic life , as well as in the inorganic matter generally , there is nothing to impede the action of one simple unique law  the divine volition .
with the view of producing impediment , the organic life and matter , ( complex , substantial , and <unk> , ) were contrived .
p. but again  why need this impediment have been produced ?
v. the result of law <unk> is perfection  right  negative happiness .
the result of law violate is imperfection , wrong , positive pain .
through the <unk> afforded by the number , complexity , and <unk> of the laws of organic life and matter , the violation of law is rendered , to a certain extent , practicable .
thus pain , which in the inorganic life is impossible , is possible in the organic .
p. but to what good end is pain thus rendered possible ?
v. all things are either good or bad by comparison .
a sufficient analysis <name> show that pleasure , in all cases , is but the contrast of pain .
positive pleasure is a mere idea .
to be happy at any one point we must have suffered at the same .
never to suffer would have been never to have been blessed .
but it has been shown that , in the inorganic life , pain can not be thus the necessity for the organic .
the pain of the primitive life of earth , is the sole basis of the bliss of the ultimate life in heaven .
p. still , there is one of your expressions which i find it impossible to comprehend  " the truly substantive vastness of infinity . "
v. this , probably , is because you have no sufficiently generic <name> of the term " substance " itself .
we must not regard it as a quality , but as a sentiment :  it is the perception , in thinking beings , of the adaptation of matter to their organization .
there are many things on the earth , which would be <unk> to the inhabitants of <name>  many things visible and tangible in <name> , which we could not be brought to appreciate as existing at all .
but to the inorganic beings  to the angels  the whole of the <unk> matter is substance  that is to say , the whole of what we term " space " is to them the truest <unk> ;  the stars , meantime , through what we consider their <unk> , escaping the <name> sense , just in proportion as the <unk> matter , through what we consider its <unk> , <unk> the organic .
as the <unk> pronounced these latter words , in a feeble tone , i observed on his countenance a singular expression , which somewhat alarmed me , and induced me to awake him at once .
no sooner had i done this , than , with a bright smile <unk> all his features , he fell back upon his pillow and expired .
i noticed that in less than a minute afterward his corpse had all the stern rigidity of stone .
his brow was of the coldness of ice .
thus , ordinarily , should it have appeared , only after long pressure from <unk> 's hand .
had the <unk> , indeed , during the latter portion of his discourse , been addressing me from out the region of the shadows ?
the facts in the case of m. valdemar of course i shall not pretend to consider it any matter for wonder , that the extraordinary case of m. valdemar has excited discussion .
it would have been a miracle had it <unk> under the circumstances .
through the <name> of all parties concerned , to keep the affair from the public , at least for the present , or until we had farther opportunities for investigation  through our endeavors to effect this  a <unk> or exaggerated account made its way into society , and became the source of many unpleasant <unk> , and , very naturally , of a great deal of disbelief .
it is now rendered necessary that i give the facts  as far as i comprehend them myself .
they are , <unk> , these : my attention , for the last three years , had been repeatedly drawn to the subject of mesmerism ; and , about nine months ago it occurred to me , quite suddenly , that in the series of experiments made hitherto , there had been a very remarkable and most unaccountable omission :  no person had as yet been <unk> in <unk> <unk> .
it remained to be seen , first , whether , in such condition , there existed in the patient any susceptibility to the magnetic influence ; secondly , whether , if any existed , it was impaired or increased by the condition ; thirdly , to what extent , or for how long a period , the encroachments of death might be arrested by the process .
there were other points to be ascertained , but these most excited my curiosity  the last in especial , from the immensely important character of its consequences .
in looking around me for some subject by whose means i might test these particulars , i was brought to think of my friend , m. <name> valdemar , the well-known <unk> of the " <unk> <unk> , " and author ( under the nom de plume of <unk> <name> ) of the polish <unk> of " <unk> " and " <unk> . "
m. valdemar , who has resided principally at <unk> , <unk> , since the year 1839 , is ( or was ) particularly noticeable for the extreme <unk> of his person  his lower limbs much resembling those of <name> <name> ; and , also , for the whiteness of his whiskers , in violent contrast to the blackness of his hair  the latter , in consequence , being very generally mistaken for a wig .
his temperament was <unk> nervous , and rendered him a good subject for mesmeric experiment .
on two or three occasions i had put him to sleep with little difficulty , but was disappointed in other results which his peculiar constitution had naturally led me to anticipate .
his <name> was at no period positively , or thoroughly , under my control , and in regard to <unk> , i could accomplish with him nothing to be relied upon .
i always attributed my failure at these points to the disordered state of his health .
for some months previous to my becoming acquainted with him , his physicians had declared him in a confirmed <unk> .
it was his custom , indeed , to speak calmly of his approaching dissolution , as of a matter neither to be avoided nor regretted .
when the ideas to which i have alluded first occurred to me , it was of course very natural that i should think of m. valdemar .
i knew the steady philosophy of the man too well to apprehend any scruples from him ; and he had no relatives in <name> who would be likely to interfere .
i spoke to him frankly upon the subject ; and , to my surprise , his interest seemed vividly excited .
i say to my surprise , for , although he had always yielded his person freely to my experiments , he had never before given me any tokens of sympathy with what i did .
his disease was if that character which would admit of exact calculation in respect to the epoch of its termination in death ; and it was finally arranged between us that he would send for me about twenty-four hours before the period announced by his physicians as that of his decease .
it is now rather more than seven months since i received , from m. valdemar himself , the <unk> note : my dear p   , you may as well come now .
d  and f  are agreed that i can not hold out beyond to-morrow midnight ; and i think they have hit the time very nearly .
valdemar i received this note within half an hour after it was written , and in fifteen minutes more i was in the dying man 's chamber .
i had not seen him for ten days , and was appalled by the fearful alteration which the brief interval had wrought in him .
his face wore a leaden <name> ; the eyes were utterly <unk> ; and the <unk> was so extreme that the skin had been broken through by the cheek-bones .
his <unk> was excessive .
the pulse was barely perceptible .
he retained , nevertheless , in a very remarkable manner , both his mental power and a certain degree of physical strength .
he spoke with distinctness  took some <unk> medicines without aid  and , when i entered the room , was occupied in <unk> memoranda in a pocket-book .
he was propped up in the bed by pillows .
doctors d   and f   were in attendance .
after pressing valdemar 's hand , i took these gentlemen aside , and obtained from them a minute account of the patient 's condition .
the left lung had been for eighteen months in a <unk> or <unk> state , and was , of course , entirely useless for all purposes of vitality .
the right , in its upper portion , was also partially , if not thoroughly , <unk> , while the lower region was merely a mass of <unk> <unk> , running one into another .
several extensive <unk> existed ; and , at one point , permanent adhesion to the ribs had taken place .
these appearances in the right lobe were of comparatively recent date .
the <unk> had proceeded with very unusual rapidity ; no sign of it had discovered a month before , and the adhesion had only been observed during the three previous days .
independently of the <unk> , the patient was suspected of <unk> of the <unk> ; but on this point the <unk> symptoms rendered an exact diagnosis impossible .
it was the opinion of both physicians that m. valdemar would die about midnight on the morrow ( <name> ) .
it was then seven o'clock on saturday evening .
on quitting the invalid 's <unk> to hold conversation with myself , doctors d  and f  had bidden him a final farewell .
it had not been their intention to return ; but , at my request , they agreed to look in upon the patient about ten the next night .
when they had gone , i spoke freely with m. valdemar on the subject of his approaching dissolution , as well as , more particularly , of the experiment proposed .
he still professed himself quite willing and even anxious to have it made , and urged me to commence it at once .
a male and a female nurse were in attendance ; but i did not feel myself altogether at <name> to engage in a task of this character with no more reliable witnesses than these people , in case of sudden accident , might prove .
i therefore postponed operations until about eight the next night , when the arrival of a medical student with whom i had some acquaintance , ( mr. <name> l  l , ) relieved me from farther embarrassment .
it had been my design , originally , to wait for the physicians ; but i was induced to proceed , first , by the urgent entreaties of m. valdemar , and secondly , by my conviction that i had not a moment to lose , as he was evidently sinking fast .
mr. l  l was so kind as to accede to my <name> that he would take notes of all that occurred , and it is from his memoranda that what i now have to relate is , for the most part , either condensed or copied verbatim .
it wanted about five minutes of eight when , taking the patient 's hand , i begged him to state , as distinctly as he could , to mr. l  l , whether he ( m. valdemar ) was entirely willing that i should make the experiment of <unk> him in his then condition .
he replied feebly , yet quite audibly , " yes , i wish to be .
i fear you have <unk> "  adding immediately afterwards , " deferred it too long . "
while he spoke thus , i commenced the passes which i had already found most effectual in subduing him .
he was evidently influenced with the first lateral stroke of my hand across his forehead ; but although i exerted all my powers , no farther perceptible effect was induced until some minutes after ten o'clock , when doctors d  and f  called , according to appointment .
i explained to them , in a few words , what i designed , and as they opposed no objection , saying that the patient was already in the death agony , i proceeded without hesitation  exchanging , however , the lateral passes for downward ones , and directing my gaze entirely into the right eye of the sufferer .
by this time his pulse was imperceptible and his breathing was <unk> , and at intervals of half a minute .
this condition was nearly unaltered for a quarter of an hour .
at the expiration of this period , however , a natural although a very deep sigh escaped the bosom of the dying man , and the <unk> breathing ceased  that is to say , its <unk> was no longer apparent ; the intervals were undiminished .
the patient 's extremities were of an icy coldness .
at five minutes before eleven i perceived unequivocal signs of the mesmeric influence .
the glassy roll of the eye was changed for that expression of uneasy inward examination which is never seen except in cases of <unk> , and which it is quite impossible to mistake .
with a few rapid lateral passes i made the lids quiver , as in incipient sleep , and with a few more i closed them altogether .
i was not satisfied , however , with this , but continued the <unk> vigorously , and with the fullest exertion of the <name> , until i had completely stiffened the limbs of the <unk> , after placing them in a seemingly easy position .
the legs were at full length ; the arms were nearly so , and reposed on the bed at a moderate distance from the <unk> .
the head was very slightly elevated .
when i had accomplished this , it was fully midnight , and i requested the gentlemen present to examine m. valdemar 's condition .
after a few experiments , they admitted him to be an unusually perfect state of mesmeric trance .
the curiosity of both the physicians was greatly excited .
dr. d   resolved at once to remain with the patient all night , while dr. f   took leave with a promise to return at daybreak .
mr. l  l and the nurses remained .
we left m. valdemar entirely undisturbed until about three o'clock in the morning , when i approached him and found him in precisely the same condition as when dr. f  went away  that is to say , he lay in the same position ; the pulse was imperceptible ; the breathing was gentle ( scarcely noticeable , unless through the application of a mirror to the lips ) ; the eyes were closed naturally ; and the limbs were as rigid and as cold as marble .
still , the general appearance was certainly not that of death .
as i approached m. valdemar i made a kind of half effort to influence his right arm into pursuit of my own , as i passed the latter gently to and fro above his person .
in such experiments with this patient had never perfectly succeeded before , and assuredly i had little thought of succeeding now ; but to my astonishment , his arm very readily , although feebly , followed every direction i assigned it with mine .
i determined to hazard a few words of conversation .
" m. valdemar , " i said , " are you asleep ? "
he made no answer , but i perceived a tremor about the lips , and was thus induced to repeat the question , again and again .
at its third repetition , his whole frame was agitated by a very slight shivering ; the eyelids <unk> themselves so far as to display a white line of the ball ; the lips moved <unk> , and from between them , in a barely audible whisper , issued the words : " yes ;  asleep now .
do not wake me !  let me die so ! "
i here felt the limbs and found them as rigid as ever .
the right arm , as before , obeyed the direction of my hand .
i questioned the <unk> again : " do you still feel pain in the breast , m .
valdemar ? "
the answer now was immediate , but even less audible than before : " no pain  i am dying . "
i did not think it advisable to disturb him farther just then , and nothing more was said or done until the arrival of dr. f  , who came a little before sunrise , and expressed unbounded astonishment at finding the patient still alive .
after feeling the pulse and applying a mirror to the lips , he requested me to speak to the <unk> again .
i did so , saying : " m. valdemar , do you still sleep ? "
as before , some minutes elapsed ere a reply was made ; and during the interval the dying man seemed to be collecting his energies to speak .
at my fourth repetition of the question , he said very faintly , almost <unk> : " yes ; still asleep  dying . "
it was now the opinion , or rather the wish , of the physicians , that m. valdemar should be suffered to remain undisturbed in his present apparently tranquil condition , until death should <unk>  and this , it was generally agreed , must now take place within a few minutes .
i concluded , however , to speak to him once more , and merely repeated my previous question .
while i spoke , there came a marked change over the countenance of the <unk> .
the eyes rolled themselves slowly open , the pupils disappearing <unk> ; the skin generally assumed a <unk> <name> , resembling not so much parchment as white paper ; and the circular <unk> spots which , hitherto , had been strongly defined in the centre of each cheek , went out at once .
i use this expression , because the suddenness of their departure put me in mind of nothing so much as the <unk> of a candle by a puff of the breath .
the upper lip , at the same time , writhed itself away from the teeth , which it had previously covered completely ; while the lower jaw fell with an audible jerk , leaving the mouth widely extended , and disclosing in full view the swollen and blackened tongue .
i presume that no member of the party then present had been unaccustomed to death-bed horrors ; but so hideous beyond <name> was the appearance of m. valdemar at this moment , that there was a general shrinking back from the region of the bed .
i now feel that i have reached a point of this narrative at which every reader <name> be startled into positive disbelief .
it is my business , however , simply to proceed .
there was no longer the faintest sign of vitality in m. valdemar ; and concluding him to be dead , we were <unk> him to the charge of the nurses , when a strong vibratory motion was observable in the tongue .
this continued for perhaps a minute .
at the expiration of this period , there issued from the distended and motionless jaws a voice  such as it would be madness in me to attempt describing .
there are , indeed , two or three epithets which might be considered as applicable to it in part ; i might say , for example , that the sound was harsh , and broken and hollow ; but the hideous whole is indescribable , for the simple reason that no similar sounds have ever <name> upon the ear of humanity .
there were two particulars , nevertheless , which i thought then , and still think , might fairly be stated as characteristic of the intonation  as well adapted to convey some idea of its unearthly peculiarity .
in the first place , the voice seemed to reach our ears  at least mine  from a vast distance , or from some deep cavern within the earth .
in the second place , it impressed me ( i fear , indeed , that it <name> be impossible to make myself comprehended ) as gelatinous or <unk> matters impress the sense of touch .
i have spoken both of " sound " and of " voice . "
i mean to say that the sound was one of distinct  of even wonderfully , <unk> distinct  <unk> .
m. valdemar spoke  obviously in reply to the question i had propounded to him a few minutes before .
i had asked him , it <name> be remembered , if he still slept .
he now said : " yes ;  no ;  i have been sleeping  and now  now  i am dead . "
no person present even affected to deny , or attempted to repress , the unutterable , shuddering horror which these few words , thus uttered , were so well calculated to convey .
mr. l  l ( the student ) swooned .
the nurses immediately left the chamber , and could not be induced to return .
my own impressions i would not pretend to render intelligible to the reader .
for nearly an hour , we busied ourselves , silently  without the utterance of a word  in endeavors to revive mr. l  l. when he came to himself , we addressed ourselves again to an investigation of m. <unk> condition .
it remained in all respects as i have last described it , with the exception that the mirror no longer afforded evidence of respiration .
an attempt to draw blood from the arm failed .
i should mention , too , that this limb was no farther subject to my <name> .
i endeavored in vain to make it follow the direction of my hand .
the only real indication , indeed , of the mesmeric influence , was now found in the vibratory movement of the tongue , whenever i addressed m. valdemar a question .
he seemed to be making an effort to reply , but had no longer sufficient volition .
to queries put to him by any other person than myself he seemed utterly insensible  although i endeavored to place each member of the company in mesmeric <unk> with him .
i believe that i have now related all that is necessary to an understanding of the <unk> state at this epoch .
other nurses were procured ; and at ten o'clock i left the house in company with the two physicians and mr. l  l. in the afternoon we all called again to see the patient .
his condition remained precisely the same .
we had now some discussion as to the propriety and <unk> of awakening him ; but we had little difficulty in agreeing that no good purpose would be served by so doing .
it was evident that , so far , death ( or what is usually termed death ) had been arrested by the mesmeric process .
it seemed clear to us all that to awaken m. valdemar would be merely to insure his instant , or at least his speedy dissolution .
from this period until the close of last week  an interval of nearly seven months  we continued to make daily calls at m. valdemar 's house , accompanied , now and then , by medical and other friends .
all this time the <unk> remained exactly as i have last described him .
the nurses ' attentions were continual .
it was on friday last that we finally resolved to make the experiment of awakening or attempting to awaken him ; and it is the ( perhaps ) unfortunate result of this latter experiment which has given rise to so much discussion in private circles  to so much of what i can not help thinking unwarranted popular feeling .
for the purpose of relieving m. valdemar from the mesmeric trance , i made use of the customary passes .
these , for a time , were unsuccessful .
the first indication of revival was afforded by a partial descent of the <name> .
it was observed , as especially remarkable , that this lowering of the pupil was accompanied by the profuse <unk> of a yellowish <unk> ( from beneath the lids ) of a pungent and highly offensive odor .
it was now suggested that i should attempt to influence the <unk> arm , as heretofore .
i made the attempt and failed .
dr. f  then intimated a <name> to have me put a question .
i did so , as follows : " m. valdemar , can you explain to us what are your feelings or wishes now ? "
there was an instant return of the <unk> circles on the cheeks ; the tongue quivered , or rather rolled violently in the mouth ( although the jaws and lips remained rigid as before ; ) and at length the same hideous voice which i have already described , broke forth : " for god 's sake !  quick !  quick !  put me to sleep  or , quick !  waken me !  quick !  i say to you that i am dead ! "
i was thoroughly unnerved , and for an instant remained undecided what to do .
at first i made an endeavor to <unk> the patient ; but , failing in this through total abeyance of the <name> , i retraced my steps and as earnestly struggled to awaken him .
in this attempt i soon saw that i should be successful  or at least i soon fancied that my success would be complete  and i am sure that all in the room were prepared to see the patient awaken .
for what really occurred , however , it is quite impossible that any human being could have been prepared .
as i rapidly made the mesmeric passes , amid ejaculations of " dead !
dead ! "
absolutely bursting from the tongue and not from the lips of the sufferer , his whole frame at once  within the space of a single minute , or even less , shrunk  crumbled  absolutely rotted away beneath my hands .
upon the bed , before that whole company , there lay a nearly liquid mass of loathsome  of detestable <unk> .
the black cat .
for the most wild , yet most homely narrative which i am about to pen , i neither expect nor solicit belief .
mad indeed would i be to expect it , in a case where my very senses reject their own evidence .
yet , mad am i not  and very surely do i not dream .
but to-morrow i die , and to-day i would <unk> my soul .
my immediate purpose is to place before the world , plainly , <unk> , and without comment , a series of mere household events .
in their consequences , these events have terrified  have tortured  have destroyed me .
yet i <name> not attempt to <unk> them .
to me , they have presented little but horror  to many they <name> seem less terrible than <unk> .
hereafter , perhaps , some intellect may be found which <name> reduce my <unk> to the <unk>  some intellect more calm , more logical , and far less excitable than my own , which <name> perceive , in the circumstances i detail with awe , nothing more than an ordinary succession of very natural causes and effects .
from my infancy i was noted for the <unk> and humanity of my disposition .
my tenderness of heart was even so conspicuous as to make me the jest of my companions .
i was especially fond of animals , and was indulged by my parents with a great variety of pets .
with these i spent most of my time , and never was so happy as when feeding and caressing them .
this peculiarity of character grew with my growth , and in my manhood , i derived from it one of my principal sources of pleasure .
to those who have cherished an affection for a faithful and sagacious dog , i need hardly be at the trouble of explaining the nature or the intensity of the gratification thus <unk> .
there is something in the unselfish and self-sacrificing love of a brute , which goes directly to the heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere man .
i married early , and was happy to find in my wife a disposition not <unk> with my own .
observing my partiality for domestic pets , she lost no opportunity of procuring those of the most agreeable kind .
we had birds , gold-fish , a fine dog , rabbits , a small monkey , and a cat .
this latter was a remarkably large and beautiful animal , entirely black , and sagacious to an astonishing degree .
in speaking of his intelligence , my wife , who at heart was not a little <unk> with superstition , made frequent allusion to the ancient popular notion , which regarded all black cats as witches in disguise .
not that she was ever serious upon this point  and i mention the matter at all for no better reason than that it happens , just now , to be remembered .
<unk>  this was the cat 's name  was my favorite pet and playmate .
i alone fed him , and he attended me wherever i went about the house .
it was even with difficulty that i could prevent him from following me through the streets .
our friendship lasted , in this manner , for several years , during which my general temperament and character  through the instrumentality of the fiend intemperance  had ( i blush to confess it ) experienced a radical alteration for the worse .
i grew , day by day , more moody , more irritable , more regardless of the feelings of others .
i suffered myself to use intemperate language to my wife .
at length , i even offered her personal violence .
my pets , of course , were made to feel the change in my disposition .
i not only neglected , but <unk> them .
for <unk> , however , i still retained sufficient regard to restrain me from <unk> him , as i made no scruple of <unk> the rabbits , the monkey , or even the dog , when by accident , or through affection , they came in my way .
but my disease grew upon me  for what disease is like alcohol !  and at length even <unk> , who was now becoming old , and consequently somewhat <unk>  even <unk> began to experience the effects of my ill temper .
one night , returning home , much intoxicated , from one of my haunts about town , i fancied that the cat avoided my presence .
i seized him ; when , in his fright at my violence , he inflicted a slight wound upon my hand with his teeth .
the fury of a demon instantly possessed me .
i knew myself no longer .
my original soul seemed , at once , to take its flight from my body and a more than fiendish <unk> , <unk> , thrilled every fibre of my frame .
i took from my <unk> a <unk> , opened it , grasped the poor beast by the throat , and deliberately cut one of its eyes from the socket !
i blush , i burn , i shudder , while i pen the damnable atrocity .
when reason returned with the morning  when i had slept off the fumes of the night 's <unk>  i experienced a sentiment half of horror , half of remorse , for the crime of which i had been guilty ; but it was , at best , a feeble and equivocal feeling , and the soul remained untouched .
i again plunged into excess , and soon drowned in wine all memory of the deed .
in the meantime the cat slowly recovered .
the socket of the lost eye presented , it is true , a frightful appearance , but he no longer appeared to suffer any pain .
he went about the house as usual , but , as might be expected , fled in extreme terror at my approach .
i had so much of my old heart left , as to be at first grieved by this evident dislike on the part of a creature which had once so loved me .
but this feeling soon gave place to irritation .
and then came , as if to my final and <unk> overthrow , the spirit of <unk> .
of this spirit philosophy takes no account .
yet i am not more sure that my soul lives , than i am that <unk> is one of the primitive impulses of the human heart  one of the <unk> primary faculties , or sentiments , which give direction to the character of man .
who has not , a hundred times , found himself committing a vile or a silly action , for no other reason than because he knows he should not ?
have we not a perpetual inclination , in the teeth of our best judgment , to violate that which is law , merely because we understand it to be such ?
this spirit of <unk> , i say , came to my final overthrow .
it was this unfathomable longing of the soul to vex itself  to offer violence to its own nature  to do wrong for the wrong 's sake only  that urged me to continue and finally to consummate the injury i had inflicted upon the unoffending brute .
one morning , in cool blood , i slipped a noose about its neck and <name> it to the limb of a tree ;  <name> it with the tears streaming from my eyes , and with the bitterest remorse at my heart ;  <name> it because i knew that it had loved me , and because i felt it had given me no reason of offence ;  <name> it because i knew that in so doing i was committing a sin  a deadly sin that would so <unk> my immortal soul as to place it  if such a thing wore possible  even beyond the reach of the infinite <name> of the most merciful and most terrible god .
on the night of the day on which this cruel deed was done , i was aroused from sleep by the cry of fire .
the curtains of my bed were in flames .
the whole house was blazing .
it was with great difficulty that my wife , a servant , and myself , made our escape from the conflagration .
the destruction was complete .
my entire worldly wealth was swallowed up , and i resigned myself thenceforward to despair .
i am above the weakness of seeking to establish a sequence of cause and effect , between the disaster and the atrocity .
but i am <unk> a chain of facts  and wish not to leave even a possible link imperfect .
on the day succeeding the fire , i visited the ruins .
the walls , with one exception , had fallen in .
this exception was found in a compartment wall , not very thick , which stood about the middle of the house , and against which had rested the head of my bed .
the <unk> had here , in great measure , resisted the action of the fire  a fact which i attributed to its having been recently spread .
about this wall a dense crowd were collected , and many persons seemed to be examining a particular portion of it with very minute and eager attention .
the words " strange ! "
" singular ! "
and other similar expressions , excited my curiosity .
i approached and saw , as if graven in <unk> relief upon the white surface , the figure of a gigantic cat .
the impression was given with an accuracy truly marvellous .
there was a rope about the <unk> neck .
when i first beheld this apparition  for i could scarcely regard it as less  my wonder and my terror were extreme .
but at length reflection came to my aid .
the cat , i remembered , had been <name> in a garden adjacent to the house .
upon the alarm of fire , this garden had been immediately filled by the crowd  by some one of whom the animal must have been cut from the tree and thrown , through an open window , into my chamber .
this had probably been done with the view of arousing me from sleep .
the falling of other walls had compressed the victim of my cruelty into the substance of the <unk> plaster ; the lime of which , with the flames , and the ammonia from the carcass , had then accomplished the <unk> as i saw it .
although i thus readily accounted to my reason , if not altogether to my conscience , for the startling fact just detailed , it did not the less fail to make a deep impression upon my fancy .
for months i could not rid myself of the <unk> of the cat ; and , during this period , there came back into my spirit a <unk> that seemed , but was not , remorse .
i went so far as to regret the loss of the animal , and to look about me , among the vile haunts which i now habitually frequented , for another pet of the same species , and of somewhat similar appearance , with which to supply its place .
one night as i sat , half <unk> , in a den of more than infamy , my attention was suddenly drawn to some black object , reposing upon the head of one of the immense <unk> of gin , or of rum , which constituted the chief furniture of the apartment .
i had been looking steadily at the top of this hogshead for some minutes , and what now caused me surprise was the fact that i had not sooner perceived the object thereupon .
i approached it , and touched it with my hand .
it was a black cat  a very large one  fully as large as <unk> , and closely resembling him in every respect but one .
<unk> had not a white hair upon any portion of his body ; but this cat had a large , although indefinite <unk> of white , covering nearly the whole region of the breast .
upon my touching him , he immediately arose , purred loudly , rubbed against my hand , and appeared delighted with my notice .
this , then , was the very creature of which i was in search .
i at once offered to purchase it of the landlord ; but this person made no claim to it  knew nothing of it  had never seen it before .
i continued my caresses , and , when i prepared to go home , the animal evinced a disposition to accompany me .
i permitted it to do so ; occasionally stooping and patting it as i proceeded .
when it reached the house it domesticated itself at once , and became immediately a great favorite with my wife .
for my own part , i soon found a dislike to it arising within me .
this was just the reverse of what i had anticipated ; but  i know not how or why it was  its evident fondness for myself rather disgusted and annoyed .
by slow degrees , these feelings of disgust and annoyance rose into the bitterness of hatred .
i avoided the creature ; a certain sense of shame , and the remembrance of my former deed of cruelty , preventing me from physically abusing it .
i did not , for some weeks , strike , or otherwise violently ill use it ; but gradually  very gradually  i came to look upon it with unutterable loathing , and to flee silently from its odious presence , as from the breath of a pestilence .
what added , no doubt , to my hatred of the beast , was the discovery , on the morning after i brought it home , that , like <unk> , it also had been deprived of one of its eyes .
this circumstance , however , only <unk> it to my wife , who , as i have already said , possessed , in a high degree , that humanity of feeling which had once been my distinguishing trait , and the source of many of my simplest and purest pleasures .
with my aversion to this cat , however , its partiality for myself seemed to increase .
it followed my footsteps with a pertinacity which it would be difficult to make the reader comprehend .
whenever i sat , it would crouch beneath my chair , or spring upon my knees , covering me with its loathsome caresses .
if i arose to walk it would get between my feet and thus nearly throw me down , or , fastening its long and sharp claws in my dress , clamber , in this manner , to my breast .
at such times , although i longed to destroy it with a blow , i was yet withheld from so doing , partly by a memory of my former crime , but chiefly  let me confess it at once  by absolute dread of the beast .
this dread was not exactly a dread of physical evil  and yet i should be at a loss how otherwise to define it .
i am almost ashamed to own  yes , even in this <unk> 's cell , i am almost ashamed to own  that the terror and horror with which the animal inspired me , had been heightened by one of the merest <unk> it would be possible to conceive .
my wife had called my attention , more than once , to the character of the <name> of white hair , of which i have spoken , and which constituted the sole visible difference between the strange beast and the one i had destroyed .
the reader <name> remember that this <name> , although large , had been originally very indefinite ; but , by slow degrees  degrees nearly imperceptible , and which for a long time my reason struggled to reject as fanciful  it had , at length , assumed a rigorous distinctness of outline .
it was now the representation of an object that i shudder to name  and for this , above all , i loathed , and dreaded , and would have rid myself of the monster had i dared  it was now , i say , the image of a hideous  of a ghastly thing  of the gallows !  oh , mournful and terrible engine of horror and of crime  of agony and of death !
and now was i indeed wretched beyond the wretchedness of mere humanity .
and a brute beast   whose fellow i had contemptuously destroyed  a brute beast to work out for me  for me a man , fashioned in the image of the high god  so much of insufferable wo !
alas !
neither by day nor by night knew i the blessing of rest any more !
during the former the creature left me no moment alone ; and , in the latter , i started , hourly , from dreams of unutterable fear , to find the hot breath of the thing upon my face , and its vast weight  an incarnate <unk> that i had no power to shake off  incumbent eternally upon my heart !  beneath the pressure of torments such as these , the feeble remnant of the good within me succumbed .
evil thoughts became my sole intimates  the darkest and most evil of thoughts .
the <unk> of my usual temper increased to hatred of all things and of all mankind ; while , from the sudden , frequent , and ungovernable <unk> of a fury to which i now blindly abandoned myself , my <unk> wife , alas !
was the most usual and the most patient of sufferers .
one day she accompanied me , upon some household errand , into the cellar of the old building which our poverty compelled us to inhabit .
the cat followed me down the steep stairs , and , nearly throwing me headlong , exasperated me to madness .
uplifting an axe , and forgetting , in my wrath , the childish dread which had hitherto stayed my hand , i aimed a blow at the animal which , of course , would have proved instantly fatal had it descended as i wished .
but this blow was arrested by the hand of my wife .
goaded , by the interference , into a rage more than <unk> , i withdrew my arm from her grasp and buried the axe in her <name> .
she fell dead upon the spot , without a groan .
this hideous murder accomplished , i set myself forthwith , and with entire deliberation , to the task of concealing the body .
i knew that i could not remove it from the house , either by day or by night , without the risk of being observed by the neighbors .
many projects entered my mind .
at one period i thought of cutting the corpse into minute fragments , and destroying them by fire .
at another , i resolved to dig a grave for it in the floor of the cellar .
again , i <unk> about casting it in the well in the yard  about packing it in a box , as if <unk> , with the usual arrangements , and so getting a <name> to take it from the house .
finally i hit upon what i considered a far better expedient than either of these .
i determined to wall it up in the cellar  as the monks of the middle ages are recorded to have walled up their victims .
for a purpose such as this the cellar was well adapted .
its walls were loosely constructed , and had lately been plastered throughout with a rough plaster , which the dampness of the atmosphere had prevented from <unk> .
moreover , in one of the walls was a projection , caused by a false chimney , or fireplace , that had been filled up , and made to resemble the red of the cellar .
i made no doubt that i could readily <unk> the bricks at this point , insert the corpse , and wall the whole up as before , so that no eye could detect any thing suspicious .
and in this calculation i was not deceived .
by means of a <unk> i easily dislodged the bricks , and , having carefully deposited the body against the inner wall , i propped it in that position , while , with little trouble , i <unk> the whole structure as it originally stood .
having procured mortar , sand , and hair , with every possible precaution , i prepared a plaster which could not be distinguished from the old , and with this i very carefully went over the new brickwork .
when i had finished , i felt satisfied that all was right .
the wall did not present the slightest appearance of having been disturbed .
the rubbish on the floor was picked up with the minutest care .
i looked around triumphantly , and said to myself  " here at least , then , my labor has not been in vain . "
my next step was to look for the beast which had been the cause of so much wretchedness ; for i had , at length , firmly resolved to put it to death .
had i been able to meet with it , at the moment , there could have been no doubt of its fate ; but it appeared that the crafty animal had been alarmed at the violence of my previous anger , and <unk> to present itself in my present mood .
it is impossible to describe , or to imagine , the deep , the blissful sense of relief which the absence of the detested creature occasioned in my bosom .
it did not make its appearance during the night  and thus for one night at least , since its introduction into the house , i soundly and tranquilly slept ; aye , slept even with the burden of murder upon my soul !
the second and the third day passed , and still my <unk> came not .
once again i breathed as a <name> .
the monster , in terror , had fled the premises forever !
i should behold it no more !
my happiness was supreme !
the guilt of my dark deed disturbed me but little .
some few inquiries had been made , but these had been readily answered .
even a search had been instituted  but of course nothing was to be discovered .
i looked upon my future felicity as secured .
upon the fourth day of the assassination , a party of the police came , very unexpectedly , into the house , and proceeded again to make rigorous investigation of the premises .
secure , however , in the <unk> of my place of concealment , i felt no embarrassment whatever .
the officers bade me accompany them in their search .
they left no nook or corner unexplored .
at length , for the third or fourth time , they descended into the cellar .
i quivered not in a muscle .
my heart beat calmly as that of one who slumbers in innocence .
i walked the cellar from end to end .
i folded my arms upon my bosom , and roamed easily to and fro .
the police were thoroughly satisfied and prepared to depart .
the glee at my heart was too strong to be restrained .
i burned to say if but one word , by way of triumph , and to render doubly sure their assurance of my <unk> .
" gentlemen , " i said at last , as the party ascended the steps , " i delight to have allayed your suspicions .
i wish you all health , and a little more courtesy .
by the bye , gentlemen , this  this is a very well constructed house . "
[ in the rabid <name> to say something easily , i scarcely knew what i uttered at all . ]
 " i may say an excellently well constructed house .
these walls  are you going , gentlemen ?  these walls are solidly put together ; " and here , through the mere <unk> of bravado , i rapped heavily , with a cane which i held in my hand , upon that very portion of the <unk> behind which stood the corpse of the wife of my bosom .
but may god shield and deliver me from the fangs of the <unk> !
no sooner had the <unk> of my blows sunk into silence , than i was answered by a voice from within the tomb !  by a cry , at first muffled and broken , like the sobbing of a child , and then quickly swelling into one long , loud , and continuous scream , utterly anomalous and inhuman  a howl  a wailing shriek , half of horror and half of triumph , such as might have arisen only out of hell , conjointly from the throats of the <unk> in their agony and of the demons that <unk> in the damnation .
of my own thoughts it is folly to speak .
<unk> , i staggered to the opposite wall .
for one instant the party upon the stairs remained motionless , through extremity of terror and of awe .
in the next , a dozen stout arms were toiling at the wall .
it fell bodily .
the corpse , already greatly decayed and clotted with gore , stood erect before the eyes of the spectators .
upon its head , with red extended mouth and solitary eye of fire , sat the hideous beast whose craft had seduced me into murder , and whose informing voice had consigned me to the <unk> .
i had walled the monster up within the tomb !
the fall of the house of usher son <unk> est <name> <unk> <unk> ; <unk> <unk> <name> <unk> il <unk>  de <unk> .
during the whole of a dull , dark , and <unk> day in the autumn of the year , when the clouds <name> <unk> low in the heavens , i had been passing alone , on horseback , through a singularly dreary tract of country ; and at length found myself , as the shades of the evening <name> on , within view of the melancholy house of usher .
i know not how it was  but , with the first glimpse of the building , a sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit .
i say insufferable ; for the feeling was <unk> by any of that <unk> , because poetic , sentiment , with which the mind usually receives even the <unk> natural images of the desolate or terrible .
i looked upon the scene before me  upon the mere house , and the simple landscape features of the domain  upon the bleak walls  upon the vacant <unk> windows  upon a few rank <unk>  and upon a few white trunks of decayed trees  with an utter depression of soul which i can compare to no earthly sensation more properly than to the <unk> of the <unk> upon opium  the bitter lapse into everyday life  the hideous dropping off of the veil .
there was an <unk> , a sinking , a sickening of the heart  an <unk> <unk> of thought which no <unk> of the imagination could torture into aught of the sublime .
what was it  i paused to think  what was it that so unnerved me in the contemplation of the house of usher ?
it was a mystery all insoluble ; nor could i grapple with the shadowy fancies that crowded upon me as i pondered .
i was forced to fall back upon the unsatisfactory conclusion , that while , beyond doubt , there are combinations of very simple natural objects which have the power of thus affecting us , still the analysis of this power lies among considerations beyond our depth .
it was possible , i reflected , that a mere different arrangement of the particulars of the scene , of the details of the picture , would be sufficient to modify , or perhaps to annihilate its capacity for sorrowful impression ; and , acting upon this idea , i reined my horse to the precipitous brink of a black and lurid tarn that lay in unruffled lustre by the dwelling , and gazed down  but with a shudder even more thrilling than before  upon the <unk> and inverted images of the gray <unk> , and the ghastly <unk> , and the vacant and <unk> windows .
nevertheless , in this mansion of gloom i now proposed to myself a sojourn of some weeks .
its proprietor , <name> usher , had been one of my boon companions in boyhood ; but many years had elapsed since our last meeting .
a letter , however , had lately reached me in a distant part of the country  a letter from him  which , in its wildly importunate nature , had admitted of no other than a personal reply .
the ms. gave evidence of nervous agitation .
the writer spoke of acute bodily illness  of a mental disorder which oppressed him  and of an <name> <name> to see me , as his best , and indeed his only personal friend , with a view of attempting , by the cheerfulness of my society , some <unk> of his malady .
it was the manner in which all this , and much more , was said  it was the apparent heart that went with his request  which allowed me no room for hesitation ; and i accordingly obeyed forthwith what i still considered a very singular summons .
although , as boys , we had been even intimate associates , yet i really knew little of my friend .
his reserve had been always excessive and habitual .
i was aware , however , that his very ancient family had been noted , time out of mind , for a peculiar sensibility of temperament , displaying itself , through long ages , in many works of exalted <name> , and manifested , of late , in repeated deeds of <unk> yet unobtrusive <name> , as well as in a passionate devotion to the intricacies , perhaps even more than to the orthodox and easily recognisable beauties , of musical science .
i had learned , too , the very remarkable fact , that the stem of the usher race , all <unk> as it was , had put forth , at no period , any enduring branch ; in other words , that the entire family lay in the direct line of descent , and had always , with very trifling and very temporary variation , so lain .
it was this deficiency , i considered , while running over in thought the perfect keeping of the character of the premises with the <unk> character of the people , and while speculating upon the possible influence which the one , in the long lapse of centuries , might have exercised upon the other  it was this deficiency , perhaps , of collateral issue , and the consequent <unk> transmission , from sire to son , of the <unk> with the name , which had , at length , so identified the two as to <unk> the original title of the estate in the quaint and equivocal appellation of the " house of usher "  an appellation which seemed to include , in the minds of the peasantry who used it , both the family and the family mansion .
i have said that the sole effect of my somewhat childish experiment  that of looking down within the tarn  had been to deepen the first singular impression .
there can be no doubt that the consciousness of the rapid increase of my superstition  for why should i not so term it ?  served mainly to <unk> the increase itself .
such , i have long known , is the paradoxical law of all sentiments having terror as a basis .
and it might have been for this reason only , that , when i again uplifted my eyes to the house itself , from its image in the pool , there grew in my mind a strange fancy  a fancy so ridiculous , indeed , that i but mention it to show the vivid force of the sensations which oppressed me .
i had so worked upon my imagination as really to believe that about the whole mansion and domain there <name> an atmosphere peculiar to themselves and their immediate vicinity  an atmosphere which had no affinity with the air of heaven , but which had reeked up from the decayed trees , and the gray wall , and the silent tarn  a <unk> and mystic vapor , dull , sluggish , faintly discernible , and <unk> .
shaking off from my spirit what must have been a dream , i scanned more narrowly the real aspect of the building .
its principal feature seemed to be that of an excessive antiquity .
the <unk> of ages had been great .
minute <unk> overspread the whole exterior , hanging in a fine tangled <unk> from the eaves .
yet all this was apart from any extraordinary <unk> .
no portion of the masonry had fallen ; and there appeared to be a wild inconsistency between its still perfect adaptation of parts , and the crumbling condition of the individual stones .
in this there was much that reminded me of the <unk> <unk> of old <unk> which has rotted for long years in some neglected vault , with no disturbance from the breath of the external air .
beyond this indication of extensive decay , however , the fabric gave little token of instability .
perhaps the eye of a scrutinizing observer might have discovered a barely perceptible fissure , which , extending from the roof of the building in front , made its way down the wall in a zigzag direction , until it became lost in the sullen waters of the tarn .
noticing these things , i rode over a short causeway to the house .
a servant in waiting took my horse , and i entered the gothic archway of the hall .
a valet , of stealthy step , thence conducted me , in silence , through many dark and intricate passages in my progress to the studio of his master .
much that i encountered on the way contributed , i know not how , to heighten the vague sentiments of which i have already spoken .
while the objects around me  while the carvings of the ceilings , the sombre tapestries of the walls , the <unk> blackness of the floors , and the <unk> <unk> trophies which rattled as i strode , were but matters to which , or to such as which , i had been accustomed from my infancy  while i hesitated not to acknowledge how familiar was all this  i still wondered to find how unfamiliar were the fancies which ordinary images were stirring up .
on one of the staircases , i met the physician of the family .
his countenance , i thought , wore a mingled expression of low cunning and perplexity .
he accosted me with trepidation and passed on .
the valet now threw open a door and ushered me into the presence of his master .
the room in which i found myself was very large and lofty .
the windows were long , narrow , and pointed , and at so vast a distance from the black oaken floor as to be altogether inaccessible from within .
feeble gleams of <unk> light made their way through the <unk> panes , and served to render sufficiently distinct the more prominent objects around ; the eye , however , struggled in vain to reach the remoter angles of the chamber , or the recesses of the vaulted and fretted ceiling .
dark draperies <name> upon the walls .
the general furniture was profuse , comfortless , antique , and tattered .
many books and musical instruments lay scattered about , but failed to give any vitality to the scene .
i felt that i breathed an atmosphere of sorrow .
an air of stern , deep , and <unk> gloom <name> over and pervaded all .
upon my entrance , usher arose from a sofa on which he had been lying at full length , and greeted me with a vivacious warmth which had much in it , i at first thought , of an overdone cordiality  of the constrained effort of the <unk> man of the world .
a glance , however , at his countenance , convinced me of his perfect sincerity .
we sat down ; and for some moments , while he spoke not , i gazed upon him with a feeling half of pity , half of awe .
surely , man had never before so terribly altered , in so brief a period , as had <name> usher !
it was with difficulty that i could bring myself to admit the identity of the <name> being before me with the companion of my early boyhood .
yet the character of his face had been at all times remarkable .
a <unk> of complexion ; an eye large , liquid , and luminous beyond comparison ; lips somewhat thin and very pallid , but of a <unk> beautiful curve ; a nose of a delicate hebrew model , but with a breadth of <unk> unusual in similar formations ; a finely moulded <name> , speaking , in its want of prominence , of a want of moral energy ; hair of a more than <unk> softness and tenuity ; these features , with an inordinate expansion above the regions of the <name> , made up altogether a countenance not easily to be forgotten .
and now in the mere exaggeration of the prevailing character of these features , and of the expression they were wont to convey , lay so much of change that i doubted to whom i spoke .
the now ghastly pallor of the skin , and the now miraculous lustre of the eye , above all things startled and even awed me .
the silken hair , too , had been suffered to grow all unheeded , and as , in its wild gossamer texture , it floated rather than fell about the face , i could not , even with effort , connect its <unk> expression with any idea of simple humanity .
in the manner of my friend i was at once struck with an <unk>  an inconsistency ; and i soon found this to arise from a series of feeble and futile struggles to overcome an habitual <unk>  an excessive nervous agitation .
for something of this nature i had indeed been prepared , no less by his letter , than by reminiscences of certain boyish traits , and by conclusions deduced from his peculiar physical conformation and temperament .
his action was alternately vivacious and sullen .
his voice varied rapidly from a tremulous indecision ( when the animal spirits seemed utterly in abeyance ) to that species of energetic <unk>  that abrupt , weighty , <unk> , and <unk> enunciation  that leaden , <unk> and perfectly <unk> guttural utterance , which may be observed in the lost drunkard , or the <unk> eater of opium , during the periods of his most intense excitement .
it was thus that he spoke of the object of my visit , of his <name> <name> to see me , and of the solace he expected me to afford him .
he entered , at some length , into what he conceived to be the nature of his malady .
it was , he said , a constitutional and a family evil , and one for which he despaired to find a remedy  a mere nervous affection , he immediately added , which would undoubtedly soon pass off .
it displayed itself in a host of unnatural sensations .
some of these , as he detailed them , interested and bewildered me ; although , perhaps , the terms , and the general manner of the narration had their weight .
he suffered much from a morbid acuteness of the senses ; the most insipid food was alone <unk> ; he could wear only garments of certain texture ; the odors of all flowers were oppressive ; his eyes were tortured by even a faint light ; and there were but peculiar sounds , and these from <unk> instruments , which did not inspire him with horror .
to an anomalous species of terror i found him a <unk> slave .
" i shall perish , " said he , " i must perish in this deplorable folly .
thus , thus , and not otherwise , shall i be lost .
i dread the events of the future , not in themselves , but in their results .
i shudder at the thought of any , even the most trivial , incident , which may operate upon this intolerable agitation of soul .
i have , indeed , no abhorrence of danger , except in its absolute effect  in terror .
in this unnerved  in this pitiable condition  i feel that the period <name> sooner or later arrive when i must abandon life and reason together , in some struggle with the grim <unk> , fear . "
i learned , moreover , at intervals , and through broken and equivocal hints , another singular feature of his mental condition .
he was <unk> by certain superstitious impressions in regard to the dwelling which he tenanted , and whence , for many years , he had never ventured forth  in regard to an influence whose <unk> force was conveyed in terms too shadowy here to be <unk>  an influence which some peculiarities in the mere form and substance of his family mansion , had , by dint of long sufferance , he said , obtained over his spirit  an effect which the physique of the gray walls and turrets , and of the dim tarn into which they all looked down , had , at length , brought about upon the <unk> of his existence .
he admitted , however , although with hesitation , that much of the peculiar gloom which thus afflicted him could be traced to a more natural and far more palpable origin  to the severe and long-continued illness  indeed to the evidently approaching dissolution  of a tenderly beloved sister  his sole companion for long years  his last and only relative on earth .
" her decease , " he said , with a bitterness which i can never forget , " would leave him ( him the hopeless and the frail ) the last of the ancient race of the ushers . "
while he spoke , the <name> <name> ( for so was she called ) passed slowly through a remote portion of the apartment , and , without having noticed my presence , disappeared .
i regarded her with an utter astonishment not <unk> with dread  and yet i found it impossible to account for such feelings .
a sensation of stupor oppressed me , as my eyes followed her retreating steps .
when a door , at length , closed upon her , my glance sought instinctively and eagerly the countenance of the brother  but he had buried his face in his hands , and i could only perceive that a far more than ordinary <unk> had overspread the emaciated fingers through which trickled many passionate tears .
the disease of the <name> <name> had long baffled the skill of her physicians .
a settled apathy , a gradual wasting away of the person , and frequent although transient affections of a partially <unk> character , were the unusual diagnosis .
hitherto she had steadily borne up against the pressure of her malady , and had not <unk> herself finally to bed ; but , on the closing in of the evening of my arrival at the house , she succumbed ( as her brother told me at night with inexpressible agitation ) to the <unk> power of the destroyer ; and i learned that the glimpse i had obtained of her person would thus probably be the last i should obtain  that the <name> , at least while living , would be seen by me no more .
for several days ensuing , her name was <unk> by either usher or myself : and during this period i was busied in <name> endeavors to <unk> the melancholy of my friend .
we painted and read together ; or i listened , as if in a dream , to the wild <unk> of his speaking guitar .
and thus , as a closer and still closer intimacy admitted me more unreservedly into the recesses of his spirit , the more bitterly did i perceive the futility of all attempt at cheering a mind from which darkness , as if an inherent positive quality , poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe , in one unceasing radiation of gloom .
i shall ever bear about me a memory of the many solemn hours i thus spent alone with the master of the house of usher .
yet i should fail in any attempt to convey an idea of the exact character of the studies , or of the occupations , in which he involved me , or led me the way .
an excited and highly <unk> <unk> threw a <unk> lustre over all .
his long improvised <unk> <name> ring forever in my ears .
among other things , i hold painfully in mind a certain singular perversion and <unk> of the wild air of the last waltz of <name> <unk> .
from the paintings over which his elaborate fancy brooded , and which grew , touch by touch , into <unk> at which i shuddered the more <unk> , because i shuddered knowing not why ;  from these paintings ( vivid as their images now are before me ) i would in vain endeavor to <unk> more than a small portion which should lie within the compass of merely written words .
by the utter simplicity , by the nakedness of his designs , he arrested and overawed attention .
if ever mortal painted an idea , that mortal was <name> usher .
for me at least  in the circumstances then surrounding me  there arose out of the pure <unk> which the <unk> contrived to throw upon his canvass , an intensity of intolerable awe , no shadow of which felt i ever yet in the contemplation of the certainly glowing yet too concrete reveries of <unk> .
one of the <unk> conceptions of my friend , partaking not so rigidly of the spirit of abstraction , may be shadowed forth , although feebly , in words .
a small picture presented the interior of an immensely long and rectangular vault or tunnel , with low walls , smooth , white , and without interruption or device .
certain accessory points of the design served well to convey the idea that this excavation lay at an exceeding depth below the surface of the earth .
no outlet was observed in any portion of its vast extent , and no torch , or other artificial source of light was discernible ; yet a flood of intense rays rolled throughout , and bathed the whole in a ghastly and inappropriate splendor .
i have just spoken of that morbid condition of the auditory nerve which rendered all music intolerable to the sufferer , with the exception of certain effects of <unk> instruments .
it was , perhaps , the narrow limits to which he thus confined himself upon the guitar , which gave birth , in great measure , to the fantastic character of his performances .
but the <unk> facility of his <unk> could not be so accounted for .
they must have been , and were , in the notes , as well as in the words of his wild <unk> ( for he not unfrequently accompanied himself with <unk> verbal <unk> ) , the result of that intense mental <unk> and concentration to which i have previously alluded as observable only in particular moments of the highest artificial excitement .
the words of one of these <unk> i have easily remembered .
i was , perhaps , the more forcibly impressed with it , as he gave it , because , in the under or mystic current of its meaning , i fancied that i perceived , and for the first time , a full consciousness on the part of usher , of the tottering of his lofty reason upon her throne .
the verses , which were entitled " the haunted palace , " ran very nearly , if not accurately , thus : i .
in the <unk> of our valleys , by good angels tenanted , once a fair and stately palace  radiant palace  reared its head .
in the monarch thought 's dominion  it stood there !
never seraph spread a <unk> over fabric half so fair .
ii .
banners yellow , glorious , golden , on its roof did float and flow ; ( this  all this  was in the olden time long ago ) and every gentle air that <unk> , in that sweet day , along the ramparts plumed and pallid , a winged odor went away .
iii .
wanderers in that happy valley through two luminous windows saw spirits moving musically to a <unk> 's <unk> law , round about a throne , where sitting ( <unk> ! )
in state his <name> well <unk> , the ruler of the realm was seen .
iv .
and all with <name> and <name> glowing was the fair palace door , through which came flowing , flowing , flowing , and sparkling evermore , a troop of echoes whose sweet duty was but to sing , in voices of surpassing beauty , the wit and wisdom of their king .
v. but evil things , in robes of sorrow , assailed the monarch 's high estate ; ( ah , let us mourn , for never morrow shall <name> upon him , desolate ! )
and , round about his home , the <name> that blushed and bloomed is but a <unk> story of the old time entombed .
<name> .
and travellers now within that valley , through the <unk> windows , see vast forms that move fantastically to a discordant <name> ; while , like a rapid ghastly river , through the pale door , a hideous throng rush out forever , and laugh  but smile no more .
i well remember that suggestions arising from this ballad , led us into a train of thought wherein there became manifest an opinion of <unk> which i mention not so much on account of its novelty , ( for other men * have thought thus , ) as on account of the pertinacity with which he maintained it .
this opinion , in its general form , was that of the <unk> of all vegetable things .
but , in his disordered fancy , the idea had assumed a more daring character , and <unk> , under certain conditions , upon the kingdom of <unk> .
i lack words to express the full extent , or the <name> abandon of his persuasion .
the belief , however , was connected ( as i have previously hinted ) with the gray stones of the home of his forefathers .
the conditions of the <unk> had been here , he imagined , fulfilled in the method of <unk> of these stones  in the order of their arrangement , as well as in that of the many <unk> which overspread them , and of the decayed trees which stood around  above all , in the long undisturbed endurance of this arrangement , and in its <unk> in the still waters of the tarn .
its evidence  the evidence of the <unk>  was to be seen , he said , ( and i here started as he spoke , ) in the gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere of their own about the waters and the walls .
the result was discoverable , he added , in that silent , yet importunate and terrible influence which for centuries had moulded the destinies of his family , and which made him what i now saw him  what he was .
such opinions need no comment , and i <name> make none .
* watson , dr. <unk> , <unk> , and especially the bishop of <unk>  see " chemical essays , " vol v. our books  the books which , for years , had formed no small portion of the mental existence of the invalid  were , as might be supposed , in strict keeping with this character of <unk> .
we <unk> together over such works as the <unk> et <unk> of <unk> ; the <unk> of machiavelli ; the heaven and hell of swedenborg ; the subterranean voyage of <name> <unk> by <unk> ; the <unk> of <name> <unk> , of <name> <unk> , and of de la <unk> ; the journey into the blue distance of <unk> ; and the city of the sun of <unk> .
one favorite volume was a small octavo edition of the <unk> <unk> , by the <unk> <unk> de <unk> ; and there were passages in <unk> <unk> , about the old african <unk> and <unk> , over which usher would sit dreaming for hours .
his chief delight , however , was found in the perusal of an exceedingly rare and curious book in quarto gothic  the <name> of a forgotten church  the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i could not help thinking of the wild ritual of this work , and of its probable influence upon the <unk> , when , one evening , having informed me abruptly that the <name> <name> was no more , he stated his intention of preserving her corpse for a fortnight , ( previously to its final interment , ) in one of the numerous vaults within the main walls of the building .
the worldly reason , however , assigned for this singular proceeding , was one which i did not feel at <name> to dispute .
the brother had been led to his resolution ( so he told me ) by consideration of the unusual character of the malady of the deceased , of certain <unk> and eager inquiries on the part of her medical men , and of the remote and exposed situation of the <unk> of the family .
i <name> not deny that when i called to mind the sinister countenance of the person whom i met upon the staircase , on the day of my arrival at the house , i had no <name> to oppose what i regarded as at best but a harmless , and by no means an unnatural , precaution .
at the request of usher , i personally aided him in the arrangements for the temporary <unk> .
the body having been <unk> , we two alone bore it to its rest .
the vault in which we placed it ( and which had been so long unopened that our torches , half smothered in its oppressive atmosphere , gave us little opportunity for investigation ) was small , damp , and entirely without means of admission for light ; lying , at great depth , immediately beneath that portion of the building in which was my own sleeping apartment .
it had been used , apparently , in remote feudal times , for the worst purposes of a <unk> , and , in later days , as a place of deposit for powder , or some other highly combustible substance , as a portion of its floor , and the whole interior of a long archway through which we reached it , were carefully sheathed with copper .
the door , of massive iron , had been , also , similarly protected .
its immense weight caused an unusually sharp grating sound , as it moved upon its hinges .
having deposited our mournful burden upon <unk> within this region of horror , we partially turned aside the yet <unk> lid of the coffin , and looked upon the face of the tenant .
a striking <unk> between the brother and sister now first arrested my attention ; and usher , <unk> , perhaps , my thoughts , murmured out some few words from which i learned that the deceased and himself had been twins , and that sympathies of a scarcely intelligible nature had always existed between them .
our glances , however , rested not long upon the dead  for we could not regard her <unk> .
the disease which had thus entombed the <name> in the maturity of youth , had left , as usual in all maladies of a strictly <unk> character , the mockery of a faint blush upon the bosom and the face , and that suspiciously lingering smile upon the lip which is so terrible in death .
we replaced and screwed down the lid , and , having secured the door of iron , made our way , with toil , into the scarcely less gloomy apartments of the upper portion of the house .
and now , some days of bitter grief having elapsed , an observable change came over the features of the mental disorder of my friend .
his ordinary manner had vanished .
his ordinary occupations were neglected or forgotten .
he roamed from chamber to chamber with hurried , unequal , and <unk> step .
the pallor of his countenance had assumed , if possible , a more ghastly <name>  but the <unk> of his eye had utterly gone out .
the once occasional <unk> of his tone was heard no more ; and a tremulous <unk> , as if of extreme terror , habitually characterized his utterance .
there were times , indeed , when i thought his unceasingly agitated mind was laboring with some oppressive secret , to divulge which he struggled for the necessary courage .
at times , again , i was obliged to resolve all into the mere inexplicable vagaries of madness , for i beheld him gazing upon vacancy for long hours , in an attitude of the profoundest attention , as if listening to some imaginary sound .
it was no wonder that his condition terrified  that it infected me .
i felt creeping upon me , by slow yet certain degrees , the wild influences of his own fantastic yet impressive superstitions .
it was , especially , upon retiring to bed late in the night of the seventh or eighth day after the placing of the <name> <name> within the <unk> , that i experienced the full power of such feelings .
sleep came not near my couch  while the hours waned and waned away .
i struggled to reason off the nervousness which had dominion over me .
i endeavored to believe that much , if not all of what i felt , was due to the bewildering influence of the gloomy furniture of the room  of the dark and tattered draperies , which , tortured into motion by the breath of a rising tempest , swayed fitfully to and fro upon the walls , and rustled uneasily about the decorations of the bed .
but my efforts were fruitless .
an irrepressible tremor gradually pervaded my frame ; and , at length , there sat upon my very heart an <unk> of utterly <unk> alarm .
shaking this off with a gasp and a struggle , i uplifted myself upon the pillows , and , peering earnestly within the intense darkness of the chamber , <unk>  i know not why , except that an instinctive spirit prompted me  to certain low and indefinite sounds which came , through the pauses of the storm , at long intervals , i knew not whence .
overpowered by an intense sentiment of horror , unaccountable yet unendurable , i threw on my clothes with haste ( for i felt that i should sleep no more during the night ) , and endeavored to arouse myself from the pitiable condition into which i had fallen , by pacing rapidly to and fro through the apartment .
i had taken but few turns in this manner , when a light step on an adjoining staircase arrested my attention .
i presently recognised it as that of usher .
in an instant afterward he rapped , with a gentle touch , at my door , and entered , bearing a lamp .
his countenance was , as usual , <unk> <name>  but , moreover , there was a species of mad hilarity in his eyes  an evidently restrained hysteria in his whole demeanor .
his air appalled me  but anything was preferable to the solitude which i had so long endured , and i even welcomed his presence as a relief .
" and you have not seen it ? "
he said abruptly , after having stared about him for some moments in silence  " you have not then seen it ?  but , stay !
you shall . "
thus speaking , and having carefully shaded his lamp , he hurried to one of the <unk> , and threw it freely open to the storm .
the impetuous fury of the entering gust nearly lifted us from our feet .
it was , indeed , a tempestuous yet sternly beautiful night , and one wildly singular in its terror and its beauty .
a whirlwind had apparently collected its force in our vicinity ; for there were frequent and violent alterations in the direction of the wind ; and the exceeding density of the clouds ( which <name> so low as to press upon the turrets of the house ) did not prevent our perceiving the <unk> velocity with which they flew <unk> from all points against each other , without passing away into the distance .
i say that even their exceeding density did not prevent our perceiving this  yet we had no glimpse of the moon or stars  nor was there any flashing forth of the lightning .
but the under surfaces of the huge masses of agitated vapor , as well as all terrestrial objects immediately around us , were glowing in the unnatural light of a faintly luminous and distinctly visible gaseous <unk> which <name> about and enshrouded the mansion .
" you must not  you shall not behold this ! "
said i , <unk> , to usher , as i led him , with a gentle violence , from the window to a seat .
" these appearances , which bewilder you , are merely electrical phenomena not uncommon  or it may be that they have their ghastly origin in the rank <unk> of the tarn .
let us close this casement ;  the air is chilling and dangerous to your frame .
here is one of your favorite romances .
i <name> read , and you shall listen ;  and so we <name> pass away this terrible night together . "
the antique volume which i had taken up was the " mad <unk> " of sir launcelot canning ; but i had called it a favorite of usher 's more in sad jest than in <name> ; for , in truth , there is little in its uncouth and <unk> <unk> which could have had interest for the lofty and spiritual <unk> of my friend .
it was , however , the only book immediately at hand ; and i indulged a vague <name> that the excitement which now agitated the <unk> , might find relief ( for the history of mental disorder is full of similar anomalies ) even in the <unk> of the folly which i should read .
could i have judged , indeed , by the wild <unk> air of vivacity with which he <unk> , or apparently <unk> , to the words of the tale , i might well have congratulated myself upon the success of my design .
i had arrived at that well-known portion of the story where ethelred , the hero of the <unk> , having sought in vain for peaceable admission into the dwelling of the hermit , proceeds to make good an entrance by force .
here , it <name> be remembered , the words of the narrative run thus : " and ethelred , who was by nature of a doughty heart , and who was now mighty withal , on account of the <unk> of the wine which he had drunken , waited no longer to hold parley with the hermit , who , in sooth , was of an obstinate and <unk> turn , but , feeling the rain upon his shoulders , and fearing the rising of the tempest , uplifted his <unk> outright , and , with blows , made quickly room in the <unk> of the door for his <unk> hand ; and now pulling therewith sturdily , he so cracked , and ripped , and tore all asunder , that the noise of the dry and <unk> wood <unk> and <unk> throughout the forest . "
at the termination of this sentence i started , and for a moment , paused ; for it appeared to me ( although i at once concluded that my excited fancy had deceived me )  it appeared to me that , from some very remote portion of the mansion , there came , indistinctly , to my ears , what might have been , in its exact similarity of character , the <name> ( but a stifled and dull one certainly ) of the very cracking and ripping sound which sir launcelot had so particularly described .
it was , beyond doubt , the coincidence alone which had arrested my attention ; for , amid the rattling of the sashes of the <unk> , and the ordinary commingled noises of the still increasing storm , the sound , in itself , had nothing , surely , which should have interested or disturbed me .
i continued the story : " but the good champion ethelred , now entering within the door , was sore enraged and amazed to perceive no signal of the <unk> hermit ; but , in the stead thereof , a dragon of a <unk> and prodigious demeanor , and of a fiery tongue , which sate in guard before a palace of gold , with a floor of silver ; and upon the wall there <name> a shield of shining brass with this legend <unk>  who <unk> herein , a conqueror hath bin ; who <unk> the dragon , the shield he shall win ; and ethelred uplifted his <unk> , and struck upon the head of the dragon , which fell before him , and gave up his <unk> breath , with a shriek so horrid and harsh , and withal so piercing , that ethelred had fain to close his ears with his hands against the dreadful noise of it , the like whereof was never before heard . "
here again i paused abruptly , and now with a feeling of wild amazement  for there could be no doubt whatever that , in this instance , i did actually hear ( although from what direction it proceeded i found it impossible to say ) a low and apparently distant , but harsh , protracted , and most unusual screaming or grating sound  the exact counterpart of what my fancy had already <unk> up for the <unk> unnatural shriek as described by the <unk> .
oppressed , as i certainly was , upon the occurrence of this second and most extraordinary coincidence , by a thousand conflicting sensations , in which wonder and extreme terror were predominant , i still retained sufficient presence of mind to avoid exciting , by any observation , the sensitive nervousness of my companion .
i was by no means certain that he had noticed the sounds in question ; although , assuredly , a strange alteration had , during the last few minutes , taken place in his demeanor .
from a position fronting my own , he had gradually brought round his chair , so as to sit with his face to the door of the chamber ; and thus i could but partially perceive his features , although i saw that his lips trembled as if he were murmuring <unk> .
his head had dropped upon his breast  yet i knew that he was not asleep , from the wide and rigid opening of the eye as i caught a glance of it in profile .
the motion of his body , too , was at variance with this idea  for he rocked from side to side with a gentle yet constant and uniform sway .
having rapidly taken notice of all this , i resumed the narrative of sir launcelot , which thus proceeded : " and now , the champion , having escaped from the terrible fury of the dragon , <unk> himself of the brazen shield , and of the breaking up of the enchantment which was upon it , removed the carcass from out of the way before him , and approached <unk> over the silver pavement of the castle to where the shield was upon the wall ; which in sooth t feet upon the silver floor , with a mighty great and terrible ringing sound . "
no sooner had these syllables passed my lips , than  as if a shield of brass had indeed , at the moment , fallen heavily upon a floor of silver  i became aware of a distinct , hollow , metallic , and <unk> , yet apparently muffled <unk> .
completely unnerved , i leaped to my feet ; but the measured rocking movement of usher was undisturbed .
i rushed to the chair in which he sat .
his eyes were bent fixedly before him , and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony rigidity .
but , as i placed my hand upon his shoulder , there came a strong shudder over his whole person ; a sickly smile quivered about his lips ; and i saw that he spoke in a low , hurried , and <unk> murmur , as if unconscious of my presence .
bending closely over him , i at length drank in the hideous import of his words .
" not hear it ?  yes , i hear it , and have heard it .
long  long  long  many minutes , many hours , many days , have i heard it  yet i dared not  oh , pity me , miserable wretch that i am !  i dared not  i dared not speak !
we have put her living in the tomb !  said i not that my senses were acute ?
i now tell you that i heard her first feeble movements in the hollow coffin .
i heard them  many , many days ago  yet i dared not  i dared not speak !  and now  to-night  ethelred  <name> !
<name> !  the breaking of the hermit 's door , and the <unk> of the dragon , and the <unk> of the shield !  say , rather , the rending of her coffin , and the grating of the iron hinges of her prison , and her struggles within the <unk> archway of the vault !
oh whither shall i fly ?
<name> she not be here anon ?
is she not <unk> my haste ?
have i not heard her footstep on the stair ?
do i not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart ?
madman ! "
 here he sprang furiously to his feet , and shrieked out his syllables , as if in the effort he were giving up his soul  " madman !
i tell you that she now stands without the door !  " as if in the superhuman energy of his utterance there had been found the <unk> of a spell  the huge antique <unk> to which the speaker pointed , threw slowly back , upon the instant , their ponderous and <name> jaws .
it was the work of the rushing gust  but then without those doors there did stand the lofty and enshrouded figure of the <name> <name> of usher .
there was blood upon her white robes , and the evidence of some bitter struggle upon every portion of her emaciated frame .
for a moment she remained trembling and reeling to and fro upon the threshold  then , with a low moaning cry , fell heavily inward upon the person of her brother , and in her violent and now final <unk> , bore him to the floor a corpse , and a victim to the terrors he had anticipated .
from that chamber , and from that mansion , i fled aghast .
the storm was still abroad in all its wrath as i found myself crossing the old causeway .
suddenly there shot along the path a wild light , and i turned to see whence a gleam so unusual could have issued ; for the vast house and its shadows were alone behind me .
the radiance was that of the full , setting , and blood-red moon , which now shone vividly through that once <unk> fissure , of which i have before spoken as extending from the roof of the building , in a zigzag direction , to the base .
while i gazed , this fissure rapidly widened  there came a fierce breath of the whirlwind  the entire orb of the satellite burst at once upon my sight  my <name> reeled as i saw the mighty walls rushing asunder  there was a long tumultuous shouting sound like the voice of a thousand waters  and the deep and dank tarn at my feet closed sullenly and silently over the fragments of the " house of usher . "
silence  a fable <unk> .
the mountain pinnacles slumber ; valleys , crags and caves are silent .
" listen to me , " said the demon as he placed his hand upon my head .
" the region of which i speak is a dreary region in <unk> , by the borders of the river <unk> .
and there is no quiet there , nor silence .
" the waters of the river have a saffron and sickly <name> ; and they flow not onwards to the sea , but <unk> forever and forever beneath the red eye of the sun with a tumultuous and convulsive motion .
for many miles on either side of the river 's <unk> bed is a pale desert of gigantic water-lilies .
they sigh one unto the other in that solitude , and stretch towards the heaven their long and ghastly necks , and nod to and fro their everlasting heads .
and there is an indistinct murmur which cometh out from among them like the rushing of <unk> water .
and they sigh one unto the other .
" but there is a boundary to their realm  the boundary of the dark , horrible , lofty forest .
there , like the waves about the hebrides , the low <unk> is agitated continually .
but there is no wind throughout the heaven .
and the tall primeval trees rock eternally hither and thither with a crashing and mighty sound .
and from their high summits , one by one , drop everlasting dews .
and at the roots strange poisonous flowers lie writhing in <unk> slumber .
and overhead , with a rustling and loud noise , the gray clouds rush <unk> forever , until they roll , a cataract , over the fiery wall of the horizon .
but there is no wind throughout the heaven .
and by the shores of the river <unk> there is neither quiet nor silence .
" it was night , and the rain fell ; and falling , it was rain , but , having fallen , it was blood .
and i stood in the morass among the tall and the rain fell upon my head  and the lilies sighed one unto the other in the solemnity of their desolation .
" and , all at once , the moon arose through the thin ghastly mist , and was crimson in color .
and mine eyes fell upon a huge gray rock which stood by the shore of the river , and was lighted by the light of the moon .
and the rock was gray , and ghastly , and tall ,  and the rock was gray .
upon its front were characters <unk> in the stone ; and i walked through the morass of water-lilies , until i came close unto the shore , that i might read the characters upon the stone .
but i could not <unk> them .
and i was going back into the morass , when the moon shone with a fuller red , and i turned and looked again upon the rock , and upon the characters ;  and the characters were desolation .
" and i looked upwards , and there stood a man upon the summit of the rock ; and i hid myself among the water-lilies that i might discover the actions of the man .
and the man was tall and stately in form , and was wrapped up from his shoulders to his feet in the <unk> of old rome .
and the outlines of his figure were indistinct  but his features were the features of a deity ; for the mantle of the night , and of the mist , and of the moon , and of the dew , had left uncovered the features of his face .
and his brow was lofty with thought , and his eye wild with care ; and , in the few furrows upon his cheek i read the fables of sorrow , and weariness , and disgust with mankind , and a longing after solitude .
" and the man sat upon the rock , and leaned his head upon his hand , and looked out upon the desolation .
he looked down into the low unquiet shrubbery , and up into the tall primeval trees , and up higher at the rustling heaven , and into the crimson moon .
and i lay close within shelter of the lilies , and observed the actions of the man .
and the man trembled in the solitude ;  but the night waned , and he sat upon the rock .
" and the man turned his attention from the heaven , and looked out upon the dreary river <unk> , and upon the yellow ghastly waters , and upon the pale legions of the water-lilies .
and the man listened to the sighs of the water-lilies , and to the murmur that came up from among them .
and i lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man .
and the man trembled in the solitude ;  but the night waned and he sat upon the rock .
" then i went down into the recesses of the morass , and waded afar in among the wilderness of the lilies , and called unto the <unk> which dwelt among the fens in the recesses of the morass .
and the <unk> heard my call , and came , with the <unk> , unto the foot of the rock , and roared loudly and fearfully beneath the moon .
and i lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man .
and the man trembled in the solitude ;  but the night waned and he sat upon the rock .
" then i cursed the elements with the curse of tumult ; and a frightful tempest gathered in the heaven where , before , there had been no wind .
and the heaven became livid with the violence of the tempest  and the rain beat upon the head of the man  and the floods of the river came down  and the river was tormented into foam  and the water-lilies shrieked within their beds  and the forest crumbled before the wind  and the thunder rolled  and the lightning fell  and the rock rocked to its foundation .
and i lay close within my covert and observed the actions of the man .
and the man trembled in the solitude ;  but the night waned and he sat upon the rock .
" then i grew angry and cursed , with the curse of silence , the river , and the lilies , and the wind , and the forest , and the heaven , and the thunder , and the sighs of the water-lilies .
and they became accursed , and were still .
and the moon ceased to totter up its pathway to heaven  and the thunder died away  and the lightning did not flash  and the clouds <name> motionless  and the waters sunk to their level and remained  and the trees ceased to rock  and the water-lilies sighed no more  and the murmur was heard no longer from among them , nor any shadow of sound throughout the vast illimitable desert .
and i looked upon the characters of the rock , and they were changed ;  and the characters were silence .
" and mine eyes fell upon the countenance of the man , and his countenance was <name> with terror .
and , hurriedly , he raised his head from his hand , and stood forth upon the rock and listened .
but there was no voice throughout the vast illimitable desert , and the characters upon the rock were silence .
and the man shuddered , and turned his face away , and fled afar off , in haste , so that i beheld him no more . "
now there are fine tales in the volumes of the magi  in the <unk> , melancholy volumes of the magi .
therein , i say , are glorious histories of the heaven , and of the earth , and of the mighty sea  and of the genii that <unk> the sea , and the earth , and the lofty heaven .
there was much <name> too in the sayings which were said by the <unk> ; and holy , holy things were heard of old by the dim leaves that trembled around <unk>  but , as allah <unk> , that fable which the demon told me as he sat by my side in the shadow of the tomb , i hold to be the most wonderful of all !
and as the demon made an end of his story , he fell back within the cavity of the tomb and laughed .
and i could not laugh with the demon , and he cursed me because i could not laugh .
and the lynx which <unk> forever in the tomb , came out therefrom , and lay down at the feet of the demon , and looked at him steadily in the face .
the <unk> of the red death .
the " red death " had long <unk> the country .
no pestilence had ever been so fatal , or so hideous .
blood was its <unk> and its seal  the redness and the horror of blood .
there were sharp pains , and sudden dizziness , and then profuse bleeding at the pores , with dissolution .
the <name> stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim , were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellow-men .
and the whole seizure , progress and termination of the disease , were the incidents of half an hour .
but the <name> <unk> was happy and dauntless and sagacious .
when his dominions were half <unk> , he summoned to his presence a thousand hale and light-hearted friends from among the knights and dames of his court , and with these retired to the deep seclusion of one of his <unk> abbeys .
this was an extensive and magnificent structure , the creation of the <name> 's own eccentric yet <name> taste .
a strong and lofty wall <unk> it in .
this wall had gates of iron .
the courtiers , having entered , brought furnaces and massy hammers and welded the bolts .
they resolved to leave means neither of ingress or egress to the sudden impulses of despair or of frenzy from within .
the <name> was amply <unk> .
with such precautions the courtiers might bid defiance to <unk> .
the external world could take care of itself .
in the meantime it was folly to grieve , or to think .
the <name> had provided all the appliances of pleasure .
there were <unk> , there were <unk> , there were <unk> , there were musicians , there was beauty , there was wine .
all these and security were within .
without was the " red death . "
it was toward the close of the fifth or sixth month of his seclusion , and while the pestilence raged most furiously abroad , that the <name> <unk> entertained his thousand friends at a masked ball of the most unusual magnificence .
it was a voluptuous scene , that masquerade .
but first let me tell of the rooms in which it was held .
there were seven  an imperial suite .
in many palaces , however , such suites form a long and straight vista , while the folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand , so that the view of the whole extent is scarcely impeded .
here the case was very different ; as might have been expected from the duke 's love of the bizarre .
the apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more than one at a time .
there was a sharp turn at every twenty or thirty yards , and at each turn a novel effect .
to the right and left , in the middle of each wall , a tall and narrow gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor which pursued the windings of the suite .
these windows were of stained glass whose color varied in accordance with the prevailing <name> of the decorations of the chamber into which it opened .
that at the eastern extremity was <name> , for example , in blue  and vividly blue were its windows .
the second chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries , and here the panes were purple .
the third was green throughout , and so were the <unk> .
the fourth was furnished and lighted with orange  the fifth with white  the sixth with <name> .
the seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black <name> tapestries that <name> all over the ceiling and down the walls , falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and <name> .
but in this chamber only , the color of the windows failed to correspond with the decorations .
the panes here were <name>  a deep blood color .
now in no one of the seven apartments was there any lamp or <unk> , amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro or depended from the roof .
there was no light of any kind <unk> from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers .
but in the corridors that followed the suite , there stood , opposite to each window , a heavy tripod , bearing a <unk> of fire that protected its rays through the tinted glass and so <unk> illumined the room .
and thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances .
but in the western or black chamber the effect of the <unk> that streamed upon the dark hangings through the <unk> panes , was ghastly in the extreme , and produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered , that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all .
it was in this apartment , also , that there stood against the western wall , a gigantic clock of <name> .
its pendulum swung to and fro with a dull , heavy , monotonous clang ; and when the <unk> made the circuit of the face , and the hour was to be stricken , there came from the brazen lungs of the clock a sound which was clear and loud and deep and exceedingly musical , but of so peculiar a note and emphasis that , at each lapse of an hour , the musicians of the orchestra were constrained to pause , momentarily , in their performance , to hearken to the sound ; and thus the <unk> perforce ceased their evolutions ; and there was a brief <unk> of the whole <name> company ; and , while the <unk> of the clock yet rang , it was observed that the <unk> grew pale , and the more aged and sedate passed their hands over their brows as if in confused reverie or meditation .
but when the echoes had fully ceased , a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly ; the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly , and made whispering vows , each to the other , that the next <unk> of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion ; and then , after the lapse of sixty minutes , ( which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of the time that flies , ) there came yet another <unk> of the clock , and then were the same <unk> and <unk> and meditation as before .
but , in spite of these things , it was a <name> and magnificent revel .
the tastes of the duke were peculiar .
he had a fine eye for colors and effects .
he disregarded the <unk> of mere fashion .
his plans were bold and fiery , and his conceptions glowed with barbaric lustre .
there are some who would have thought him mad .
his followers felt that he was not .
it was necessary to hear and see and touch him to be sure that he was not .
he had directed , in great part , the <unk> embellishments of the seven chambers , upon occasion of this great <unk> ; and it was his own guiding taste which had given character to the <unk> .
be sure they were grotesque .
there were much glare and glitter and <unk> and <unk>  much of what has been since seen in " <unk> . "
there were <unk> figures with <unk> limbs and appointments .
there were delirious fancies such as the madman fashions .
there was much of the beautiful , much of the wanton , much of the bizarre , something of the terrible , and not a little of that which might have excited disgust .
to and fro in the seven chambers there stalked , in fact , a multitude of dreams .
and these  the dreams  writhed in and about , taking <name> from the rooms , and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the <name> of their steps .
and , anon , there strikes the <name> clock which stands in the hall of the <name> .
and then , for a moment , all is still , and all is silent save the voice of the clock .
the dreams are <unk> as they stand .
but the echoes of the chime die away  they have endured but an instant  and a light , <unk> laughter floats after them as they depart .
and now again the music swells , and the dreams live , and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever , taking <name> from the <unk> windows through which stream the rays from the <unk> .
but to the chamber which lies most <unk> of the seven , there are now none of the <unk> who venture ; for the night is waning away ; and there flows a <unk> light through the <unk> panes ; and the blackness of the sable drapery <unk> ; and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet , there comes from the near clock of <name> a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulge in the more remote <unk> of the other apartments .
but these other apartments were densely crowded , and in them beat feverishly the heart of life .
and the revel went <unk> on , until at length there commenced the sounding of midnight upon the clock .
and then the music ceased , as i have told ; and the evolutions of the <unk> were quieted ; and there was an uneasy cessation of all things as before .
but now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the <name> of the clock ; and thus it happened , perhaps , that more of thought crept , with more of time , into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled .
and thus , too , it happened , perhaps , that before the last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence , there were many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no single individual before .
and the rumor of this new presence having spread itself <unk> around , there arose at length from the whole company a buzz , or murmur , expressive of disapprobation and surprise  then , finally , of terror , of horror , and of disgust .
in an assembly of <unk> such as i have painted , it may well be supposed that no ordinary appearance could have excited such sensation .
in truth the masquerade license of the night was nearly unlimited ; but the figure in question had <unk> herod , and gone beyond the bounds of even the <name> 's indefinite decorum .
there are chords in the hearts of the most reckless which can not be touched without emotion .
even with the utterly lost , to whom life and death are equally jests , there are matters of which no jest can be made .
the whole company , indeed , seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed .
the figure was tall and gaunt , and shrouded from head to foot in the <unk> of the grave .
the mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have had difficulty in detecting the cheat .
and yet all this might have been endured , if not approved , by the mad <unk> around .
but the <unk> had gone so far as to assume the type of the red death .
his <unk> was <unk> in blood  and his broad brow , with all the features of the face , was <unk> with the <name> horror .
when the eyes of <name> <unk> fell upon this spectral image ( which with a slow and solemn movement , as if more fully to sustain its role , stalked to and fro among the <unk> ) he was seen to be convulsed , in the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste ; but , in the next , his brow reddened with rage .
" who dares ? "
he demanded hoarsely of the courtiers who stood near him  " who dares insult us with this blasphemous mockery ?
seize him and <unk> him  that we may know whom we have to <name> at sunrise , from the battlements ! "
it was in the eastern or blue chamber in which stood the <name> <unk> as he uttered these words .
they rang throughout the seven rooms loudly and clearly  for the <name> was a bold and robust man , and the music had become hushed at the waving of his hand .
it was in the blue room where stood the <name> , with a group of pale courtiers by his side .
at first , as he spoke , there was a slight rushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder , who at the moment was also near at hand , and now , with deliberate and stately step , made closer approach to the speaker .
but from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the <unk> had inspired the whole party , there were found none who put forth hand to seize him ; so that , <unk> , he passed within a yard of the <name> 's person ; and , while the vast assembly , as if with one impulse , shrank from the centres of the rooms to the walls , he made his way uninterruptedly , but with the same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the first , through the blue chamber to the purple  through the purple to the green  through the green to the orange  through this again to the white  and even thence to the <name> , ere a decided movement had been made to arrest him .
it was then , however , that the <name> <unk> , maddening with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice , rushed hurriedly through the six chambers , while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had seized upon all .
he bore aloft a drawn dagger , and had approached , in rapid impetuosity , to within three or four feet of the retreating figure , when the latter , having attained the extremity of the <name> apartment , turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer .
there was a sharp cry  and the dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet , upon which , instantly afterwards , fell prostrate in death the <name> <unk> .
then , summoning the wild courage of despair , a throng of the <unk> at once threw themselves into the black apartment , and , seizing the <unk> , whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the <name> clock , gasped in unutterable horror at finding the <unk> and <unk> mask which they handled with so violent a rudeness , <unk> by any tangible form .
and now was acknowledged the presence of the red death .
he had come like a thief in the night .
and one by one dropped the <unk> in the <unk> halls of their revel , and died each in the despairing posture of his fall .
and the life of the <name> clock went out with that of the last of the <name> .
and the flames of the <unk> expired .
and darkness and decay and the red death held illimitable dominion over all .
the cask of amontillado .
the thousand injuries of fortunato i had borne as i best could ; but when he ventured upon insult , i vowed revenge .
you , who so well know the nature of my soul , <name> not suppose , however , that i gave utterance to a threat .
at length i would be avenged ; this was a point <unk> settled  but the very <unk> with which it was resolved , <unk> the idea of risk .
i must not only punish , but punish with impunity .
a wrong is <unk> when retribution <unk> its <unk> .
it is equally <unk> when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong .
it must be understood , that neither by word nor deed had i given fortunato cause to doubt my good <name> .
i continued , as was my wont , to smile in his face , and he did not perceive that my smile now was at the thought of his <unk> .
he had a weak point  this fortunato  although in other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared .
he prided himself on his <unk> in wine .
few italians have the true <unk> spirit .
for the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunity  to practise imposture upon the british and austrian millionaires .
in painting and <unk> , fortunato , like his countrymen , was a quack  but in the matter of old wines he was sincere .
in this respect i did not differ from him materially : i was skilful in the italian <unk> myself , and bought largely whenever i could .
it was about dusk , one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season , that i encountered my friend .
he accosted me with excessive warmth , for he had been drinking much .
the man wore motley .
he had on a <unk> <unk> dress , and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells .
i was so pleased to see him , that i thought i should never have done wringing his hand .
i said to him  " my dear fortunato , you are luckily met .
how remarkably well you are looking to-day !
but i have received a pipe of what passes for amontillado , and i have my doubts . "
" how ? "
said he .
" amontillado ?
a pipe ?
impossible !
and in the middle of the carnival ! "
" i have my doubts , " i replied ; " and i was silly enough to pay the full amontillado price without consulting you in the matter .
you were not to be found , and i was fearful of losing a bargain . "
" amontillado ! "
" i have my doubts . "
" amontillado ! "
" and i must satisfy them . "
" amontillado ! "
" as you are engaged , i am on my way to <unk> .
if any one has a critical turn , it is he .
he <name> tell me  " " <unk> can not tell amontillado from <name> . "
" and yet some fools <name> have it that his taste is a match for your own . "
" come , let us go . "
" whither ? "
" to your vaults . "
" my friend , no ; i <name> not impose upon your good nature .
i perceive you have an engagement .
<unk>  " " i have no engagement ;  come . "
" my friend , no .
it is not the engagement , but the severe cold with which i perceive you are afflicted .
the vaults are <unk> damp .
they are encrusted with nitre . "
" let us go , nevertheless .
the cold is merely nothing .
amontillado !
you have been imposed upon .
and as for <unk> , he can not distinguish <name> from amontillado . "
thus speaking , fortunato possessed himself of my arm .
putting on a mask of black silk , and drawing a <unk> closely about my person , i suffered him to hurry me to my <unk> .
there were no attendants at home ; they had <unk> to make <name> in honor of the time .
i had told them that i should not return until the morning , and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house .
these orders were sufficient , i well knew , to insure their immediate disappearance , one and all , as soon as my back was turned .
i took from their <unk> two <unk> , and giving one to fortunato , bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into the vaults .
i passed down a long and winding staircase , requesting him to be cautious as he followed .
we came at length to the foot of the descent , and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the <unk> .
the gait of my friend was unsteady , and the bells upon his cap jingled as he strode .
" the pipe , " said he .
" it is farther on , " said i ; " but observe the white <unk> which gleams from these cavern walls . "
he turned towards me , and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that distilled the <unk> of intoxication .
" nitre ? "
he asked , at length .
" nitre , " i replied .
" how long have you had that cough ? "
" ugh !
ugh !
ugh !  ugh !
ugh !
ugh !  ugh !
ugh !
ugh !  ugh !
ugh !
ugh !  ugh !
ugh !
ugh ! "
my poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes .
" it is nothing , " he said , at last .
" come , " i said , with decision , " we <name> go back ; your health is precious .
you are <name> , respected , admired , beloved ; you are happy , as once i was .
you are a man to be missed .
for me it is no matter .
we <name> go back ; you <name> be ill , and i can not be responsible .
besides , there is <unk>  " " enough , " he said ; " the cough is a mere nothing ; it <name> not kill me .
i shall not die of a cough . "
" true  true , " i replied ; " and , indeed , i had no intention of alarming you unnecessarily  but you should use all proper caution .
a draught of this <unk> <name> defend us from the <unk> . "
here i knocked off the neck of a bottle which i <name> from a long row of its fellows that lay upon the mould .
" drink , " i said , presenting him the wine .
he raised it to his lips with a leer .
he paused and nodded to me familiarly , while his bells jingled .
" i drink , " he said , " to the buried that repose around us . "
" and i to your long life . "
he again took my arm , and we proceeded .
" these vaults , " he said , " are extensive . "
" the <unk> , " i replied , " were a great and numerous family . "
" i forget your arms . "
" a huge human foot <unk> , in a field azure ; the foot <unk> a serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel . "
" and the motto ? "
" <unk> me <unk> <unk> . "
" good ! "
he said .
the wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled .
my own fancy grew warm with the <unk> .
we had passed through walls of piled bones , with casks and <unk> <unk> , into the inmost recesses of the catacombs .
i paused again , and this time i made bold to seize fortunato by an arm above the elbow .
" the nitre ! "
i said : " see , it increases .
it hangs like moss upon the vaults .
we are below the river 's bed .
the drops of moisture trickle among the bones .
come , we <name> go back ere it is too late .
your cough  " " it is nothing , " he said ; " let us go on .
but first , another draught of the <unk> . "
i broke and reached him a <unk> of de <unk> .
he emptied it at a breath .
his eyes flashed with a fierce light .
he laughed and threw the bottle upwards with a <unk> i did not understand .
i looked at him in surprise .
he repeated the movement  a grotesque one .
" you do not comprehend ? "
he said .
" not i , " i replied .
" then you are not of the brotherhood . "
" how ? "
" you are not of the masons . "
" yes , yes , " i said , " yes , yes . "
" you ?
impossible !
a <name> ? "
" a <name> , " i replied .
" a sign , " he said .
" it is this , " i answered , producing a trowel from beneath the folds of my <unk> .
" you jest , " he exclaimed , <unk> a few paces .
" but let us proceed to the amontillado . "
" be it so , " i said , replacing the tool beneath the cloak , and again offering him my arm .
he leaned upon it heavily .
we continued our route in search of the amontillado .
we passed through a range of low arches , descended , passed on , and descending again , arrived at a deep crypt , in which the <unk> of the air caused our <unk> rather to glow than flame .
at the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less spacious .
its walls had been lined with human remains , piled to the vault overhead , in the fashion of the great catacombs of <name> .
three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner .
from the fourth the bones had been thrown down , and lay promiscuously upon the earth , forming at one point a mound of some size .
within the wall thus exposed by the <unk> of the bones , we perceived a still interior recess , in depth about four feet , in width three , in height six or seven .
it seemed to have been constructed for no especial use in itself , but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs , and was backed by one of their <unk> walls of solid granite .
it was in vain that fortunato , uplifting his dull torch , endeavored to pry into the depths of the recess .
its termination the feeble light did not enable us to see .
" proceed , " i said ; " herein is the amontillado .
as for <unk>  " " he is an <unk> , " interrupted my friend , as he stepped unsteadily forward , while i followed immediately at his heels .
in an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche , and finding his progress arrested by the rock , stood stupidly bewildered .
a moment more and i had fettered him to the granite .
in its surface were two iron <unk> , distant from each other about two feet , horizontally .
from one of these depended a short chain , from the other a <unk> .
throwing the links about his waist , it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it .
he was too much astounded to resist .
withdrawing the key i stepped back from the recess .
" pass your hand , " i said , " over the wall ; you can not help feeling the nitre .
indeed it is very damp .
once more let me implore you to return .
no ?
then i must positively leave you .
but i must first render you all the little attentions in my power . "
" the amontillado ! "
ejaculated my friend , not yet recovered from his astonishment .
" true , " i replied ; " the amontillado . "
as i said these words i busied myself among the pile of bones of which i have before spoken .
throwing them aside , i soon uncovered a quantity of building stone and mortar .
with these materials and with the aid of my trowel , i began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche .
i had scarcely laid the first tier of my masonry when i discovered that the intoxication of fortunato had in a great measure worn off .
the earliest indication i had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth of the recess .
it was not the cry of a drunken man .
there was then a long and obstinate silence .
i laid the second tier , and the third , and the fourth ; and then i heard the furious vibrations of the chain .
the noise lasted for several minutes , during which , that i might hearken to it with the more satisfaction , i ceased my labors and sat down upon the bones .
when at last the clanking subsided , i resumed the trowel , and finished without interruption the fifth , the sixth , and the seventh tier .
the wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast .
i again paused , and holding the <unk> over the <unk> , threw a few feeble rays upon the figure within .
a succession of loud and shrill screams , bursting suddenly from the throat of the chained form , seemed to thrust me violently back .
for a brief moment i hesitated  i trembled .
<unk> my <unk> , i began to grope with it about the recess : but the thought of an instant reassured me .
i placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs , and felt satisfied .
i <unk> the wall .
i replied to the yells of him who <unk> .
i <unk>  i aided  i surpassed them in volume and in strength .
i did this , and the <unk> grew still .
it was now midnight , and my task was drawing to a close .
i had completed the eighth , the ninth , and the tenth tier .
i had finished a portion of the last and the eleventh ; there remained but a single stone to be fitted and plastered in .
i struggled with its weight ; i placed it partially in its destined position .
but now there came from out the niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head .
it was succeeded by a sad voice , which i had difficulty in recognising as that of the <name> fortunato .
the voice said  " <name> !
<name> !
<name> !  he !
he !  a very good joke indeed  an excellent jest .
we <name> have many a <name> laugh about it at the <unk>  he !
he !
he !  over our wine  he !
he !
he ! "
" the amontillado ! "
i said .
" he !
he !
he !  he !
he !
he !  yes , the amontillado .
but is it not getting late ?
<name> not they be awaiting us at the <unk> , the <name> fortunato and the rest ?
let us be gone . "
" yes , " i said , " let us be gone . "
" for the love of god , <unk> !  " " yes , " i said , " for the love of god ! "
but to these words i <unk> in vain for a reply .
i grew impatient .
i called aloud  " fortunato ! "
no answer .
i called again  " fortunato ! "
no answer still .
i thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let it fall within .
there came forth in return only a jingling of the bells .
my heart grew sick  on account of the dampness of the catacombs .
i hastened to make an end of my labor .
i forced the last stone into its position ; i plastered it up .
against the new masonry i <unk> the old rampart of bones .
for the half of a century no mortal has disturbed them .
in pace <unk> !  the imp of the perverse in the consideration of the faculties and impulses  of the <unk> <unk> of the human soul , the <unk> have failed to make room for a propensity which , although obviously existing as a radical , primitive , <unk> sentiment , has been equally overlooked by all the <unk> who have preceded them .
in the pure arrogance of the reason , we have all overlooked it .
we have suffered its existence to escape our senses , solely through want of belief  of <name> ;  whether it be <name> in revelation , or <name> in the <unk> .
the idea of it has never occurred to us , simply because of its <unk> .
we saw no need of the impulse  for the propensity .
we could not perceive its necessity .
we could not understand , that is to say , we could not have understood , had the notion of this <unk> mobile ever <unk> itself ;  we could not have understood in what manner it might be made to further the objects of humanity , either temporal or eternal .
it can not be denied that <unk> and , in great measure , all <unk> have been concocted a priori .
the intellectual or logical man , rather than the understanding or <unk> man , set himself to imagine designs  to dictate purposes to god .
having thus <unk> , to his satisfaction , the intentions of jehovah , out of these intentions he built his innumerable systems of mind .
in the matter of <unk> , for example , we first determined , naturally enough , that it was the design of the deity that man should eat .
we then assigned to man an organ of <unk> , and this organ is the scourge with which the deity compels man , <unk> <unk> , into eating .
secondly , having settled it to be god 's <name> that man should continue his species , we discovered an organ of <unk> , forthwith .
and so with <unk> , with <unk> , with <unk> , with <unk> ,  so , in short , with every organ , whether representing a propensity , a moral sentiment , or a faculty of the pure intellect .
and in these arrangements of the <unk> of human action , the <unk> , whether right or wrong , in part , or upon the whole , have but followed , in principle , the footsteps of their predecessors : <unk> and establishing every thing from the preconceived <name> of man , and upon the ground of the objects of his creator .
it would have been wiser , it would have been safer , to classify ( if classify we must ) upon the basis of what man usually or occasionally did , and was always occasionally doing , rather than upon the basis of what we took it for granted the deity intended him to do .
if we can not comprehend god in his visible works , how then in his inconceivable thoughts , that call the works into being ?
if we can not understand him in his objective creatures , how then in his substantive moods and phases of creation ?
induction , a <unk> , would have brought <unk> to admit , as an innate and primitive principle of human action , a paradoxical something , which we may call <unk> , for want of a more characteristic term .
in the sense i intend , it is , in fact , a mobile without motive , a motive not <unk> .
through its <unk> we act without comprehensible object ; or , if this shall be understood as a contradiction in terms , we may so far modify the proposition as to say , that through its <unk> we act , for the reason that we should not .
in theory , no reason can be more unreasonable , but , in fact , there is none more strong .
with certain minds , under certain conditions , it becomes absolutely irresistible .
i am not more certain that i breathe , than that the assurance of the wrong or error of any action is often the one <unk> force which impels us , and alone impels us to its prosecution .
nor <name> this overwhelming tendency to do wrong for the wrong 's sake , admit of analysis , or resolution into ulterior elements .
it is a radical , a primitive <unk> .
it <name> be said , i am aware , that when we persist in acts because we feel we should not persist in them , our conduct is but a modification of that which ordinarily springs from the <unk> of <unk> .
but a glance <name> show the fallacy of this idea .
the <unk> <unk> has for its essence , the necessity of self-defence .
it is our safeguard against injury .
its principle regards our well-being ; and thus the <name> to be well is excited simultaneously with its development .
it follows , that the <name> to be well must be excited simultaneously with any principle which shall be merely a modification of <unk> , but in the case of that something which i term <unk> , the <name> to be well is not only not aroused , but a strongly <unk> sentiment exists .
an appeal to one 's own heart is , after all , the best reply to the <unk> just noticed .
no one who <unk> <unk> and thoroughly questions his own soul , <name> be disposed to deny the entire <unk> of the propensity in question .
it is not more incomprehensible than distinctive .
there lives no man who at some period has not been tormented , for example , by an <name> <name> to <unk> a listener by <unk> .
the speaker is aware that he <unk> ; he has every intention to please , he is usually <name> , precise , and clear , the most <unk> and luminous language is struggling for utterance upon his tongue , it is only with difficulty that he <unk> himself from giving it flow ; he dreads and <unk> the anger of him whom he addresses ; yet , the thought strikes him , that by certain <unk> and <unk> this anger may be engendered .
that single thought is enough .
the impulse increases to a wish , the wish to a <name> , the <name> to an uncontrollable longing , and the longing ( to the deep regret and mortification of the speaker , and in defiance of all consequences ) is indulged .
we have a task before us which must be speedily performed .
we know that it <name> be ruinous to make delay .
the most important crisis of our life calls , <unk> , for immediate energy and action .
we glow , we are consumed with eagerness to commence the work , with the anticipation of whose glorious result our whole souls are on fire .
it must , it shall be undertaken to-day , and yet we put it off until to-morrow , and why ?
there is no answer , except that we feel perverse , using the word with no comprehension of the principle .
to-morrow arrives , and with it a more impatient anxiety to do our duty , but with this very increase of anxiety arrives , also , a nameless , a positively fearful , because unfathomable , craving for delay .
this craving gathers strength as the moments fly .
the last hour for action is at hand .
we tremble with the violence of the conflict within us ,  of the definite with the indefinite  of the substance with the shadow .
but , if the contest have proceeded thus far , it is the shadow which prevails ,  we struggle in vain .
the clock strikes , and is the knell of our welfare .
at the same time , it is the <unk>  note to the ghost that has so long overawed us .
it flies  it disappears  we are free .
the old energy returns .
we <name> labor now .
alas , it is too late !
we stand upon the brink of a precipice .
we peer into the abyss  we grow sick and dizzy .
our first impulse is to shrink from the danger .
unaccountably we remain .
by slow degrees our sickness and dizziness and horror become merged in a cloud of <unk> feeling .
by gradations , still more imperceptible , this cloud assumes shape , as did the vapor from the bottle out of which arose the genius in the arabian nights .
but out of this our cloud upon the precipice 's edge , there grows into <unk> , a shape , far more terrible than any genius or any demon of a tale , and yet it is but a thought , although a fearful one , and one which chills the very marrow of our bones with the fierceness of the delight of its horror .
it is merely the idea of what would be our sensations during the sweeping <unk> of a fall from such a height .
and this fall  this rushing annihilation  for the very reason that it involves that one most ghastly and loathsome of all the most ghastly and loathsome images of death and suffering which have ever presented themselves to our imagination  for this very cause do we now the most vividly <name> it .
and because our reason violently <unk> us from the brink , therefore do we the most impetuously approach it .
there is no passion in nature so <unk> impatient , as that of him who , shuddering upon the edge of a precipice , thus <unk> a plunge .
to indulge , for a moment , in any attempt at thought , is to be inevitably lost ; for reflection but urges us to forbear , and therefore it is , i say , that we can not .
if there be no friendly arm to check us , or if we fail in a sudden effort to prostrate ourselves backward from the abyss , we plunge , and are destroyed .
examine these similar actions as we <name> , we shall find them resulting solely from the spirit of the perverse .
we perpetrate them because we feel that we should not .
beyond or behind this there is no intelligible principle ; and we might , indeed , deem this <unk> a direct <unk> of the <unk> , were it not occasionally known to operate in furtherance of good .
i have said thus much , that in some measure i may answer your question , that i may explain to you why i am here , that i may assign to you something that shall have at least the faint aspect of a cause for my wearing these fetters , and for my <unk> this cell of the condemned .
had i not been thus <unk> , you might either have misunderstood me altogether , or , with the rabble , have fancied me mad .
as it is , you <name> easily perceive that i am one of the many <unk> victims of the imp of the perverse .
it is impossible that any deed could have been wrought with a more thorough deliberation .
for weeks , for months , i pondered upon the means of the murder .
i rejected a thousand schemes , because their accomplishment involved a chance of detection .
at length , in reading some french memoirs , i found an account of a nearly fatal illness that occurred to madame <unk> , through the agency of a candle accidentally poisoned .
the idea struck my fancy at once .
i knew my victim 's habit of reading in bed .
i knew , too , that his apartment was narrow and <unk> .
but i need not vex you with impertinent details .
i need not describe the easy artifices by which i substituted , in his <unk> <unk> , a <unk> of my own making for the one which i there found .
the next morning he was discovered dead in his bed , and the coroner 's verdict was  " death by the visitation of god . "
having inherited his estate , all went well with me for years .
the idea of detection never once entered my <name> .
of the remains of the fatal taper i had myself carefully disposed .
i had left no shadow of a clew by which it would be possible to convict , or even to suspect me of the crime .
it is inconceivable how <name> a sentiment of satisfaction arose in my bosom as i reflected upon my absolute security .
for a very long period of time i was accustomed to revel in this sentiment .
it afforded me more real delight than all the mere worldly advantages <unk> from my sin .
but there arrived at length an epoch , from which the pleasurable feeling grew , by scarcely perceptible gradations , into a haunting and harassing thought .
it harassed because it haunted .
i could scarcely get rid of it for an instant .
it is quite a common thing to be thus annoyed with the ringing in our ears , or rather in our memories , of the burthen of some ordinary song , or some <unk> snatches from an opera .
nor <name> we be the less tormented if the song in itself be good , or the opera air <unk> .
in this manner , at last , i would perpetually catch myself pondering upon my security , and repeating , in a low undertone , the phrase , " i am safe . "
one day , whilst sauntering along the streets , i arrested myself in the act of murmuring , half aloud , these customary syllables .
in a fit of <unk> , i <unk> them thus ; " i am safe  i am safe  yes  if i be not fool enough to make open confession ! "
no sooner had i spoken these words , than i felt an icy chill creep to my heart .
i had had some experience in these fits of perversity , ( whose nature i have been at some trouble to explain ) , and i remembered well that in no instance i had successfully resisted their attacks .
and now my own casual <unk> that i might possibly be fool enough to confess the murder of which i had been guilty , confronted me , as if the very ghost of him whom i had murdered  and beckoned me on to death .
at first , i made an effort to shake off this nightmare of the soul .
i walked vigorously  faster  still faster  at length i ran .
i felt a maddening <name> to shriek aloud .
every succeeding wave of thought overwhelmed me with new terror , for , alas !
i well , too well understood that to think , in my situation , was to be lost .
i still quickened my pace .
i bounded like a madman through the crowded thoroughfares .
at length , the populace took the alarm , and pursued me .
i felt then the consummation of my fate .
could i have torn out my tongue , i would have done it , but a rough voice resounded in my ears  a rougher grasp seized me by the shoulder .
i turned  i gasped for breath .
for a moment i experienced all the pangs of suffocation ; i became blind , and deaf , and giddy ; and then some invisible fiend , i thought , struck me with his broad palm upon the back .
the long imprisoned secret burst forth from my soul .
they say that i spoke with a distinct enunciation , but with marked emphasis and passionate hurry , as if in dread of interruption before concluding the brief , but pregnant sentences that consigned me to the <unk> and to hell .
having related all that was necessary for the fullest judicial conviction , i fell prostrate in a swoon .
but why shall i say more ?
to-day i wear these chains , and am here !
to-morrow i shall be <unk> !  but where ?
the island of the <name> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> .
" la <unk> , " says <unk> , in those " <unk> <unk> " ( *1 ) which in all our translations , we have insisted upon calling " moral tales , " as if in mockery of their spirit  " la <unk> est <name> <unk> des talents qui <unk> de <unk> ; tous <name> <unk> <unk> des <unk> . "
he here <unk> the pleasure <unk> from sweet sounds with the capacity for creating them .
no more than any other talent , is that for music susceptible of complete enjoyment , where there is no second party to appreciate its exercise .
and it is only in common with other talents that it produces effects which may be fully enjoyed in solitude .
the idea which the <unk> has either failed to entertain clearly , or has sacrificed in its expression to his national love of point , is , doubtless , the very <unk> one that the higher order of music is the most thoroughly estimated when we are exclusively alone .
the proposition , in this form , <name> be admitted at once by those who love the lyre for its own sake , and for its spiritual uses .
but there is one pleasure still within the reach of fallen mortality and perhaps only one  which owes even more than does music to the accessory sentiment of seclusion .
i mean the happiness experienced in the contemplation of natural scenery .
in truth , the man who would behold aright the <name> of god upon earth must in solitude behold that <name> .
to me , at least , the presence  not of human life only , but of life in any other form than that of the green things which grow upon the soil and are voiceless  is a stain upon the landscape  is at war with the genius of the scene .
i love , indeed , to regard the dark valleys , and the gray rocks , and the waters that silently smile , and the forests that sigh in uneasy slumbers , and the proud watchful mountains that look down upon all ,  i love to regard these as themselves but the colossal members of one vast animate and <unk> whole  a whole whose form ( that of the sphere ) is the most perfect and most inclusive of all ; whose path is among associate planets ; whose meek <unk> is the moon , whose <unk> sovereign is the sun ; whose life is eternity , whose thought is that of a god ; whose enjoyment is knowledge ; whose destinies are lost in immensity , whose cognizance of ourselves is akin with our own cognizance of the <unk> which infest the <name>  a being which we , in consequence , regard as purely inanimate and material much in the same manner as these <unk> must thus regard us .
our telescopes and our mathematical investigations assure us on every hand  notwithstanding the cant of the more ignorant of the <unk>  that space , and therefore that bulk , is an important consideration in the eyes of the almighty .
the cycles in which the stars move are those best adapted for the evolution , without collision , of the greatest possible number of bodies .
the forms of those bodies are accurately such as , within a given surface , to include the greatest possible amount of matter ;  while the surfaces themselves are so disposed as to accommodate a denser population than could be accommodated on the same surfaces otherwise arranged .
nor is it any argument against bulk being an object with god , that space itself is infinite ; for there may be an infinity of matter to fill it .
and since we see clearly that the endowment of matter with vitality is a principle  indeed , as far as our judgments extend , the leading principle in the operations of deity ,  it is scarcely logical to imagine it confined to the regions of the minute , where we daily trace it , and not extending to those of the <name> .
as we find cycle within cycle without end ,  yet all revolving around one <unk> centre which is the <unk> , may we not <unk> suppose in the same manner , life within life , the less within the greater , and all within the spirit divine ?
in short , we are madly erring , through <unk> , in believing man , in either his temporal or future destinies , to be of more moment in the universe than that vast " clod of the valley " which he <unk> and <unk> , and to which he denies a soul for no more profound reason than that he does not behold it in operation .
( <unk> ) these fancies , and such as these , have always given to my meditations among the mountains and the forests , by the rivers and the ocean , a tinge of what the everyday world would not fail to term fantastic .
my wanderings amid such scenes have been many , and <unk> , and often solitary ; and the interest with which i have strayed through many a dim , deep valley , or gazed into the reflected heaven of many a bright lake , has been an interest greatly deepened by the thought that i have strayed and gazed alone .
what flippant frenchman was it who said in allusion to the well-known work of <unk> , that , " la solitude est une <name> chose ; mais il <unk> <unk> pour vous dire que la solitude est une <name> chose ? "
the <unk> can not be <unk> ; but the necessity is a thing that does not exist .
it was during one of my lonely <unk> , amid a far distant region of mountain locked within mountain , and sad rivers and melancholy tarn writhing or sleeping within all  that i chanced upon a certain rivulet and island .
i came upon them suddenly in the leafy <name> , and threw myself upon the turf , beneath the branches of an unknown odorous shrub , that i might doze as i contemplated the scene .
i felt that thus only should i look upon it  such was the character of <unk> which it wore .
on all sides  save to the west , where the sun was about sinking  arose the verdant walls of the forest .
the little river which turned sharply in its course , and was thus immediately lost to sight , seemed to have no exit from its prison , but to be absorbed by the deep green foliage of the trees to the east  while in the opposite quarter ( so it appeared to me as i lay at length and glanced upward ) there poured down noiselessly and continuously into the valley , a <name> golden and crimson waterfall from the sunset fountains of the sky .
about midway in the short vista which my dreamy vision took in , one small circular island , profusely <unk> , reposed upon the bosom of the stream .
so blended bank and shadow there that each seemed pendulous in air  so <unk> was the glassy water , that it was scarcely possible to say at what point upon the slope of the <name> turf its <name> dominion began .
my position enabled me to include in a single view both the eastern and western extremities of the islet ; and i observed a <unk> difference in their aspects .
the latter was all one radiant harem of garden beauties .
it glowed and blushed beneath the eyes of the slant sunlight , and fairly laughed with flowers .
the grass was short , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
the trees were lithe , mirthful , erect  bright , slender , and graceful ,  of eastern figure and foliage , with bark smooth , glossy , and <unk> .
there seemed a deep sense of life and <name> about all ; and although no airs blew from out the heavens , yet every thing had motion through the gentle <unk> to and fro of innumerable butterflies , that might have been mistaken for tulips with wings .
( <unk> ) the other or eastern end of the isle was <unk> in the blackest shade .
a sombre , yet beautiful and peaceful gloom here pervaded all things .
the trees were dark in color , and mournful in form and attitude , <unk> themselves into sad , solemn , and spectral shapes that conveyed ideas of mortal sorrow and untimely death .
the grass wore the deep tint of the cypress , and the heads of its blades <name> <unk> , and hither and thither among it were many small unsightly hillocks , low and narrow , and not very long , that had the aspect of graves , but were not ; although over and all about them the rue and the <name> clambered .
the shade of the trees fell heavily upon the water , and seemed to bury itself therein , <unk> the depths of the element with darkness .
i fancied that each shadow , as the sun descended lower and lower , separated itself sullenly from the trunk that gave it birth , and thus became absorbed by the stream ; while other shadows issued momently from the trees , taking the place of their predecessors thus entombed .
this idea , having once seized upon my fancy , greatly excited it , and i lost myself forthwith in revery .
" if ever island were enchanted , " said i to myself , " this is it .
this is the haunt of the few gentle <unk> who remain from the wreck of the race .
are these green tombs theirs ?  or do they yield up their sweet lives as mankind yield up their own ?
in dying , do they not rather waste away mournfully , rendering unto god , little by little , their existence , as these trees render up shadow after shadow , exhausting their substance unto dissolution ?
what the wasting tree is to the water that <unk> its shade , growing thus blacker by what it preys upon , may not the life of the <name> be to the death which <unk> it ? "
as i thus mused , with half-shut eyes , while the sun sank rapidly to rest , and <unk> currents <unk> round and round the island , bearing upon their bosom large , dazzling , white flakes of the bark of the <unk> which , in their multiform positions upon the water , a quick imagination might have converted into any thing it pleased , while i thus mused , it appeared to me that the form of one of those very <unk> about whom i had been pondering made its way slowly into the darkness from out the light at the western end of the island .
she stood erect in a singularly fragile canoe , and urged it with the mere phantom of an oar .
while within the influence of the lingering <unk> , her attitude seemed indicative of <name>  but sorrow deformed it as she passed within the shade .
slowly she glided along , and at length rounded the islet and re-entered the region of light .
" the revolution which has just been made by the <name> , " continued i , musingly , " is the cycle of the brief year of her life .
she has floated through her <name> and through her summer .
she is a year nearer unto death ; for i did not fail to see that , as she came into the shade , her shadow fell from her , and was swallowed up in the dark water , making its blackness more black . "
and again the boat appeared and the <name> , but about the attitude of the latter there was more of care and uncertainty and less of elastic <name> .
she floated again from out the light and into the gloom ( which deepened momently ) and again her shadow fell from her into the <name> water , and became absorbed into its blackness .
and again and again she made the circuit of the island , ( while the sun rushed down to his slumbers ) , and at each issuing into the light there was more sorrow about her person , while it grew feebler and far fainter and more indistinct , and at each passage into the gloom there fell from her a darker shade , which became <unk> in a shadow more black .
but at length when the sun had utterly departed , the <name> , now the mere ghost of her former self , went disconsolately with her boat into the region of the <name> flood , and that she issued thence at all i can not say , for darkness fell over all things and i beheld her magical figure no more .
the <unk> stay for me there !
i <name> not fail .
to meet thee in that hollow vale .
[ <unk> on the death of his wife , by <name> king , bishop of <unk> . ]
ill-fated and mysterious man !  bewildered in the brilliancy of thine own imagination , and fallen in the flames of thine own youth !
again in fancy i behold thee !
once more thy form hath risen before me !  not  oh not as thou <name>  in the cold valley and shadow  but as thou shouldst be  <unk> away a life of magnificent meditation in that city of dim visions , thine own <name>  which is a <unk> elysium of the sea , and the wide windows of whose <unk> palaces look down with a deep and bitter meaning upon the secrets of her silent waters .
yes !
i repeat it  as thou shouldst be .
there are surely other worlds than this  other thoughts than the thoughts of the multitude  other speculations than the speculations of the <unk> .
who then shall call thy conduct into question ?
who blame thee for thy visionary hours , or denounce those occupations as a wasting away of life , which were but the <unk> of thine everlasting energies ?
it was at <name> , beneath the covered archway there called the <unk> di <unk> , that i met for the third or fourth time the person of whom i speak .
it is with a confused recollection that i bring to mind the circumstances of that meeting .
yet i remember  ah !
how should i forget ?  the deep midnight , the bridge of sighs , the beauty of woman , and the genius of romance that stalked up and down the narrow canal .
it was a night of unusual gloom .
the great clock of the piazza had sounded the fifth hour of the italian evening .
the square of the <unk> lay silent and deserted , and the lights in the old ducal palace were dying fast away .
i was returning home from the <unk> , by way of the grand canal .
but as my gondola arrived opposite the mouth of the canal san <name> , a female voice from its recesses broke suddenly upon the night , in one wild , hysterical , and long continued shriek .
startled at the sound , i sprang upon my feet : while the <unk> , letting slip his single oar , lost it in the pitchy darkness beyond a chance of recovery , and we were consequently left to the guidance of the current which here sets from the greater into the smaller channel .
like some huge and <unk> condor , we were slowly drifting down towards the bridge of sighs , when a thousand <unk> flashing from the windows , and down the staircases of the ducal palace , turned all at once that deep gloom into a livid and <unk> day .
a child , slipping from the arms of its own mother , had fallen from an upper window of the lofty structure into the deep and dim canal .
the quiet waters had closed placidly over their victim ; and , although my own gondola was the only one in sight , many a stout swimmer , already in the stream , was seeking in vain upon the surface , the treasure which was to be found , alas !
only within the abyss .
upon the broad black marble <unk> at the entrance of the palace , and a few steps above the water , stood a figure which none who then saw can have ever since forgotten .
it was the <unk> aphrodite  the adoration of all <name>  the <unk> of the <name>  the most lovely where all were beautiful  but still the young wife of the old and <unk> <unk> , and the mother of that fair child , her first and only one , who now , deep beneath the murky water , was thinking in bitterness of heart upon her sweet caresses , and exhausting its little life in struggles to call upon her name .
she stood alone .
her small , bare , and silvery feet gleamed in the black mirror of marble beneath her .
her hair , not as yet more than half loosened for the night from its ball-room array , clustered , amid a shower of diamonds , round and round her classical head , in curls like those of the young <name> .
a <unk> and <unk> drapery seemed to be nearly the sole covering to her delicate form ; but the <unk> and midnight air was hot , sullen , and still , and no motion in the <unk> form itself , stirred even the folds of that raiment of very vapor which <name> around it as the heavy marble hangs around the <unk> .
yet  strange to say !  her large lustrous eyes were not turned downwards upon that grave wherein her brightest <name> lay buried  but riveted in a widely different direction !
the prison of the old republic is , i think , the stateliest building in all <name>  but how could that <name> gaze so fixedly upon it , when beneath her lay stifling her only child ?
<name> dark , gloomy niche , too , <unk> right opposite her chamber window  what , then , could there be in its shadows  in its architecture  in its <unk> and solemn cornices  that the <unk> di <unk> had not wondered at a thousand times before ?
nonsense !  who does not remember that , at such a time as this , the eye , like a shattered mirror , <unk> the images of its sorrow , and sees in innumerable far-off places , the woe which is close at hand ?
many steps above the <unk> , and within the arch of the <unk> , stood , in full dress , the <unk> figure of <unk> himself .
he was occasionally occupied in <unk> a guitar , and seemed <unk> to the very death , as at intervals he gave directions for the recovery of his child .
<unk> and aghast , i had myself no power to move from the upright position i had assumed upon first hearing the shriek , and must have presented to the eyes of the agitated group a spectral and ominous appearance , as with pale countenance and rigid limbs , i floated down among them in that funereal gondola .
all efforts proved in vain .
many of the most energetic in the search were relaxing their exertions , and yielding to a gloomy sorrow .
there seemed but little <name> for the child ; ( how much less than for the mother ! )
but now , from the interior of that dark niche which has been already mentioned as forming a part of the old republican prison , and as fronting the lattice of the <unk> , a figure muffled in a cloak , stepped out within reach of the light , and , pausing a moment upon the verge of the giddy descent , plunged headlong into the canal .
as , in an instant afterwards , he stood with the still living and breathing child within his grasp , upon the marble <unk> by the side of the <unk> , his cloak , heavy with the drenching water , became unfastened , and , falling in folds about his feet , discovered to the <unk> spectators the graceful person of a very young man , with the sound of whose name the greater part of europe was then ringing .
no word spoke the deliverer .
but the <unk> !
she <name> now receive her child  she <name> press it to her heart  she <name> cling to its little form , and smother it with her caresses .
alas !
<unk> arms have taken it from the stranger  <unk> arms have taken it away , and borne it afar off , unnoticed , into the palace !
and the <unk> !
her lip  her beautiful lip trembles : tears are gathering in her eyes  those eyes which , like pliny 's <unk> , are " soft and almost liquid . "
yes !
tears are gathering in those eyes  and see !
the entire woman thrills throughout the soul , and the statue has started into life !
the pallor of the marble countenance , the swelling of the marble bosom , the very purity of the marble feet , we behold suddenly flushed over with a tide of ungovernable crimson ; and a slight shudder <unk> about her delicate frame , as a gentle air at <unk> about the <name> silver lilies in the grass .
why should that <name> blush !
to this demand there is no answer  except that , having left , in the eager haste and terror of a mother 's heart , the privacy of her own boudoir , she has neglected to <unk> her <name> feet in their slippers , and utterly forgotten to throw over her venetian shoulders that drapery which is their due .
what other possible reason could there have been for her so blushing ?  for the glance of those wild appealing eyes ?
for the unusual tumult of that throbbing bosom ?  for the convulsive pressure of that trembling hand ?  that hand which fell , as <unk> turned into the palace , accidentally , upon the hand of the stranger .
what reason could there have been for the low  the singularly low tone of those unmeaning words which the <name> uttered hurriedly in bidding him adieu ?
" thou hast conquered , " she said , or the murmurs of the water deceived me ; " thou hast conquered  one hour after sunrise  we shall meet  so let it be ! "
* * * * * the tumult had subsided , the lights had died away within the palace , and the stranger , whom i now recognized , stood alone upon the flags .
he shook with inconceivable agitation , and his eye glanced around in search of a gondola .
i could not do less than offer him the service of my own ; and he accepted the civility .
having obtained an oar at the <unk> , we proceeded together to his residence , while he rapidly recovered his self-possession , and spoke of our former slight acquaintance in terms of great apparent cordiality .
there are some subjects upon which i take pleasure in being minute .
the person of the stranger  let me call him by this title , who to all the world was still a stranger  the person of the stranger is one of these subjects .
in height he might have been below rather than above the medium size : although there were moments of intense passion when his frame actually expanded and belied the assertion .
the light , almost slender symmetry of his figure , promised more of that ready activity which he evinced at the bridge of sighs , than of that <unk> strength which he has been known to wield without an effort , upon occasions of more dangerous emergency .
with the mouth and <name> of a deity  singular , wild , full , liquid eyes , whose shadows varied from pure <name> to intense and brilliant jet  and a profusion of curling , black hair , from which a forehead of unusual breadth gleamed forth at intervals all light and <name>  his were features than which i have seen none more <unk> regular , except , perhaps , the marble ones of the emperor <unk> .
yet his countenance was , nevertheless , one of those which all men have seen at some period of their lives , and have never afterwards seen again .
it had no peculiar  it had no settled predominant expression to be fastened upon the memory ; a countenance seen and instantly forgotten  but forgotten with a vague and <unk> <name> of recalling it to mind .
not that the spirit of each rapid passion failed , at any time , to throw its own distinct image upon the mirror of that face  but that the mirror , <unk> , retained no vestige of the passion , when the passion had departed .
upon leaving him on the night of our adventure , he <unk> me , in what i thought an urgent manner , to call upon him very early the next morning .
shortly after sunrise , i found myself accordingly at his <unk> , one of those huge structures of gloomy , yet fantastic pomp , which tower above the waters of the grand canal in the vicinity of the <unk> .
i was shown up a broad winding staircase of mosaics , into an apartment whose unparalleled splendor burst through the opening door with an actual glare , making me blind and dizzy with <unk> .
i knew my acquaintance to be wealthy .
report had spoken of his possessions in terms which i had even ventured to call terms of ridiculous exaggeration .
but as i gazed about me , i could not bring myself to believe that the wealth of any subject in europe could have supplied the princely magnificence which burned and blazed around .
although , as i say , the sun had arisen , yet the room was still brilliantly lighted up .
i judge from this circumstance , as well as from an air of exhaustion in the countenance of my friend , that he had not retired to bed during the whole of the preceding night .
in the architecture and embellishments of the chamber , the evident design had been to dazzle and <unk> .
little attention had been paid to the <unk> of what is technically called keeping , or to the proprieties of nationality .
the eye wandered from object to object , and rested upon none  neither the <unk> of the greek painters , nor the sculptures of the best italian days , nor the huge carvings of <unk> egypt .
<name> draperies in every part of the room trembled to the vibration of low , melancholy music , whose origin was not to be discovered .
the senses were oppressed by mingled and conflicting perfumes , reeking up from strange <unk> <unk> , together with multitudinous flaring and flickering tongues of <name> and <name> fire .
the rays of the newly risen sun poured in upon the whole , through windows , formed each of a single pane of <unk> glass .
glancing to and fro , in a thousand reflections , from curtains which rolled from their cornices like cataracts of molten silver , the beams of natural <name> mingled at length fitfully with the artificial light , and lay weltering in subdued masses upon a carpet of <name> , <unk> cloth of <unk> gold .
" <name> !
<name> !
<name> !  <name> !
<name> !
<name> ! "
 laughed the proprietor , motioning me to a seat as i entered the room , and throwing himself back at <unk> upon an ottoman .
" i see , " said he , perceiving that i could not immediately reconcile myself to the <unk> of so singular a welcome  " i see you are astonished at my apartment  at my statues  my pictures  my originality of <name> in architecture and <unk> !
absolutely drunk , eh , with my magnificence ?
but pardon me , my dear sir , ( here his tone of voice dropped to the very spirit of cordiality , ) pardon me for my <unk> laughter .
you appeared so utterly astonished .
besides , some things are so completely ludicrous , that a man must laugh or die .
to die laughing , must be the most glorious of all glorious deaths !
sir <name> more  a very fine man was sir <name> more  sir <name> more died laughing , you remember .
also in the absurdities of <unk> <unk> , there is a long list of characters who came to the same magnificent end .
do you know , however , " continued he musingly , " that at sparta ( which is now <unk> ; <unk> , ) at sparta , i say , to the west of the citadel , among a chaos of scarcely visible ruins , is a kind of <unk> , upon which are still <unk> the letters <unk> .
they are undoubtedly part of <unk> .
now , at sparta were a thousand temples and shrines to a thousand different divinities .
how exceedingly strange that the altar of laughter should have survived all the others !
but in the present instance , " he resumed , with a singular alteration of voice and manner , " i have no right to be <name> at your expense .
you might well have been amazed .
europe can not produce anything so fine as this , my little regal cabinet .
my other apartments are by no means of the same order  mere <unk> of fashionable <unk> .
this is better than fashion  is it not ?
yet this has but to be seen to become the rage  that is , with those who could afford it at the cost of their entire <unk> .
i have guarded , however , against any such profanation .
with one exception , you are the only human being besides myself and my valet , who has been admitted within the mysteries of these imperial precincts , since they have been <unk> as you see ! "
i bowed in acknowledgment  for the overpowering sense of splendor and perfume , and music , together with the unexpected eccentricity of his address and manner , prevented me from expressing , in words , my appreciation of what i might have construed into a compliment .
" here , " he resumed , arising and leaning on my arm as he sauntered around the apartment , " here are paintings from the greeks to <unk> , and from <unk> to the present hour .
many are chosen , as you see , with little deference to the opinions of <unk> .
they are all , however , fitting tapestry for a chamber such as this .
here , too , are some <unk> <unk> of the unknown great ; and here , unfinished designs by men , celebrated in their day , whose very names the <unk> of the academies has left to silence and to me .
what think you , " said he , turning abruptly as he spoke  " what think you of this <name> <name> <unk> ? "
" it is <unk> 's own ! "
i said , with all the enthusiasm of my nature , for i had been poring intently over its surpassing loveliness .
" it is <unk> own !  how could you have obtained it ?  she is undoubtedly in painting what the <name> is in sculpture . "
" <name> ! "
said he thoughtfully , " the <name>  the beautiful <name> ?  the <name> of the <unk> ?  she of the diminutive head and the gilded hair ?
part of the left arm ( here his voice dropped so as to be heard with difficulty , ) and all the right , are <unk> ; and in the <unk> of that right arm lies , i think , the <unk> of all affectation .
give me the <unk> !
the apollo , too , is a copy  there can be no doubt of it  blind fool that i am , who can not behold the boasted inspiration of the apollo !
i can not help  pity me !  i can not help preferring the <unk> .
was it not socrates who said that the statuary found his statue in the block of marble ?
then <name> <name> was by no means original in his <unk>  <unk> <name> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <name> <unk> <unk> in se non <unk> . ' "
it has been , or should be remarked , that , in the manner of the true gentleman , we are always aware of a difference from the bearing of the vulgar , without being at once precisely able to determine in what such difference consists .
allowing the remark to have applied in its full force to the outward demeanor of my acquaintance , i felt it , on that eventful morning , still more fully applicable to his moral temperament and character .
nor can i better define that peculiarity of spirit which seemed to place him so essentially apart from all other human beings , than by calling it a habit of intense and continual thought , pervading even his most trivial actions  intruding upon his moments of <unk>  and <unk> itself with his very flashes of merriment  like <unk> which writhe from out the eyes of the grinning masks in the cornices around the temples of <unk> .
i could not help , however , repeatedly observing , through the mingled tone of levity and solemnity with which he rapidly <unk> upon matters of little importance , a certain air of trepidation  a degree of nervous unction in action and in speech  an unquiet <unk> of manner which appeared to me at all times unaccountable , and upon some occasions even filled me with alarm .
frequently , too , pausing in the middle of a sentence whose commencement he had apparently forgotten , he seemed to be listening in the deepest attention , as if either in momentary expectation of a visiter , or to sounds which must have had existence in his imagination alone .
it was during one of these reveries or pauses of apparent abstraction , that , in turning over a <name> of the poet and scholar <unk> beautiful tragedy " the <unk> , " ( the first native italian tragedy , ) which lay near me upon an ottoman , i discovered a passage <unk> in pencil .
it was a passage towards the end of the third act  a passage of the most <unk> excitement  a passage which , although tainted with <unk> , no man shall read without a thrill of novel emotion  no woman without a sigh .
the whole <name> was blotted with fresh tears ; and , upon the opposite <unk> , were the following english lines , written in a hand so very different from the peculiar characters of my acquaintance , that i had some difficulty in recognising it as his own :  thou wast that all to me , love , for which my soul did pine  a green isle in the sea , love , a fountain and a shrine , all wreathed with <name> fruits and flowers ; and all the flowers were mine .
ah , dream too bright to last !
ah , starry <name> , that didst arise but to be overcast !
a voice from out the future cries , " onward ! "
 but o'er the past ( dim gulf ! )
my spirit hovering lies , mute  motionless  aghast !
for alas !
alas !
with me the light of life is o'er .
" no more  no more  no more , " ( such language holds the solemn sea to the sands upon the shore , ) shall bloom the <unk> tree , or the stricken eagle soar !
now all my hours are <unk> ; and all my nightly dreams are where the dark eye glances , and where thy footstep gleams , in what ethereal dances , by what italian streams .
alas !
for that accursed time they bore thee o'er the <unk> , from love to titled age and crime , and an unholy pillow !  from me , and from our <name> clime , where weeps the silver <name> !
that these lines were written in english  a language with which i had not believed their author acquainted  afforded me little matter for surprise .
i was too well aware of the extent of his acquirements , and of the singular pleasure he took in concealing them from observation , to be astonished at any similar discovery ; but the place of date , i must confess , occasioned me no little amazement .
it had been originally written london , and afterwards carefully <unk>  not , however , so effectually as to conceal the word from a scrutinizing eye .
i say , this occasioned me no little amazement ; for i well remember that , in a former conversation with a friend , i particularly inquired if he had at any time met in london the <unk> di <unk> , ( who for some years previous to her marriage had resided in that city , ) when his answer , if i mistake not , gave me to understand that he had never visited the metropolis of great britain .
i might as well here mention , that i have more than once heard , ( without , of course , giving credit to a report involving so many <unk> , ) that the person of whom i speak , was not only by birth , but in education , an englishman .
* * * * * " there is one painting , " said he , without being aware of my notice of the tragedy  " there is still one painting which you have not seen . "
and throwing aside a drapery , he discovered a <unk> portrait of the <unk> aphrodite .
human <name> could have done no more in the <unk> of her superhuman beauty .
the same ethereal figure which stood before me the preceding night upon the steps of the ducal palace , stood before me once again .
but in the expression of the countenance , which was beaming all over with smiles , there still lurked ( incomprehensible anomaly ! )
that fitful stain of melancholy which <name> ever be found inseparable from the perfection of the beautiful .
her right arm lay folded over her bosom .
with her left she pointed downward to a curiously fashioned vase .
one small , <name> foot , alone visible , barely touched the earth ; and , scarcely discernible in the brilliant atmosphere which seemed to <unk> and <unk> her loveliness , floated a pair of the most delicately imagined wings .
my glance fell from the painting to the figure of my friend , and the vigorous words of chapman 's <unk> <unk> , quivered instinctively upon my lips : " he is up there like a <name> statue !
he <name> stand till death hath made him marble ! "
" come , " he said at length , turning towards a table of richly enamelled and massive silver , upon which were a few <unk> fantastically stained , together with two large <unk> vases , fashioned in the same extraordinary model as that in the foreground of the portrait , and filled with what i supposed to be <unk> .
" come , " he said , abruptly , " let us drink !
it is early  but let us drink .
it is indeed early , " he continued , musingly , as a cherub with a heavy golden hammer made the apartment ring with the first hour after sunrise : " it is indeed early  but what matters it ?
let us drink !
let us pour out an offering to <name> solemn sun which these gaudy lamps and <unk> are so eager to subdue ! "
and , having made me pledge him in a <unk> , he swallowed in rapid succession several <unk> of the wine .
" to dream , " he continued , resuming the tone of his <unk> conversation , as he held up to the <name> light of a censer one of the magnificent vases  " to dream has been the business of my life .
i have therefore framed for myself , as you see , a bower of dreams .
in the heart of <name> could i have erected a better ?
you behold around you , it is true , a medley of architectural embellishments .
the <name> of <unk> is offended by <unk> devices , and the <unk> of egypt are outstretched upon carpets of gold .
yet the effect is incongruous to the timid alone .
proprieties of place , and especially of time , are the <unk> which terrify mankind from the contemplation of the magnificent .
once i was myself a <unk> ; but that <unk> of folly has <unk> upon my soul .
all this is now the <unk> for my purpose .
like these <unk> <unk> , my spirit is writhing in fire , and the delirium of this scene is fashioning me for the wilder visions of that land of real dreams whither i am now rapidly departing . "
he here paused abruptly , bent his head to his bosom , and seemed to listen to a sound which i could not hear .
at length , erecting his frame , he looked upwards , and ejaculated the lines of the bishop of <unk> :  " stay for me there !
i <name> not fail to meet thee in that hollow vale .
"  in the next instant , confessing the power of the wine , he threw himself at <unk> upon an ottoman .
a quick step was now heard upon the staircase , and a loud knock at the door rapidly succeeded .
i was hastening to anticipate a second disturbance , when a <name> of <unk> 's household burst into the room , and faltered out , in a voice choking with emotion , the incoherent words , " my mistress !  my mistress !  poisoned !  poisoned !
oh , beautiful  oh , beautiful aphrodite ! "
bewildered , i flew to the ottoman , and endeavored to arouse the sleeper to a sense of the startling intelligence .
but his limbs were rigid  his lips were livid  his lately beaming eyes were riveted in death .
i staggered back towards the table  my hand fell upon a cracked and blackened <unk>  and a consciousness of the entire and terrible truth flashed suddenly over my soul .
the pit and the pendulum <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , non <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <name> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <name> <unk> patent .
[ <unk> composed for the gates of a market to be erected upon the site of the jacobin club house at <name> . ]
i was sick  sick unto death with that long agony ; and when they at length unbound me , and i was permitted to sit , i felt that my senses were leaving me .
the sentence  the dread sentence of death  was the last of distinct <unk> which reached my ears .
after that , the sound of the <unk> voices seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminate hum .
it conveyed to my soul the idea of revolution  perhaps from its association in fancy with the burr of a mill wheel .
this only for a brief period ; for presently i heard no more .
yet , for a while , i saw ; but with how terrible an exaggeration !
i saw the lips of the <unk> judges .
they appeared to me white  whiter than the sheet upon which i trace these words  and thin even to <unk> ; thin with the intensity of their expression of firmness  of <unk> resolution  of stern contempt of human torture .
i saw that the decrees of what to me was fate , were still issuing from those lips .
i saw them writhe with a deadly <unk> .
i saw them fashion the syllables of my name ; and i shuddered because no sound succeeded .
i saw , too , for a few moments of delirious horror , the soft and nearly imperceptible waving of the sable draperies which <unk> the walls of the apartment .
and then my vision fell upon the seven tall candles upon the table .
at first they wore the aspect of <name> , and seemed white and slender angels who would save me ; but then , all at once , there came a most deadly nausea over my spirit , and i felt every fibre in my frame thrill as if i had touched the wire of a galvanic battery , while the <name> forms became meaningless spectres , with heads of flame , and i saw that from them there would be no help .
and then there stole into my fancy , like a <name> musical note , the thought of what sweet rest there must be in the grave .
the thought came gently and stealthily , and it seemed long before it attained full appreciation ; but just as my spirit came at length properly to feel and entertain it , the figures of the judges vanished , as if magically , from before me ; the tall candles sank into nothingness ; their flames went out utterly ; the blackness of darkness supervened ; all sensations appeared swallowed up in a mad rushing descent as of the soul into hades .
then silence , and stillness , night were the universe .
i had swooned ; but still <name> not say that all of consciousness was lost .
what of it there remained i <name> not attempt to define , or even to describe ; yet all was not lost .
in the deepest slumber  no !
in delirium  no !
in a swoon  no !
in death  no !
even in the grave all is not lost .
else there is no immortality for man .
arousing from the most profound of slumbers , we break the gossamer web of some dream .
yet in a second afterward , ( so frail may that web have been ) we remember not that we have dreamed .
in the return to life from the swoon there are two stages ; first , that of the sense of mental or spiritual ; secondly , that of the sense of physical , existence .
it seems probable that if , upon reaching the second stage , we could recall the impressions of the first , we should find these impressions eloquent in memories of the gulf beyond .
and that gulf is  what ?
how at least shall we distinguish its shadows from those of the tomb ?
but if the impressions of what i have termed the first stage , are not , at <name> , recalled , yet , after long interval , do they not come <unk> , while we <name> whence they come ?
he who has never swooned , is not he who finds strange palaces and wildly familiar faces in coals that glow ; is not he who beholds floating in <unk> the sad visions that the many may not view ; is not he who <unk> over the perfume of some novel flower  is not he whose <name> grows bewildered with the meaning of some musical cadence which has never before arrested his attention .
amid frequent and thoughtful endeavors to remember ; amid <name> struggles to <unk> some token of the state of seeming nothingness into which my soul had lapsed , there have been moments when i have dreamed of success ; there have been brief , very brief periods when i have <unk> up remembrances which the lucid reason of a later epoch assures me could have had reference only to that condition of seeming unconsciousness .
these shadows of memory tell , indistinctly , of tall figures that lifted and bore me in silence down  down  still down  till a hideous dizziness oppressed me at the mere idea of the <unk> of the descent .
they tell also of a vague horror at my heart , on account of that heart 's unnatural stillness .
then comes a sense of sudden <unk> throughout all things ; as if those who bore me ( a ghastly train ! )
had outrun , in their descent , the limits of the limitless , and paused from the <unk> of their toil .
after this i call to mind flatness and dampness ; and then all is madness  the madness of a memory which <unk> itself among forbidden things .
very suddenly there came back to my soul motion and sound  the tumultuous motion of the heart , and , in my ears , the sound of its beating .
then a pause in which all is blank .
then again sound , and motion , and touch  a tingling sensation pervading my frame .
then the mere consciousness of existence , without thought  a condition which lasted long .
then , very suddenly , thought , and shuddering terror , and <name> endeavor to comprehend my true state .
then a strong <name> to lapse into insensibility .
then a rushing revival of soul and a successful effort to move .
and now a full memory of the trial , of the judges , of the sable draperies , of the sentence , of the sickness , of the swoon .
then entire forgetfulness of all that followed ; of all that a later day and much earnestness of endeavor have enabled me vaguely to recall .
so far , i had not opened my eyes .
i felt that i lay upon my back , unbound .
i reached out my hand , and it fell heavily upon something damp and hard .
there i suffered it to remain for many minutes , while i strove to imagine where and what i could be .
i longed , yet dared not to employ my vision .
i dreaded the first glance at objects around me .
it was not that i feared to look upon things horrible , but that i grew aghast lest there should be nothing to see .
at length , with a wild desperation at heart , i quickly <unk> my eyes .
my worst thoughts , then , were confirmed .
the blackness of eternal night encompassed me .
i struggled for breath .
the intensity of the darkness seemed to oppress and <unk> me .
the atmosphere was intolerably close .
i still lay quietly , and made effort to exercise my reason .
i brought to mind the <unk> proceedings , and attempted from that point to deduce my real condition .
the sentence had passed ; and it appeared to me that a very long interval of time had since elapsed .
yet not for a moment did i suppose myself actually dead .
such a supposition , notwithstanding what we read in fiction , is altogether inconsistent with real existence ;  but where and in what state was i ?
the condemned to death , i knew , perished usually at the <unk> , and one of these had been held on the very night of the day of my trial .
had i been <unk> to my dungeon , to await the next sacrifice , which would not take place for many months ?
this i at once saw could not be .
victims had been in immediate demand .
moreover , my dungeon , as well as all the condemned cells at <unk> , had stone floors , and light was not altogether excluded .
a fearful idea now suddenly drove the blood in torrents upon my heart , and for a brief period , i once more relapsed into insensibility .
upon recovering , i at once started to my feet , trembling convulsively in every fibre .
i thrust my arms wildly above and around me in all directions .
i felt nothing ; yet dreaded to move a step , lest i should be impeded by the walls of a tomb .
perspiration burst from every pore , and stood in cold big beads upon my forehead .
the agony of suspense grew at length intolerable , and i cautiously moved forward , with my arms extended , and my eyes straining from their sockets , in the <name> of catching some faint <name> of light .
i proceeded for many paces ; but still all was blackness and vacancy .
i breathed more freely .
it seemed evident that mine was not , at least , the most hideous of fates .
and now , as i still continued to step cautiously onward , there came thronging upon my recollection a thousand vague rumors of the horrors of <unk> .
of the dungeons there had been strange things narrated  fables i had always deemed them  but yet strange , and too ghastly to repeat , save in a whisper .
was i left to perish of starvation in this subterranean world of darkness ; or what fate , perhaps even more fearful , awaited me ?
that the result would be death , and a death of more than customary bitterness , i knew too well the character of my judges to doubt .
the mode and the hour were all that occupied or distracted me .
my outstretched hands at length encountered some solid obstruction .
it was a wall , seemingly of stone masonry  very smooth , slimy , and cold .
i followed it up ; stepping with all the careful distrust with which certain antique narratives had inspired me .
this process , however , afforded me no means of ascertaining the dimensions of my dungeon ; as i might make its circuit , and return to the point whence i set out , without being aware of the fact ; so perfectly uniform seemed the wall .
i therefore sought the knife which had been in my pocket , when led into the <unk> chamber ; but it was gone ; my clothes had been exchanged for a wrapper of coarse <unk> .
i had thought of forcing the blade in some minute crevice of the masonry , so as to identify my point of departure .
the difficulty , nevertheless , was but trivial ; although , in the disorder of my fancy , it seemed at first insuperable .
i tore a part of the hem from the robe and placed the fragment at full length , and at right angles to the wall .
in groping my way around the prison , i could not fail to encounter this rag upon completing the circuit .
so , at least i thought : but i had not counted upon the extent of the dungeon , or upon my own weakness .
the ground was moist and slippery .
i staggered onward for some time , when i stumbled and fell .
my excessive fatigue induced me to remain prostrate ; and sleep soon overtook me as i lay .
upon awaking , and stretching forth an arm , i found beside me a loaf and a pitcher with water .
i was too much exhausted to reflect upon this circumstance , but ate and drank with avidity .
shortly afterward , i resumed my tour around the prison , and with much toil came at last upon the fragment of the <unk> .
up to the period when i fell i had counted fifty-two paces , and upon resuming my walk , i had counted forty-eight more ;  when i arrived at the rag .
there were in all , then , a hundred paces ; and , admitting two paces to the yard , i presumed the dungeon to be fifty yards in circuit .
i had met , however , with many angles in the wall , and thus i could form no guess at the shape of the vault ; for vault i could not help supposing it to be .
i had little object  certainly no <name> these researches ; but a vague curiosity prompted me to continue them .
quitting the wall , i resolved to cross the area of the enclosure .
at first i proceeded with extreme caution , for the floor , although seemingly of solid material , was treacherous with slime .
at length , however , i took courage , and did not hesitate to step firmly ; endeavoring to cross in as direct a line as possible .
i had advanced some ten or twelve paces in this manner , when the remnant of the torn hem of my robe became entangled between my legs .
i stepped on it , and fell violently on my face .
in the confusion attending my fall , i did not immediately apprehend a somewhat startling circumstance , which yet , in a few seconds afterward , and while i still lay prostrate , arrested my attention .
it was this  my <name> rested upon the floor of the prison , but my lips and the upper portion of my head , although seemingly at a less elevation than the <name> , touched nothing .
at the same time my forehead seemed bathed in a clammy vapor , and the peculiar smell of decayed fungus arose to my nostrils .
i put forward my arm , and shuddered to find that i had fallen at the very brink of a circular pit , whose extent , of course , i had no means of ascertaining at the moment .
groping about the masonry just below the margin , i succeeded in <unk> a small fragment , and let it fall into the abyss .
for many seconds i <unk> to its <unk> as it dashed against the sides of the chasm in its descent ; at length there was a sullen plunge into water , succeeded by loud echoes .
at the same moment there came a sound resembling the quick opening , and as rapid closing of a door overhead , while a faint gleam of light flashed suddenly through the gloom , and as suddenly faded away .
i saw clearly the doom which had been prepared for me , and congratulated myself upon the timely accident by which i had escaped .
another step before my fall , and the world had seen me no more .
and the death just avoided , was of that very character which i had regarded as fabulous and frivolous in the tales respecting the inquisition .
to the victims of its tyranny , there was the choice of death with its <unk> physical agonies , or death with its most hideous moral horrors .
i had been reserved for the latter .
by long suffering my nerves had been unstrung , until i trembled at the sound of my own voice , and had become in every respect a fitting subject for the species of torture which awaited me .
shaking in every limb , i groped my way back to the wall ; resolving there to perish rather than risk the terrors of the wells , of which my imagination now pictured many in various positions about the dungeon .
in other conditions of mind i might have had courage to end my misery at once by a plunge into one of these abysses ; but now i was the veriest of cowards .
neither could i forget what i had read of these pits  that the sudden extinction of life formed no part of their most horrible plan .
agitation of spirit kept me awake for many long hours ; but at length i again slumbered .
upon arousing , i found by my side , as before , a loaf and a pitcher of water .
a burning thirst consumed me , and i emptied the vessel at a draught .
it must have been drugged ; for scarcely had i drunk , before i became irresistibly drowsy .
a deep sleep fell upon me  a sleep like that of death .
how long it lasted of course , i know not ; but when , once again , i <unk> my eyes , the objects around me were visible .
by a wild sulphurous lustre , the origin of which i could not at first determine , i was enabled to see the extent and aspect of the prison .
in its size i had been greatly mistaken .
the whole circuit of its walls did not exceed twenty-five yards .
for some minutes this fact occasioned me a world of vain trouble ; vain indeed !
for what could be of less importance , under the terrible circumstances which <unk> me , then the mere dimensions of my dungeon ?
but my soul took a wild interest in trifles , and i busied myself in endeavors to account for the error i had committed in my measurement .
the truth at length flashed upon me .
in my first attempt at exploration i had counted fifty-two paces , up to the period when i fell ; i must then have been within a pace or two of the fragment of <unk> ; in fact , i had nearly performed the circuit of the vault .
i then slept , and upon awaking , i must have returned upon my steps  thus supposing the circuit nearly double what it actually was .
my confusion of mind prevented me from observing that i began my tour with the wall to the left , and ended it with the wall to the right .
i had been deceived , too , in respect to the shape of the enclosure .
in feeling my way i had found many angles , and thus deduced an idea of great irregularity ; so potent is the effect of total darkness upon one arousing from lethargy or sleep !
the angles were simply those of a few slight depressions , or <unk> , at odd intervals .
the general shape of the prison was square .
what i had taken for masonry seemed now to be iron , or some other metal , in huge plates , whose <unk> or joints occasioned the depression .
the entire surface of this metallic enclosure was rudely <unk> in all the hideous and repulsive devices to which the <unk> superstition of the monks has given rise .
the figures of fiends in aspects of menace , with skeleton forms , and other more really fearful images , overspread and disfigured the walls .
i observed that the outlines of these monstrosities were sufficiently distinct , but that the colors seemed faded and blurred , as if from the effects of a damp atmosphere .
i now noticed the floor , too , which was of stone .
in the centre yawned the circular pit from whose jaws i had escaped ; but it was the only one in the dungeon .
all this i saw indistinctly and by much effort : for my personal condition had been greatly changed during slumber .
i now lay upon my back , and at full length , on a species of low framework of wood .
to this i was securely bound by a long strap resembling a <unk> .
it passed in many convolutions about my limbs and body , leaving at <name> only my head , and my left arm to such extent that i could , by dint of much exertion , supply myself with food from an earthen dish which lay by my side on the floor .
i saw , to my horror , that the pitcher had been removed .
i say to my horror ; for i was consumed with intolerable thirst .
this thirst it appeared to be the design of my <unk> to stimulate : for the food in the dish was meat <unk> seasoned .
looking upward , i surveyed the ceiling of my prison .
it was some thirty or forty feet overhead , and constructed much as the side walls .
in one of its panels a very singular figure riveted my whole attention .
it was the painted figure of time as he is commonly represented , save that , in lieu of a scythe , he held what , at a casual glance , i supposed to be the pictured image of a huge pendulum such as we see on antique clocks .
there was something , however , in the appearance of this machine which caused me to regard it more attentively .
while i gazed directly upward at it ( for its position was immediately over my own ) i fancied that i saw it in motion .
in an instant afterward the fancy was confirmed .
its sweep was brief , and of course slow .
i watched it for some minutes , somewhat in fear , but more in wonder .
wearied at length with observing its dull movement , i turned my eyes upon the other objects in the cell .
a slight noise attracted my notice , and , looking to the floor , i saw several enormous rats traversing it .
they had issued from the well , which lay just within view to my right .
even then , while i gazed , they came up in troops , hurriedly , with ravenous eyes , <unk> by the scent of the meat .
from this it required much effort and attention to scare them away .
it might have been half an hour , perhaps even an hour , ( for i could take but imperfect note of time ) before i again cast my eyes upward .
what i then saw confounded and amazed me .
the sweep of the pendulum had increased in extent by nearly a yard .
as a natural consequence , its velocity was also much greater .
but what mainly disturbed me was the idea that had perceptibly descended .
i now observed  with what horror it is needless to say  that its nether extremity was formed of a crescent of glittering steel , about a foot in length from horn to horn ; the horns upward , and the under edge evidently as keen as that of a razor .
like a razor also , it seemed massy and heavy , tapering from the edge into a solid and broad structure above .
it was appended to a weighty <name> of brass , and the whole hissed as it swung through the air .
i could no longer doubt the doom prepared for me by <unk> ingenuity in torture .
my cognizance of the pit had become known to the <unk> agents  the pit whose horrors had been destined for so bold a <unk> as myself  the pit , typical of hell , and regarded by rumor as the <unk> <unk> of all their punishments .
the plunge into this pit i had avoided by the merest of accidents , i knew that surprise , or <unk> into torment , formed an important portion of all the <unk> of these dungeon deaths .
having failed to fall , it was no part of the demon plan to hurl me into the abyss ; and thus ( there being no alternative ) a different and a milder destruction awaited me .
milder !
i half smiled in my agony as i thought of such application of such a term .
what boots it to tell of the long , long hours of horror more than mortal , during which i counted the rushing vibrations of the steel !
inch by inch  line by line  with a descent only appreciable at intervals that seemed ages  down and still down it came !
days passed  it might have been that many days passed  ere it swept so closely over me as to fan me with its acrid breath .
the odor of the sharp steel forced itself into my nostrils .
i prayed  i wearied heaven with my prayer for its more speedy descent .
i grew frantically mad , and struggled to force myself upward against the sweep of the fearful scimitar .
and then i fell suddenly calm , and lay smiling at the glittering death , as a child at some rare <unk> .
there was another interval of utter insensibility ; it was brief ; for , upon again <unk> into life there had been no perceptible descent in the pendulum .
but it might have been long ; for i knew there were demons who took note of my swoon , and who could have arrested the vibration at pleasure .
upon my recovery , too , i felt very  oh , inexpressibly sick and weak , as if through long <unk> .
even amid the agonies of that period , the human nature craved food .
with painful effort i outstretched my left arm as far as my bonds permitted , and took possession of the small remnant which had been spared me by the rats .
as i put a portion of it within my lips , there rushed to my mind a half formed thought of <name>  of <name> .
yet what business had i with <name> ?
it was , as i say , a half formed thought  man has many such which are never completed .
i felt that it was of <name>  of <name> ; but felt also that it had perished in its formation .
in vain i struggled to perfect  to regain it .
long suffering had nearly annihilated all my ordinary powers of mind .
i was an imbecile  an idiot .
the vibration of the pendulum was at right angles to my length .
i saw that the crescent was designed to cross the region of the heart .
it would fray the <unk> of my robe  it would return and repeat its operations  again  and again .
notwithstanding <unk> wide sweep ( some thirty feet or more ) and the hissing vigor of its descent , sufficient to <unk> these very walls of iron , still the <unk> of my robe would be all that , for several minutes , it would accomplish .
and at this thought i paused .
i dared not go farther than this reflection .
i dwelt upon it with a pertinacity of attention  as if , in so dwelling , i could arrest here the descent of the steel .
i forced myself to ponder upon the sound of the crescent as it should pass across the garment  upon the peculiar thrilling sensation which the friction of cloth produces on the nerves .
i pondered upon all this frivolity until my teeth were on edge .
down  steadily down it crept .
i took a frenzied pleasure in <unk> its downward with its lateral velocity .
to the right  to the left  far and wide  with the shriek of a damned spirit ; to my heart with the stealthy pace of the tiger !
i alternately laughed and howled as the one or the other idea grew predominant .
down  certainly , <unk> down !
it vibrated within three inches of my bosom !
i struggled violently , furiously , to free my left arm .
this was free only from the elbow to the hand .
i could reach the latter , from the platter beside me , to my mouth , with great effort , but no farther .
could i have broken the fastenings above the elbow , i would have seized and attempted to arrest the pendulum .
i might as well have attempted to arrest an avalanche !
down  still unceasingly  still inevitably down !
i gasped and struggled at each vibration .
i shrunk convulsively at its every sweep .
my eyes followed its outward or upward whirls with the eagerness of the most unmeaning despair ; they closed themselves <unk> at the descent , although death would have been a relief , oh !
how unspeakable !
still i quivered in every nerve to think how slight a sinking of the machinery would precipitate that keen , glistening axe upon my bosom .
it was <name> that prompted the nerve to quiver  the frame to shrink .
it was <name>  the <name> that triumphs on the rack  that whispers to the <unk> even in the dungeons of the inquisition .
i saw that some ten or twelve vibrations would bring the steel in actual contact with my robe , and with this observation there suddenly came over my spirit all the keen , collected calmness of despair .
for the first time during many hours  or perhaps days  i thought .
it now occurred to me that the bandage , or <unk> , which enveloped me , was unique .
i was tied by no separate cord .
the first stroke of the <unk> crescent athwart any portion of the band , would so detach it that it might be unwound from my person by means of my left hand .
but how fearful , in that case , the proximity of the steel !
the result of the slightest struggle how deadly !
was it likely , moreover , that the <unk> of the <unk> had not foreseen and provided for this possibility !
was it probable that the bandage crossed my bosom in the track of the pendulum ?
dreading to find my faint , and , as it seemed , in last <name> frustrated , i so far elevated my head as to obtain a distinct view of my breast .
the <unk> enveloped my limbs and body close in all directions  save in the path of the destroying crescent .
scarcely had i dropped my head back into its original position , when there flashed upon my mind what i can not better describe than as the <unk> half of that idea of deliverance to which i have previously alluded , and of which a <unk> only floated <unk> through my <name> when i raised food to my burning lips .
the whole thought was now present  feeble , scarcely sane , scarcely definite ,  but still entire .
i proceeded at once , with the nervous energy of despair , to attempt its execution .
for many hours the immediate vicinity of the low framework upon which i lay , had been literally swarming with rats .
they were wild , bold , ravenous ; their red eyes glaring upon me as if they waited but for <unk> on my part to make me their prey .
" to what food , " i thought , " have they been accustomed in the well ? "
they had devoured , in spite of all my efforts to prevent them , all but a small remnant of the contents of the dish .
i had fallen into an habitual <unk> , or wave of the hand about the platter : and , at length , the unconscious uniformity of the movement deprived it of effect .
in their <unk> the vermin frequently fastened their sharp fangs in my fingers .
with the particles of the oily and <unk> <unk> which now remained , i thoroughly rubbed the bandage wherever i could reach it ; then , raising my hand from the floor , i lay breathlessly still .
at first the ravenous animals were startled and terrified at the change  at the cessation of movement .
they shrank <unk> back ; many sought the well .
but this was only for a moment .
i had not counted in vain upon their <unk> .
observing that i remained without motion , one or two of the boldest leaped upon the <unk> , and smelt at the <unk> .
this seemed the signal for a general rush .
forth from the well they hurried in fresh troops .
they clung to the wood  they <unk> it , and leaped in hundreds upon my person .
the measured movement of the pendulum disturbed them not at all .
avoiding its strokes they busied themselves with the anointed bandage .
they pressed  they swarmed upon me in ever accumulating heaps .
they writhed upon my throat ; their cold lips sought my own ; i was half stifled by their thronging pressure ; disgust , for which the world has no name , swelled my bosom , and chilled , with a heavy <unk> , my heart .
yet one minute , and i felt that the struggle would be over .
plainly i perceived the loosening of the bandage .
i knew that in more than one place it must be already severed .
with a more than human resolution i lay still .
nor had i erred in my calculations  nor had i endured in vain .
i at length felt that i was free .
the <unk> <name> in <unk> from my body .
but the stroke of the pendulum already pressed upon my bosom .
it had divided the <unk> of the robe .
it had cut through the linen beneath .
twice again it swung , and a sharp sense of pain shot through every nerve .
but the moment of escape had arrived .
at a wave of my hand my <unk> hurried <unk> away .
with a steady movement  cautious , <unk> , shrinking , and slow  i slid from the embrace of the bandage and beyond the reach of the scimitar .
for the moment , at least , i was free .
free !  and in the grasp of the inquisition !
i had scarcely stepped from my wooden bed of horror upon the stone floor of the prison , when the motion of the <unk> machine ceased and i beheld it drawn up , by some invisible force , through the ceiling .
this was a lesson which i took desperately to heart .
my every motion was undoubtedly watched .
free !  i had but escaped death in one form of agony , to be delivered unto worse than death in some other .
with that thought i rolled my <unk> nervously around on the barriers of iron that hemmed me in .
something unusual  some change which , at first , i could not appreciate distinctly  it was obvious , had taken place in the apartment .
for many minutes of a dreamy and trembling abstraction , i busied myself in vain , unconnected conjecture .
during this period , i became aware , for the first time , of the origin of the sulphurous light which illumined the cell .
it proceeded from a fissure , about half an inch in width , extending entirely around the prison at the base of the walls , which thus appeared , and were , completely separated from the floor .
i endeavored , but of course in vain , to look through the aperture .
as i arose from the attempt , the mystery of the alteration in the chamber broke at once upon my understanding .
i have observed that , although the outlines of the figures upon the walls were sufficiently distinct , yet the colors seemed blurred and indefinite .
these colors had now assumed , and were momentarily assuming , a startling and most intense brilliancy , that gave to the spectral and fiendish <unk> an aspect that might have thrilled even firmer nerves than my own .
demon eyes , of a wild and ghastly vivacity , glared upon me in a thousand directions , where none had been visible before , and gleamed with the lurid lustre of a fire that i could not force my imagination to regard as unreal .
unreal !  even while i breathed there came to my nostrils the breath of the vapour of heated iron !
a suffocating odour pervaded the prison !
a deeper glow settled each moment in the eyes that glared at my agonies !
a richer tint of crimson diffused itself over the pictured horrors of blood .
i panted !
i gasped for breath !
there could be no doubt of the design of my tormentors  oh !
most <unk> !
oh !
most <unk> of men !
i shrank from the glowing metal to the centre of the cell .
amid the thought of the fiery destruction that <unk> , the idea of the coolness of the well came over my soul like balm .
i rushed to its deadly brink .
i threw my straining vision below .
the glare from the <unk> roof illumined its inmost recesses .
yet , for a wild moment , did my spirit refuse to comprehend the meaning of what i saw .
at length it forced  it wrestled its way into my soul  it burned itself in upon my shuddering <unk>  oh !
for a voice to speak !  oh !
horror !  oh !
any horror but this !
with a shriek , i rushed from the margin , and buried my face in my hands  weeping bitterly .
the heat rapidly increased , and once again i looked up , shuddering as with a fit of the ague .
there had been a second change in the cell  and now the change was obviously in the form .
as before , it was in vain that i , at first , endeavoured to appreciate or understand what was taking place .
but not long was i left in doubt .
the <unk> vengeance had been hurried by my <unk> escape , and there was to be no more <unk> with the king of terrors .
the room had been square .
i saw that two of its iron angles were now acute  two , consequently , obtuse .
the fearful difference quickly increased with a low rumbling or moaning sound .
in an instant the apartment had shifted its form into that of a <unk> .
but the alteration stopped not <unk> neither hoped nor desired it to stop .
i could have clasped the red walls to my bosom as a garment of eternal peace .
" death , " i said , " any death but that of the pit ! "
fool !
might i have not known that into the pit it was the object of the burning iron to urge me ?
could i resist its glow ?
or , if even that , could i withstand its pressure and now , flatter and flatter grew the <unk> , with a rapidity that left me no time for contemplation .
its centre , and of course , its greatest width , came just over the yawning gulf .
i shrank back  but the closing walls pressed me <unk> onward .
at length for my seared and writhing body there was no longer an inch of foothold on the firm floor of the prison .
i struggled no more , but the agony of my soul found vent in one loud , long , and final scream of despair .
i felt that i tottered upon the brink  i averted my eyes  there was a discordant hum of human voices !
there was a loud blast as of many trumpets !
there was a harsh grating as of a thousand thunders !
the fiery walls rushed back !
an outstretched arm caught my own as i fell , fainting , into the abyss .
it was that of general <unk> .
the french army had entered <unk> .
the inquisition was in the hands of its enemies .
the premature burial there are certain themes of which the interest is <unk> , but which are too entirely horrible for the purposes of legitimate fiction .
these the mere <unk> must <unk> , if he do not wish to offend or to disgust .
they are with propriety handled only when the severity and majesty of truth <unk> and sustain them .
we thrill , for example , with the most intense of " pleasurable pain " over the accounts of the passage of the <unk> , of the earthquake at lisbon , of the plague at london , of the massacre of st. <unk> , or of the stifling of the hundred and twenty-three prisoners in the black hole at calcutta .
but in these accounts it is the fact   it is the reality   it is the history which excites .
as inventions , we should regard them with simple abhorrence .
i have mentioned some few of the more prominent and <name> calamities on record ; but in these it is the extent , not less than the character of the calamity , which so vividly impresses the fancy .
i need not remind the reader that , from the long and weird catalogue of human miseries , i might have selected many individual instances more replete with essential suffering than any of these vast <unk> of disaster .
the true wretchedness , indeed  the ultimate woe   is particular , not diffuse .
that the ghastly extremes of agony are endured by man the unit , and never by man the mass   for this let us thank a merciful god !
to be buried while alive is , beyond question , the most terrific of these extremes which has ever fallen to the lot of mere mortality .
that it has frequently , very frequently , so fallen <name> scarcely be denied by those who think .
the boundaries which divide life from death are at best shadowy and vague .
who shall say where the one ends , and where the other begins ?
we know that there are diseases in which occur total <unk> of all the apparent functions of vitality , and yet in which these <unk> are merely <unk> , properly so called .
they are only temporary pauses in the incomprehensible mechanism .
a certain period <unk> , and some unseen mysterious principle again sets in motion the magic pinions and the wizard wheels .
the silver cord was not for ever loosed , nor the golden bowl <unk> broken .
but where , meantime , was the soul ?
apart , however , from the inevitable conclusion , a priori that such causes must produce such effects   that the well-known occurrence of such cases of suspended animation must naturally give rise , now and then , to premature <unk>  apart from this consideration , we have the direct testimony of medical and ordinary experience to prove that a vast number of such <unk> have actually taken place .
i might refer at once , if necessary to a hundred well authenticated instances .
one of very remarkable character , and of which the circumstances may be fresh in the memory of some of my readers , occurred , not very long ago , in the neighboring city of baltimore , where it occasioned a painful , intense , and <unk> excitement .
the wife of one of the most respectable <unk> lawyer of eminence and a member of congress  was seized with a sudden and unaccountable illness , which completely baffled the skill of her physicians .
after much suffering she died , or was supposed to die .
no one suspected , indeed , or had reason to suspect , that she was not actually dead .
she presented all the ordinary appearances of death .
the face assumed the usual pinched and sunken outline .
the lips were of the usual marble pallor .
the eyes were <unk> .
there was no warmth .
<unk> had ceased .
for three days the body was preserved <unk> , during which it had acquired a stony rigidity .
the funeral , in short , was hastened , on account of the rapid advance of what was supposed to be decomposition .
the <name> was deposited in her family vault , which , for three subsequent years , was undisturbed .
at the expiration of this term it was opened for the reception of a sarcophagus ;   but , alas !
how fearful a shock awaited the husband , who , personally , threw open the door !
as its <unk> swung outwardly back , some <unk> object fell rattling within his arms .
it was the skeleton of his wife in her yet <unk> shroud .
a careful investigation rendered it evident that she had revived within two days after her <unk> ; that her struggles within the coffin had caused it to fall from a ledge , or shelf to the floor , where it was so broken as to permit her escape .
a lamp which had been accidentally left , full of oil , within the tomb , was found empty ; it might have been exhausted , however , by evaporation .
on the uttermost of the steps which led down into the dread chamber was a large fragment of the coffin , with which , it seemed , that she had endeavored to arrest attention by striking the iron door .
while thus occupied , she probably swooned , or possibly died , through sheer terror ; and , in failing , her shroud became entangled in some iron  work which projected <unk> .
thus she remained , and thus she rotted , erect .
in the year <unk> , a case of living <unk> happened in <name> , attended with circumstances which go far to warrant the assertion that truth is , indeed , stranger than fiction .
the heroine of the story was a mademoiselle <unk> <unk> , a young girl of illustrious family , of wealth , and of great personal beauty .
among her numerous suitors was <unk> <unk> , a poor <unk> , or journalist of <name> .
his talents and general <unk> had recommended him to the notice of the heiress , by whom he seems to have been truly beloved ; but her pride of birth decided her , finally , to reject him , and to wed a monsieur <unk> , a banker and a <unk> of some eminence .
after marriage , however , this gentleman neglected , and , perhaps , even more positively <unk> her .
having passed with him some wretched years , she died ,   at least her condition so closely resembled death as to deceive every one who saw her .
she was buried   not in a vault , but in an ordinary grave in the village of her nativity .
filled with despair , and still inflamed by the memory of a profound attachment , the lover journeys from the capital to the remote province in which the village lies , with the romantic purpose of <unk> the corpse , and possessing himself of its luxuriant tresses .
he reaches the grave .
at midnight he <unk> the coffin , opens it , and is in the act of <unk> the hair , when he is arrested by the <unk> of the beloved eyes .
in fact , the <name> had been buried alive .
vitality had not altogether departed , and she was aroused by the caresses of her lover from the lethargy which had been mistaken for death .
he bore her frantically to his lodgings in the village .
he employed certain powerful <unk> suggested by no little medical learning .
in fine , she revived .
she recognized her preserver .
she remained with him until , by slow degrees , she fully recovered her original health .
her woman 's heart was not <unk> , and this last lesson of love sufficed to soften it .
she bestowed it upon <unk> .
she returned no more to her husband , but , concealing from him her resurrection , fled with her lover to <name> .
twenty years afterward , the two returned to <name> , in the persuasion that time had so greatly altered the <name> 's appearance that her friends would be unable to recognize her .
they were mistaken , however , for , at the first meeting , monsieur <unk> did actually recognize and make claim to his wife .
this claim she resisted , and a judicial tribunal sustained her in her resistance , deciding that the peculiar circumstances , with the long lapse of years , had extinguished , not only <unk> , but legally , the authority of the husband .
the " <unk> journal " of <unk>  a periodical of high authority and merit , which some american bookseller would do well to translate and <unk> , records in a late number a very distressing event of the character in question .
an officer of artillery , a man of gigantic stature and of robust health , being thrown from an unmanageable horse , received a very severe <unk> upon the head , which rendered him insensible at once ; the skull was slightly fractured , but no immediate danger was apprehended .
<unk> was accomplished successfully .
he was bled , and many other of the ordinary means of relief were adopted .
gradually , however , he fell into a more and more hopeless state of stupor , and , finally , it was thought that he died .
the weather was warm , and he was buried with indecent haste in one of the public cemeteries .
his funeral took place on thursday .
on the <name> following , the grounds of the cemetery were , as usual , much thronged with <unk> , and about noon an intense excitement was created by the declaration of a peasant that , while sitting upon the grave of the officer , he had distinctly felt a commotion of the earth , as if occasioned by some one struggling beneath .
at first little attention was paid to the man 's <unk> ; but his evident terror , and the dogged obstinacy with which he persisted in his story , had at length their natural effect upon the crowd .
spades were hurriedly procured , and the grave , which was shamefully shallow , was in a few minutes so far thrown open that the head of its occupant appeared .
he was then seemingly dead ; but he sat nearly erect within his coffin , the lid of which , in his furious struggles , he had partially uplifted .
he was forthwith conveyed to the nearest hospital , and there pronounced to be still living , although in an <unk> condition .
after some hours he revived , recognized individuals of his acquaintance , and , in broken sentences spoke of his agonies in the grave .
from what he related , it was clear that he must have been conscious of life for more than an hour , while <unk> , before <unk> into insensibility .
the grave was carelessly and loosely filled with an exceedingly porous soil ; and thus some air was necessarily admitted .
he heard the footsteps of the crowd overhead , and endeavored to make himself heard in turn .
it was the tumult within the grounds of the cemetery , he said , which appeared to awaken him from a deep sleep , but no sooner was he awake than he became fully aware of the awful horrors of his position .
this patient , it is recorded , was doing well and seemed to be in a fair way of ultimate recovery , but fell a victim to the <unk> of medical experiment .
the galvanic battery was applied , and he suddenly expired in one of those ecstatic paroxysms which , occasionally , it <unk> .
the mention of the galvanic battery , nevertheless , recalls to my memory a well known and very extraordinary case in point , where its action proved the means of restoring to animation a young attorney of london , who had been interred for two days .
this occurred in 1831 , and created , at the time , a very profound sensation wherever it was made the subject of converse .
the patient , mr. <name> <unk> , had died , apparently of <unk> fever , accompanied with some anomalous symptoms which had excited the curiosity of his medical attendants .
upon his seeming decease , his friends were requested to sanction a <unk> examination , but declined to permit it .
as often happens , when such <unk> are made , the <unk> resolved to <unk> the body and <unk> it at leisure , in private .
arrangements were easily effected with some of the numerous corps of <unk> , with which london abounds ; and , upon the third night after the funeral , the supposed corpse was unearthed from a grave eight feet deep , and deposited in the opening chamber of one of the private hospitals .
an <unk> of some extent had been actually made in the abdomen , when the fresh and <unk> appearance of the subject suggested an application of the battery .
one experiment succeeded another , and the customary effects supervened , with nothing to characterize them in any respect , except , upon one or two occasions , a more than ordinary degree of <unk> in the convulsive action .
it grew late .
the day was about to <name> ; and it was thought expedient , at length , to proceed at once to the dissection .
a student , however , was especially desirous of testing a theory of his own , and insisted upon applying the battery to one of the <unk> muscles .
a rough gash was made , and a wire hastily brought in contact , when the patient , with a hurried but quite <unk> movement , arose from the table , stepped into the middle of the floor , gazed about him uneasily for a few seconds , and then  spoke .
what he said was unintelligible , but words were uttered ; the <unk> was distinct .
having spoken , he fell heavily to the floor .
for some moments all were paralyzed with awe  but the urgency of the case soon restored them their presence of mind .
it was seen that mr. <unk> was alive , although in a swoon .
upon exhibition of ether he revived and was rapidly restored to health , and to the society of his friends  from whom , however , all knowledge of his <unk> was withheld , until a relapse was no longer to be apprehended .
their wonder  their rapturous astonishment  may be conceived .
the most thrilling peculiarity of this incident , nevertheless , is involved in what mr. s. himself asserts .
he declares that at no period was he altogether insensible  that , dully and confusedly , he was aware of everything which happened to him , from the moment in which he was pronounced dead by his physicians , to that in which he fell <unk> to the floor of the hospital .
" i am alive , " were the <unk> words which , upon recognizing the locality of the <unk> , he had endeavored , in his extremity , to utter .
it were an easy matter to multiply such histories as these  but i forbear  for , indeed , we have no need of such to establish the fact that premature <unk> occur .
when we reflect how very rarely , from the nature of the case , we have it in our power to detect them , we must admit that they may frequently occur without our cognizance .
scarcely , in truth , is a graveyard ever <unk> upon , for any purpose , to any great extent , that skeletons are not found in <unk> which suggest the most fearful of suspicions .
fearful indeed the suspicion  but more fearful the doom !
it may be asserted , without hesitation , that no event is so terribly well adapted to inspire the <unk> of bodily and of mental distress , as is burial before death .
the unendurable oppression of the lungs  the stifling fumes from the damp earth  the clinging to the death garments  the rigid embrace of the narrow house  the blackness of the absolute night  the silence like a sea that <unk>  the unseen but palpable presence of the conqueror worm  these things , with the thoughts of the air and grass above , with memory of dear friends who would fly to save us if but informed of our fate , and with consciousness that of this fate they can never be informed  that our hopeless portion is that of the really dead  these considerations , i say , <name> into the heart , which still <unk> , a degree of appalling and intolerable horror from which the most daring imagination must recoil .
we know of nothing so agonizing upon earth  we can dream of nothing half so hideous in the realms of the <unk> hell .
and thus all narratives upon this topic have an interest profound ; an interest , nevertheless , which , through the sacred awe of the topic itself , very properly and very peculiarly depends upon our conviction of the truth of the matter narrated .
what i have now to tell is of my own actual knowledge  of my own positive and personal experience .
for several years i had been subject to attacks of the singular disorder which physicians have agreed to term <unk> , in default of a more <unk> title .
although both the immediate and the <unk> causes , and even the actual diagnosis , of this disease are still mysterious , its obvious and apparent character is sufficiently well understood .
its variations seem to be chiefly of degree .
sometimes the patient lies , for a day only , or even for a shorter period , in a species of exaggerated lethargy .
he is senseless and externally motionless ; but the <unk> of the heart is still faintly perceptible ; some traces of warmth remain ; a slight color lingers within the centre of the cheek ; and , upon application of a mirror to the lips , we can detect a torpid , unequal , and <unk> action of the lungs .
then again the duration of the trance is for weeks  even for months ; while the closest scrutiny , and the most rigorous medical tests , fail to establish any material distinction between the state of the sufferer and what we conceive of absolute death .
very usually he is saved from premature interment solely by the knowledge of his friends that he has been previously subject to <unk> , by the consequent suspicion excited , and , above all , by the <unk> of decay .
the advances of the malady are , luckily , gradual .
the first manifestations , although marked , are unequivocal .
the fits grow successively more and more distinctive , and endure each for a longer term than the preceding .
in this lies the principal security from <unk> .
the unfortunate whose first attack should be of the extreme character which is occasionally seen , would almost inevitably be consigned alive to the tomb .
my own case differed in no important particular from those mentioned in medical books .
sometimes , without any apparent cause , i sank , little by little , into a condition of <unk> , or half swoon ; and , in this condition , without pain , without ability to stir , or , strictly speaking , to think , but with a dull <unk> consciousness of life and of the presence of those who surrounded my bed , i remained , until the crisis of the disease restored me , suddenly , to perfect sensation .
at other times i was quickly and impetuously smitten .
i grew sick , and numb , and chilly , and dizzy , and so fell prostrate at once .
then , for weeks , all was void , and black , and silent , and nothing became the universe .
total annihilation could be no more .
from these latter attacks i awoke , however , with a gradation slow in proportion to the suddenness of the seizure .
just as the day <unk> to the friendless and houseless beggar who <unk> the streets throughout the long desolate <name> night  just so <unk>  just so wearily  just so cheerily came back the light of the soul to me .
apart from the tendency to trance , however , my general health appeared to be good ; nor could i perceive that it was at all affected by the one prevalent malady  unless , indeed , an <unk> in my ordinary sleep may be looked upon as <unk> .
upon awaking from slumber , i could never gain , at once , thorough possession of my senses , and always remained , for many minutes , in much bewilderment and perplexity ;  the mental faculties in general , but the memory in especial , being in a condition of absolute abeyance .
in all that i endured there was no physical suffering but of moral distress an infinitude .
my fancy grew <unk> , i talked " of worms , of tombs , and <unk> . "
i was lost in reveries of death , and the idea of premature burial held continual possession of my <name> .
the ghastly danger to which i was subjected haunted me day and night .
in the former , the torture of meditation was excessive  in the latter , supreme .
when the grim darkness overspread the earth , then , with every horror of thought , i shook  shook as the quivering plumes upon the hearse .
when nature could endure <unk> no longer , it was with a struggle that i consented to sleep  for i shuddered to reflect that , upon awaking , i might find myself the tenant of a grave .
and when , finally , i sank into slumber , it was only to rush at once into a world of <unk> , above which , with vast , sable , overshadowing wing , hovered , predominant , the one sepulchral idea .
from the innumerable images of gloom which thus oppressed me in dreams , i select for record but a solitary vision .
methought i was immersed in a <unk> trance of more than usual duration and profundity .
suddenly there came an icy hand upon my forehead , and an impatient , <unk> voice whispered the word " arise ! "
within my ear .
i sat erect .
the darkness was total .
i could not see the figure of him who had aroused me .
i could call to mind neither the period at which i had fallen into the trance , nor the locality in which i then lay .
while i remained motionless , and busied in endeavors to collect my thought , the cold hand grasped me fiercely by the wrist , shaking it petulantly , while the <unk> voice said again : " arise !
did i not bid thee arise ? "
" and who , " i demanded , " <name> thou ? "
" i have no name in the regions which i inhabit , " replied the voice , mournfully ; " i was mortal , but am fiend .
i was merciless , but am pitiful .
thou dost feel that i <unk>  my teeth chatter as i speak , yet it is not with the <unk> of the night  of the night without end .
but this <unk> is insufferable .
how canst thou tranquilly sleep ?
i can not rest for the cry of these great agonies .
these sights are more than i can bear .
get thee up !
come with me into the outer night , and let me unfold to thee the graves .
is not this a spectacle of woe ?  behold ! "
i looked ; and the unseen figure , which still grasped me by the wrist , had caused to be thrown open the graves of all mankind , and from each issued the faint phosphoric radiance of decay , so that i could see into the innermost recesses , and there view the shrouded bodies in their sad and solemn slumbers with the worm .
but alas !
the real sleepers were fewer , by many millions , than those who slumbered not at all ; and there was a feeble struggling ; and there was a general sad unrest ; and from out the depths of the countless pits there came a melancholy rustling from the garments of the buried .
and of those who seemed tranquilly to repose , i saw that a vast number had changed , in a greater or less degree , the rigid and uneasy position in which they had originally been entombed .
and the voice again said to me as i gazed : " is it not  oh !
is it not a pitiful sight ? "
 but , before i could find words to reply , the figure had ceased to grasp my wrist , the phosphoric lights expired , and the graves were closed with a sudden violence , while from out them arose a tumult of despairing cries , saying again : " is it not  o , god , is it not a very pitiful sight ? "
<unk> such as these , presenting themselves at night , extended their terrific influence far into my waking hours .
my nerves became thoroughly unstrung , and i fell a prey to perpetual horror .
i hesitated to ride , or to walk , or to indulge in any exercise that would <name> me from home .
in fact , i no longer dared trust myself out of the immediate presence of those who were aware of my <unk> to <unk> , lest , falling into one of my usual fits , i should be buried before my real condition could be ascertained .
i doubted the care , the fidelity of my dearest friends .
i dreaded that , in some trance of more than customary duration , they might be prevailed upon to regard me as <unk> .
i even went so far as to fear that , as i occasioned much trouble , they might be glad to consider any very protracted attack as sufficient excuse for getting rid of me altogether .
it was in vain they endeavored to reassure me by the most solemn promises .
i exacted the most sacred oaths , that under no circumstances they would bury me until decomposition had so materially advanced as to render farther preservation impossible .
and , even then , my mortal terrors would listen to no reason  would accept no consolation .
i entered into a series of elaborate precautions .
among other things , i had the family vault so <unk> as to admit of being readily opened from within .
the slightest pressure upon a long lever that extended far into the tomb would cause the iron portal to fly back .
there were arrangements also for the free admission of air and light , and convenient receptacles for food and water , within immediate reach of the coffin intended for my reception .
this coffin was warmly and softly padded , and was provided with a lid , fashioned upon the principle of the <unk> , with the addition of springs so contrived that the feeblest movement of the body would be sufficient to set it at <name> .
besides all this , there was suspended from the roof of the tomb , a large <name> , the rope of which , it was designed , should extend through a hole in the coffin , and so be fastened to one of the hands of the corpse .
but , alas ?
what avails the vigilance against the <name> of man ?
not even these <unk> securities sufficed to save from the uttermost agonies of living <unk> , a wretch to these agonies <unk> !
there arrived an epoch  as often before there had arrived  in which i found myself emerging from total unconsciousness into the first feeble and indefinite sense of existence .
slowly  with a tortoise gradation  approached the faint gray <name> of the <unk> day .
a torpid uneasiness .
an <unk> endurance of dull pain .
no care  no <name>  no effort .
then , after a long interval , a ringing in the ears ; then , after a lapse still longer , a <unk> or tingling sensation in the extremities ; then a seemingly eternal period of pleasurable quiescence , during which the awakening feelings are struggling into thought ; then a brief <unk> into <unk> ; then a sudden recovery .
at length the slight quivering of an eyelid , and immediately thereupon , an electric shock of a terror , deadly and indefinite , which sends the blood in torrents from the temples to the heart .
and now the first positive effort to think .
and now the first endeavor to remember .
and now a partial and evanescent success .
and now the memory has so far regained its dominion , that , in some measure , i am cognizant of my state .
i feel that i am not awaking from ordinary sleep .
i recollect that i have been subject to <unk> .
and now , at last , as if by the rush of an ocean , my shuddering spirit is overwhelmed by the one grim danger  by the one spectral and <unk> idea .
for some minutes after this fancy possessed me , i remained without motion .
and why ?
i could not summon courage to move .
i dared not make the effort which was to satisfy me of my fate  and yet there was something at my heart which whispered me it was sure .
despair  such as no other species of wretchedness ever calls into being  despair alone urged me , after long <unk> , to uplift the heavy lids of my eyes .
i uplifted them .
it was dark  all dark .
i knew that the fit was over .
i knew that the crisis of my disorder had long passed .
i knew that i had now fully recovered the use of my <unk> faculties  and yet it was dark  all dark  the intense and utter <unk> of the night that <unk> for evermore .
i endeavored to shriek , and my lips and my parched tongue moved convulsively together in the attempt  but no voice issued from the cavernous lungs , which oppressed as if by the weight of some incumbent mountain , gasped and <unk> , with the heart , at every elaborate and struggling inspiration .
the movement of the jaws , in this effort to cry aloud , showed me that they were bound up , as is usual with the dead .
i felt , too , that i lay upon some hard substance , and by something similar my sides were , also , closely compressed .
so far , i had not ventured to stir any of my limbs  but now i violently threw up my arms , which had been lying at length , with the wrists crossed .
they struck a solid wooden substance , which extended above my person at an elevation of not more than six inches from my face .
i could no longer doubt that i reposed within a coffin at last .
and now , amid all my infinite miseries , came sweetly the cherub <name>  for i thought of my precautions .
i writhed , and made spasmodic exertions to force open the lid : it would not move .
i felt my wrists for the <unk> : it was not to be found .
and now the comforter fled for ever , and a still sterner despair reigned triumphant ; for i could not help perceiving the absence of the <unk> which i had so carefully prepared  and then , too , there came suddenly to my nostrils the strong peculiar odor of moist earth .
the conclusion was irresistible .
i was not within the vault .
i had fallen into a trance while absent from <unk> among strangers  when , or how , i could not remember  and it was they who had buried me as a dog  nailed up in some common coffin  and thrust deep , deep , and for ever , into some ordinary and nameless grave .
as this awful conviction forced itself , thus , into the innermost chambers of my soul , i once again struggled to cry aloud .
and in this second endeavor i succeeded .
a long , wild , and continuous shriek , or yell of agony , resounded through the realms of the subterranean night .
" <unk> !
<unk> , there ! "
said a gruff voice , in reply .
" what the devil 's the matter now ! "
said a second .
" get out o ' that ! "
said a third .
" what do you mean by <unk> in that ere kind of style , like a <unk> ? "
said a fourth ; and hereupon i was seized and shaken without ceremony , for several minutes , by a <unk> of very rough-looking individuals .
they did not arouse me from my slumber  for i was wide awake when i screamed  but they restored me to the full possession of my memory .
this adventure occurred near richmond , in <name> .
accompanied by a friend , i had proceeded , upon a <unk> expedition , some miles down the banks of the <name> river .
night approached , and we were overtaken by a storm .
the cabin of a small sloop lying at anchor in the stream , and laden with garden mould , afforded us the only available shelter .
we made the best of it , and passed the night on board .
i slept in one of the only two berths in the vessel  and the berths of a sloop of sixty or twenty tons need scarcely be described .
that which i occupied had no bedding of any kind .
its extreme width was eighteen inches .
the distance of its bottom from the deck overhead was precisely the same .
i found it a matter of exceeding difficulty to squeeze myself in .
nevertheless , i slept soundly , and the whole of my vision  for it was no dream , and no nightmare  arose naturally from the circumstances of my position  from my ordinary bias of thought  and from the difficulty , to which i have alluded , of collecting my senses , and especially of regaining my memory , for a long time after awaking from slumber .
the men who shook me were the crew of the sloop , and some laborers engaged to unload it .
from the load itself came the earthly smell .
the bandage about the jaws was a silk handkerchief in which i had bound up my head , in default of my customary <unk> .
the tortures endured , however , were indubitably quite equal for the time , to those of actual <unk> .
they were fearfully  they were inconceivably hideous ; but out of evil proceeded good ; for their very excess wrought in my spirit an inevitable revulsion .
my soul acquired tone  acquired temper .
i went abroad .
i took vigorous exercise .
i breathed the free air of heaven .
i thought upon other subjects than death .
i discarded my medical books .
" <unk> " i burned .
i read no " night thoughts "  no <unk> about <unk>  no <unk> tales  such as this .
in short , i became a new man , and lived a man 's life .
from that memorable night , i dismissed forever my <unk> apprehensions , and with them vanished the <unk> disorder , of which , perhaps , they had been less the consequence than the cause .
there are moments when , even to the sober eye of reason , the world of our sad humanity may assume the semblance of a hell  but the imagination of man is no <unk> , to explore with impunity its every cavern .
alas !
the grim legion of sepulchral terrors can not be regarded as altogether fanciful  but , like the demons in whose company <unk> made his voyage down the <unk> , they must sleep , or they <name> devour us  they must be suffered to slumber , or we perish .
the domain of <unk> the garden like a <name> fair was cut , that lay as if she slumbered in delight , and to the open skies her eyes did shut .
the azure fields of heaven were <unk> right in a large round , set with the flowers of light .
the flowers de <unk> , and the round sparks of dew .
that <name> upon their azure leaves did shew like twinkling stars that <name> in the evening blue .
giles <name> .
from his cradle to his grave a <name> of prosperity bore my friend ellison along .
nor do i use the word prosperity in its mere worldly sense .
i mean it as synonymous with happiness .
the person of whom i speak seemed born for the purpose of <unk> the doctrines of <unk> , price , <unk> , and <unk>  of <unk> by individual instance what has been deemed the <unk> of the <unk> .
in the brief existence of ellison i fancy that i have seen <unk> the dogma , that in man 's very nature lies some hidden principle , the antagonist of bliss .
an anxious examination of his career has given me to understand that in general , from the violation of a few simple laws of humanity arises the wretchedness of mankind  that as a species we have in our possession the as yet <unk> elements of content  and that , even now , in the present darkness and madness of all thought on the great question of the social condition , it is not impossible that man , the individual , under certain unusual and highly <unk> conditions , may be happy .
with opinions such as these my young friend , too , was fully imbued , and thus it is worthy of observation that the uninterrupted enjoyment which distinguished his life was , in great measure , the result of <unk> .
it is indeed evident that with less of the instinctive philosophy which , now and then , stands so well in the stead of experience , mr. ellison would have found himself precipitated , by the very extraordinary success of his life , into the common vortex of unhappiness which <unk> for those of <unk> endowments .
but it is by no means my object to pen an essay on happiness .
the ideas of my friend may be summed up in a few words .
he admitted but four elementary principles , or more strictly , conditions of bliss .
that which he considered chief was ( strange to say ! )
the simple and purely physical one of free exercise in the open air .
" the health , " he said , " attainable by other means is scarcely worth the name . "
he <unk> the ecstasies of the <unk> , and pointed to the <unk> of the earth , the only people who , as a class , can be fairly considered happier than others .
his second condition was the love of woman .
his third , and most difficult of realization , was the contempt of ambition .
his fourth was an object of unceasing pursuit ; and he held that , other things being equal , the extent of attainable happiness was in proportion to the <unk> of this object .
ellison was remarkable in the continuous profusion of good gifts lavished upon him by fortune .
in personal <name> and beauty he exceeded all men .
his intellect was of that order to which the acquisition of knowledge is less a labor than an intuition and a necessity .
his family was one of the most illustrious of the empire .
his bride was the loveliest and most devoted of women .
his possessions had been always ample ; but on the attainment of his majority , it was discovered that one of those extraordinary freaks of fate had been played in his behalf which startle the whole social world amid which they occur , and seldom fail radically to alter the moral constitution of those who are their objects .
it appears that about a hundred years before mr. ellison 's coming of age , there had died , in a remote province , one mr. <unk> ellison .
this gentleman had <unk> a princely fortune , and , having no immediate connections , conceived the whim of suffering his wealth to accumulate for a century after his decease .
minutely and sagaciously directing the various modes of investment , he bequeathed the aggregate amount to the nearest of blood , bearing the name of ellison , who should be alive at the end of the hundred years .
many attempts had been made to set aside this singular <unk> ; their ex post <unk> character rendered them abortive ; but the attention of a jealous government was aroused , and a legislative act finally obtained , forbidding all similar accumulations .
this act , however , did not prevent young ellison from entering into possession , on his <unk> birthday , as the heir of his ancestor <unk> , of a fortune of four hundred and fifty millions of dollars .
( *1 ) when it had become known that such was the enormous wealth inherited , there were , of course , many speculations as to the mode of its disposal .
the magnitude and the immediate <unk> of the sum bewildered all who thought on the topic .
the possessor of any appreciable amount of money might have been imagined to perform any one of a thousand things .
with riches merely surpassing those of any citizen , it would have been easy to suppose him engaging to supreme excess in the fashionable <unk> of his time  or <unk> himself with political intrigue  or aiming at <unk> power  or purchasing increase of nobility  or collecting large museums of <unk>  or playing the <unk> patron of letters , of science , of <name>  or <unk> , and bestowing his name upon extensive institutions of <name> .
but for the inconceivable wealth in the actual possession of the heir , these objects and all ordinary objects were felt to afford too limited a field .
recourse was had to figures , and these but sufficed to confound .
it was seen that , even at three per cent. , the annual income of the inheritance amounted to no less than thirteen millions and five hundred thousand dollars ; which was one million and one hundred and twenty-five thousand per month ; or thirty-six thousand nine hundred and <unk> per day ; or one thousand five hundred and forty-one per hour ; or six and twenty dollars for every minute that flew .
thus the usual track of supposition was thoroughly broken up .
men knew not what to imagine .
there were some who even conceived that mr. ellison would divest himself of at least one-half of his fortune , as of utterly superfluous opulence  enriching whole troops of his relatives by division of his <unk> .
to the nearest of these he did , in fact , abandon the very unusual wealth which was his own before the inheritance .
i was not surprised , however , to perceive that he had long made up his mind on a point which had occasioned so much discussion to his friends .
nor was i greatly astonished at the nature of his decision .
in regard to individual charities he had satisfied his conscience .
in the possibility of any improvement , properly so called , being effected by man himself in the general condition of man , he had ( i am sorry to confess it ) little <name> .
upon the whole , whether happily or unhappily , he was thrown back , in very great measure , upon self .
in the widest and noblest sense he was a poet .
he comprehended , moreover , the true character , the <name> aims , the supreme majesty and dignity of the poetic sentiment .
the fullest , if not the sole proper satisfaction of this sentiment he instinctively felt to lie in the creation of novel forms of beauty .
some peculiarities , either in his early education , or in the nature of his intellect , had tinged with what is termed <unk> all his ethical speculations ; and it was this bias , perhaps , which led him to believe that the most advantageous at least , if not the sole legitimate field for the poetic exercise , lies in the creation of novel moods of purely physical loveliness .
thus it happened he became neither musician nor poet  if we use this latter term in its every-day <unk> .
or it might have been that he neglected to become either , merely in pursuance of his idea that in contempt of ambition is to be found one of the essential principles of happiness on earth .
is it not indeed , possible that , while a high order of genius is necessarily ambitious , the highest is above that which is termed ambition ?
and may it not thus happen that many far greater than <name> have contentedly remained " mute and <unk> ? "
i believe that the world has never seen  and that , unless through some series of accidents <unk> the noblest order of mind into distasteful exertion , the world <name> never see  that full extent of triumphant execution , in the richer domains of <name> , of which the human nature is absolutely capable .
ellison became neither musician nor poet ; although no man lived more profoundly <unk> of music and poetry .
under other circumstances than those which invested him , it is not impossible that he would have become a painter .
sculpture , although in its nature rigorously poetical was too limited in its extent and consequences , to have occupied , at any time , much of his attention .
and i have now mentioned all the provinces in which the common understanding of the poetic sentiment has declared it capable of <unk> .
but ellison maintained that the richest , the truest , and most natural , if not altogether the most extensive province , had been unaccountably neglected .
no definition had spoken of the <unk> as of the poet ; yet it seemed to my friend that the creation of the <unk> offered to the proper muse the most magnificent of opportunities .
here , indeed , was the fairest field for the display of imagination in the endless combining of forms of novel beauty ; the elements to enter into combination being , by a vast superiority , the most glorious which the earth could afford .
in the multiform and <unk> of the flowers and the trees , he recognised the most direct and energetic efforts of nature at physical loveliness .
and in the direction or concentration of this effort  or , more properly , in its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it on earth  he perceived that he should be employing the best means  laboring to the greatest advantage  in the fulfilment , not only of his own <name> as poet , but of the <name> purposes for which the deity had implanted the poetic sentiment in man .
" its adaptation to the eyes which were to behold it on earth . "
in his explanation of this phraseology , mr. ellison did much toward solving what has always seemed to me an enigma :  i mean the fact ( which none but the ignorant dispute ) that no such combination of scenery exists in nature as the painter of genius may produce .
no such <unk> are to be found in reality as have glowed on the canvas of <name> .
in the most enchanting of natural landscapes , there <name> always be found a defect or an excess  many excesses and defects .
while the component parts may defy , individually , the highest skill of the artist , the arrangement of these parts <name> always be susceptible of improvement .
in short , no position can be attained on the wide surface of the natural earth , from which an <unk> eye , looking steadily , <name> not find matter of offence in what is termed the " composition " of the landscape .
and yet how unintelligible is this !
in all other matters we are justly instructed to regard nature as supreme .
with her details we shrink from competition .
who shall presume to imitate the colors of the <unk> , or to improve the proportions of the <name> of the valley ?
the criticism which says , of sculpture or <unk> , that here nature is to be exalted or <unk> rather than imitated , is in error .
no pictorial or <unk> combinations of points of human <unk> do more than approach the living and breathing beauty .
in landscape alone is the principle of the critic true ; and , having felt its truth here , it is but the headlong spirit of generalization which has led him to pronounce it true throughout all the domains of <name> .
having , i say , felt its truth here ; for the feeling is no affectation or <unk> .
the mathematics afford no more absolute demonstrations than the sentiments of his <name> yields the artist .
he not only believes , but positively knows , that such and such apparently arbitrary arrangements of matter constitute and alone constitute the true beauty .
his reasons , however , have not yet been matured into expression .
it remains for a more profound analysis than the world has yet seen , fully to investigate and express them .
nevertheless he is confirmed in his instinctive opinions by the voice of all his brethren .
let a " composition " be defective ; let an <unk> be wrought in its mere arrangement of form ; let this <unk> be submitted to every artist in the world ; by each <name> its necessity be admitted .
and even far more than this :  in remedy of the defective composition , each insulated member of the fraternity would have suggested the identical <unk> .
i repeat that in landscape arrangements alone is the physical nature susceptible of exaltation , and that , therefore , her susceptibility of improvement at this one point , was a mystery i had been unable to solve .
my own thoughts on the subject had rested in the idea that the primitive intention of nature would have so arranged the earth 's surface as to have fulfilled at all points man 's sense of perfection in the beautiful , the sublime , or the picturesque ; but that this primitive intention had been frustrated by the known geological disturbances  disturbances of form and color  grouping , in the correction or <unk> of which lies the soul of <name> .
the force of this idea was much weakened , however , by the necessity which it involved of considering the disturbances abnormal and <unk> to any purpose .
it was ellison who suggested that they were <unk> of death .
he thus explained :  admit the earthly immortality of man to have been the first intention .
we have then the primitive arrangement of the earth 's surface adapted to his blissful estate , as not <unk> but designed .
the disturbances were the preparations for his subsequently conceived <unk> condition .
" now , " said my friend , " what we regard as exaltation of the landscape may be really such , as respects only the moral or human point of view .
each alteration of the natural scenery may possibly effect a blemish in the picture , if we can suppose this picture viewed at large  in mass  from some point distant from the earth 's surface , although not beyond the limits of its atmosphere .
it is easily understood that what might improve a closely scrutinized detail , may at the same time injure a general or more distantly observed effect .
there may be a class of beings , human once , but now invisible to humanity , to whom , from afar , our disorder may seem order  our <unk> picturesque , in a word , the <unk> , for whose scrutiny more especially than our own , and for whose death  refined appreciation of the beautiful , may have been set in array by god the wide <unk> of the hemispheres . "
in the course of discussion , my friend quoted some passages from a writer on <unk> who has been supposed to have well treated his theme : " there are properly but two styles of <unk> , the natural and the artificial .
one seeks to recall the original beauty of the country , by adapting its means to the surrounding scenery , cultivating trees in <name> with the hills or plain of the neighboring land ; detecting and bringing into practice those nice relations of size , proportion , and color which , hid from the common observer , are revealed everywhere to the experienced student of nature .
the result of the natural style of gardening , is seen rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities  in the prevalence of a healthy <name> and order  than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles .
the artificial style has as many varieties as there are different tastes to gratify .
it has a certain general relation to the various styles of building .
there are the stately avenues and <unk> of versailles ; italian terraces ; and a various mixed old english style , which bears some relation to the domestic gothic or english elizabethan architecture .
whatever may be said against the abuses of the artificial landscape  gardening , a mixture of pure <name> in a garden scene adds to it a great beauty .
this is partly pleasing to the eye , by the show of order and design , and partly moral .
a terrace , with an old moss  covered balustrade , calls up at once to the eye the fair forms that have passed there in other days .
the slightest exhibition of <name> is an evidence of care and human interest . "
" from what i have already observed , " said ellison , " you <name> understand that i reject the idea , here expressed , of recalling the original beauty of the country .
the original beauty is never so great as that which may be introduced .
of course , every thing depends on the selection of a spot with <unk> .
what is said about detecting and bringing into practice nice relations of size , proportion , and color , is one of those mere <unk> of speech which serve to veil <unk> of thought .
the phrase quoted may mean any thing , or nothing , and guides in no degree .
that the true result of the natural style of gardening is seen rather in the absence of all defects and incongruities than in the creation of any special wonders or miracles , is a proposition better suited to the <unk> apprehension of the herd than to the <unk> dreams of the man of genius .
the negative merit suggested <unk> to that <unk> criticism which , in letters , would elevate addison into <unk> .
in truth , while that virtue which consists in the mere avoidance of vice appeals directly to the understanding , and can thus be circumscribed in rule , the loftier virtue , which flames in creation , can be apprehended in its results alone .
rule applies but to the merits of denial  to the excellencies which refrain .
beyond these , the critical <name> can but suggest .
we may be instructed to build a " cato , " but we are in vain told how to conceive a parthenon or an " inferno . "
the thing done , however ; the wonder accomplished ; and the capacity for apprehension becomes universal .
the <unk> of the negative school who , through inability to create , have scoffed at creation , are now found the loudest in applause .
what , in its chrysalis condition of principle , <unk> their demure reason , never fails , in its maturity of accomplishment , to extort admiration from their instinct of beauty .
" the author 's observations on the artificial style , " continued ellison , " are less objectionable .
a mixture of pure <name> in a garden scene adds to it a great beauty .
this is just ; as also is the reference to the sense of human interest .
the principle expressed is <unk>  but there may be something beyond it .
there may be an object in keeping with the principle  an object unattainable by the means ordinarily possessed by individuals , yet which , if attained , would lend a charm to the <unk> far surpassing that which a sense of merely human interest could bestow .
a poet , having very unusual pecuniary resources , might , while retaining the necessary idea of <name> or culture , or , as our author expresses it , of interest , so <unk> his designs at once with extent and novelty of beauty , as to convey the sentiment of spiritual interference .
it <name> be seen that , in bringing about such result , he secures all the advantages of interest or design , while relieving his work of the harshness or <unk> of the worldly <name> .
in the most rugged of <unk>  in the most savage of the scenes of pure nature  there is apparent the <name> of a creator ; yet this <name> is apparent to reflection only ; in no respect has it the obvious force of a feeling .
now let us suppose this sense of the almighty design to be one step depressed  to be brought into something like <name> or consistency with the sense of human <name>  to form an <unk> between the two :  let us imagine , for example , a landscape whose combined vastness and <unk>  whose united beauty , magnificence , and strangeness , shall convey the idea of care , or culture , or superintendence , on the part of beings superior , yet akin to humanity  then the sentiment of interest is preserved , while the <name> <unk> is made to assume the air of an intermediate or secondary nature  a nature which is not god , nor an <unk> from god , but which still is nature in the sense of the handiwork of the angels that hover between man and god . "
it was in devoting his enormous wealth to the embodiment of a vision such as this  in the free exercise in the open air ensured by the personal superintendence of his plans  in the unceasing object which these plans afforded  in the high <unk> of the object  in the contempt of ambition which it enabled him truly to feel  in the perennial springs with which it gratified , without possibility of <unk> , that one master passion of his soul , the thirst for beauty , above all , it was in the sympathy of a woman , not <unk> , whose loveliness and love enveloped his existence in the purple atmosphere of paradise , that ellison thought to find , and found , <unk> from the ordinary cares of humanity , with a far greater amount of positive happiness than ever glowed in the rapt <unk> of de <unk> .
i despair of conveying to the reader any distinct <name> of the marvels which my friend did actually accomplish .
i wish to describe , but am disheartened by the difficulty of description , and hesitate between detail and generality .
perhaps the better course <name> be to unite the two in their extremes .
mr. ellison 's first step regarded , of course , the choice of a locality , and scarcely had he commenced thinking on this point , when the luxuriant nature of the pacific islands arrested his attention .
in fact , he had made up his mind for a voyage to the south seas , when a <unk> reflection induced him to abandon the idea .
" were i <unk> , " he said , " such a <unk> would suit me .
the thoroughness of its insulation and seclusion , and the difficulty of ingress and egress , would in such case be the charm of charms ; but as yet i am not <unk> .
i wish the composure but not the depression of solitude .
there must remain with me a certain control over the extent and duration of my repose .
there <name> be frequent hours in which i shall need , too , the sympathy of the poetic in what i have done .
let me seek , then , a spot not far from a populous city  whose vicinity , also , <name> best enable me to execute my plans . "
in search of a suitable place so situated , ellison travelled for several years , and i was permitted to accompany him .
a thousand spots with which i was <unk> he rejected without hesitation , for reasons which satisfied me , in the end , that he was right .
we came at length to an elevated table-land of wonderful fertility and beauty , affording a <unk> prospect very little less in extent than that of <unk> , and , in ellison 's opinion as well as my own , surpassing the <unk> view from that mountain in all the true elements of the picturesque .
" i am aware , " said the traveller , as he <name> a sigh of deep delight after gazing on this scene , entranced , for nearly an hour , " i know that here , in my circumstances , nine-tenths of the most fastidious of men would rest content .
this panorama is indeed glorious , and i should rejoice in it but for the excess of its <name> .
the taste of all the architects i have ever known leads them , for the sake of <unk> , ' to put up buildings on <unk> .
the error is obvious .
grandeur in any of its moods , but especially in that of extent , <unk> , excites  and then fatigues , <unk> .
for the occasional scene nothing can be better  for the constant view nothing worse .
and , in the constant view , the most objectionable phase of grandeur is that of extent ; the worst phase of extent , that of distance .
it is at war with the sentiment and with the sense of seclusion  the sentiment and sense which we seek to humor in <unk> to the country . '
in looking from the summit of a mountain we can not help feeling abroad in the world .
the <unk> avoid distant prospects as a pestilence . "
it was not until toward the close of the fourth year of our search that we found a locality with which ellison professed himself satisfied .
it is , of course , needless to say where was the locality .
the late death of my friend , in causing his domain to be thrown open to certain classes of <unk> , has given to <unk> a species of secret and subdued if not solemn celebrity , similar in kind , although infinitely superior in degree , to that which so long distinguished <unk> .
the usual approach to <unk> was by the river .
the visiter left the city in the early morning .
during the forenoon he passed between shores of a tranquil and domestic beauty , on which grazed innumerable sheep , their white <unk> <unk> the vivid green of rolling meadows .
by degrees the idea of cultivation subsided into that of merely pastoral care .
this slowly became merged in a sense of retirement  this again in a consciousness of solitude .
as the evening approached , the channel grew more narrow , the banks more and more precipitous ; and these latter were clothed in <name> , more profuse , and more sombre foliage .
the water increased in transparency .
the stream took a thousand turns , so that at no moment could its gleaming surface be seen for a greater distance than a furlong .
at every instant the vessel seemed imprisoned within an enchanted circle , having insuperable and impenetrable walls of foliage , a roof of <unk> satin , and no floor  the keel balancing itself with admirable nicety on that of a phantom bark which , by some accident having been turned upside down , floated in constant company with the substantial one , for the purpose of sustaining it .
the channel now became a gorge  although the term is somewhat <unk> , and i employ it merely because the language has no word which better represents the most striking  not the most <unk> of the scene .
the character of gorge was maintained only in the height and parallelism of the shores ; it was lost altogether in their other traits .
the walls of the ravine ( through which the clear water still tranquilly flowed ) arose to an elevation of a hundred and occasionally of a hundred and fifty feet , and inclined so much toward each other as , in a great measure , to shut out the light of day ; while the long <unk> moss which depended densely from the <unk> <unk> overhead , gave the whole chasm an air of funereal gloom .
the windings became more frequent and intricate , and seemed often as if returning in upon themselves , so that the voyager had long lost all idea of direction .
he was , moreover , <unk> in an exquisite sense of the strange .
the thought of nature still remained , but her character seemed to have undergone modification , there was a weird symmetry , a thrilling uniformity , a wizard propriety in these her works .
not a dead branch  not a withered leaf  not a stray pebble  not a patch of the brown earth was anywhere visible .
the <name> water welled up against the clean granite , or the <unk> moss , with a sharpness of outline that delighted while it bewildered the eye .
having threaded the mazes of this channel for some hours , the gloom deepening every moment , a sharp and unexpected turn of the vessel brought it suddenly , as if dropped from heaven , into a circular basin of very considerable extent when compared with the width of the gorge .
it was about two hundred yards in diameter , and girt in at all points but one  that immediately fronting the vessel as it entered  by hills equal in general height to the walls of the chasm , although of a thoroughly different character .
their sides sloped from the water 's edge at an <name> of some forty-five degrees , and they were clothed from base to summit  not a perceptible point escaping  in a drapery of the most gorgeous <unk> ; scarcely a green leaf being visible among the sea of odorous and fluctuating color .
this basin was of great depth , but so transparent was the water that the bottom , which seemed to consist of a thick mass of small round <unk> pebbles , was distinctly visible by glimpses  that is to say , whenever the eye could permit itself not to see , far down in the inverted heaven , the duplicate blooming of the hills .
on these latter there were no trees , nor even shrubs of any size .
the impressions wrought on the observer were those of richness , warmth , color , <unk> , uniformity , softness , delicacy , <unk> , <unk> , and a miraculous <unk> of culture that suggested dreams of a new race of fairies , laborious , <unk> , magnificent , and fastidious ; but as the eye traced upward the <unk> slope , from its sharp junction with the water to its vague termination amid the folds of overhanging cloud , it became , indeed , difficult not to fancy a <unk> cataract of rubies , <unk> , <unk> , and golden <unk> , rolling silently out of the sky .
the visiter , shooting suddenly into this bay from out the gloom of the ravine , is delighted but astounded by the full orb of the declining sun , which he had supposed to be already far below the horizon , but which now <unk> him , and forms the sole termination of an otherwise limitless vista seen through another chasm  like rift in the hills .
but here the voyager quits the vessel which has borne him so far , and descends into a light canoe of <name> , stained with <unk> devices in vivid <name> , both within and without .
the poop and beak of this boat arise high above the water , with sharp points , so that the general form is that of an irregular crescent .
it lies on the surface of the bay with the proud <name> of a swan .
on its <unk> floor <unk> a single feathery paddle of <unk> ; but no oarsmen or attendant is to be seen .
the guest is bidden to be of good cheer  that the fates <name> take care of him .
the larger vessel disappears , and he is left alone in the canoe , which lies apparently motionless in the middle of the lake .
while he considers what course to pursue , however , he becomes aware of a gentle movement in the <name> bark .
it slowly swings itself around until its prow points toward the sun .
it advances with a gentle but gradually accelerated velocity , while the slight ripples it creates seem to break about the <name> side in <unk> <unk> to offer the only possible explanation of the soothing yet melancholy music for whose unseen origin the bewildered voyager looks around him in vain .
the canoe steadily proceeds , and the <name> gate of the vista is approached , so that its depths can be more distinctly seen .
to the right arise a chain of lofty hills rudely and luxuriantly wooded .
it is observed , however , that the trait of exquisite <unk> where the bank dips into the water , still prevails .
there is not one token of the usual river debris .
to the left the character of the scene is softer and more obviously artificial .
here the bank slopes upward from the stream in a very gentle ascent , forming a broad <unk> of grass of a texture resembling nothing so much as <name> , and of a brilliancy of green which would bear comparison with the tint of the purest <name> .
this plateau varies in width from ten to three hundred yards ; reaching from the river-bank to a wall , fifty feet high , which extends , in an infinity of curves , but following the general direction of the river , until lost in the distance to the westward .
this wall is of one continuous rock , and has been formed by cutting perpendicularly the once rugged precipice of the stream 's southern bank , but no trace of the labor has been suffered to remain .
the <unk> stone has the <name> of ages , and is profusely overhung and overspread with the <name> , the <name> honeysuckle , the <unk> , and the clematis .
the uniformity of the top and bottom lines of the wall is fully relieved by occasional trees of gigantic height , growing singly or in small groups , both along the plateau and in the domain behind the wall , but in close proximity to it ; so that frequent limbs ( of the black walnut especially ) reach over and dip their <unk> extremities into the water .
farther back within the domain , the vision is impeded by an impenetrable screen of foliage .
these things are observed during the canoe 's gradual approach to what i have called the gate of the vista .
on drawing nearer to this , however , its <unk> appearance vanishes ; a new outlet from the bay is discovered to the left  in which direction the wall is also seen to sweep , still following the general course of the stream .
down this new opening the eye can not penetrate very far ; for the stream , accompanied by the wall , still bends to the left , until both are swallowed up by the leaves .
the boat , nevertheless , glides magically into the winding channel ; and here the shore opposite the wall is found to resemble that opposite the wall in the straight vista .
lofty hills , rising occasionally into mountains , and covered with vegetation in wild luxuriance , still shut in the scene .
floating gently onward , but with a velocity slightly augmented , the voyager , after many short turns , finds his progress apparently barred by a gigantic gate or rather door of burnished gold , elaborately carved and fretted , and reflecting the direct rays of the now <unk> sun with an <unk> that seems to wreath the whole surrounding forest in flames .
this gate is inserted in the lofty wall ; which here appears to cross the river at right angles .
in a few moments , however , it is seen that the main body of the water still sweeps in a gentle and extensive curve to the left , the wall following it as before , while a stream of considerable volume , diverging from the principal one , makes its way , with a slight ripple , under the door , and is thus hidden from sight .
the canoe falls into the lesser channel and approaches the gate .
its ponderous wings are slowly and musically expanded .
the boat glides between them , and commences a rapid descent into a vast amphitheatre entirely <unk> with purple mountains , whose bases are <unk> by a gleaming river throughout the full extent of their circuit .
meantime the whole paradise of <unk> bursts upon the view .
there is a gush of <unk> <name> ; there is an oppressive sense of strange sweet odor ,  there is a dream  like <unk> to the eye of tall slender eastern trees  <unk> <unk>  flocks of golden and crimson birds  <unk> lakes  meadows of violets , tulips , poppies , hyacinths , and <unk>  long <unk> lines of silver <unk>  and , <unk> confusedly from amid all , a mass of <unk> , <unk> architecture sustaining itself by miracle in <unk> , glittering in the red sunlight with a hundred <unk> , <unk> , and pinnacles ; and seeming the phantom handiwork , conjointly , of the <unk> , of the fairies , of the genii and of the <unk> .
<unk> 's cottage a pendant to " the domain of <unk> " during a pedestrian trip last summer , through one or two of the river counties of new york , i found myself , as the day declined , somewhat embarrassed about the road i was pursuing .
the land <unk> very remarkably ; and my path , for the last hour , had wound about and about so confusedly , in its effort to keep in the valleys , that i no longer knew in what direction lay the sweet village of b , where i had determined to stop for the night .
the sun had scarcely shone  strictly speaking  during the day , which nevertheless , had been unpleasantly warm .
a smoky mist , resembling that of the indian summer , enveloped all things , and of course , added to my uncertainty .
not that i cared much about the matter .
if i did not hit upon the village before sunset , or even before dark , it was more than possible that a little dutch farmhouse , or something of that kind , would soon make its appearance  although , in fact , the neighborhood ( perhaps on account of being more picturesque than fertile ) was very <unk> inhabited .
at all events , with my knapsack for a pillow , and my hound as a sentry , a bivouac in the open air was just the thing which would have amused me .
i sauntered on , therefore , quite at ease  <unk> taking charge of my gun  until at length , just as i had begun to consider whether the numerous little <unk> that led hither and thither , were intended to be paths at all , i was conducted by one of them into an unquestionable carriage track .
there could be no mistaking it .
the traces of light wheels were evident ; and although the tall <unk> and overgrown undergrowth met overhead , there was no obstruction whatever below , even to the passage of a virginian mountain wagon  the most aspiring vehicle , i take it , of its kind .
the road , however , except in being open through the wood  if wood be not too weighty a name for such an assemblage of light trees  and except in the particulars of evident <unk>  bore no resemblance to any road i had before seen .
the tracks of which i speak were but faintly perceptible  having been impressed upon the firm , yet pleasantly moist surface of  what looked more like green genoese <name> than any thing else .
it was grass , clearly  but grass such as we seldom see out of england  so short , so thick , so even , and so vivid in color .
not a single impediment lay in the <unk>  not even a chip or dead twig .
the stones that once obstructed the way had been carefully placed  not <unk> the sides of the <name> , so as to define its boundaries at bottom with a kind of <unk> , <unk> , and wholly picturesque definition .
clumps of wild flowers grew everywhere , luxuriantly , in the interspaces .
what to make of all this , of course i knew not .
here was <name> undoubtedly  that did not surprise me  all roads , in the ordinary sense , are works of <name> ; nor can i say that there was much to wonder at in the mere excess of <name> manifested ; all that seemed to have been done , might have been done here  with such natural " <unk> " ( as they have it in the books on landscape gardening )  with very little labor and expense .
no ; it was not the amount but the character of the <name> which caused me to take a seat on one of the <unk> stones and gaze up and down this <name>  like avenue for half an hour or more in bewildered admiration .
one thing became more and more evident the longer i gazed : an artist , and one with a most scrupulous eye for form , had superintended all these arrangements .
the greatest care had been taken to preserve a due medium between the neat and graceful on the one hand , and the <unk> , in the true sense of the italian term , on the other .
there were few straight , and no long uninterrupted lines .
the same effect of curvature or of color appeared twice , usually , but not oftener , at any one point of view .
everywhere was variety in uniformity .
it was a piece of " composition , " in which the most <unk> critical taste could scarcely have suggested an <unk> .
i had turned to the right as i entered this road , and now , arising , i continued in the same direction .
the path was so serpentine , that at no moment could i trace its course for more than two or three paces in advance .
its character did not undergo any material change .
presently the murmur of water fell gently upon my ear  and in a few moments afterward , as i turned with the road somewhat more abruptly than hitherto , i became aware that a building of some kind lay at the foot of a gentle declivity just before me .
i could see nothing distinctly on account of the mist which occupied all the little valley below .
a gentle breeze , however , now arose , as the sun was about descending ; and while i remained standing on the brow of the slope , the fog gradually became dissipated into wreaths , and so floated over the scene .
as it came fully into view  thus gradually as i describe it  piece by piece , here a tree , there a glimpse of water , and here again the summit of a chimney , i could scarcely help <unk> that the whole was one of the ingenious illusions sometimes exhibited under the name of " vanishing pictures . "
by the time , however , that the fog had thoroughly disappeared , the sun had made its way down behind the gentle hills , and thence , as if with a slight <unk> to the south , had come again fully into sight , glaring with a purplish lustre through a chasm that entered the valley from the west .
suddenly , therefore  and as if by the hand of magic  this whole valley and every thing in it became brilliantly visible .
the first coup <unk> , as the sun slid into the position described , impressed me very much as i have been impressed , when a boy , by the concluding scene of some <unk> theatrical spectacle or <unk> .
not even the monstrosity of color was wanting ; for the sunlight came out through the chasm , tinted all orange and purple ; while the vivid green of the grass in the valley was reflected more or less upon all objects from the curtain of vapor that still <name> overhead , as if loth to take its total departure from a scene so <unk> beautiful .
the little vale into which i thus peered down from under the fog canopy could not have been more than four hundred yards long ; while in breadth it varied from fifty to one hundred and fifty or perhaps two hundred .
it was most narrow at its northern extremity , opening out as it tended <unk> , but with no very precise regularity .
the widest portion was within eighty yards of the southern extreme .
the slopes which encompassed the vale could not fairly be called hills , unless at their northern face .
here a precipitous ledge of granite arose to a height of some ninety feet ; and , as i have mentioned , the valley at this point was not more than fifty feet wide ; but as the visiter proceeded <unk> from the <name> , he found on his right hand and on his left , declivities at once less high , less precipitous , and less <name> .
all , in a word , sloped and softened to the south ; and yet the whole vale was <unk> by <unk> , more or less high , except at two points .
one of these i have already spoken of .
it lay considerably to the north of west , and was where the setting sun made its way , as i have before described , into the amphitheatre , through a cleanly cut natural cleft in the granite embankment ; this fissure might have been ten yards wide at its widest point , so far as the eye could trace it .
it seemed to lead up , up like a natural causeway , into the recesses of unexplored mountains and forests .
the other opening was directly at the southern end of the vale .
here , generally , the slopes were nothing more than gentle inclinations , extending from east to west about one hundred and fifty yards .
in the middle of this extent was a depression , level with the ordinary floor of the valley .
as regards vegetation , as well as in respect to every thing else , the scene softened and sloped to the south .
to the north  on the <unk> precipice  a few paces from the verge  up sprang the magnificent trunks of numerous <unk> , black walnuts , and chestnuts , interspersed with occasional oak , and the strong lateral branches thrown out by the walnuts especially , spread far over the edge of the <name> .
proceeding <unk> , the explorer saw , at first , the same class of trees , but less and less lofty and <unk> in character ; then he saw the gentler elm , succeeded by the <unk> and locust  these again by the softer <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <name>  these yet again by still more graceful and more modest varieties .
the whole face of the southern declivity was covered with wild shrubbery alone  an occasional silver <name> or white poplar excepted .
in the bottom of the valley itself  ( for it must be borne in mind that the vegetation hitherto mentioned grew only on the cliffs or hillsides )  were to be seen three insulated trees .
one was an elm of fine size and exquisite form : it stood guard over the southern gate of the vale .
another was a hickory , much larger than the elm , and altogether a much finer tree , although both were exceedingly beautiful : it seemed to have taken charge of the northwestern entrance , springing from a group of rocks in the very jaws of the ravine , and throwing its graceful body , at an <name> of nearly forty-five degrees , far out into the <name> of the amphitheatre .
about thirty yards east of this tree stood , however , the pride of the valley , and beyond all question the most magnificent tree i have ever seen , unless , perhaps , among the <unk> of the <unk> .
it was a triple  <unk> <unk>  the <unk> <unk>  one of the natural order of <unk> .
its three trunks separated from the parent at about three feet from the soil , and diverging very slightly and gradually , were not more than four feet apart at the point where the largest stem shot out into foliage : this was at an elevation of about eighty feet .
the whole height of the principal division was one hundred and twenty feet .
nothing can surpass in beauty the form , or the glossy , vivid green of the leaves of the <unk> .
in the present instance they were fully eight inches wide ; but their <name> was altogether <unk> by the gorgeous splendor of the profuse blossoms .
conceive , closely congregated , a million of the largest and most resplendent tulips !
only thus can the reader get any idea of the picture i would convey .
and then the stately <name> of the clean , delicately  <unk> columnar stems , the largest four feet in diameter , at twenty from the ground .
the innumerable blossoms , mingling with those of other trees scarcely less beautiful , although infinitely less majestic , filled the valley with more than arabian perfumes .
the general floor of the amphitheatre was grass of the same character as that i had found in the road ; if anything , more deliciously soft , thick , velvety , and miraculously green .
it was hard to conceive how all this beauty had been attained .
i have spoken of two openings into the vale .
from the one to the northwest issued a rivulet , which came , gently murmuring and slightly foaming , down the ravine , until it dashed against the group of rocks out of which sprang the insulated hickory .
here , after encircling the tree , it passed on a little to the north of east , leaving the <unk> tree some twenty feet to the south , and making no decided alteration in its course until it came near the midway between the eastern and western boundaries of the valley .
at this point , after a series of sweeps , it turned off at right angles and pursued a generally southern direction meandering as it went  until it became lost in a small lake of irregular figure ( although roughly oval ) , that lay gleaming near the lower extremity of the vale .
this <unk> was , perhaps , a hundred yards in diameter at its widest part .
no <name> could be clearer than its waters .
its bottom , which could be distinctly seen , consisted altogether , of pebbles brilliantly white .
its banks , of the <name> grass already described , rounded , rather than sloped , off into the clear heaven below ; and so clear was this heaven , so perfectly , at times , did it reflect all objects above it , that where the true bank ended and where the mimic one commenced , it was a point of no little difficulty to determine .
the trout , and some other varieties of fish , with which this pond seemed to be almost <unk> crowded , had all the appearance of veritable flying-fish .
it was almost impossible to believe that they were not absolutely suspended in the air .
a light birch canoe that lay placidly on the water , was reflected in its minutest fibres with a fidelity <unk> by the most exquisitely polished mirror .
a small island , fairly laughing with flowers in full bloom , and affording little more space than just enough for a picturesque little building , seemingly a <unk>  arose from the lake not far from its northern shore  to which it was connected by means of an inconceivably light  looking and yet very primitive bridge .
it was formed of a single , broad and thick plank of the <unk> wood .
this was forty feet long , and spanned the interval between shore and shore with a slight but very perceptible arch , preventing all oscillation .
from the southern extreme of the lake issued a continuation of the rivulet , which , after meandering for , perhaps , thirty yards , finally passed through the " depression " ( already described ) in the middle of the southern declivity , and tumbling down a sheer precipice of a hundred feet , made its devious and unnoticed way to the hudson .
the lake was deep  at some points thirty feet  but the rivulet seldom exceeded three , while its greatest width was about eight .
its bottom and banks were as those of the pond  if a defect could have been attributed , in point of picturesqueness , it was that of excessive neatness .
the expanse of the green turf was relieved , here and there , by an occasional showy shrub , such as the <unk> , or the common snowball , or the <unk> <unk> ; or , more frequently , by a clump of geraniums <unk> gorgeously in great varieties .
these latter grew in pots which were carefully buried in the soil , so as to give the plants the appearance of being indigenous .
besides all this , the lawn 's <name> was exquisitely spotted with sheep  a considerable flock of which roamed about the vale , in company with three tamed deer , and a vast number of brilliantly  plumed ducks .
a very large mastiff seemed to be in vigilant attendance upon these animals , each and all .
along the eastern and western cliffs  where , toward the upper portion of the amphitheatre , the boundaries were more or less precipitous  grew <name> in great profusion  so that only here and there could even a glimpse of the naked rock be obtained .
the northern precipice , in like manner , was almost entirely clothed by <unk> of rare luxuriance ; some springing from the soil at the base of the <name> , and others from ledges on its face .
the slight elevation which formed the lower boundary of this little domain , was crowned by a neat stone wall , of sufficient height to prevent the escape of the deer .
nothing of the fence kind was observable elsewhere ; for nowhere else was an artificial enclosure needed :  any stray sheep , for example , which should attempt to make its way out of the vale by means of the ravine , would find its progress arrested , after a few yards ' advance , by the precipitous ledge of rock over which tumbled the cascade that had arrested my attention as i first <name> near the domain .
in short , the only ingress or egress was through a gate occupying a <name> pass in the road , a few paces below the point at which i stopped to reconnoitre the scene .
i have described the <name> as meandering very irregularly through the whole of its course .
its two general directions , as i have said , were first from west to east , and then from north to south .
at the turn , the stream , sweeping backward , made an almost circular loop , so as to form a peninsula which was very nearly an island , and which included about the sixteenth of an acre .
on this peninsula stood a <unk>  and when i say that this house , like the infernal terrace seen by <unk> , " <unk> <unk> architecture <unk> dans <name> annales de la terre , " i mean , merely , that its tout <unk> struck me with the keenest sense of combined novelty and propriety  in a word , of poetry  ( for , than in the words just employed , i could scarcely give , of poetry in the abstract , a more rigorous definition )  and i do not mean that merely <unk> was perceptible in any respect .
in fact nothing could well be more simple  more utterly unpretending than this cottage .
its marvellous effect lay altogether in its artistic arrangement as a picture .
i could have fancied , while i looked at it , that some eminent <unk> had built it with his brush .
the point of view from which i first saw the valley , was not altogether , although it was nearly , the best point from which to survey the house .
i <name> therefore describe it as i afterwards saw it  from a position on the stone wall at the southern extreme of the amphitheatre .
the main building was about twenty-four feet long and sixteen broad  certainly not more .
its total height , from the ground to the apex of the roof , could not have exceeded eighteen feet .
to the west end of this structure was attached one about a third smaller in all its proportions :  the line of its front standing back about two yards from that of the larger house , and the line of its roof , of course , being considerably depressed below that of the roof adjoining .
at right angles to these buildings , and from the rear of the main one  not exactly in the middle  extended a third compartment , very small  being , in general , one-third less than the western wing .
the roofs of the two larger were very steep  sweeping down from the <unk> with a long concave curve , and extending at least four feet beyond the walls in front , so as to form the roofs of two <unk> .
these latter roofs , of course , needed no support ; but as they had the air of needing it , slight and perfectly plain pillars were inserted at the corners alone .
the roof of the northern wing was merely an extension of a portion of the main roof .
between the chief building and western wing arose a very tall and rather slender square chimney of hard dutch bricks , alternately black and red :  a slight cornice of projecting bricks at the top .
over the <unk> the roofs also projected very much :  in the main building about four feet to the east and two to the west .
the principal door was not exactly in the main division , being a little to the east  while the two windows were to the west .
these latter did not extend to the floor , but were much longer and narrower than usual  they had single shutters like doors  the panes were of <unk> form , but quite large .
the door itself had its upper half of glass , also in <unk> panes  a movable shutter secured it at night .
the door to the west wing was in its gable , and quite simple  a single window looked out to the south .
there was no external door to the north wing , and it also had only one window to the east .
the blank wall of the eastern gable was relieved by stairs ( with a balustrade ) running diagonally across it  the ascent being from the south .
under cover of the widely projecting <unk> these steps gave access to a door leading to the <name> , or rather loft  for it was lighted only by a single window to the north , and seemed to have been intended as a <unk> .
the <unk> of the main building and western wing had no floors , as is usual ; but at the doors and at each window , large , flat irregular slabs of granite lay imbedded in the delicious turf , affording comfortable footing in all weather .
excellent paths of the same material  not nicely adapted , but with the velvety sod filling frequent intervals between the stones , led hither and thither from the house , to a <name> spring about five paces off , to the road , or to one or two out  houses that lay to the north , beyond the <name> , and were thoroughly concealed by a few locusts and <unk> .
not more than six steps from the main door of the cottage stood the dead trunk of a fantastic <unk> , so clothed from head to foot in the gorgeous bignonia blossoms that one required no little scrutiny to determine what manner of sweet thing it could be .
from various arms of this tree <name> cages of different kinds .
in one , a large wicker cylinder with a ring at top , revelled a mocking bird ; in another an <unk> ; in a third the impudent <unk>  while three or four more delicate prisons were loudly vocal with canaries .
the pillars of the piazza were <unk> in <name> and sweet honeysuckle ; while from the <name> formed by the main structure and its west wing , in front , sprang a <unk> of <unk> luxuriance .
<unk> all restraint , it had clambered first to the lower roof  then to the higher ; and along the ridge of this latter it continued to writhe on , throwing out tendrils to the right and left , until at length it fairly attained the east gable , and fell trailing over the stairs .
the whole house , with its wings , was constructed of the old-fashioned dutch shingles  broad , and with <unk> corners .
it is a peculiarity of this material to give houses built of it the appearance of being wider at bottom than at top  after the manner of egyptian architecture ; and in the present instance , this exceedingly picturesque effect was aided by numerous pots of gorgeous flowers that almost encompassed the base of the buildings .
the shingles were painted a dull gray ; and the happiness with which this neutral tint melted into the vivid green of the <unk> tree leaves that partially overshadowed the cottage , can readily be conceived by an artist .
from the position near the stone wall , as described , the buildings were seen at great advantage  for the southeastern <name> was thrown forward  so that the eye took in at once the whole of the two fronts , with the picturesque eastern gable , and at the same time obtained just a sufficient glimpse of the northern wing , with parts of a pretty roof to the <unk> , and nearly half of a light bridge that spanned the <name> in the near vicinity of the main buildings .
i did not remain very long on the brow of the hill , although long enough to make a thorough survey of the scene at my feet .
it was clear that i had wandered from the road to the village , and i had thus good traveller 's excuse to open the gate before me , and inquire my way , at all events ; so , without more ado , i proceeded .
the road , after passing the gate , seemed to lie upon a natural ledge , sloping gradually down along the face of the <unk> cliffs .
it led me on to the foot of the northern precipice , and thence over the bridge , round by the eastern gable to the front door .
in this progress , i took notice that no sight of the <unk> could be obtained .
as i turned the corner of the gable , the mastiff bounded towards me in stern silence , but with the eye and the whole air of a tiger .
i held him out my hand , however , in token of amity  and i never yet knew the dog who was proof against such an appeal to his courtesy .
he not only shut his mouth and wagged his tail , but absolutely offered me his <unk> extending his <unk> to <unk> .
as no <name> was discernible , i rapped with my stick against the door , which stood half open .
instantly a figure advanced to the threshold  that of a young woman about twenty-eight years of age  slender , or rather slight , and somewhat above the medium height .
as she approached , with a certain modest decision of step altogether indescribable .
i said to myself , " surely here i have found the perfection of natural , in <unk> from artificial <name> . "
the second impression which she made on me , but by far the more vivid of the two , was that of enthusiasm .
so intense an expression of romance , perhaps i should call it , or of <unk> , as that which gleamed from her <unk> eyes , had never so sunk into my heart of hearts before .
i know not how it is , but this peculiar expression of the eye , <unk> itself occasionally into the lips , is the most powerful , if not absolutely the sole spell , which rivets my interest in woman .
" romance , provided my readers fully comprehended what i would here imply by the word  " romance " and " <unk> " seem to me <unk> terms : and , after all , what man truly loves in woman , is simply her womanhood .
the eyes of <name> ( i heard some one from the interior call her " <name> , darling ! " )
were " spiritual grey ; " her hair , a light chestnut : this is all i had time to observe of her .
at her most courteous of invitations , i entered  passing first into a tolerably wide vestibule .
having come mainly to observe , i took notice that to my right as i stepped in , was a window , such as those in front of the house ; to the left , a door leading into the principal room ; while , opposite me , an open door enabled me to see a small apartment , just the size of the vestibule , arranged as a study , and having a large bow window looking out to the north .
passing into the parlor , i found myself with mr. <unk>  for this , i afterwards found , was his name .
he was civil , even cordial in his manner , but just then , i was more intent on observing the arrangements of the dwelling which had so much interested me , than the personal appearance of the tenant .
the north wing , i now saw , was a bed-chamber , its door opened into the parlor .
west of this door was a single window , looking toward the <name> .
at the west end of the parlor , were a fireplace , and a door leading into the west wing  probably a kitchen .
nothing could be more rigorously simple than the furniture of the parlor .
on the floor was an <unk> carpet , of excellent texture  a white ground , spotted with small circular green figures .
at the windows were curtains of snowy white <unk> muslin : they were tolerably full , and <name> <unk> , perhaps rather formally in sharp , parallel <unk> to the floor  just to the floor .
the walls were prepared with a french paper of great delicacy , a silver ground , with a faint green cord running <unk> throughout .
its expanse was relieved merely by three of <unk> 's exquisite <unk> a <unk> <unk> , fastened to the wall without frames .
one of these drawings was a scene of oriental luxury , or rather <unk> ; another was a " carnival piece , " spirited beyond compare ; the third was a greek female head  a face so divinely beautiful , and yet of an expression so <unk> indeterminate , never before arrested my attention .
the more substantial furniture consisted of a round table , a few chairs ( including a large rocking-chair ) , and a sofa , or rather " settee ; " its material was plain <name> painted a creamy white , slightly <unk> with green ; the seat of cane .
the chairs and table were " to match , " but the forms of all had evidently been designed by the same <name> which planned " the grounds ; " it is impossible to conceive anything more graceful .
on the table were a few books , a large , square , <name> bottle of some novel perfume , a plain ground  glass <unk> ( not solar ) lamp with an italian shade , and a large vase of <unk> flowers .
flowers , indeed , of gorgeous colours and delicate odour formed the sole mere decoration of the apartment .
the fire-place was nearly filled with a vase of brilliant geranium .
on a triangular shelf in each <name> of the room stood also a similar vase , varied only as to its lovely contents .
one or two smaller bouquets adorned the mantel , and late violets clustered about the open windows .
it is not the purpose of this work to do more than give in detail , a picture of mr. <unk> 's residence  as i found it .
how he made it what it was  and why  with some particulars of mr. <unk> himself  may , possibly form the subject of another article .
<name> <name> what say of it ?
what say of conscience grim , that spectre in my path ?
<unk> 's <unk> let me call myself , for the present , <name> <name> .
the fair <name> now lying before me need not be <unk> with my real appellation .
this has been already too much an object for the scorn  for the horror  for the detestation of my race .
to the uttermost regions of the globe have not the indignant winds <unk> its unparalleled infamy ?
oh , outcast of all outcasts most abandoned !  to the earth <name> thou not forever dead ?
to its honors , to its flowers , to its golden aspirations ?  and a cloud , dense , dismal , and limitless , does it not <name> eternally between thy hopes and heaven ?
i would not , if i could , here or to-day , embody a record of my later years of unspeakable misery , and unpardonable crime .
this epoch  these later years  took unto themselves a sudden elevation in <unk> , whose origin alone it is my present purpose to assign .
men usually grow base by degrees .
from me , in an instant , all virtue dropped bodily as a mantle .
from comparatively trivial wickedness i passed , with the stride of a giant , into more than the <unk> of an <unk> .
what chance  what one event brought this evil thing to pass , bear with me while i relate .
death approaches ; and the shadow which <unk> him has thrown a softening influence over my spirit .
i long , in passing through the dim valley , for the sympathy  i had nearly said for the pity  of my fellow men .
i would fain have them believe that i have been , in some measure , the slave of circumstances beyond human control .
i would wish them to seek out for me , in the details i am about to give , some little oasis of <unk> amid a wilderness of error .
i would have them allow  what they can not refrain from allowing  that , although temptation may have <unk> existed as great , man was never thus , at least , tempted before  certainly , never thus fell .
and is it therefore that he has never thus suffered ?
have i not indeed been living in a dream ?
and am i not now dying a victim to the horror and the mystery of the wildest of all <unk> visions ?
i am the descendant of a race whose imaginative and easily excitable temperament has at all times rendered them remarkable ; and , in my earliest infancy , i gave evidence of having fully inherited the family character .
as i advanced in years it was more strongly developed ; becoming , for many reasons , a cause of serious <unk> to my friends , and of positive injury to myself .
i grew <unk> , addicted to the wildest caprices , and a prey to the most ungovernable passions .
weak-minded , and beset with constitutional infirmities akin to my own , my parents could do but little to check the evil propensities which distinguished me .
some feeble and <unk> efforts resulted in complete failure on their part , and , of course , in total triumph on mine .
thenceforward my voice was a household law ; and at an age when few children have abandoned their <unk> , i was left to the guidance of my own <name> , and became , in all but name , the master of my own actions .
my earliest recollections of a <unk> , are connected with a large , rambling , elizabethan house , in a <unk> village of england , where were a vast number of gigantic and gnarled trees , and where all the houses were excessively ancient .
in truth , it was a <unk> and <unk> place , that venerable old town .
at this moment , in fancy , i feel the refreshing <unk> of its <unk> avenues , <unk> the fragrance of its thousand <unk> , and thrill anew with <unk> delight , at the deep hollow note of the <unk> , breaking , each hour , with sullen and sudden roar , upon the stillness of the dusky atmosphere in which the fretted gothic steeple lay imbedded and asleep .
it gives me , perhaps , as much of pleasure as i can now in any manner experience , to dwell upon minute recollections of the school and its concerns .
steeped in misery as i am  misery , alas !
only too real  i shall be pardoned for seeking relief , however slight and temporary , in the weakness of a few rambling details .
these , moreover , utterly trivial , and even ridiculous in themselves , assume , to my fancy , <unk> importance , as connected with a period and a locality when and where i recognise the first <unk> <unk> of the <name> which afterwards so fully overshadowed me .
let me then remember .
the house , i have said , was old and irregular .
the grounds were extensive , and a high and solid brick wall , topped with a bed of mortar and broken glass , encompassed the whole .
this <unk> rampart formed the limit of our domain ; beyond it we saw but thrice a week  once every saturday afternoon , when , attended by two ushers , we were permitted to take brief walks in a body through some of the neighbouring fields  and twice during <name> , when we were paraded in the same formal manner to the morning and evening service in the one church of the village .
of this church the principal of our school was pastor .
with how deep a spirit of wonder and perplexity was i wont to regard him from our remote pew in the gallery , as , with step solemn and slow , he ascended the pulpit !
this reverend man , with countenance so demurely benign , with robes so glossy and so <unk> flowing , with wig so minutely powdered , so rigid and so vast ,  could this be he who , of late , with sour visage , and in <unk> <unk> , administered , <unk> in hand , the <unk> laws of the academy ?
oh , gigantic paradox , too utterly monstrous for solution !
at an <name> of the ponderous wall frowned a more ponderous gate .
it was riveted and studded with iron bolts , and surmounted with jagged iron spikes .
what impressions of deep awe did it inspire !
it was never opened save for the three periodical <unk> and <unk> already mentioned ; then , in every creak of its mighty hinges , we found a <unk> of mystery  a world of matter for solemn remark , or for more solemn meditation .
the extensive enclosure was irregular in form , having many capacious recesses .
of these , three or four of the largest constituted the <unk> .
it was level , and covered with fine hard gravel .
i well remember it had no trees , nor benches , nor anything similar within it .
of course it was in the rear of the house .
in front lay a small <unk> , planted with box and other shrubs ; but through this sacred division we passed only upon rare occasions indeed  such as a first advent to school or final departure thence , or perhaps , when a parent or friend having called for us , we joyfully took our way home for the christmas or midsummer <unk> .
but the house !  how quaint an old building was this !  to me how <unk> a palace of enchantment !
there was really no end to its windings  to its incomprehensible subdivisions .
it was difficult , at any given time , to say with certainty upon which of its two stories one happened to be .
from each room to every other there were sure to be found three or four steps either in ascent or descent .
then the lateral branches were innumerable  inconceivable  and so returning in upon themselves , that our most exact ideas in regard to the whole mansion were not very far different from those with which we pondered upon infinity .
during the five years of my residence here , i was never able to ascertain with precision , in what remote locality lay the little sleeping apartment assigned to myself and some eighteen or twenty other scholars .
the school-room was the largest in the house  i could not help thinking , in the world .
it was very long , narrow , and dismally low , with pointed gothic windows and a ceiling of oak .
in a remote and <unk> <name> was a square enclosure of eight or ten feet , comprising the sanctum , " during hours , " of our principal , the reverend dr. <unk> .
it was a solid structure , with massy door , sooner than open which in the absence of the " <name> , " we would all have willingly perished by the <unk> <unk> et <unk> .
in other angles were two other similar boxes , far less <unk> , indeed , but still greatly matters of awe .
one of these was the pulpit of the " classical " usher , one of the " english and mathematical . "
interspersed about the room , crossing and <unk> in endless irregularity , were innumerable benches and desks , black , ancient , and <unk> , piled desperately with <unk> books , and so <unk> with initial letters , names at full length , grotesque figures , and other multiplied efforts of the knife , as to have entirely lost what little of original form might have been their portion in days long departed .
a huge bucket with water stood at one extremity of the room , and a clock of stupendous dimensions at the other .
encompassed by the massy walls of this venerable academy , i passed , yet not in <unk> or disgust , the years of the third <unk> of my life .
the teeming <name> of childhood requires no external world of incident to occupy or amuse it ; and the apparently dismal monotony of a school was replete with more intense excitement than my <unk> youth has derived from luxury , or my full manhood from crime .
yet i must believe that my first mental development had in it much of the uncommon  even much of the <unk> .
upon mankind at large the events of very early existence rarely leave in mature age any definite impression .
all is gray shadow  a weak and irregular remembrance  an indistinct <unk> of feeble pleasures and <unk> pains .
with me this is not so .
in childhood i must have felt with the energy of a man what i now find stamped upon memory in lines as vivid , as deep , and as <unk> as the <unk> of the carthaginian medals .
yet in fact  in the fact of the world 's view  how little was there to remember !
the morning 's awakening , the nightly summons to bed ; the <unk> , the recitations ; the periodical <unk> , and <unk> ; the <unk> , with its <unk> , its <unk> , its intrigues ;  these , by a mental sorcery long forgotten , were made to involve a wilderness of sensation , a world of <name> incident , an universe of varied emotion , of excitement the most passionate and <unk> .
" oh , <name> bon <unk> , que ce <unk> de fer ! "
in truth , the ardor , the enthusiasm , and the <unk> of my disposition , soon rendered me a marked character among my schoolmates , and by slow , but natural gradations , gave me an ascendancy over all not greatly older than myself ;  over all with a single exception .
this exception was found in the person of a scholar , who , although no relation , bore the same <name> and <unk> as myself ;  a circumstance , in fact , little remarkable ; for , notwithstanding a <name> descent , mine was one of those everyday <unk> which seem , by <unk> right , to have been , time out of mind , the common property of the mob .
in this narrative i have therefore designated myself as <name> <name> ,  a fictitious title not very dissimilar to the real .
my namesake alone , of those who in school phraseology constituted " our set , " presumed to compete with me in the studies of the class  in the sports and <unk> of the <unk>  to refuse implicit belief in my assertions , and submission to my <name>  indeed , to interfere with my arbitrary dictation in any respect whatsoever .
if there is on earth a supreme and unqualified despotism , it is the despotism of a master mind in boyhood over the less energetic spirits of its companions .
<name> 's rebellion was to me a source of the greatest embarrassment ;  the more so as , in spite of the bravado with which in public i made a point of treating him and his pretensions , i secretly felt that i feared him , and could not help thinking the equality which he maintained so easily with myself , a proof of his true superiority ; since not to be overcome cost me a perpetual struggle .
yet this superiority  even this equality  was in truth acknowledged by no one but myself ; our associates , by some unaccountable blindness , seemed not even to suspect it .
indeed , his competition , his resistance , and especially his impertinent and dogged interference with my purposes , were not more pointed than private .
he appeared to be destitute alike of the ambition which urged , and of the passionate energy of mind which enabled me to excel .
in his rivalry he might have been supposed actuated solely by a whimsical <name> to thwart , astonish , or <unk> myself ; although there were times when i could not help observing , with a feeling made up of wonder , <unk> , and pique , that he mingled with his injuries , his insults , or his contradictions , a certain most inappropriate , and assuredly most unwelcome <unk> of manner .
i could only conceive this singular behavior to arise from a consummate <unk> assuming the vulgar airs of patronage and protection .
perhaps it was this latter trait in <name> 's conduct , conjoined with our identity of name , and the mere accident of our having entered the school upon the same day , which set afloat the notion that we were brothers , among the senior classes in the academy .
these do not usually inquire with much strictness into the affairs of their juniors .
i have before said , or should have said , that <name> was not , in the most remote degree , connected with my family .
but assuredly if we had been brothers we must have been twins ; for , after leaving dr. <unk> 's , i casually learned that my namesake was born on the nineteenth of <name> , 1813  and this is a somewhat remarkable coincidence ; for the day is precisely that of my own nativity .
it may seem strange that in spite of the continual anxiety occasioned me by the rivalry of <name> , and his intolerable spirit of contradiction , i could not bring myself to hate him altogether .
we had , to be sure , nearly every day a quarrel in which , yielding me publicly the palm of victory , he , in some manner , contrived to make me feel that it was he who had deserved it ; yet a sense of pride on my part , and a veritable dignity on his own , kept us always upon what are called " speaking terms , " while there were many points of strong <unk> in our tempers , operating to awake me in a sentiment which our position alone , perhaps , prevented from ripening into friendship .
it is difficult , indeed , to define , or even to describe , my real feelings towards him .
they formed a motley and heterogeneous <unk> ;  some <unk> animosity , which was not yet hatred , some esteem , more respect , much fear , with a world of uneasy curiosity .
to the <unk> it <name> be unnecessary to say , in addition , that <name> and myself were the most inseparable of companions .
it was no doubt the anomalous state of affairs existing between us , which turned all my attacks upon him , ( and they were many , either open or covert ) into the channel of banter or practical joke ( giving pain while assuming the aspect of mere fun ) rather than into a more serious and determined hostility .
but my endeavours on this head were by no means uniformly successful , even when my plans were the most <unk> concocted ; for my namesake had much about him , in character , of that unassuming and quiet <unk> which , while enjoying the <unk> of its own jokes , has no heel of achilles in itself , and absolutely refuses to be laughed at .
i could find , indeed , but one vulnerable point , and that , lying in a personal peculiarity , arising , perhaps , from constitutional disease , would have been spared by any antagonist less at his wit 's end than myself ;  my rival had a weakness in the <unk> or guttural organs , which <unk> him from raising his voice at any time above a very low whisper .
of this defect i did not fall to take what poor advantage lay in my power .
<name> 's <unk> in kind were many ; and there was one form of his practical wit that disturbed me beyond measure .
how his sagacity first discovered at all that so petty a thing would vex me , is a question i never could solve ; but , having discovered , he habitually practised the annoyance .
i had always felt aversion to my <unk> <unk> , and its very common , if not plebeian <unk> .
the words were venom in my ears ; and when , upon the day of my arrival , a second <name> <name> came also to the academy , i felt angry with him for bearing the name , and doubly disgusted with the name because a stranger bore it , who would be the cause of its twofold repetition , who would be constantly in my presence , and whose concerns , in the ordinary routine of the school business , must inevitably , on account of the detestable coincidence , be often confounded with my own .
the feeling of vexation thus engendered grew stronger with every circumstance tending to show resemblance , moral or physical , between my rival and myself .
i had not then discovered the remarkable fact that we were of the same age ; but i saw that we were of the same height , and i perceived that we were even singularly alike in general contour of person and outline of feature .
i was galled , too , by the rumor touching a relationship , which had grown current in the upper forms .
in a word , nothing could more seriously disturb me , ( although i scrupulously concealed such disturbance , ) than any allusion to a similarity of mind , person , or condition existing between us .
but , in truth , i had no reason to believe that ( with the exception of the matter of relationship , and in the case of <name> himself , ) this similarity had ever been made a subject of comment , or even observed at all by our <unk> .
that he observed it in all its bearings , and as fixedly as i , was apparent ; but that he could discover in such circumstances so fruitful a field of annoyance , can only be attributed , as i said before , to his more than ordinary penetration .
his cue , which was to perfect an imitation of myself , lay both in words and in actions ; and most admirably did he play his part .
my dress it was an easy matter to copy ; my gait and general manner were , without difficulty , appropriated ; in spite of his constitutional defect , even my voice did not escape him .
my louder tones were , of course , <unk> , but then the key , it was identical ; and his singular whisper , it grew the very <name> of my own .
how greatly this most exquisite <unk> harassed me , ( for it could not justly be termed a caricature , ) i <name> not now venture to describe .
i had but one consolation  in the fact that the imitation , apparently , was noticed by myself alone , and that i had to endure only the knowing and strangely sarcastic smiles of my namesake himself .
satisfied with having produced in my bosom the intended effect , he seemed to chuckle in secret over the sting he had inflicted , and was characteristically <unk> of the public applause which the success of his witty endeavours might have so easily elicited .
that the school , indeed , did not feel his design , perceive its accomplishment , and participate in his sneer , was , for many anxious months , a riddle i could not resolve .
perhaps the gradation of his copy rendered it not so readily perceptible ; or , more possibly , i owed my security to the master air of the <unk> , who , <unk> the letter , ( which in a painting is all the obtuse can see , ) gave but the full spirit of his original for my individual contemplation and chagrin .
i have already more than once spoken of the disgusting air of patronage which he assumed toward me , and of his frequent <unk> interference with my <name> .
this interference often took the <unk> character of advice ; advice not openly given , but hinted or <unk> .
i received it with a repugnance which gained strength as i grew in years .
yet , at this distant day , let me do him the simple justice to acknowledge that i can recall no occasion when the suggestions of my rival were on the side of those errors or follies so usual to his immature age and seeming inexperience ; that his moral sense , at least , if not his general talents and worldly wisdom , was far keener than my own ; and that i might , to-day , have been a better , and thus a happier man , had i less frequently rejected the counsels embodied in those meaning whispers which i then but too cordially hated and too bitterly despised .
as it was , i at length grew restive in the extreme under his distasteful supervision , and daily resented more and more openly what i considered his intolerable arrogance .
i have said that , in the first years of our connexion as schoolmates , my feelings in regard to him might have been easily ripened into friendship : but , in the latter months of my residence at the academy , although the intrusion of his ordinary manner had , beyond doubt , in some measure , abated , my sentiments , in nearly similar proportion , partook very much of positive hatred .
upon one occasion he saw this , i think , and afterwards avoided , or made a show of avoiding me .
it was about the same period , if i remember aright , that , in an altercation of violence with him , in which he was more than usually thrown off his guard , and spoke and acted with an <unk> of demeanor rather foreign to his nature , i discovered , or fancied i discovered , in his accent , his air , and general appearance , a something which first startled , and then deeply interested me , by bringing to mind dim visions of my earliest infancy  wild , confused and thronging memories of a time when memory herself was yet unborn .
i can not better describe the sensation which oppressed me than by saying that i could with difficulty shake off the belief of my having been acquainted with the being who stood before me , at some epoch very long ago  some point of the past even infinitely remote .
the delusion , however , faded rapidly as it came ; and i mention it at all but to define the day of the last conversation i there held with my singular namesake .
the huge old house , with its countless subdivisions , had several large chambers communicating with each other , where slept the greater number of the students .
there were , however , ( as must necessarily happen in a building so awkwardly planned , ) many little nooks or recesses , the odds and ends of the structure ; and these the economic ingenuity of dr. <unk> had also fitted up as dormitories ; although , being the merest closets , they were capable of accommodating but a single individual .
one of these small apartments was occupied by <name> .
one night , about the close of my fifth year at the school , and immediately after the altercation just mentioned , finding every one wrapped in sleep , i arose from bed , and , lamp in hand , stole through a wilderness of narrow passages from my own bedroom to that of my rival .
i had long been plotting one of those ill-natured pieces of practical wit at his expense in which i had hitherto been so uniformly unsuccessful .
it was my intention , now , to put my scheme in operation , and i resolved to make him feel the whole extent of the malice with which i was imbued .
having reached his closet , i noiselessly entered , leaving the lamp , with a shade over it , on the outside .
i advanced a step , and listened to the sound of his tranquil breathing .
assured of his being asleep , i returned , took the light , and with it again approached the bed .
close curtains were around it , which , in the prosecution of my plan , i slowly and quietly withdrew , when the bright rays fell vividly upon the sleeper , and my eyes , at the same moment , upon his countenance .
i looked ;  and a <unk> , an <unk> of feeling instantly pervaded my frame .
my breast heaved , my knees tottered , my whole spirit became possessed with an <unk> yet intolerable horror .
gasping for breath , i lowered the lamp in still nearer proximity to the face .
were these  these the <unk> of <name> <name> ?
i saw , indeed , that they were his , but i shook as if with a fit of the ague in <unk> they were not .
what was there about them to confound me in this manner ?
i gazed ;  while my <name> reeled with a multitude of incoherent thoughts .
not thus he appeared  assuredly not thus  in the vivacity of his waking hours .
the same name !
the same contour of person !
the same day of arrival at the academy !
and then his dogged and meaningless imitation of my gait , my voice , my habits , and my manner !
was it , in truth , within the bounds of human possibility , that what i now saw was the result , merely , of the habitual practice of this sarcastic imitation ?
awe-stricken , and with a creeping shudder , i extinguished the lamp , passed silently from the chamber , and left , at once , the halls of that old academy , never to enter them again .
after a lapse of some months , spent at home in mere idleness , i found myself a student at eton .
the brief interval had been sufficient to <unk> my remembrance of the events at dr. <unk> 's , or at least to effect a material change in the nature of the feelings with which i remembered them .
the truth  the tragedy  of the drama was no more .
i could now find room to doubt the evidence of my senses ; and seldom called up the subject at all but with wonder at extent of human credulity , and a smile at the vivid force of the imagination which i <unk> possessed .
neither was this species of <unk> likely to be diminished by the character of the life i led at eton .
the vortex of thoughtless folly into which i there so immediately and so recklessly plunged , washed away all but the froth of my past hours , engulfed at once every solid or serious impression , and left to memory only the veriest <unk> of a former existence .
i do not wish , however , to trace the course of my miserable profligacy here  a profligacy which set at defiance the laws , while it eluded the vigilance of the institution .
three years of folly , passed without profit , had but given me rooted habits of vice , and added , in a somewhat unusual degree , to my bodily stature , when , after a week of <unk> dissipation , i invited a small party of the most dissolute students to a secret <unk> in my chambers .
we met at a late hour of the night ; for our <unk> were to be faithfully protracted until morning .
the wine flowed freely , and there were not wanting other and perhaps more dangerous <unk> ; so that the gray <name> had already faintly appeared in the east , while our delirious extravagance was at its height .
madly flushed with cards and intoxication , i was in the act of insisting upon a toast of more than wonted profanity , when my attention was suddenly diverted by the violent , although partial <unk> of the door of the apartment , and by the eager voice of a servant from without .
he said that some person , apparently in great haste , demanded to speak with me in the hall .
wildly excited with wine , the unexpected interruption rather delighted than surprised me .
i staggered forward at once , and a few steps brought me to the vestibule of the building .
in this low and small room there <name> no lamp ; and now no light at all was admitted , save that of the exceedingly feeble <name> which made its way through the <unk> window .
as i put my foot over the threshold , i became aware of the figure of a youth about my own height , and <unk> in a white <unk> morning frock , cut in the novel fashion of the one i myself wore at the moment .
this the faint light enabled me to perceive ; but the features of his face i could not distinguish .
upon my entering he strode hurriedly up to me , and , seizing me by the arm with a gesture of <unk> impatience , whispered the words " <name> <name> ! "
in my ear .
i grew perfectly sober in an instant .
there was that in the manner of the stranger , and in the tremulous shake of his uplifted finger , as he held it between my eyes and the light , which filled me with unqualified amazement ; but it was not this which had so violently moved me .
it was the <unk> of solemn admonition in the singular , low , hissing utterance ; and , above all , it was the character , the tone , the key , of those few , simple , and familiar , yet whispered syllables , which came with a thousand thronging memories of bygone days , and struck upon my soul with the shock of a galvanic battery .
ere i could recover the use of my senses he was gone .
although this event failed not of a vivid effect upon my disordered imagination , yet was it evanescent as vivid .
for some weeks , indeed , i busied myself in <name> inquiry , or was wrapped in a cloud of morbid speculation .
i did not pretend to disguise from my perception the identity of the singular individual who thus perseveringly interfered with my affairs , and harassed me with his <unk> counsel .
but who and what was this <name> ?  and whence came he ?  and what were his purposes ?
upon neither of these points could i be satisfied ; merely ascertaining , in regard to him , that a sudden accident in his family had caused his removal from dr. <unk> 's academy on the afternoon of the day in which i myself had <unk> .
but in a brief period i ceased to think upon the subject ; my attention being all absorbed in a contemplated departure for oxford .
thither i soon went ; the <unk> vanity of my parents furnishing me with an outfit and annual establishment , which would enable me to indulge at <name> in the luxury already so dear to my heart ,  to vie in <unk> of expenditure with the <unk> heirs of the <unk> <unk> in great britain .
excited by such appliances to vice , my constitutional temperament broke forth with redoubled ardor , and i spurned even the common restraints of decency in the mad infatuation of my revels .
but it were absurd to pause in the detail of my extravagance .
let it suffice , that among <unk> i <unk> herod , and that , giving name to a multitude of novel follies , i added no brief appendix to the long catalogue of vices then usual in the most dissolute university of europe .
it could hardly be credited , however , that i had , even here , so utterly fallen from the gentlemanly estate , as to seek acquaintance with the <unk> arts of the gambler by profession , and , having become an <unk> in his despicable science , to practise it habitually as a means of increasing my already enormous income at the expense of the weak-minded among my <unk> .
such , nevertheless , was the fact .
and the very enormity of this offence against all manly and honourable sentiment proved , beyond doubt , the main if not the sole reason of the impunity with which it was committed .
who , indeed , among my most abandoned associates , would not rather have disputed the clearest evidence of his senses , than have suspected of such courses , the <name> , the <name> , the generous <name> <name>  the noblest and most liberal commoner at oxford  him whose follies ( said his parasites ) were but the follies of youth and unbridled fancy  whose errors but inimitable whim  whose darkest vice but a careless and dashing extravagance ?
i had been now two years successfully busied in this way , when there came to the university a young <unk> nobleman , <unk>  <name> , said report , as <unk> <unk>  his riches , too , as easily acquired .
i soon found him of weak intellect , and , of course , marked him as a fitting subject for my skill .
i frequently engaged him in play , and contrived , with the gambler 's usual <name> , to let him win considerable sums , the more effectually to <unk> him in my <unk> .
at length , my schemes being ripe , i met him ( with the full intention that this meeting should be final and decisive ) at the chambers of a <unk> , ( mr. <name> , ) equally intimate with both , but who , to do him justice , entertained not even a remote suspicion of my design .
to give to this a better colouring , i had contrived to have assembled a party of some eight or ten , and was <unk> careful that the introduction of cards should appear accidental , and originate in the proposal of my contemplated dupe himself .
to be brief upon a vile topic , none of the low <unk> was omitted , so customary upon similar occasions that it is a just matter for wonder how any are still found so <unk> as to fall its victim .
we had protracted our sitting far into the night , and i had at length effected the manoeuvre of getting <unk> as my sole antagonist .
the game , too , was my favorite <unk> !
the rest of the company , interested in the extent of our play , had abandoned their own cards , and were standing around us as spectators .
the <unk> , who had been induced by my artifices in the early part of the evening , to drink deeply , now shuffled , dealt , or played , with a wild nervousness of manner for which his intoxication , i thought , might partially , but could not altogether account .
in a very short period he had become my debtor to a large amount , when , having taken a long draught of port , he did precisely what i had been coolly anticipating  he proposed to double our already extravagant stakes .
with a <unk> show of reluctance , and not until after my repeated refusal had seduced him into some angry words which gave a color of pique to my compliance , did i finally comply .
the result , of course , did but prove how entirely the prey was in my toils ; in less than an hour he had <unk> his debt .
for some time his countenance had been losing the <unk> tinge lent it by the wine ; but now , to my astonishment , i perceived that it had grown to a pallor truly fearful .
i say to my astonishment .
<unk> had been represented to my eager inquiries as immeasurably wealthy ; and the sums which he had as yet lost , although in themselves vast , could not , i supposed , very seriously annoy , much less so violently affect him .
that he was overcome by the wine just swallowed , was the idea which most readily presented itself ; and , rather with a view to the preservation of my own character in the eyes of my associates , than from any less interested motive , i was about to insist , peremptorily , upon a <unk> of the play , when some expressions at my elbow from among the company , and an ejaculation evincing utter despair on the part of <unk> , gave me to understand that i had effected his total ruin under circumstances which , rendering him an object for the pity of all , should have protected him from the ill offices even of a fiend .
what now might have been my conduct it is difficult to say .
the pitiable condition of my dupe had thrown an air of embarrassed gloom over all ; and , for some moments , a profound silence was maintained , during which i could not help feeling my cheeks tingle with the many burning glances of scorn or reproach cast upon me by the less abandoned of the party .
i <name> even own that an intolerable weight of anxiety was for a brief instant lifted from my bosom by the sudden and extraordinary interruption which ensued .
the wide , heavy folding doors of the apartment were all at once thrown open , to their full extent , with a vigorous and rushing impetuosity that extinguished , as if by magic , every candle in the room .
their light , in dying , enabled us just to perceive that a stranger had entered , about my own height , and closely muffled in a cloak .
the darkness , however , was now total ; and we could only feel that he was standing in our midst .
before any one of us could recover from the extreme astonishment into which this rudeness had thrown all , we heard the voice of the intruder .
" gentlemen , " he said , in a low , distinct , and never-to-be-forgotten whisper which thrilled to the very marrow of my bones , " gentlemen , i make no apology for this behaviour , because in thus behaving , i am but fulfilling a duty .
you are , beyond doubt , <unk> of the true character of the person who has to-night won at <unk> a large sum of money from lord <unk> .
i <name> therefore put you upon an <unk> and decisive plan of obtaining this very necessary information .
please to examine , at your leisure , the inner <unk> of the cuff of his left sleeve , and the several little packages which may be found in the somewhat capacious pockets of his embroidered morning wrapper . "
while he spoke , so profound was the stillness that one might have heard a pin drop upon the floor .
in ceasing , he departed at once , and as abruptly as he had entered .
can i  shall i describe my sensations ?  must i say that i felt all the horrors of the damned ?
most assuredly i had little time given for reflection .
many hands roughly seized me upon the spot , and lights were immediately <unk> .
a search ensued .
in the lining of my sleeve were found all the court cards essential in <unk> , and , in the pockets of my wrapper , a number of packs , <unk> of those used at our sittings , with the single exception that mine were of the species called , technically , <unk> ; the honours being slightly convex at the ends , the lower cards slightly convex at the sides .
in this disposition , the dupe who cuts , as customary , at the length of the pack , <name> invariably find that he cuts his antagonist an honor ; while the gambler , cutting at the breadth , <name> , as certainly , cut nothing for his victim which may count in the records of the game .
any burst of indignation upon this discovery would have affected me less than the silent contempt , or the sarcastic composure , with which it was received .
" mr. <name> , " said our host , stooping to remove from beneath his feet an exceedingly luxurious cloak of rare furs , " mr. <name> , this is your property . "
( the weather was cold ; and , upon quitting my own room , i had thrown a cloak over my dressing wrapper , putting it off upon reaching the scene of play . )
" i presume it is <unk> to seek here ( eyeing the folds of the garment with a bitter smile ) for any farther evidence of your skill .
indeed , we have had enough .
you <name> see the necessity , i <name> , of quitting oxford  at all events , of quitting instantly my chambers . "
<unk> , humbled to the dust as i then was , it is probable that i should have resented this <unk> language by immediate personal violence , had not my whole attention been at the moment arrested by a fact of the most startling character .
the cloak which i had worn was of a rare description of fur ; how rare , how extravagantly costly , i shall not venture to say .
its fashion , too , was of my own fantastic invention ; for i was fastidious to an absurd degree of <unk> , in matters of this frivolous nature .
when , therefore , mr. <name> reached me that which he had picked up upon the floor , and near the folding doors of the apartment , it was with an astonishment nearly bordering upon terror , that i perceived my own already hanging on my arm , ( where i had no doubt unwittingly placed it , ) and that the one presented me was but its exact counterpart in every , in even the minutest possible particular .
the singular being who had so <unk> exposed me , had been muffled , i remembered , in a cloak ; and none had been worn at all by any of the members of our party with the exception of myself .
retaining some presence of mind , i took the one offered me by <name> ; placed it , unnoticed , over my own ; left the apartment with a resolute scowl of defiance ; and , next morning ere <name> of day , commenced a hurried journey from oxford to the continent , in a perfect agony of horror and of shame .
i fled in vain .
my evil <name> pursued me as if in exultation , and proved , indeed , that the exercise of its mysterious dominion had as yet only begun .
scarcely had i set foot in <name> ere i had fresh evidence of the detestable interest taken by this <name> in my concerns .
years flew , while i experienced no relief .
villain !  at rome , with how untimely , yet with how spectral an <unk> , stepped he in between me and my ambition !
at vienna , too  at berlin  and at moscow !
where , in truth , had i not bitter cause to curse him within my heart ?
from his inscrutable tyranny did i at length flee , panic-stricken , as from a pestilence ; and to the very ends of the earth i fled in vain .
and again , and again , in secret communion with my own spirit , would i demand the questions " who is he ?  whence came he ?  and what are his objects ? "
but no answer was there found .
and then i scrutinized , with a minute scrutiny , the forms , and the methods , and the leading traits of his impertinent supervision .
but even here there was very little upon which to base a conjecture .
it was noticeable , indeed , that , in no one of the multiplied instances in which he had of late crossed my path , had he so crossed it except to <unk> those schemes , or to disturb those actions , which , if fully carried out , might have resulted in bitter mischief .
poor justification this , in truth , for an authority so imperiously assumed !
poor <unk> for natural rights of <unk> so pertinaciously , so <unk> denied !
i had also been forced to notice that my <unk> , for a very long period of time , ( while scrupulously and with miraculous dexterity maintaining his whim of an identity of apparel with myself , ) had so contrived it , in the execution of his varied interference with my <name> , that i saw not , at any moment , the features of his face .
be <name> what he might , this , at least , was but the veriest of affectation , or of folly .
could he , for an instant , have supposed that , in my <unk> at eton  in the destroyer of my honor at oxford ,  in him who thwarted my ambition at rome , my revenge at <name> , my passionate love at naples , or what he falsely termed my avarice in egypt ,  that in this , my <unk> and evil genius , could fall to recognise the <name> <name> of my school boy days ,  the namesake , the companion , the rival ,  the hated and dreaded rival at dr. <unk> 's ?
impossible !  but let me hasten to the last eventful scene of the drama .
thus far i had succumbed <unk> to this imperious domination .
the sentiment of deep awe with which i habitually regarded the elevated character , the majestic wisdom , the apparent omnipresence and <unk> of <name> , added to a feeling of even terror , with which certain other traits in his nature and assumptions inspired me , had operated , hitherto , to impress me with an idea of my own utter weakness and helplessness , and to suggest an implicit , although bitterly reluctant submission to his arbitrary <name> .
but , of late days , i had given myself up entirely to wine ; and its maddening influence upon my hereditary temper rendered me more and more impatient of control .
i began to murmur ,  to hesitate ,  to resist .
and was it only fancy which induced me to believe that , with the increase of my own firmness , that of my <unk> underwent a proportional diminution ?
be this as it may , i now began to feel the inspiration of a burning <name> , and at length <unk> in my secret thoughts a stern and desperate resolution that i would submit no longer to be <unk> .
it was at rome , during the carnival of 18  , that i attended a masquerade in the <unk> of the neapolitan duke di <unk> .
i had indulged more freely than usual in the excesses of the <unk> ; and now the suffocating atmosphere of the crowded rooms irritated me beyond endurance .
the difficulty , too , of forcing my way through the mazes of the company contributed not a little to the <unk> of my temper ; for i was anxiously seeking , ( let me not say with what unworthy motive ) the young , the <name> , the beautiful wife of the aged and <unk> di <unk> .
with a too unscrupulous confidence she had previously communicated to me the secret of the costume in which she would be <unk> , and now , having caught a glimpse of her person , i was hurrying to make my way into her <unk>  at this moment i felt a light hand placed upon my shoulder , and that <unk> , low , damnable whisper within my ear .
in an absolute <unk> of wrath , i turned at once upon him who had thus interrupted me , and seized him violently by the collar .
he was attired , as i had expected , in a costume altogether similar to my own ; wearing a spanish cloak of blue <name> , <unk> about the waist with a crimson belt sustaining a <unk> .
a mask of black silk entirely covered his face .
" scoundrel ! "
i said , in a voice husky with rage , while every syllable i uttered seemed as new fuel to my fury , " scoundrel !
impostor !
accursed villain !
you shall not  you shall not dog me unto death !
follow me , or i stab you where you stand ! "
 and i broke my way from the ball-room into a small <unk> adjoining  dragging him <unk> with me as i went .
upon entering , i thrust him furiously from me .
he staggered against the wall , while i closed the door with an oath , and commanded him to draw .
he hesitated but for an instant ; then , with a slight sigh , <name> in silence , and put himself upon his defence .
the contest was brief indeed .
i was frantic with every species of wild excitement , and felt within my single arm the energy and power of a multitude .
in a few seconds i forced him by sheer strength against the <unk> , and thus , getting him at <name> , plunged my sword , with brute ferocity , repeatedly through and through his bosom .
at that instant some person tried the latch of the door .
i hastened to prevent an intrusion , and then immediately returned to my dying antagonist .
but what human language can adequately portray that astonishment , that horror which possessed me at the spectacle then presented to view ?
the brief moment in which i averted my eyes had been sufficient to produce , apparently , a material change in the arrangements at the upper or farther end of the room .
a large mirror ,  so at first it seemed to me in my confusion  now stood where none had been perceptible before ; and , as i stepped up to it in extremity of terror , mine own image , but with features all pale and <unk> in blood , advanced to meet me with a feeble and tottering gait .
thus it appeared , i say , but was not .
it was my antagonist  it was <name> , who then stood before me in the agonies of his dissolution .
his mask and cloak lay , where he had thrown them , upon the floor .
not a thread in all his raiment  not a line in all the marked and singular <unk> of his face which was not , even in the most absolute identity , mine own !
it was <name> ; but he spoke no longer in a whisper , and i could have fancied that i myself was speaking while he said : " you have conquered , and i yield .
yet , henceforward <name> thou also dead  dead to the world , to heaven and to <name> !
in me didst thou exist  and , in my death , see by this image , which is thine own , how utterly thou hast murdered thyself . "
the <unk> heart .
true !  nervous  very , very dreadfully nervous i had been and am ; but why <name> you say that i am mad ?
the disease had sharpened my senses  not destroyed  not dulled them .
above all was the sense of hearing acute .
i heard all things in the heaven and in the earth .
i heard many things in hell .
how , then , am i mad ?
hearken !
and observe how <unk>  how calmly i can tell you the whole story .
it is impossible to say how first the idea entered my <name> ; but once conceived , it haunted me day and night .
object there was none .
passion there was none .
i loved the old man .
he had never wronged me .
he had never given me insult .
for his gold i had no <name> .
i think it was his eye !
yes , it was this !
he had the eye of a vulture  a pale blue eye , with a film over it .
whenever it fell upon me , my blood ran cold ; and so by degrees  very gradually  i made up my mind to take the life of the old man , and thus rid myself of the eye forever .
now this is the point .
you fancy me mad .
madmen know nothing .
but you should have seen me .
you should have seen how wisely i proceeded  with what caution  with what foresight  with what <unk> i went to work !
i was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before i killed him .
and every night , about midnight , i turned the latch of his door and opened it  oh so gently !
and then , when i had made an opening sufficient for my head , i put in a dark lantern , all closed , closed , that no light shone out , and then i thrust in my head .
oh , you would have laughed to see how cunningly i thrust it in !
i moved it slowly  very , very slowly , so that i might not disturb the old man's sleep .
it took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that i could see him as he lay upon his bed .
<name> !
would a madman have been so wise as this , and then , when my head was well in the room , i undid the lantern <unk> , so cautiously  cautiously ( for the hinges creaked )  i undid it just so much that a single thin <name> fell upon the vulture eye .
and this i did for seven long nights  every night just at midnight  but i found the eye always closed ; and so it was impossible to do the work ; for it was not the old man who vexed me , but his evil eye .
and every morning , when the day broke , i went boldly into the chamber , and spoke <unk> to him , calling him by name in a hearty tone , and inquiring how he has passed the night .
so you see he would have been a very profound old man , indeed , to suspect that every night , just at twelve , i looked in upon him while he slept .
upon the eighth night i was more than usually cautious in opening the door .
a watch 's minute hand moves more quickly than did mine .
never before that night had i felt the extent of my own powers  of my sagacity .
i could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph .
to think that there i was , opening the door , little by little , and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts .
i fairly chuckled at the idea ; and perhaps he heard me ; for he moved on the bed suddenly , as if startled .
now you may think that i <name> back  but no .
his room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness , ( for the shutters were close fastened , through fear of robbers , ) and so i knew that he could not see the opening of the door , and i kept pushing it on steadily , steadily .
i had my head in , and was about to open the lantern , when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening , and the old man sprang up in bed , crying out  " who 's there ? "
i kept quite still and said nothing .
for a whole hour i did not move a muscle , and in the meantime i did not hear him lie down .
he was still sitting up in the bed listening ;  just as i have done , night after night , <unk> to the death watches in the wall .
presently i heard a slight groan , and i knew it was the groan of mortal terror .
it was not a groan of pain or of grief  oh , no !  it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when <unk> with awe .
i knew the sound well .
many a night , just at midnight , when all the world slept , it has welled up from my own bosom , deepening , with its dreadful <name> , the terrors that distracted me .
i say i knew it well .
i knew what the old man felt , and pitied him , although i chuckled at heart .
i knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise , when he had turned in the bed .
his fears had been ever since growing upon him .
he had been trying to fancy them <unk> , but could not .
he had been saying to himself  " it is nothing but the wind in the chimney  it is only a mouse crossing the floor , " or " it is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp . "
yes , he had been trying to comfort himself with these <unk> : but he had found all in vain .
all in vain ; because death , in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him , and enveloped the victim .
and it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel  although he neither saw nor heard  to feel the presence of my head within the room .
when i had waited a long time , very patiently , without hearing him lie down , i resolved to open a little  a very , very little crevice in the lantern .
so i opened it  you can not imagine how stealthily , stealthily  until , at length a simple dim <name> , like the thread of the spider , shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye .
it was open  wide , wide open  and i grew furious as i gazed upon it .
i saw it with perfect distinctness  all a dull blue , with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones ; but i could see nothing else of the old man 's face or person : for i had directed the <name> as if by instinct , precisely upon the damned spot .
and have i not told you that what you mistake for madness is but <unk> of the sense ?  now , i say , there came to my ears a low , dull , quick sound , such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton .
i knew that sound well , too .
it was the beating of the old man 's heart .
it increased my fury , as the beating of a drum <unk> the soldier into courage .
but even yet i refrained and kept still .
i scarcely breathed .
i held the lantern motionless .
i tried how steadily i could maintain the <name> upon the <name> .
meantime the <unk> tattoo of the heart increased .
it grew quicker and quicker , and louder and louder every instant .
the old man's terror must have been extreme !
it grew louder , i say , louder every moment !  do you <name> me well i have told you that i am nervous : so i am .
and now at the dead hour of the night , amid the dreadful silence of that old house , so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror .
yet , for some minutes longer i refrained and stood still .
but the beating grew louder , louder !
i thought the heart must burst .
and now a new anxiety seized me  the sound would be heard by a neighbour !
the old man 's hour had come !
with a loud yell , i threw open the lantern and leaped into the room .
he shrieked once  once only .
in an instant i dragged him to the floor , and pulled the heavy bed over him .
i then smiled gaily , to find the deed so far done .
but , for many minutes , the heart beat on with a muffled sound .
this , however , did not vex me ; it would not be heard through the wall .
at length it ceased .
the old man was dead .
i removed the bed and examined the corpse .
yes , he was stone , stone dead .
i placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes .
there was no <unk> .
he was stone dead .
his eye would trouble me no more .
if still you think me mad , you <name> think so no longer when i describe the wise precautions i took for the concealment of the body .
the night waned , and i worked hastily , but in silence .
first of all i <unk> the corpse .
i cut off the head and the arms and the legs .
i then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber , and deposited all between the <unk> .
i then replaced the boards so cleverly , so cunningly , that no human eye  not even his  could have detected any thing wrong .
there was nothing to wash out  no stain of any kind  no <unk> whatever .
i had been too wary for that .
a tub had caught all  <name> !
<name> !
when i had made an end of these labors , it was four o'clock  still dark as midnight .
as the <name> sounded the hour , there came a knocking at the street door .
i went down to open it with a light heart ,  for what had i now to fear ?
there entered three men , who introduced themselves , with perfect <unk> , as officers of the police .
a shriek had been heard by a neighbour during the night ; suspicion of foul play had been aroused ; information had been lodged at the police office , and they ( the officers ) had been <unk> to search the premises .
i smiled ,  for what had i to fear ?
i bade the gentlemen welcome .
the shriek , i said , was my own in a dream .
the old man , i mentioned , was absent in the country .
i took my visitors all over the house .
i bade them search  search well .
i led them , at length , to his chamber .
i showed them his treasures , secure , undisturbed .
in the enthusiasm of my confidence , i brought chairs into the room , and desired them here to rest from their fatigues , while i myself , in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph , placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim .
the officers were satisfied .
my manner had convinced them .
i was singularly at ease .
they sat , and while i answered cheerily , they chatted of familiar things .
but , ere long , i felt myself getting pale and wished them gone .
my head ached , and i fancied a ringing in my ears : but still they sat and still chatted .
the ringing became more distinct :  it continued and became more distinct : i talked more freely to get rid of the feeling : but it continued and gained <unk>  until , at length , i found that the noise was not within my ears .
no doubt i now grew very pale ;  but i talked more fluently , and with a heightened voice .
yet the sound increased  and what could i do ?
it was a low , dull , quick sound  much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton .
i gasped for breath  and yet the officers heard it not .
i talked more quickly  more vehemently ; but the noise steadily increased .
i arose and argued about trifles , in a high key and with violent gesticulations ; but the noise steadily increased .
why would they not be gone ?
i paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides , as if excited to fury by the observations of the men  but the noise steadily increased .
oh god !
what could i do ?
i foamed  i raved  i swore !
i swung the chair upon which i had been sitting , and grated it upon the boards , but the noise arose over all and continually increased .
it grew louder  louder  louder !
and still the men chatted pleasantly , and smiled .
was it possible they heard not ?
almighty god !  no , no !
they heard !  they suspected !  they knew !  they were making a mockery of my horror ! this i thought , and this i think .
but anything was better than this agony !
anything was more tolerable than this derision !
i could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer !
i felt that i must scream or die !
and now  again !  hark !
louder !
louder !
louder !
louder !
" villains ! "
i shrieked , " <unk> no more !
i admit the deed !  tear up the planks !
here , here !  it is the beating of his hideous heart ! "
<name> <unk> <unk> <unk> , si <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
 <unk> <unk> .
misery is manifold .
the wretchedness of earth is multiform .
<unk> the wide horizon as the rainbow , its hues are as various as the hues of that arch  as distinct too , yet as intimately blended .
<unk> the wide horizon as the rainbow !
how is it that from beauty i have derived a type of <unk> ?  from the covenant of peace , a simile of sorrow ?
but as , in ethics , evil is a consequence of good , so , in fact , out of <name> is sorrow born .
either the memory of past bliss is the anguish of to-day , or the agonies which are , have their origin in the ecstasies which might have been .
my <unk> name is <unk> ; that of my family i <name> not mention .
yet there are no towers in the land more <unk> than my gloomy , gray , hereditary halls .
our line has been called a race of <unk> ; and in many striking particulars  in the character of the family mansion  in the <unk> of the chief saloon  in the tapestries of the dormitories  in the <unk> of some buttresses in the <unk>  but more especially in the gallery of antique paintings  in the fashion of the library chamber  and , lastly , in the very peculiar nature of the library 's contents  there is more than sufficient evidence to warrant the belief .
the recollections of my earliest years are connected with that chamber , and with its volumes  of which latter i <name> say no more .
here died my mother .
herein was i born .
but it is mere idleness to say that i had not lived before  that the soul has no previous existence .
you deny it ?  let us not argue the matter .
convinced myself , i seek not to convince .
there is , however , a remembrance of aerial forms  of spiritual and meaning eyes  of sounds , musical yet sad  a remembrance which <name> not be excluded ; a memory like a shadow  vague , variable , indefinite , unsteady ; and like a shadow , too , in the impossibility of my getting rid of it while the sunlight of my reason shall exist .
in that chamber was i born .
thus awaking from the long night of what seemed , but was not , <unk> , at once into the very regions of <name> land  into a palace of imagination  into the wild dominions of <unk> thought and erudition  it is not singular that i gazed around me with a startled and ardent eye  that i loitered away my boyhood in books , and dissipated my youth in reverie ; but it is singular that as years rolled away , and the noon of manhood found me still in the mansion of my fathers  it is wonderful what <unk> there fell upon the springs of my life  wonderful how total an inversion took place in the character of my commonest thought .
the realities of the world affected me as visions , and as visions only , while the wild ideas of the land of dreams became , in turn , not the material of my every-day existence , but in very deed that existence utterly and solely in itself .
* * * * * <name> and i were cousins , and we grew up together in my paternal halls .
yet differently we grew  i , ill of health , and buried in gloom  she , agile , graceful , and overflowing with energy ; hers , the ramble on the hill-side  mine the studies of the <unk> ; i , living within my own heart , and addicted , body and soul , to the most intense and painful meditation  she , roaming carelessly through life , with no thought of the shadows in her path , or the silent flight of the <unk> hours .
<name> !  i call upon her name  <name> !  and from the gray ruins of memory a thousand tumultuous recollections are startled at the sound !
ah , vividly is her image before me now , as in the early days of her <unk> and <name> !
oh , gorgeous yet fantastic beauty !
oh , <unk> amid the <unk> of <unk> !
oh , <unk> among its fountains !
and then  then all is mystery and terror , and a tale which should not be told .
disease  a fatal disease , fell like the <unk> upon her frame ; and , even while i gazed upon her , the spirit of change swept over her , pervading her mind , her habits , and her character , and , in a manner the most subtle and terrible , disturbing even the identity of her person !
alas !
the destroyer came and went !  and the victim  where is she ?
i knew her not  or knew her no longer as <name> .
among the numerous train of maladies <unk> by that fatal and primary one which effected a revolution of so horrible a kind in the moral and physical being of my cousin , may be mentioned as the most distressing and obstinate in its nature , a species of <unk> not unfrequently terminating in trance itself  trance very nearly resembling positive dissolution , and from which her manner of recovery was in most instances , startlingly abrupt .
in the mean time my own disease  for i have been told that i should call it by no other appellation  my own disease , then , grew rapidly upon me , and assumed finally a <unk> character of a novel and extraordinary form  hourly and momently gaining vigor  and at length obtaining over me the most incomprehensible ascendancy .
this <unk> , if i must so term it , consisted in a morbid irritability of those properties of the mind in metaphysical science termed the attentive .
it is more than probable that i am not understood ; but i fear , indeed , that it is in no manner possible to convey to the mind of the merely general reader , an adequate idea of that nervous intensity of interest with which , in my case , the powers of meditation ( not to speak technically ) busied and buried themselves , in the contemplation of even the most ordinary objects of the universe .
to muse for long unwearied hours , with my attention riveted to some frivolous device on the margin , or in the <unk> of a book ; to become absorbed , for the better part of a summer 's day , in a quaint shadow falling <unk> upon the tapestry or upon the floor ; to lose myself , for an entire night , in watching the steady flame of a lamp , or the embers of a fire ; to dream away whole days over the perfume of a flower ; to repeat , monotonously , some common word , until the sound , by dint of frequent repetition , ceased to convey any idea whatever to the mind ; to lose all sense of motion or physical existence , by means of absolute bodily quiescence long and obstinately persevered in : such were a few of the most common and least pernicious vagaries induced by a condition of the mental faculties , not , indeed , altogether unparalleled , but certainly bidding defiance to anything like analysis or explanation .
yet let me not be <unk> .
the undue , <name> , and morbid attention thus excited by objects in their own nature frivolous , must not be confounded in character with that <unk> propensity common to all mankind , and more especially indulged in by persons of ardent imagination .
it was not even , as might be at first supposed , an extreme condition , or exaggeration of such propensity , but primarily and essentially distinct and different .
in the one instance , the dreamer , or enthusiast , being interested by an object usually not frivolous , imperceptibly loses sight of this object in a wilderness of deductions and suggestions issuing therefrom , until , at the conclusion of a day dream often replete with luxury , he finds the <unk> , or first cause of his musings , entirely vanished and forgotten .
in my case , the primary object was invariably frivolous , although assuming , through the medium of my <unk> vision , a <unk> and unreal importance .
few deductions , if any , were made ; and those few pertinaciously returning in upon the original object as a centre .
the meditations were never pleasurable ; and , at the termination of the reverie , the first cause , so far from being out of sight , had attained that <unk> exaggerated interest which was the prevailing feature of the disease .
in a word , the powers of mind more particularly exercised were , with me , as i have said before , the attentive , and are , with the <unk> , the speculative .
my books , at this epoch , if they did not actually serve to irritate the disorder , partook , it <name> be perceived , largely , in their imaginative and inconsequential nature , of the characteristic qualities of the disorder itself .
i well remember , among others , the treatise of the <name> italian , <unk> <unk> <unk> , " de <unk> <unk> <unk> dei ;  " st. <name> 's great work , the " city of god ; " and <unk> 's " de <unk> <name> , " in which the paradoxical sentence " <unk> est dei <unk> ; credible est <unk> <unk> est : et <unk> <unk> ; <unk> est <unk> <unk> est ,  " occupied my undivided time , for many weeks of laborious and fruitless investigation .
thus it <name> appear that , shaken from its balance only by trivial things , my reason bore resemblance to that <unk> spoken of by ptolemy <unk> , which steadily resisting the attacks of human violence , and the fiercer fury of the waters and the winds , trembled only to the touch of the flower called <unk> .
and although , to a careless thinker , it might appear a matter beyond doubt , that the alteration produced by her unhappy malady , in the moral condition of <name> , would afford me many objects for the exercise of that intense and abnormal meditation whose nature i have been at some trouble in explaining , yet such was not in any degree the case .
in the lucid intervals of my infirmity , her calamity , indeed , gave me pain , and , taking deeply to heart that total wreck of her fair and gentle life , i did not fall to ponder , frequently and bitterly , upon the <unk> means by which so strange a revolution had been so suddenly brought to pass .
but these reflections partook not of the <unk> of my disease , and were such as would have occurred , under similar circumstances , to the ordinary mass of mankind .
true to its own character , my disorder revelled in the less important but more startling changes wrought in the physical frame of <name>  in the singular and most appalling <unk> of her personal identity .
during the brightest days of her unparalleled beauty , most surely i had never loved her .
in the strange anomaly of my existence , feelings with me , had never been of the heart , and my passions always were of the mind .
through the gray of the early morning  among the <unk> shadows of the forest at noonday  and in the silence of my library at night  she had flitted by my eyes , and i had seen her  not as the living and breathing <name> , but as the <name> of a dream ; not as a being of the earth , earthy , but as the abstraction of such a being ; not as a thing to admire , but to analyze ; not as an object of love , but as the theme of the most abstruse although <unk> speculation .
and now  now i shuddered in her presence , and grew pale at her approach ; yet , bitterly lamenting her fallen and desolate condition , i called to mind that she had loved me long , and , in an evil moment , i spoke to her of marriage .
and at length the period of our nuptials was approaching , when , upon an afternoon in the <name> of the year  one of those <unk> warm , calm , and <name> days which are the nurse of the beautiful <unk> ( *1 ) ,  i sat , ( and sat , as i thought , alone , ) in the inner apartment of the library .
but , uplifting my eyes , i saw that <name> stood before me .
was it my own excited imagination  or the <name> influence of the atmosphere  or the uncertain twilight of the chamber  or the gray draperies which fell around her figure  that caused in it so <unk> and indistinct an outline ?
i could not tell .
she spoke no word ; and i  not for worlds could i have uttered a syllable .
an icy chill ran through my frame ; a sense of insufferable anxiety oppressed me ; a consuming curiosity pervaded my soul ; and sinking back upon the chair , i remained for some time breathless and motionless , with my eyes riveted upon her person .
alas !
its <unk> was excessive , and not one vestige of the former being lurked in any single line of the contour .
my burning glances at length fell upon the face .
the forehead was high , and very pale , and singularly placid ; and the once <unk> hair fell partially over it , and overshadowed the hollow temples with innumerable ringlets , now of a vivid yellow , and jarring <unk> , in their fantastic character , with the reigning melancholy of the countenance .
the eyes were lifeless , and <unk> , and seemingly <unk> , and i shrank involuntarily from their glassy stare to the contemplation of the thin and shrunken lips .
they parted ; and in a smile of peculiar meaning , the teeth of the changed <name> disclosed themselves slowly to my view .
would to god that i had never beheld them , or that , having done so , i had died !
* * * * * the shutting of a door disturbed me , and , looking up , i found that my cousin had departed from the chamber .
but from the disordered chamber of my <name> , had not , alas !
departed , and would not be driven away , the white and ghastly spectrum of the teeth .
not a speck on their surface  not a shade on their enamel  not an <unk> in their edges  but what that period of her smile had sufficed to brand in upon my memory .
i saw them now even more unequivocally than i beheld them then .
the teeth !  the teeth !  they were here , and there , and everywhere , and visibly and palpably before me ; long , narrow , and excessively white , with the pale lips writhing about them , as in the very moment of their first terrible development .
then came the full fury of my <unk> , and i struggled in vain against its strange and irresistible influence .
in the multiplied objects of the external world i had no thoughts but for the teeth .
for these i longed with a <unk> <name> .
all other matters and all different interests became absorbed in their single contemplation .
they  they alone were present to the mental eye , and they , in their sole individuality , became the essence of my mental life .
i held them in every light .
i turned them in every attitude .
i surveyed their characteristics .
i dwelt upon their peculiarities .
i pondered upon their conformation .
i mused upon the alteration in their nature .
i shuddered as i assigned to them in imagination a sensitive and <unk> power , and even when <unk> by the lips , a capability of moral expression .
of mademoiselle salle it has been well said , " que tous ses pas <unk> des sentiments , " and of <name> i more seriously believed que toutes ses <unk> <unk> des <unk> .
des <unk> !   ah here was the idiotic thought that destroyed me !
des <unk> !   ah therefore it was that i coveted them so madly !
i felt that their possession could alone ever restore me to peace , in giving me back to reason .
and the evening closed in upon me thus  and then the darkness came , and tarried , and went  and the day again dawned  and the mists of a second night were now gathering around  and still i sat motionless in that solitary room  and still i sat buried in meditation  and still the <unk> of the teeth maintained its terrible ascendancy , as , with the most vivid hideous distinctness , it floated about amid the changing lights and shadows of the chamber .
at length there broke in upon my dreams a cry as of horror and dismay ; and <unk> , after a pause , succeeded the sound of troubled voices , intermingled with many low <unk> of sorrow or of pain .
i arose from my seat , and throwing open one of the doors of the library , saw standing out in the <unk> a servant maiden , all in tears , who told me that <name> was  no more !
she had been seized with <unk> in the early morning , and now , at the closing in of the night , the grave was ready for its tenant , and all the preparations for the burial were completed .
* * * * * i found myself sitting in the library , and again sitting there alone .
it seemed that i had newly awakened from a confused and exciting dream .
i knew that it was now midnight , and i was well aware , that since the setting of the sun , <name> had been interred .
but of that dreary period which intervened i had no positive , at least no definite comprehension .
yet its memory was replete with horror  horror more horrible from being vague , and terror more terrible from <unk> .
it was a fearful <name> in the record my existence , written all over with dim , and hideous , and unintelligible recollections .
i <unk> to <unk> them , but in vain ; while ever and anon , like the spirit of a departed sound , the shrill and piercing shriek of a female voice seemed to be ringing in my ears .
i had done a deed  what was it ?
i asked myself the question aloud , and the whispering echoes of the chamber answered me ,  " what was it ?  " on the table beside me burned a lamp , and near it lay a little box .
it was of no remarkable character , and i had seen it frequently before , for it was the property of the family physician ; but how came it there , upon my table , and why did i shudder in regarding it ?
these things were in no manner to be accounted for , and my eyes at length dropped to the open pages of a book , and to a sentence <unk> therein .
the words were the singular but simple ones of the poet <unk> <unk> :  " <unk> <unk> <unk> si <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> fore <unk> . "
why then , as i perused them , did the hairs of my head erect themselves on end , and the blood of my body become <unk> within my veins ?
there came a light tap at the library door  and , pale as the tenant of a tomb , a menial entered upon tiptoe .
his looks were wild with terror , and he spoke to me in a voice tremulous , husky , and very low .
what said he ?  some broken sentences i heard .
he told of a wild cry disturbing the silence of the night  of the gathering together of the household  of a search in the direction of the sound ; and then his tones grew <unk> distinct as he whispered me of a violated grave  of a disfigured body enshrouded , yet still breathing  still palpitating  still alive !
he pointed to garments ;  they were muddy and clotted with gore .
i spoke not , and he took me gently by the hand : it was indented with the impress of human nails .
he directed my attention to some object against the wall .
i looked at it for some minutes : it was a spade .
with a shriek i bounded to the table , and grasped the box that lay upon it .
but i could not force it open ; and in my tremor , it slipped from my hands , and fell heavily , and burst into pieces ; and from it , with a rattling sound , there rolled out some instruments of <unk> surgery , intermingled with thirty-two small , white and <unk> substances that were scattered to and fro about the floor .
<name> sub <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
 <name> <unk> .
i am come of a race noted for vigor of fancy and ardor of passion .
men have called me mad ; but the question is not yet settled , whether madness is or is not the loftiest intelligence  whether much that is glorious  whether all that is profound  does not spring from disease of thought  from moods of mind exalted at the expense of the general intellect .
they who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night .
in their gray visions they obtain glimpses of eternity , and thrill , in awakening , to find that they have been upon the verge of the great secret .
in snatches , they learn something of the wisdom which is of good , and more of the mere knowledge which is of evil .
they penetrate , however , <unk> or <unk> into the vast ocean of the " light ineffable , " and again , like the adventures of the <unk> <unk> , " <unk> <unk> mare <unk> , quid in <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
we <name> say , then , that i am mad .
i <name> , at least , that there are two distinct conditions of my mental existence  the condition of a lucid reason , not to be disputed , and belonging to the memory of events forming the first epoch of my life  and a condition of shadow and doubt , <unk> to the present , and to the recollection of what constitutes the second great <name> of my being .
therefore , what i shall tell of the earlier period , believe ; and to what i may relate of the later time , give only such credit as may seem due , or doubt it altogether , or , if doubt it ye can not , then play unto its riddle the <unk> .
she whom i loved in youth , and of whom i now pen calmly and distinctly these remembrances , was the sole daughter of the only sister of my mother long departed .
<name> was the name of my cousin .
we had always <unk> together , beneath a tropical sun , in the valley of the many-colored grass .
no <unk> footstep ever came upon that vale ; for it lay away up among a range of giant hills that <name> <unk> around about it , shutting out the sunlight from its sweetest recesses .
no path was trodden in its vicinity ; and , to reach our happy home , there was need of putting back , with force , the foliage of many thousands of forest trees , and of crushing to death the glories of many millions of fragrant flowers .
thus it was that we lived all alone , knowing nothing of the world without the valley  i , and my cousin , and her mother .
from the dim regions beyond the mountains at the upper end of our encircled domain , there crept out a narrow and deep river , brighter than all save the eyes of <name> ; and , winding stealthily about in <unk> courses , it passed away , at length , through a shadowy gorge , among hills still <unk> than those whence it had issued .
we called it the " river of silence " ; for there seemed to be a <unk> influence in its flow .
no murmur arose from its bed , and so gently it wandered along , that the <name> pebbles upon which we loved to gaze , far down within its bosom , stirred not at all , but lay in a motionless content , each in its own old station , shining on gloriously forever .
the margin of the river , and of the many dazzling rivulets that glided through devious ways into its channel , as well as the spaces that extended from the margins away down into the depths of the streams until they reached the bed of pebbles at the bottom ,  these spots , not less than the whole surface of the valley , from the river to the mountains that <unk> it in , were carpeted all by a soft green grass , thick , short , perfectly even , and <unk> , but so <unk> throughout with the yellow <unk> , the white <name> , the purple <name> , and the <unk> <unk> , that its exceeding beauty spoke to our hearts in loud tones , of the love and of the <name> of god .
and , here and there , in groves about this grass , like <unk> of dreams , sprang up fantastic trees , whose tall slender stems stood not upright , but slanted gracefully toward the light that peered at <unk> into the centre of the valley .
their <name> was speckled with the vivid alternate splendor of <name> and silver , and was smoother than all save the cheeks of <name> ; so that , but for the brilliant green of the huge leaves that spread from their summits in long , tremulous lines , <unk> with the <unk> , one might have fancied them giant serpents of syria doing homage to their sovereign the sun .
hand in hand about this valley , for fifteen years , roamed i with <name> before love entered within our hearts .
it was one evening at the close of the third <unk> of her life , and of the fourth of my own , that we sat , locked in each other 's embrace , beneath the <unk> trees , and looked down within the water of the river of silence at our images therein .
we spoke no words during the rest of that sweet day , and our words even upon the morrow were tremulous and few .
we had drawn the god eros from that wave , and now we felt that he had <unk> within us the fiery souls of our forefathers .
the passions which had for centuries distinguished our race , came thronging with the fancies for which they had been equally noted , and together breathed a delirious bliss over the valley of the many-colored grass .
a change fell upon all things .
strange , brilliant flowers , <unk> , burn out upon the trees where no flowers had been known before .
the tints of the green carpet deepened ; and when , one by one , the white <unk> shrank away , there sprang up in place of them , ten by ten of the <unk> <unk> .
and life arose in our paths ; for the tall <unk> , hitherto unseen , with all <name> glowing birds , <unk> his <name> plumage before us .
the golden and silver fish haunted the river , out of the bosom of which issued , little by little , a murmur that swelled , at length , into a <unk> <name> more divine than that of the harp of <unk> than all save the voice of <name> .
and now , too , a voluminous cloud , which we had long watched in the regions of <unk> , floated out thence , all gorgeous in crimson and gold , and settling in peace above us , sank , day by day , lower and lower , until its edges rested upon the tops of the mountains , turning all their dimness into magnificence , and shutting us up , as if forever , within a magic <unk> of grandeur and of <name> .
the loveliness of <name> was that of the <unk> ; but she was a maiden artless and innocent as the brief life she had led among the flowers .
no <unk> disguised the fervor of love which animated her heart , and she examined with me its inmost recesses as we walked together in the valley of the many-colored grass , and discoursed of the mighty changes which had lately taken place therein .
at length , having spoken one day , in tears , of the last sad change which must befall humanity , she thenceforward dwelt only upon this one sorrowful theme , <unk> it into all our converse , as , in the songs of the bard of <unk> , the same images are found occurring , again and again , in every impressive variation of phrase .
she had seen that the finger of death was upon her bosom  that , like the <unk> , she had been made perfect in loveliness only to die ; but the terrors of the grave to her lay solely in a consideration which she revealed to me , one evening at twilight , by the banks of the river of silence .
she grieved to think that , having entombed her in the valley of the many-colored grass , i would quit forever its happy recesses , transferring the love which now was so passionately her own to some maiden of the outer and everyday world .
and , then and there , i threw myself hurriedly at the feet of <name> , and offered up a vow , to herself and to heaven , that i would never bind myself in marriage to any daughter of earth  that i would in no manner prove <unk> to her dear memory , or to the memory of the devout affection with which she had blessed me .
and i called the mighty ruler of the universe to witness the pious solemnity of my vow .
and the curse which i invoked of him and of her , a saint in <unk> should i prove <unk> to that promise , involved a penalty the exceeding great horror of which <name> not permit me to make record of it here .
and the bright eyes of <name> grew brighter at my words ; and she sighed as if a deadly burthen had been taken from her breast ; and she trembled and very bitterly wept ; but she made acceptance of the vow , ( for what was she but a child ? )
and it made easy to her the bed of her death .
and she said to me , not many days afterward , tranquilly dying , that , because of what i had done for the comfort of her spirit she would watch over me in that spirit when departed , and , if so it were permitted her return to me visibly in the watches of the night ; but , if this thing were , indeed , beyond the power of the souls in paradise , that she would , at least , give me frequent indications of her presence , sighing upon me in the evening winds , or filling the air which i breathed with perfume from the <unk> of the angels .
and , with these words upon her lips , she yielded up her innocent life , putting an end to the first epoch of my own .
thus far i have faithfully said .
but as i pass the barrier in <unk> path , formed by the death of my beloved , and proceed with the second <name> of my existence , i feel that a shadow gathers over my <name> , and i mistrust the perfect sanity of the record .
but let me <unk>  years dragged themselves along heavily , and still i <unk> within the valley of the many-colored grass ; but a second change had come upon all things .
the <unk> flowers shrank into the stems of the trees , and appeared no more .
the tints of the green carpet faded ; and , one by one , the <unk> <unk> withered away ; and there sprang up , in place of them , ten by ten , dark , <unk> violets , that writhed uneasily and were ever encumbered with dew .
and life departed from our paths ; for the tall <unk> <unk> no longer his <name> plumage before us , but flew sadly from the vale into the hills , with all the <name> glowing birds that had arrived in his company .
and the golden and silver fish swam down through the gorge at the lower end of our domain and <unk> the sweet river never again .
and the <unk> <name> that had been softer than the <unk> of <unk> , and more divine than all save the voice of <name> , it died little by little away , in murmurs growing lower and lower , until the stream returned , at length , utterly , into the solemnity of its original silence .
and then , lastly , the voluminous cloud <unk> , and , abandoning the tops of the mountains to the dimness of old , fell back into the regions of <unk> , and took away all its manifold golden and gorgeous glories from the valley of the many-colored grass .
yet the promises of <name> were not forgotten ; for i heard the sounds of the swinging of the <unk> of the angels ; and streams of a holy perfume floated ever and ever about the valley ; and at lone hours , when my heart beat heavily , the winds that bathed my brow came unto me laden with soft sighs ; and indistinct murmurs filled often the night air , and once  oh , but once only !
i was awakened from a slumber , like the slumber of death , by the pressing of spiritual lips upon my own .
but the void within my heart refused , even thus , to be filled .
i longed for the love which had before filled it to overflowing .
at length the valley pained me through its memories of <name> , and i left it for ever for the vanities and the turbulent triumphs of the world .
i found myself within a strange city , where all things might have served to blot from recollection the sweet dreams i had dreamed so long in the valley of the many-colored grass .
the pomps and <unk> of a stately court , and the mad <unk> of arms , and the radiant loveliness of women , bewildered and intoxicated my <name> .
but as yet my soul had proved true to its vows , and the indications of the presence of <name> were still given me in the silent hours of the night .
suddenly these manifestations they ceased , and the world grew dark before mine eyes , and i stood aghast at the burning thoughts which possessed , at the terrible temptations which beset me ; for there came from some far , far distant and unknown land , into the <name> court of the king i served , a maiden to whose beauty my whole <unk> heart yielded at once  at whose footstool i bowed down without a struggle , in the most ardent , in the most abject worship of love .
what , indeed , was my passion for the young girl of the valley in comparison with the fervor , and the delirium , and the <unk> ecstasy of adoration with which i poured out my whole soul in tears at the feet of the ethereal <unk> ?  oh , bright was the seraph <unk> !
and in that knowledge i had room for none <unk>  oh , divine was the <name> <unk> !
and as i looked down into the depths of her memorial eyes , i thought only of them  and of her .
i wedded ;  nor dreaded the curse i had invoked ; and its bitterness was not visited upon me .
and once  but once again in the silence of the night ; there came through my lattice the soft sighs which had forsaken me ; and they modelled themselves into familiar and sweet voice , saying : " sleep in peace !  for the spirit of love <unk> and <unk> , and , in taking to thy passionate heart her who is <unk> , thou <name> <unk> , for reasons which shall be made known to thee in heaven , of thy vows unto <name> . "
notes to this volume notes  <unk> ( *1 ) the <unk> .
( <unk> ) " one of the most remarkable natural curiosities in texas is a petrified forest , near the head of <unk> river .
it consists of several hundred trees , in an erect position , all turned to stone .
some trees , now growing , are partly petrified .
this is a startling fact for natural philosophers , and must cause them to modify the existing theory of <unk>  kennedy .
this account , at first discredited , has since been corroborated by the discovery of a completely petrified forest , near the head waters of the <name> , or <unk> river , which has its source in the black hills of the <name> chain .
there is scarcely , perhaps , a spectacle on the surface of the globe more remarkable , either in a geological or picturesque point of view than that presented by the petrified forest , near cairo .
the traveller , having passed the tombs of the <unk> , just beyond the gates of the city , proceeds to the southward , nearly at right angles to the road across the desert to suez , and after having travelled some ten miles up a low barren valley , covered with sand , gravel , and sea shells , fresh as if the tide had retired but yesterday , crosses a low range of <unk> , which has for some distance run parallel to his path .
the scene now presented to him is beyond <name> singular and desolate .
a mass of fragments of trees , all converted into stone , and when struck by his horse 's hoof ringing like cast iron , is seen to extend itself for miles and miles around him , in the form of a decayed and prostrate forest .
the wood is of a dark brown <name> , but retains its form in perfection , the pieces being from one to fifteen feet in length , and from half a foot to three feet in thickness , strewed so closely together , as far as the eye can reach , that an egyptian donkey can scarcely thread its way through amongst them , and so natural that , were it in scotland or ireland , it might pass without remark for some enormous drained bog , on which the <unk> trees lay rotting in the sun .
the roots and rudiments of the branches are , in many cases , nearly perfect , and in some the <unk> eaten under the bark are readily recognizable .
the most delicate of the sap vessels , and all the finer portions of the centre of the wood , are perfectly entire , and bear to be examined with the strongest <unk> .

b. <name> , of salem , <unk> , presented the " national institute " with an insect from new zealand , with the following description : " <unk> <unk> , a decided caterpillar , or worm , is found gnawing at the root of the <unk> tree , with a plant growing out of its head .
this most peculiar and extraordinary insect travels up both the <unk> and <unk> trees , and entering into the top , eats its way , <unk> the trunk of the trees until it reaches the root , and dies , or remains dormant , and the plant <unk> out of its head ; the body remains perfect and entire , of a harder substance than when alive .

( <unk> ) the corolla of this flower ( <unk> <unk> ) , which is tubular , but terminating upwards in a <unk> limb , is inflated into a globular figure at the base .
the tubular part is internally beset with stiff hairs , pointing downwards .
the globular part contains the pistil , which consists merely of a <unk> and stigma , together with the surrounding stamens .
but the stamens , being shorter than the <unk> , can not discharge the pollen so as to throw it upon the stigma , as the flower stands always upright till after impregnation .
and hence , without some additional and peculiar aid , the pollen must necessarily fan down to the bottom of the flower .
now , the aid that nature has furnished in this case , is that of the <unk> <unk> , a small insect , which entering the tube of the <unk> in quest of <name> , descends to the bottom , and <unk> about till it becomes quite covered with pollen ; but not being able to force its way out again , owing to the downward position of the hairs , which converge to a point like the wires of a <unk> , and being somewhat impatient of its confinement it brushes backwards and forwards , trying every corner , till , after repeatedly traversing the stigma , it covers it with pollen sufficient for its impregnation , in consequence of which the flower soon begins to droop , and the hairs to shrink to the sides of the tube , effecting an easy passage for the escape of the insect .

to suit the views of this article i have followed the <name> 's statement , although a grossly exaggerated one .

i had several reasons , however , for declining to do so , some of which were of a nature altogether private , and concern no person but myself ; others not so much so .
one consideration which deterred me was that , having kept no journal during a greater portion of the time in which i was absent , i feared i should not be able to write , from mere memory , a statement so minute and connected as to have the appearance of that truth it would really possess , barring only the natural and unavoidable exaggeration to which all of us are prone when <unk> events which have had powerful influence in exciting the imaginative faculties .
another reason was , that the incidents to be narrated were of a nature so positively marvellous that , unsupported as my assertions must necessarily be ( except by the evidence of a single individual , and he a half-breed indian ) , i could only <name> for belief among my family , and those of my friends who have had reason , through life , to put <name> in my <unk> probability being that the public at large would regard what i should put forth as merely an impudent and ingenious fiction .
a distrust in my own abilities as a writer was , nevertheless , one of the principal causes which prevented me from complying with the suggestions of my advisers .
among those gentlemen in <name> who expressed the greatest interest in my statement , more particularly in regard to that portion of it which related to the antarctic ocean , was mr. poe , lately editor of the " southern literary messenger , " a monthly magazine , published by mr. <name> w. white , in the city of richmond .
he strongly advised me , among others , to prepare at once a full account of what i had seen and undergone , and trust to the shrewdness and common-sense of the <unk> , with great plausibility , that however roughly , as regards mere authorship , my book should be got up , its very <unk> , if there were any , would give it all the better chance of being received as truth .
notwithstanding this representation , i did not make up my mind to do as he suggested .
he afterward proposed ( finding that i would not stir in the matter ) that i should allow him to draw up , in his own words , a narrative of the earlier portion of my adventures , from facts afforded by myself , publishing it in the " southern messenger " under the garb of fiction .
to this , perceiving no objection , i consented , <unk> only that my real name should be retained .
two <name> of the pretended fiction appeared , consequently , in the " messenger " for <name> and february ( 1837 ) , and , in order that it might certainly be regarded as fiction , the name of mr. poe was affixed to the articles in the table of contents of the magazine .
the manner in which this ruse was received has induced me at length to undertake a regular <unk> and publication of the adventures in question ; for i found that , in spite of the air of fable which had been so ingeniously thrown around that portion of my statement which appeared in the " messenger " ( without altering or <unk> a single fact ) , the public were still not at all disposed to receive it as fable , and several letters were sent to mr. p. 's address , distinctly expressing a conviction to the contrary .
i thence concluded that the facts of my narrative would prove of such a nature as to <name> with them sufficient evidence of their own <unk> , and that i had consequently little to fear on the score of popular incredulity .
this <unk> being made , it <name> be seen at once how much of what follows i claim to be my own writing ; and it <name> also be understood that no fact is <unk> in the first few pages which were written by mr. poe .
even to those readers who have not seen the " messenger , " it <name> be unnecessary to point out where his portion ends and my own commences ; the difference in point of style <name> be readily perceived .
a. g. <unk> .
chapter 1 my name is <name> <name> <unk> .
my father was a respectable trader in <unk> at nantucket , where i was born .
my maternal grandfather was an attorney in good practice .
he was fortunate in every thing , and had speculated very successfully in stocks of the <unk> new bank , as it was formerly called .
by these and other means he had managed to lay by a tolerable sum of money .
he was more attached to myself , i believe , than to any other person in the world , and i expected to inherit the most of his property at his death .
he sent me , at six years of age , to the school of old mr. <unk> , a gentleman with only one arm and of eccentric manners  he is well known to almost every person who has visited new bedford .
i stayed at his school until i was sixteen , when i left him for mr. e. <name> 's academy on the hill .
here i became intimate with the son of mr. barnard , a sea-captain , who generally sailed in the employ of <name> and <unk>  mr. barnard is also very well known in new bedford , and has many relations , i am certain , in <unk> .
his son was named <name> , and he was nearly two years older than myself .
he had been on a whaling voyage with his father in the <name> <unk> , and was always talking to me of his adventures in the south pacific ocean .
i used frequently to go home with him , and remain all day , and sometimes all night .
we occupied the same bed , and he would be sure to keep me awake until almost light , telling me stories of the natives of the island of <unk> , and other places he had visited in his travels .
at last i could not help being interested in what he said , and by degrees i felt the greatest <name> to go to sea .
i owned a sailboat called the <name> , and worth about seventy-five dollars .
she had a <unk> or cuddy , and was rigged <unk>  i forget her tonnage , but she would hold ten persons without much crowding .
in this boat we were in the habit of going on some of the maddest freaks in the world ; and , when i now think of them , it appears to me a thousand wonders that i am alive to-day .
i <name> relate one of these adventures by way of introduction to a longer and more momentous narrative .
one night there was a party at mr. barnard 's , and both <name> and myself were not a little intoxicated toward the close of it .
as usual , in such cases , i took part of his bed in preference to going home .
he went to sleep , as i thought , very quietly ( it being near one when the party broke up ) , and without saying a word on his favorite topic .
it might have been half an hour from the time of our getting in bed , and i was just about falling into a doze , when he suddenly started up , and swore with a terrible oath that he would not go to sleep for any <name> <unk> in christendom , when there was so glorious a breeze from the southwest .
i never was so astonished in my life , not knowing what he intended , and thinking that the wines and liquors he had drunk had set him entirely beside himself .
he proceeded to talk very coolly , however , saying he knew that i supposed him intoxicated , but that he was never more sober in his life .
he was only tired , he added , of lying in bed on such a fine night like a dog , and was determined to get up and dress , and go out on a frolic with the boat .
i can hardly tell what possessed me , but the words were no sooner out of his mouth than i felt a thrill of the greatest excitement and pleasure , and thought his mad idea one of the most delightful and most reasonable things in the world .
it was blowing almost a <name> , and the weather was very cold  it being late in october .
i sprang out of bed , nevertheless , in a kind of ecstasy , and told him i was quite as brave as himself , and quite as tired as he was of lying in bed like a dog , and quite as ready for any fun or frolic as any <name> barnard in nantucket .
we lost no time in getting on our clothes and hurrying down to the boat .
she was lying at the old decayed wharf by the <unk> of <unk> & co. , and almost thumping her side out against the rough logs .
<name> got into her and bailed her , for she was nearly half full of water .
this being done , we hoisted jib and mainsail , kept full , and started boldly out to sea .
the wind , as i before said , blew freshly from the southwest .
the night was very clear and cold .
<name> had taken the helm , and i stationed myself by the mast , on the deck of the cuddy .
we flew along at a great rate  neither of us having said a word since casting loose from the wharf .
i now asked my companion what course he intended to steer , and what time he thought it probable we should get back .
he whistled for a few minutes , and then said <unk> : " i am going to sea  you may go home if you think proper . "
turning my eyes upon him , i perceived at once that , in spite of his assumed nonchalance , he was greatly agitated .
i could see him distinctly by the light of the moon  his face was paler than any marble , and his hand shook so excessively that he could scarcely retain hold of the tiller .
i found that something had gone wrong , and became seriously alarmed .
at this period i knew little about the management of a boat , and was now depending entirely upon the nautical skill of my friend .
the wind , too , had suddenly increased , as we were fast getting out of the <name> of the land  still i was ashamed to betray any trepidation , and for almost half an hour maintained a resolute silence .
i could stand it no longer , however , and spoke to <name> about the propriety of turning back .
as before , it was nearly a minute before he made answer , or took any notice of my suggestion .
" by-and-by , " said he at length  " time enough  home by-and-by . "
i had expected a similar reply , but there was something in the tone of these words which filled me with an indescribable feeling of dread .
i again looked at the speaker attentively .
his lips were perfectly livid , and his knees shook so violently together that he seemed scarcely able to stand .
" for god 's sake , <name> , " i screamed , now heartily frightened , " what ails you ?  what is the matter ?  what are you going to do ? "
" matter ! "
he stammered , in the greatest apparent surprise , letting go the tiller at the same moment , and falling forward into the bottom of the boat  " matter  why , nothing is the  matter  going home  d  d  don't you see ? "
the whole truth now flashed upon me .
i flew to him and raised him up .
he was drunk  beastly drunk  he could no longer either stand , speak , or see .
his eyes were perfectly glazed ; and as i let him go in the extremity of my despair , he rolled like a mere log into the <unk> , from which i had lifted him .
it was evident that , during the evening , he had drunk far more than i suspected , and that his conduct in bed had been the result of a <unk> state of intoxication  a state which , like madness , frequently enables the victim to imitate the outward demeanour of one in perfect possession of his senses .
the coolness of the night air , however , had had its usual effect  the mental energy began to yield before its influence  and the confused perception which he no doubt then had of his perilous situation had assisted in hastening the catastrophe .
he was now thoroughly insensible , and there was no probability that he would be otherwise for many hours .
it is hardly possible to conceive the extremity of my terror .
the fumes of the wine lately taken had evaporated , leaving me doubly timid and irresolute .
i knew that i was altogether incapable of managing the boat , and that a fierce wind and strong ebb tide were hurrying us to destruction .
a storm was evidently gathering behind us ; we had neither compass nor provisions ; and it was clear that , if we held our present course , we should be out of sight of land before daybreak .
these thoughts , with a crowd of others equally fearful , flashed through my mind with a bewildering rapidity , and for some moments paralyzed me beyond the possibility of making any exertion .
the boat was going through the water at a terrible rate  full before the wind  no reef in either jib or mainsail  running her bows completely under the foam .
it was a thousand wonders she did not <unk> to  <name> having let go the tiller , as i said before , and i being too much agitated to think of taking it myself .
by good luck , however , she kept steady , and gradually i recovered some degree of presence of mind .
still the wind was increasing fearfully , and whenever we rose from a plunge forward , the sea behind fell <unk> over our counter , and <unk> us with water .
i was so utterly benumbed , too , in every limb , as to be nearly unconscious of sensation .
at length i summoned up the resolution of despair , and rushing to the mainsail let it go by the run .
as might have been expected , it flew over the bows , and , getting drenched with water , carried away the mast short off by the board .
this latter accident alone saved me from instant destruction .
under the jib only , i now boomed along before the wind , shipping heavy seas occasionally over the counter , but relieved from the terror of immediate death .
i took the helm , and breathed with greater freedom as i found that there yet remained to us a chance of ultimate escape .
<name> still lay senseless in the bottom of the boat ; and as there was imminent danger of his drowning ( the water being nearly a foot deep just where he fell ) , i contrived to raise him partially up , and keep him in a sitting position , by passing a rope round his waist , and lashing it to a <unk> in the deck of the cuddy .
having thus arranged every thing as well as i could in my chilled and agitated condition , i recommended myself to god , and made up my mind to bear whatever might happen with all the fortitude in my power .
hardly had i come to this resolution , when , suddenly , a loud and long scream or yell , as if from the throats of a thousand demons , seemed to <unk> the whole atmosphere around and above the boat .
never while i live shall i forget the intense agony of terror i experienced at that moment .
my hair stood erect on my head  i felt the blood <unk> in my veins  my heart ceased utterly to beat , and without having once raised my eyes to learn the source of my alarm , i tumbled headlong and insensible upon the body of my fallen companion .
i found myself , upon reviving , in the cabin of a large <unk> ( the penguin ) bound to nantucket .
several persons were standing over me , and <name> , paler than death , was busily occupied in chafing my hands .
upon seeing me open my eyes , his exclamations of gratitude and <name> excited alternate laughter and tears from the rough-looking personages who were present .
the mystery of our being in existence was now soon explained .
we had been run down by the <unk> , which was <unk> , beating up to nantucket with every sail she could venture to set , and consequently running almost at right angles to our own course .
several men were on the look-out forward , but did not perceive our boat until it was an impossibility to avoid coming in contact  their shouts of warning upon seeing us were what so terribly alarmed me .
the huge ship , i was told , rode immediately over us with as much ease as our own little vessel would have passed over a feather , and without the least perceptible impediment to her progress .
not a scream arose from the deck of the victim  there was a slight grating sound to be heard mingling with the roar of wind and water , as the frail bark which was swallowed up rubbed for a moment along the keel of her destroyer  but this was all .
thinking our boat ( which it <name> be remembered was <unk> ) some mere shell cut adrift as useless , the captain ( captain e. t. v. block , of new london ) was for proceeding on his course without troubling himself further about the matter .
luckily , there were two of the look-out who swore positively to having seen some person at our helm , and represented the possibility of yet saving him .
a discussion ensued , when block grew angry , and , after a while , said that " it was no business of his to be eternally watching for <unk> ; that the ship should not put about for any such nonsense ; and if there was a man run down , it was nobody 's fault but his own , he might drown and be <unk> " or some language to that effect .
henderson , the first mate , now took the matter up , being justly indignant , as well as the whole ship 's crew , at a speech evincing so base a degree of heartless atrocity .
he spoke plainly , seeing himself upheld by the men , told the captain he considered him a fit subject for the gallows , and that he would disobey his orders if he were hanged for it the moment he set his foot on shore .
he strode aft , jostling block ( who turned pale and made no answer ) on one side , and seizing the helm , gave the word , in a firm voice , <unk> !
the men flew to their posts , and the ship went cleverly about .
all this had occupied nearly five minutes , and it was supposed to be hardly within the bounds of possibility that any individual could be saved  allowing any to have been on board the boat .
yet , as the reader has seen , both <name> and myself were rescued ; and our deliverance seemed to have been brought about by two of those almost inconceivable pieces of good fortune which are attributed by the wise and pious to the special interference of providence .
while the ship was yet in stays , the mate lowered the jolly-boat and jumped into her with the very two men , i believe , who spoke up as having seen me at the helm .
they had just left the <name> of the vessel ( the moon still shining brightly ) when she made a long and heavy roll to windward , and henderson , at the same moment , starting up in his seat bawled out to his crew to back water .
he would say nothing else  repeating his cry impatiently , back water !
black water !
the men put back as speedily as possible , but by this time the ship had gone round , and gotten fully under headway , although all hands on board were making great exertions to take in sail .
in despite of the danger of the attempt , the mate clung to the <unk> as soon as they came within his reach .
another huge lurch now brought the starboard side of the vessel out of water nearly as far as her keel , when the cause of his anxiety was rendered obvious enough .
the body of a man was seen to be affixed in the most singular manner to the smooth and shining bottom ( the penguin was <unk> and <unk> ) , and beating violently against it with every movement of the hull .
after several ineffectual efforts , made during the <unk> of the ship , and at the imminent risk of <unk> the boat i was finally disengaged from my perilous situation and taken on board  for the body proved to be my own .
it appeared that one of the <unk> having started and broken a passage through the copper , it had arrested my progress as i passed under the ship , and fastened me in so extraordinary a manner to her bottom .
the head of the bolt had made its way through the collar of the green <unk> jacket i had on , and through the back part of my neck , forcing itself out between two <unk> and just below the right ear .
i was immediately put to bed  although life seemed to be totally extinct .
there was no surgeon on board .
the captain , however , treated me with every attention  to make amends , i presume , in the eyes of his crew , for his atrocious behaviour in the previous portion of the adventure .
in the meantime , henderson had again put off from the ship , although the wind was now blowing almost a hurricane .
he had not been gone many minutes when he fell in with some fragments of our boat , and shortly afterward one of the men with him asserted that he could distinguish a cry for help at intervals amid the roaring of the tempest .
this induced the hardy seamen to persevere in their search for more than half an hour , although repeated signals to return were made them by captain block , and although every moment on the water in so frail a boat was fraught to them with the most imminent and deadly peril .
indeed , it is nearly impossible to conceive how the small jolly they were in could have escaped destruction for a single instant .
she was built , however , for the whaling service , and was fitted , as i have since had reason to believe , with <unk> , in the manner of some <unk> used on the coast of wales .
after searching in vain for about the period of time just mentioned , it was determined to get back to the ship .
they had scarcely made this resolve when a feeble cry arose from a dark object that floated rapidly by .
they pursued and soon overtook it .
it proved to be the entire deck of the <name> 's cuddy .
<name> was struggling near it , apparently in the last agonies .
upon getting hold of him it was found that he was attached by a rope to the floating timber .
this rope , it <name> be remembered , i had myself tied around his waist , and made fast to a <unk> , for the purpose of keeping him in an upright position , and my so doing , it appeared , had been ultimately the means of preserving his life .
the <name> was slightly put together , and in going down her frame naturally went to pieces ; the deck of the cuddy , as might have been expected , was lifted , by the force of the water rushing in , entirely from the main timbers , and floated ( with other fragments , no doubt ) to the surface  <name> was buoyed up with it , and thus escaped a terrible death .
it was more than an hour after being taken on board the penguin before he could give any account of himself , or be made to comprehend the nature of the accident which had befallen our boat .
at length he became thoroughly aroused , and spoke much of his sensations while in the water .
upon his first attaining any degree of consciousness , he found himself beneath the surface , whirling round and round with inconceivable rapidity , and with a rope wrapped in three or four folds tightly about his neck .
in an instant afterward he felt himself going rapidly upward , when , his head striking violently against a hard substance , he again relapsed into insensibility .
upon once more reviving he was in fuller possession of his reason  this was still , however , in the greatest degree clouded and confused .
he now knew that some accident had occurred , and that he was in the water , although his mouth was above the surface , and he could breathe with some freedom .
possibly , at this period the deck was drifting rapidly before the wind , and drawing him after it , as he floated upon his back .
of course , as long as he could have retained this position , it would have been nearly impossible that he should be drowned .
presently a surge threw him directly athwart the deck , and this post he endeavored to maintain , screaming at intervals for help .
just before he was discovered by mr. henderson , he had been obliged to relax his hold through exhaustion , and , falling into the sea , had given himself up for lost .
during the whole period of his struggles he had not the faintest recollection of the <name> , nor of the matters in connexion with the source of his disaster .
a vague feeling of terror and despair had taken entire possession of his faculties .
when he was finally picked up , every power of his mind had failed him ; and , as before said , it was nearly an hour after getting on board the penguin before he became fully aware of his condition .
in regard to myself  i was <unk> from a state bordering very nearly upon death ( and after every other means had been tried in vain for three hours and a half ) by vigorous friction with <unk> bathed in hot oil  a proceeding suggested by <name> .
the wound in my neck , although of an ugly appearance , proved of little real consequence , and i soon recovered from its effects .
the penguin got into port about nine o'clock in the morning , after encountering one of the severest gales ever experienced off nantucket .
both <name> and myself managed to appear at mr. barnard 's in time for breakfast  which , luckily , was somewhat late , owing to the party over night .
i suppose all at the table were too much fatigued themselves to notice our jaded appearance  of course , it would not have borne a very rigid scrutiny .
schoolboys , however , can accomplish wonders in the way of deception , and i verily believe not one of our friends in nantucket had the slightest suspicion that the terrible story told by some sailors in town of their having run down a vessel at sea and drowned some thirty or forty poor devils , had reference either to the <name> , my companion , or myself .
we two have since very frequently talked the matter over  but never without a shudder .
in one of our conversations <name> frankly confessed to me , that in his whole life he had at no time experienced so excruciating a sense of dismay , as when on board our little boat he first discovered the extent of his intoxication , and felt himself sinking beneath its influence .
chapter 2 in no affairs of mere prejudice , pro or con , do we deduce inferences with entire certainty , even from the most simple data .
it might be supposed that a catastrophe such as i have just related would have effectually cooled my incipient passion for the sea .
on the contrary , i never experienced a more ardent longing for the wild adventures incident to the life of a navigator than within a week after our miraculous deliverance .
this short period proved amply long enough to <unk> from my memory the shadows , and bring out in vivid light all the <unk> exciting points of color , all the picturesqueness , of the late perilous accident .
my conversations with <name> grew daily more frequent and more intensely full of interest .
he had a manner of relating his stories of the ocean ( more than one half of which i now suspect to have been sheer <unk> ) well adapted to have weight with one of my enthusiastic temperament and somewhat gloomy although glowing imagination .
it is strange , too , that he most strongly enlisted my feelings in behalf of the life of a seaman , when he depicted his more terrible moments of suffering and despair .
for the bright side of the painting i had a limited sympathy .
my visions were of shipwreck and famine ; of death or captivity among barbarian hordes ; of a lifetime dragged out in sorrow and tears , upon some gray and desolate rock , in an ocean unapproachable and unknown .
such visions or desires  for they amounted to desires  are common , i have since been assured , to the whole numerous race of the melancholy among men  at the time of which i speak i regarded them only as prophetic glimpses of a <name> which i felt myself in a measure bound to fulfil .
<name> thoroughly entered into my state of mind .
it is probable , indeed , that our intimate communion had resulted in a partial <unk> of character .
about eighteen months after the period of the <name> 's disaster , the firm of <name> and <unk> ( a house connected in some manner with the messieurs enderby , i believe , of liverpool ) were engaged in repairing and fitting out the brig grampus for a whaling voyage .
she was an old hulk , and scarcely <unk> when all was done to her that could be done .
i hardly know why she was chosen in preference to other good vessels belonging to the same owners  but so it was .
mr. barnard was appointed to command her , and <name> was going with him .
while the brig was getting ready , he frequently urged upon me the excellency of the opportunity now offered for indulging my <name> of travel .
he found me by no means an unwilling listener  yet the matter could not be so easily arranged .
my father made no direct opposition ; but my mother went into hysterics at the bare mention of the design ; and , more than all , my grandfather , from whom i expected much , vowed to cut me off with a shilling if i should ever <unk> the subject to him again .
these difficulties , however , so far from abating my <name> , only added fuel to the flame .
i determined to go at all hazards ; and , having made known my intentions to <name> , we set about arranging a plan by which it might be accomplished .
in the meantime i forbore speaking to any of my relations in regard to the voyage , and , as i busied myself ostensibly with my usual studies , it was supposed that i had abandoned the design .
i have since frequently examined my conduct on this occasion with sentiments of displeasure as well as of surprise .
the intense hypocrisy i made use of for the furtherance of my project  an hypocrisy pervading every word and action of my life for so long a period of time  could only have been rendered tolerable to myself by the wild and burning expectation with which i looked forward to the fulfilment of my <unk> visions of travel .
in pursuance of my scheme of deception , i was necessarily obliged to leave much to the management of <name> , who was employed for the greater part of every day on board the grampus , attending to some arrangements for his father in the cabin and cabin hold .
at night , however , we were sure to have a conference and talk over our hopes .
after nearly a month passed in this manner , without our hitting upon any plan we thought likely to succeed , he told me at last that he had determined upon everything necessary .
i had a relation living in new bedford , a mr. <name> , at whose house i was in the habit of spending occasionally two or three weeks at a time .
the brig was to sail about the middle of <name> ( <name> , 1827 ) , and it was agreed that , a day or two before her putting to sea , my father was to receive a note , as usual , from mr. <name> , asking me to come over and spend a fortnight with <name> and <unk> ( his sons ) .
<name> charged himself with the <unk> of this note and getting it delivered .
having set out as supposed , for new bedford , i was then to report myself to my companion , who would contrive a hiding-place for me in the grampus .
this hiding-place , he assured me , would be rendered sufficiently comfortable for a residence of many days , during which i was not to make my appearance .
when the brig had proceeded so far on her course as to make any turning back a matter out of question , i should then , he said , be formally installed in all the comforts of the cabin ; and as to his father , he would only laugh heartily at the joke .
vessels enough would be met with by which a letter might be sent home explaining the adventure to my parents .
the middle of <name> at length arrived , and every thing had been matured .
the note was written and delivered , and on a monday morning i left the house for the new bedford packet , as supposed .
i went , however , straight to <name> , who was waiting for me at the corner of a street .
it had been our original plan that i should keep out of the way until dark , and then slip on board the brig ; but , as there was now a thick fog in our favor , it was agreed to lose no time in secreting me .
<name> led the way to the wharf , and i followed at a little distance , enveloped in a thick seaman 's cloak , which he had brought with him , so that my person might not be easily recognized .
just as we turned the second corner , after passing mr. <name> 's well , who should appear , standing right in front of me , and looking me full in the face , but old mr. peterson , my grandfather .
" why , bless my soul , <name> , " said he , after a long pause , " why , why ,  whose dirty cloak is that you have on ? "
" sir ! "
i replied , assuming , as well as i could , in the <unk> of the moment , an air of offended surprise , and talking in the <unk> of all imaginable tones  " sir !
you are a <unk> mistaken  my name , in the first place , <unk> nothing at all like <unk> , and i 'd want you for to know better , you blackguard , than to call my new <unk> a <unk> one . "
for my life i could hardly refrain from screaming with laughter at the odd manner in which the old gentleman received this handsome rebuke .
he started back two or three steps , turned first pale and then excessively red , threw up his spectacles , then , putting them down , ran full tilt at me , with his umbrella uplifted .
he stopped short , however , in his career , as if struck with a sudden recollection ; and presently , turning round , hobbled off down the street , shaking all the while with rage , and muttering between his teeth : " wo n't do  new glasses  thought it was <name>  d  d good-for-nothing salt water long <name> . "
after this narrow escape we proceeded with greater caution , and arrived at our point of destination in safety .
there were only one or two of the hands on board , and these were busy forward , doing something to the forecastle <unk> .
captain barnard , we knew very well , was engaged at <name> and <unk> 's , and would remain there until late in the evening , so we had little to apprehend on his account .
<name> went first up the vessel 's side , and in a short while i followed him , without being noticed by the men at work .
we proceeded at once into the cabin , and found no person there .
it was fitted up in the most comfortable style  a thing somewhat unusual in a <unk> .
there were four very excellent staterooms , with wide and convenient berths .
there was also a large stove , i took notice , and a remarkably thick and valuable carpet covering the floor of both the cabin and staterooms .
the ceiling was full seven feet high , and , in short , every thing appeared of a more roomy and agreeable nature than i had anticipated .
<name> , however , would allow me but little time for observation , insisting upon the necessity of my concealing myself as soon as possible .
he led the way into his own stateroom , which was on the starboard side of the brig , and next to the <unk> .
upon entering , he closed the door and bolted it .
i thought i had never seen a nicer little room than the one in which i now found myself .
it was about ten feet long , and had only one berth , which , as i said before , was wide and convenient .
in that portion of the closet nearest the <unk> there was a space of four feet square , containing a table , a chair , and a set of hanging shelves full of books , chiefly books of voyages and travels .
there were many other little comforts in the room , among which i ought not to forget a kind of safe or refrigerator , in which <name> pointed out to me a host of delicacies , both in the eating and drinking department .
he now pressed with his knuckles upon a certain spot of the carpet in one corner of the space just mentioned , letting me know that a portion of the flooring , about sixteen inches square , had been neatly cut out and again adjusted .
as he pressed , this portion rose up at one end sufficiently to allow the passage of his finger beneath .
in this manner he raised the mouth of the trap ( to which the carpet was still fastened by <unk> ) , and i found that it led into the after hold .
he next lit a small taper by means of a <unk> match , and , placing the light in a dark lantern , descended with it through the opening , bidding me follow .
i did so , and he then pulled the cover upon the hole , by means of a nail driven into the under side  the carpet , of course , resuming its original position on the floor of the stateroom , and all traces of the aperture being concealed .
the taper gave out so feeble a <name> that it was with the greatest difficulty i could grope my way through the confused mass of lumber among which i now found myself .
by degrees , however , my eyes became accustomed to the gloom , and i proceeded with less trouble , holding on to the skirts of my friend 's coat .
he brought me , at length , after creeping and winding through innumerable narrow passages , to an <unk> box , such as is used sometimes for packing fine earthenware .
it was nearly four feet high , and full six long , but very narrow .
two large empty <unk> lay on the top of it , and above these , again , a vast quantity of straw matting , piled up as high as the floor of the cabin .
in every other direction around was wedged as closely as possible , even up to the ceiling , a complete chaos of almost every species of <unk> , together with a heterogeneous medley of crates , <unk> , barrels , and bales , so that it seemed a matter no less than miraculous that we had discovered any passage at all to the box .
i afterward found that <name> had purposely arranged the stowage in this hold with a view to affording me a thorough concealment , having had only one assistant in the labour , a man not going out in the brig .
my companion now showed me that one of the ends of the box could be removed at pleasure .
he slipped it aside and displayed the interior , at which i was excessively amused .
a mattress from one of the cabin berths covered the whole of its bottom , and it contained almost every article of mere comfort which could be crowded into so small a space , allowing me , at the same time , sufficient room for my accommodation , either in a sitting position or lying at full length .
among other things , there were some books , pen , ink , and paper , three blankets , a large jug full of water , a keg of <unk> , three or four immense <unk> sausages , an enormous ham , a cold leg of roast mutton , and half a dozen bottles of <unk> and <unk> .
i proceeded immediately to take possession of my little apartment , and this with feelings of higher satisfaction , i am sure , than any monarch ever experienced upon entering a new palace .
<name> now pointed out to me the method of fastening the open end of the box , and then , holding the taper close to the deck , showed me a piece of dark <unk> lying along it .
this , he said , extended from my hiding-place throughout all the necessary windings among the lumber , to a nail which was driven into the deck of the hold , immediately beneath the trap-door leading into his stateroom .
by means of this cord i should be enabled readily to trace my way out without his guidance , provided any unlooked-for accident should render such a step necessary .
he now took his departure , leaving with me the lantern , together with a copious supply of tapers and <unk> , and promising to pay me a visit as often as he could contrive to do so without observation .
this was on the seventeenth of <name> .
i remained three days and nights ( as nearly as i could guess ) in my hiding-place without getting out of it at all , except twice for the purpose of stretching my limbs by standing erect between two crates just opposite the opening .
during the whole period i saw nothing of <name> ; but this occasioned me little uneasiness , as i knew the brig was expected to put to sea every hour , and in the bustle he would not easily find opportunities of coming down to me .
at length i heard the trap open and shut , and presently he called in a low voice , asking if all was well , and if there was any thing i wanted .
" nothing , " i replied ; " i am as comfortable as can be ; when <name> the brig sail ? "
" she <name> be under weigh in less than half an hour , " he answered .
" i came to let you know , and for fear you should be uneasy at my absence .
i shall not have a chance of coming down again for some time  perhaps for three or four days more .
all is going on right <unk> .
after i go up and close the trap , do you creep along by the <unk> to where the nail is driven in .
you <name> find my watch there  it may be useful to you , as you have no daylight to keep time by .
i suppose you ca n't tell how long you have been buried  only three days  this is the twentieth .
i would bring the watch to your box , but am afraid of being missed . "
with this he went up .
in about an hour after he had gone i distinctly felt the brig in motion , and congratulated myself upon having at length fairly commenced a voyage .
satisfied with this idea , i determined to make my mind as easy as possible , and await the course of events until i should be permitted to exchange the box for the more roomy , although hardly more comfortable , accommodations of the cabin .
my first care was to get the watch .
leaving the taper burning , i groped along in the dark , following the cord through windings innumerable , in some of which i discovered that , after toiling a long distance , i was brought back within a foot or two of a former position .
at length i reached the nail , and securing the object of my journey , returned with it in safety .
i now looked over the books which had been so thoughtfully provided , and selected the expedition of <name> and clarke to the mouth of the columbia .
with this i amused myself for some time , when , growing sleepy , i extinguished the light with great care , and soon fell into a sound slumber .
upon awakening i felt strangely confused in mind , and some time elapsed before i could bring to recollection all the various circumstances of my situation .
by degrees , however , i remembered all .
striking a light , i looked at the watch ; but it was run down , and there were , consequently , no means of determining how long i slept .
my limbs were greatly cramped , and i was forced to relieve them by standing between the crates .
presently feeling an almost ravenous appetite , i bethought myself of the cold mutton , some of which i had eaten just before going to sleep , and found excellent .
what was my astonishment in discovering it to be in a state of absolute <unk> !
this circumstance occasioned me great <unk> ; for , connecting it with the disorder of mind i experienced upon awakening , i began to suppose that i must have slept for an inordinately long period of time .
the close atmosphere of the hold might have had something to do with this , and might , in the end , be productive of the most serious results .
my head ached excessively ; i fancied that i <name> every breath with difficulty ; and , in short , i was oppressed with a multitude of gloomy feelings .
still i could not venture to make any disturbance by opening the trap or otherwise , and , having wound up the watch , contented myself as well as possible .
throughout the whole of the next tedious twenty-four hours no person came to my relief , and i could not help accusing <name> of the <unk> <unk> .
what alarmed me chiefly was , that the water in my jug was reduced to about half a pint , and i was suffering much from thirst , having eaten freely of the <unk> sausages after the loss of my mutton .
i became very uneasy , and could no longer take any interest in my books .
i was overpowered , too , with a <name> to sleep , yet trembled at the thought of indulging it , lest there might exist some pernicious influence , like that of burning charcoal , in the confined air of the hold .
in the meantime the roll of the brig told me that we were far in the main ocean , and a dull humming sound , which reached my ears as if from an immense distance , convinced me no ordinary <name> was blowing .
i could not imagine a reason for the absence of <name> .
we were surely far enough advanced on our voyage to allow of my going up .
some accident might have happened to him  but i could think of none which would account for his suffering me to remain so long a prisoner , except , indeed , his having suddenly died or fallen overboard , and upon this idea i could not dwell with any degree of <name> .
it was possible that we had been baffled by head winds , and were still in the near vicinity of nantucket .
this notion , however , i was forced to abandon ; for such being the case , the brig must have frequently gone about ; and i was entirely satisfied , from her continual inclination to the larboard , that she had been sailing all along with a steady breeze on her starboard quarter .
besides , granting that we were still in the neighborhood of the island , why should not <name> have visited me and informed me of the circumstance ?
pondering in this manner upon the difficulties of my solitary and cheerless condition , i resolved to wait yet another twenty-four hours , when , if no relief were obtained , i would make my way to the trap , and endeavour either to hold a parley with my friend , or get at least a little fresh air through the opening , and a further supply of water from the stateroom .
while occupied with this thought , however , i fell in spite of every exertion to the contrary , into a state of profound sleep , or rather stupor .
my dreams were of the most terrific description .
every species of calamity and horror befell me .
among other miseries i was smothered to death between huge pillows , by demons of the most ghastly and ferocious aspect .
immense serpents held me in their embrace , and looked earnestly in my face with their fearfully shining eyes .
then deserts , limitless , and of the most forlorn and awe-inspiring character , spread themselves out before me .
immensely tall trunks of trees , gray and leafless , rose up in endless succession as far as the eye could reach .
their roots were concealed in <unk> morasses , whose dreary water lay intensely black , still , and altogether terrible , beneath .
and the strange trees seemed endowed with a human vitality , and waving to and fro their skeleton arms , were crying to the silent waters for <name> , in the shrill and piercing accents of the most acute agony and despair .
the scene changed ; and i stood , naked and alone , amidst the burning <unk> of sahara .
at my feet lay crouched a fierce lion of the tropics .
suddenly his wild eyes opened and fell upon me .
with a conclusive bound he sprang to his feet , and laid bare his horrible teeth .
in another instant there burst from his red throat a roar like the thunder of the firmament , and i fell impetuously to the earth .
stifling in a paroxysm of terror , i at last found myself partially awake .
my dream , then , was not all a dream .
now , at least , i was in possession of my senses .
the paws of some huge and real monster were pressing heavily upon my bosom  his hot breath was in my ear  and his white and ghastly fangs were gleaming upon me through the gloom .
had a thousand lives <name> upon the movement of a limb or the utterance of a syllable , i could have neither stirred nor spoken .
the beast , whatever it was , retained his position without attempting any immediate violence , while i lay in an utterly helpless , and , i fancied , a dying condition beneath him .
i felt that my powers of body and mind were fast leaving me  in a word , that i was perishing , and perishing of sheer fright .
my <name> swam  i grew deadly sick  my vision failed  even the glaring eyeballs above me grew dim .
making a last strong effort , i at length breathed a faint ejaculation to god , and resigned myself to die .
the sound of my voice seemed to arouse all the latent fury of the animal .
he precipitated himself at full length upon my body ; but what was my astonishment , when , with a long and low whine , he commenced licking my face and hands with the greatest eagerness , and with the most extravagant demonstration of affection and <name> !
i was bewildered , utterly lost in amazement  but i could not forget the peculiar whine of my newfoundland dog tiger , and the odd manner of his caresses i well knew .
it was he .
i experienced a sudden rush of blood to my temples  a giddy and overpowering sense of deliverance and <unk> .
i rose hurriedly from the mattress upon which i had been lying , and , throwing myself upon the neck of my faithful follower and friend , relieved the long oppression of my bosom in a flood of the most passionate tears .
as upon a former occasion my conceptions were in a state of the greatest <unk> and confusion after leaving the mattress .
for a long time i found it nearly impossible to connect any ideas ; but , by very slow degrees , my thinking faculties returned , and i again called to memory the several incidents of my condition .
for the presence of tiger i tried in vain to account ; and after <unk> myself with a thousand different conjectures respecting him , was forced to content myself with rejoicing that he was with me to share my dreary solitude , and render me comfort by his caresses .
most people love their dogs  but for tiger i had an affection far more ardent than common ; and never , certainly , did any creature more truly deserve it .
for seven years he had been my inseparable companion , and in a multitude of instances had given evidence of all the <name> qualities for which we value the animal .
i had rescued him , when a puppy , from the clutches of a malignant little villain in nantucket who was leading him , with a rope around his neck , to the water ; and the grown dog repaid the obligation , about three years afterward , by saving me from the <unk> of a street robber .
getting now hold of the watch , i found , upon applying it to my ear , that it had again run down ; but at this i was not at all surprised , being convinced , from the peculiar state of my feelings , that i had slept , as before , for a very long period of time , how long , it was of course impossible to say .
i was burning up with fever , and my thirst was almost intolerable .
i felt about the box for my little remaining supply of water , for i had no light , the taper having burnt to the socket of the lantern , and the <unk> not coming readily to hand .
upon finding the jug , however , i discovered it to be empty  tiger , no doubt , having been tempted to drink it , as well as to devour the remnant of mutton , the bone of which lay , well picked , by the opening of the box .
the spoiled meat i could well spare , but my heart sank as i thought of the water .
i was feeble in the extreme  so much so that i shook all over , as with an ague , at the slightest movement or exertion .
to add to my troubles , the brig was pitching and rolling with great violence , and the <unk> which lay upon my box were in momentary danger of falling down , so as to block up the only way of ingress or egress .
i felt , also , terrible sufferings from <unk> .
these considerations determined me to make my way , at all hazards , to the trap , and obtain immediate relief , before i should be <unk> from doing so altogether .
having come to this resolve , i again felt about for the <unk> and tapers .
the former i found after some little trouble ; but , not discovering the tapers as soon as i had expected ( for i remembered very nearly the spot in which i had placed them ) , i gave up the search for the present , and bidding tiger lie quiet , began at once my journey toward the trap .
in this attempt my great feebleness became more than ever apparent .
it was with the utmost difficulty i could crawl along at all , and very frequently my limbs sank suddenly from beneath me ; when , falling prostrate on my face , i would remain for some minutes in a state bordering on insensibility .
still i struggled forward by slow degrees , dreading every moment that i should swoon amid the narrow and intricate windings of the lumber , in which event i had nothing but death to expect as the result .
at length , upon making a push forward with all the energy i could command , i struck my forehead violently against the sharp corner of an <unk> crate .
the accident only stunned me for a few moments ; but i found , to my inexpressible grief , that the quick and violent roll of the vessel had thrown the crate entirely across my path , so as effectually to block up the passage .
with my utmost exertions i could not move it a single inch from its position , it being closely wedged in among the surrounding boxes and <unk> .
it became necessary , therefore , enfeebled as i was , either to leave the guidance of the <unk> and seek out a new passage , or to climb over the obstacle , and resume the path on the other side .
the former alternative presented too many difficulties and dangers to be thought of without a shudder .
in my present weak state of both mind and body , i should infallibly lose my way if i attempted it , and perish miserably amid the dismal and disgusting <unk> of the hold .
i proceeded , therefore , without hesitation , to summon up all my remaining strength and fortitude , and endeavour , as i best might , to clamber over the crate .
upon standing erect , with this end in view , i found the undertaking even a more serious task than my fears had led me to imagine .
on each side of the narrow passage arose a complete wall of various heavy lumber , which the least blunder on my part might be the means of bringing down upon my head ; or , if this accident did not occur , the path might be effectually blocked up against my return by the descending mass , as it was in front by the obstacle there .
the crate itself was a long and unwieldy box , upon which no foothold could be obtained .
in vain i attempted , by every means in my power , to reach the top , with the <name> of being thus enabled to draw myself up .
had i succeeded in reaching it , it is certain that my strength would have proved utterly inadequate to the task of getting over , and it was better in every respect that i failed .
at length , in a desperate effort to force the crate from its ground , i felt a strong vibration in the side next me .
i thrust my hand eagerly to the edge of the planks , and found that a very large one was loose .
with my pocket-knife , which , luckily , i had with me , i succeeded , after great labour , in prying it entirely off ; and getting it through the aperture , discovered , to my exceeding <name> , that there were no boards on the opposite side  in other words , that the top was wanting , it being the bottom through which i had forced my way .
i now met with no important difficulty in proceeding along the line until i finally reached the nail .
with a beating heart i stood erect , and with a gentle touch pressed against the cover of the trap .
it did not rise as soon as i had expected , and i pressed it with somewhat more determination , still dreading lest some other person than <name> might be in his state-room .
the door , however , to my astonishment , remained steady , and i became somewhat uneasy , for i knew that it had formerly required but little or no effort to remove it .
i pushed it strongly  it was nevertheless firm : with all my strength  it still did not give way : with rage , with fury , with despair  it set at defiance my utmost efforts ; and it was evident , from the <unk> nature of the resistance , that the hole had either been discovered and effectually nailed up , or that some immense weight had been placed upon it , which it was useless to think of removing .
my sensations were those of extreme horror and dismay .
in vain i attempted to reason on the probable cause of my being thus entombed .
i could summon up no connected chain of reflection , and , sinking on the floor , gave way , <unk> , to the most gloomy imaginings , in which the dreadful deaths of thirst , famine , suffocation , and premature interment crowded upon me as the prominent disasters to be encountered .
at length there returned to me some portion of presence of mind .
i arose , and felt with my fingers for the seams or cracks of the aperture .
having found them , i examined them closely to ascertain if they emitted any light from the state-room ; but none was visible .
i then forced the blade of my <unk> through them , until i met with some hard obstacle .
scraping against it , i discovered it to be a solid mass of iron , which , from its peculiar wavy feel as i passed the blade along it , i concluded to be a <unk> .
the only course now left me was to retrace my way to the box , and there either yield to my sad fate , or try so to <unk> my mind as to admit of my arranging some plan of escape .
i immediately set about the attempt , and succeeded , after innumerable difficulties , in getting back .
as i sank , utterly exhausted , upon the mattress , tiger threw himself at full length by my side , and seemed as if desirous , by his caresses , of consoling me in my troubles , and urging me to bear them with fortitude .
the <unk> of his behavior at length forcibly arrested my attention .
after licking my face and hands for some minutes , he would suddenly cease doing so , and utter a low whine .
upon reaching out my hand toward him , i then invariably found him lying on his back , with his paws uplifted .
this conduct , so frequently repeated , appeared strange , and i could in no manner account for it .
as the dog seemed distressed , i concluded that he had received some injury ; and , taking his paws in my hands , i examined them one by one , but found no sign of any hurt .
i then supposed him hungry , and gave him a large piece of ham , which he devoured with avidity  afterward , however , resuming his extraordinary manoeuvres .
i now imagined that he was suffering , like myself , the torments of thirst , and was about adopting this conclusion as the true one , when the idea occurred to me that i had as yet only examined his paws , and that there might possibly be a wound upon some portion of his body or head .
the latter i felt carefully over , but found nothing .
on passing my hand , however , along his back , i perceived a slight erection of the hair extending completely across it .
<unk> this with my finger , i discovered a string , and tracing it up , found that it encircled the whole body .
upon a closer scrutiny , i came across a small slip of what had the feeling of letter paper , through which the string had been fastened in such a manner as to bring it immediately beneath the left shoulder of the animal .
chapter 3 the thought instantly occurred to me that the paper was a note from <name> , and that some unaccountable accident having happened to prevent his relieving me from my dungeon , he had devised this method of <unk> me with the true state of affairs .
trembling with eagerness , i now commenced another search for my phosphorus matches and tapers .
i had a confused recollection of having put them carefully away just before falling asleep ; and , indeed , previously to my last journey to the trap , i had been able to remember the exact spot where i had deposited them .
but now i endeavored in vain to call it to mind , and busied myself for a full hour in a fruitless and vexatious search for the missing articles ; never , surely , was there a more tantalizing state of anxiety and suspense .
at length , while groping about , with my head close to the ballast , near the opening of the box , and outside of it , i perceived a faint glimmering of light in the direction of the steerage .
greatly surprised , i endeavored to make my way toward it , as it appeared to be but a few feet from my position .
scarcely had i moved with this intention , when i lost sight of the glimmer entirely , and , before i could bring it into view again , was obliged to feel along by the box until i had exactly resumed my original situation .
now , moving my head with caution to and fro , i found that , by proceeding slowly , with great care , in an opposite direction to that in which i had at first started , i was enabled to draw near the light , still keeping it in view .
presently i came directly upon it ( having squeezed my way through innumerable narrow windings ) , and found that it proceeded from some fragments of my matches lying in an empty barrel turned upon its side .
i was wondering how they came in such a place , when my hand fell upon two or three pieces of taper wax , which had been evidently mumbled by the dog .
i concluded at once that he had devoured the whole of my supply of candles , and i felt hopeless of being ever able to read the note of <name> .
the small remnants of the wax were so mashed up among other rubbish in the barrel , that i despaired of <unk> any service from them , and left them as they were .
the phosphorus , of which there was only a speck or two , i gathered up as well as i could , and returned with it , after much difficulty , to my box , where tiger had all the while remained .
what to do next i could not tell .
the hold was so intensely dark that i could not see my hand , however close i would hold it to my face .
the white slip of paper could barely be discerned , and not even that when i looked at it directly ; by turning the exterior portions of the retina toward it  that is to say , by surveying it slightly askance , i found that it became in some measure perceptible .
thus the gloom of my prison may be imagined , and the note of my friend , if indeed it were a note from him , seemed only likely to throw me into further trouble , by disquieting to no purpose my already enfeebled and agitated mind .
in vain i revolved in my <name> a multitude of absurd <unk> for procuring light  such <unk> precisely as a man in the <unk> sleep occasioned by opium would be apt to fall upon for a similar purpose  each and all of which appear by turns to the dreamer the most reasonable and the most preposterous of conceptions , just as the reasoning or imaginative faculties flicker , alternately , one above the other .
at last an idea occurred to me which seemed rational , and which gave me cause to wonder , very justly , that i had not entertained it before .
i placed the slip of paper on the back of a book , and , collecting the fragments of the phosphorus matches which i had brought from the barrel , laid them together upon the paper .
i then , with the palm of my hand , rubbed the whole over quickly , yet steadily .
a clear light diffused itself immediately throughout the whole surface ; and had there been any writing upon it , i should not have experienced the least difficulty , i am sure , in reading it .
not a syllable was there , however  nothing but a dreary and unsatisfactory blank ; the illumination died away in a few seconds , and my heart died away within me as it went .
i have before stated more than once that my intellect , for some period prior to this , had been in a condition nearly bordering on <unk> .
there were , to be sure , momentary intervals of perfect sanity , and , now and then , even of energy ; but these were few .
it must be remembered that i had been , for many days certainly , <unk> the almost <unk> atmosphere of a close hold in a whaling vessel , and for a long portion of that time but scantily supplied with water .
for the last fourteen or fifteen hours i had none  nor had i slept during that time .
salt provisions of the most exciting kind had been my chief , and , indeed , since the loss of the mutton , my only supply of food , with the exception of the <unk> ; and these latter were utterly useless to me , as they were too dry and hard to be swallowed in the swollen and parched condition of my throat .
i was now in a high state of fever , and in every respect exceedingly ill .
this <name> account for the fact that many miserable hours of despondency elapsed after my last adventure with the phosphorus , before the thought suggested itself that i had examined only one side of the paper .
i shall not attempt to describe my feelings of rage ( for i believe i was more angry than any thing else ) when the <unk> oversight i had committed flashed suddenly upon my perception .
the blunder itself would have been unimportant , had not my own folly and impetuosity rendered it otherwise  in my disappointment at not finding some words upon the slip , i had <unk> torn it in pieces and thrown it away , it was impossible to say where .
from the worst part of this dilemma i was relieved by the sagacity of tiger .
having got , after a long search , a small piece of the note , i put it to the dog 's nose , and endeavored to make him understand that he must bring me the rest of it .
to my astonishment , ( for i had taught him none of the usual tricks for which his breed are famous , ) he seemed to enter at once into my meaning , and , rummaging about for a few moments , soon found another considerable portion .
bringing me this , he paused awhile , and , rubbing his nose against my hand , appeared to be waiting for my approval of what he had done .
i patted him on the head , when he immediately made off again .
it was now some minutes before he came back  but when he did come , he brought with him a large slip , which proved to be all the paper missing  it having been torn , it seems , only into three pieces .
luckily , i had no trouble in finding what few fragments of the phosphorus were left  being guided by the indistinct glow one or two of the particles still emitted .
my difficulties had taught me the necessity of caution , and i now took time to reflect upon what i was about to do .
it was very probable , i considered , that some words were written upon that side of the paper which had not been examined  but which side was that ?
fitting the pieces together gave me no clew in this respect , although it assured me that the words ( if there were any ) would be found all on one side , and connected in a proper manner , as written .
there was the greater necessity of ascertaining the point in question beyond a doubt , as the phosphorus remaining would be altogether insufficient for a third attempt , should i fail in the one i was now about to make .
i placed the paper on a book as before , and sat for some minutes thoughtfully revolving the matter over in my mind .
at last i thought it barely possible that the written side might have some <unk> on its surface , which a delicate sense of feeling might enable me to detect .
i determined to make the experiment and passed my finger very carefully over the side which first presented itself .
nothing , however , was perceptible , and i turned the paper , adjusting it on the book .
i now again carried my forefinger cautiously along , when i was aware of an exceedingly slight , but still <unk> glow , which followed as it proceeded .
this , i knew , must arise from some very minute remaining particles of the phosphorus with which i had covered the paper in my previous attempt .
the other , or under side , then , was that on which lay the writing , if writing there should finally prove to be .
again i turned the note , and went to work as i had previously done .
having rubbed in the phosphorus , a brilliancy ensued as before  but this time several lines of ms. in a large hand , and apparently in red ink , became distinctly visible .
the glimmer , although sufficiently bright , was but momentary .
still , had i not been too greatly excited , there would have been ample time enough for me to peruse the whole three sentences before me  for i saw there were three .
in my anxiety , however , to read all at once , i succeeded only in reading the seven concluding words , which thus appeared  " blood  your life depends upon lying close . "
had i been able to ascertain the entire contents of the <unk> full meaning of the admonition which my friend had thus attempted to convey , that admonition , even although it should have revealed a story of disaster the most unspeakable , could not , i am firmly convinced , have imbued my mind with one <unk> of the harrowing and yet indefinable horror with which i was inspired by the fragmentary warning thus received .
and " blood , " too , that word of all words  so rife at all times with mystery , and suffering , and terror  how <unk> full of import did it now appear  how chilly and heavily ( disjointed , as it thus was , from any foregoing words to <unk> or render it distinct ) did its vague syllables fall , amid the deep gloom of my prison , into the innermost recesses of my soul !
<name> had , undoubtedly , good reasons for wishing me to remain concealed , and i formed a thousand surmises as to what they could be  but i could think of nothing affording a satisfactory solution of the mystery .
just after returning from my last journey to the trap , and before my attention had been otherwise directed by the singular conduct of tiger , i had come to the resolution of making myself heard at all events by those on board , or , if i could not succeed in this directly , of trying to cut my way through the <unk> deck .
the half certainty which i felt of being able to accomplish one of these two purposes in the last emergency , had given me courage ( which i should not otherwise have had ) to endure the evils of my situation .
the few words i had been able to read , however , had cut me off from these final resources , and i now , for the first time , felt all the misery of my fate .
in a paroxysm of despair i threw myself again upon the mattress , where , for about the period of a day and night , i lay in a kind of stupor , relieved only by momentary intervals of reason and recollection .
at length i once more arose , and busied myself in reflection upon the horrors which encompassed me .
for another twenty-four hours it was barely possible that i might exist without water  for a longer time i could not do so .
during the first portion of my imprisonment i had made free use of the <unk> with which <name> had supplied me , but they only served to excite fever , without in the least degree <unk> thirst .
i had now only about a gill left , and this was of a species of strong peach <unk> at which my stomach revolted .
the sausages were entirely consumed ; of the ham nothing remained but a small piece of the skin ; and all the biscuit , except a few fragments of one , had been eaten by tiger .
to add to my troubles , i found that my headache was increasing momentarily , and with it the species of delirium which had distressed me more or less since my first falling asleep .
for some hours past it had been with the greatest difficulty i could breathe at all , and now each attempt at so doing was attended with the most depressing spasmodic action of the chest .
but there was still another and very different source of <unk> , and one , indeed , whose harassing terrors had been the chief means of arousing me to exertion from my stupor on the mattress .
it arose from the demeanor of the dog .
i first observed an alteration in his conduct while rubbing in the phosphorus on the paper in my last attempt .
as i rubbed , he ran his nose against my hand with a slight snarl ; but i was too greatly excited at the time to pay much attention to the circumstance .
soon afterward , it <name> be remembered , i threw myself on the mattress , and fell into a species of lethargy .
presently i became aware of a singular hissing sound close at my ears , and discovered it to proceed from tiger , who was panting and wheezing in a state of the greatest apparent excitement , his eyeballs flashing fiercely through the gloom .
i spoke to him , when he replied with a low growl , and then remained quiet .
presently i relapsed into my stupor , from which i was again awakened in a similar manner .
this was repeated three or four times , until finally his behaviour inspired me with so great a degree of fear , that i became fully aroused .
he was now lying close by the door of the box , snarling fearfully , although in a kind of undertone , and grinding his teeth as if strongly convulsed .
i had no doubt whatever that the want of water or the confined atmosphere of the hold had driven him mad , and i was at a loss what course to pursue .
i could not endure the thought of killing him , yet it seemed absolutely necessary for my own safety .
i could distinctly perceive his eyes fastened upon me with an expression of the most deadly animosity , and i expected every instant that he would attack me .
at last i could endure my terrible situation no longer , and determined to make my way from the box at all hazards , and dispatch him , if his opposition should render it necessary for me to do so .
to get out , i had to pass directly over his body , and he already seemed to anticipate my design  missing himself upon his fore-legs ( as i perceived by the altered position of his eyes ) , and displayed the whole of his white fangs , which were easily discernible .
i took the remains of the <unk> , and the bottle containing the <unk> , and secured them about my person , together with a large <unk> which <name> had left me  then , folding my cloak around me as closely as possible , i made a movement toward the mouth of the box .
no sooner did i do this , than the dog sprang with a loud growl toward my throat .
the whole weight of his body struck me on the right shoulder , and i fell violently to the left , while the enraged animal passed entirely over me .
i had fallen upon my knees , with my head buried among the blankets , and these protected me from a second furious assault , during which i felt the sharp teeth pressing vigorously upon the woollen which enveloped my neck  yet , luckily , without being able to penetrate all the folds .
i was now beneath the dog , and a few moments would place me completely in his power .
despair gave me strength , and i rose boldly up , shaking him from me by main force , and dragging with me the blankets from the mattress .
these i now threw over him , and before he could extricate himself , i had got through the door and closed it effectually against his pursuit .
in this struggle , however , i had been forced to drop the morsel of <unk> , and i now found my whole stock of provisions reduced to a single gill of <unk> .
as this reflection crossed my mind , i felt myself actuated by one of those fits of <unk> which might be supposed to influence a spoiled child in similar circumstances , and , raising the bottle to my lips , i drained it to the last drop , and dashed it furiously upon the floor .
scarcely had the <name> of the crash died away , when i heard my name pronounced in an eager but subdued voice , issuing from the direction of the steerage .
so unexpected was anything of the kind , and so intense was the emotion excited within me by the sound , that i endeavoured in vain to reply .
my powers of speech totally failed , and in an agony of terror lest my friend should conclude me dead , and return without attempting to reach me , i stood up between the crates near the door of the box , trembling convulsively , and gasping and struggling for utterance .
had a thousand words depended upon a syllable , i could not have spoken it .
there was a slight movement now audible among the lumber somewhere forward of my station .
the sound presently grew less distinct , then again less so , and still less .
shall i ever forget my feelings at this moment ?
he was going  my friend , my companion , from whom i had a right to expect so much  he was going  he would abandon me  he was gone !
he would leave me to perish miserably , to expire in the most horrible and <unk> of dungeons  and one word , one little syllable , would save me  yet that single syllable i could not utter !
i felt , i am sure , more than ten thousand times the agonies of death itself .
my <name> reeled , and i fell , deadly sick , against the end of the box .
as i fell the <unk> was shaken out from the <unk> of my pantaloons , and dropped with a rattling sound to the floor .
never did any strain of the richest <name> come so sweetly to my ears !
with the <unk> anxiety i listened to ascertain the effect of the noise upon <name>  for i knew that the person who called my name could be no one but himself .
all was silent for some moments .
at length i again heard the word " <name> ! "
repeated in a low tone , and one full of hesitation .
reviving <name> loosened at once my powers of speech , and i now screamed at the top of my voice , " <name> !
oh , <name> ! "
" hush !
for god 's sake be silent ! "
he replied , in a voice trembling with agitation ; " i <name> be with you immediately  as soon as i can make my way through the hold . "
for a long time i heard him moving among the lumber , and every moment seemed to me an age .
at length i felt his hand upon my shoulder , and he placed , at the same moment , a bottle of water to my lips .
those only who have been suddenly redeemed from the jaws of the tomb , or who have known the insufferable torments of thirst under circumstances as aggravated as those which encompassed me in my dreary prison , can form any idea of the unutterable transports which that one long draught of the richest of all physical luxuries afforded .
when i had in some degree satisfied my thirst , <name> produced from his pocket three or four boiled potatoes , which i devoured with the greatest avidity .
he had brought with him a light in a dark lantern , and the grateful rays afforded me scarcely less comfort than the food and drink .
but i was impatient to learn the cause of his protracted absence , and he proceeded to recount what had happened on board during my <unk> .
chapter 4 the brig put to sea , as i had supposed , in about an hour after he had left the watch .
this was on the twentieth of <name> .
it <name> be remembered that i had then been in the hold for three days ; and , during this period , there was so constant a bustle on board , and so much running to and fro , especially in the cabin and staterooms , that he had had no chance of visiting me without the risk of having the secret of the trap discovered .
when at length he did come , i had assured him that i was doing as well as possible ; and , therefore , for the two next days he felt but little uneasiness on my account  still , however , watching an opportunity of going down .
it was not until the fourth day that he found one .
several times during this interval he had made up his mind to let his father know of the adventure , and have me come up at once ; but we were still within reaching distance of nantucket , and it was doubtful , from some expressions which had escaped captain barnard , whether he would not immediately put back if he discovered me to be on board .
besides , upon thinking the matter over , <name> , so he told me , could not imagine that i was in immediate want , or that i would hesitate , in such case , to make myself heard at the trap .
when , therefore , he considered everything he concluded to let me stay until he could meet with an opportunity of visiting me unobserved .
this , as i said before , did not occur until the fourth day after his bringing me the watch , and the seventh since i had first entered the hold .
he then went down without taking with him any water or provisions , intending in the first place merely to call my attention , and get me to come from the box to the trap ,  when he would go up to the stateroom and thence hand me down a supply .
when he descended for this purpose he found that i was asleep , for it seems that i was snoring very loudly .
from all the calculations i can make on the subject , this must have been the slumber into which i fell just after my return from the trap with the watch , and which , consequently , must have lasted for more than three entire days and nights at the very least .
latterly , i have had reason both from my own experience and the assurance of others , to be acquainted with the strong <unk> effects of the stench arising from old <unk> when closely confined ; and when i think of the condition of the hold in which i was imprisoned , and the long period during which the brig had been used as a whaling vessel , i am more inclined to wonder that i awoke at all , after once falling asleep , than that i should have slept uninterruptedly for the period specified above .
<name> called to me at first in a low voice and without closing the trap  but i made him no reply .
he then shut the trap , and spoke to me in a louder , and finally in a very loud tone  still i continued to snore .
he was now at a loss what to do .
it would take him some time to make his way through the lumber to my box , and in the meanwhile his absence would be noticed by captain barnard , who had occasion for his services every minute , in arranging and copying papers connected with the business of the voyage .
he determined , therefore , upon reflection , to ascend , and await another opportunity of visiting me .
he was the more easily induced to this resolve , as my slumber appeared to be of the most tranquil nature , and he could not suppose that i had undergone any inconvenience from my <unk> .
he had just made up his mind on these points when his attention was arrested by an unusual bustle , the sound of which proceeded apparently from the cabin .
he sprang through the trap as quickly as possible , closed it , and threw open the door of his stateroom .
no sooner had he put his foot over the threshold than a pistol flashed in his face , and he was knocked down , at the same moment , by a blow from a <unk> .
a strong hand held him on the cabin floor , with a tight grasp upon his throat ; still he was able to see what was going on around him .
his father was tied hand and foot , and lying along the steps of the <unk> , with his head down , and a deep wound in the forehead , from which the blood was flowing in a continued stream .
he spoke not a word , and was apparently dying .
over him stood the first mate , eyeing him with an expression of fiendish derision , and deliberately searching his pockets , from which he presently <name> forth a large wallet and a <unk> .
seven of the crew ( among whom was the cook , a negro ) were rummaging the staterooms on the larboard for arms , where they soon equipped themselves with muskets and ammunition .
besides <name> and captain barnard , there were nine men altogether in the cabin , and these among the most <unk> of the brig 's company .
the villains now went upon deck , taking my friend with them after having secured his arms behind his back .
they proceeded straight to the forecastle , which was fastened down  two of the mutineers standing by it with axes  two also at the main hatch .
the mate called out in a loud voice : " do you hear there below ?
tumble up with you , one by one  now , <name> that  and no grumbling ! "
it was some minutes before any one appeared :  at last an englishman , who had shipped as a raw hand , came up , weeping piteously , and entreating the mate , in the most humble manner , to spare his life .
the only reply was a blow on the forehead from an axe .
the poor fellow fell to the deck without a groan , and the black cook lifted him up in his arms as he would a child , and tossed him deliberately into the sea .
hearing the blow and the plunge of the body , the men below could now be induced to venture on deck neither by threats nor promises , until a proposition was made to smoke them out .
a general rush then ensued , and for a moment it seemed possible that the brig might be <unk> .
the mutineers , however , succeeded at last in closing the forecastle effectually before more than six of their opponents could get up .
these six , finding themselves so greatly <unk> and without arms , submitted after a brief struggle .
the mate gave them fair words  no doubt with a view of inducing those below to yield , for they had no difficulty in hearing all that was said on deck .
the result proved his sagacity , no less than his diabolical villainy .
all in the forecastle presently signified their intention of submitting , and , ascending one by one , were pinioned and then thrown on their backs , together with the first six  there being in all , of the crew who were not concerned in the mutiny , twenty-seven .
a scene of the most horrible butchery ensued .
the bound seamen were dragged to the gangway .
here the cook stood with an axe , striking each victim on the head as he was forced over the side of the vessel by the other mutineers .
in this manner twenty-two perished , and <name> had given himself up for lost , expecting every moment his own turn to come next .
but it seemed that the villains were now either weary , or in some measure disgusted with their bloody labour ; for the four remaining prisoners , together with my friend , who had been thrown on the deck with the rest , were <unk> while the mate sent below for rum , and the whole murderous party held a drunken <unk> , which lasted until sunset .
they now fell to disputing in regard to the fate of the survivors , who lay not more than four paces off , and could distinguish every word said .
upon some of the mutineers the liquor appeared to have a softening effect , for several voices were heard in favor of releasing the captives altogether , on condition of joining the mutiny and sharing the profits .
the black cook , however ( who in all respects was a perfect demon , and who seemed to exert as much influence , if not more , than the mate himself ) , would listen to no proposition of the kind , and rose repeatedly for the purpose of resuming his work at the gangway .
fortunately he was so far overcome by intoxication as to be easily restrained by the less bloodthirsty of the party , among whom was a <unk> , who went by the name of <name> peters .
this man was the son of an indian squaw of the tribe of <unk> , who live among the fastnesses of the black hills , near the source of the missouri .
his father was a <unk> , i believe , or at least connected in some manner with the indian <unk> on <name> river .
<name> himself was one of the most <unk> men i ever beheld .
he was short in stature , not more than four feet eight inches high , but his limbs were of <unk> mould .
his hands , especially , were so enormously thick and broad as hardly to retain a human shape .
his arms , as well as legs , were bowed in the most singular manner , and appeared to possess no flexibility whatever .
his head was equally deformed , being of immense size , with an indentation on the crown ( like that on the head of most negroes ) , and entirely bald .
to conceal this latter deficiency , which did not proceed from old age , he usually wore a wig formed of any <unk> material which presented itself  occasionally the skin of a spanish dog or american grizzly bear .
at the time spoken of , he had on a portion of one of these <unk> ; and it added no little to the natural ferocity of his countenance , which betook of the <unk> character .
the mouth extended nearly from ear to ear , the lips were thin , and seemed , like some other portions of his frame , to be devoid of natural <unk> , so that the ruling expression never varied under the influence of any emotion whatever .
this ruling expression may be conceived when it is considered that the teeth were exceedingly long and protruding , and never even partially covered , in any instance , by the lips .
to pass this man with a casual glance , one might imagine him to be convulsed with laughter , but a second look would induce a shuddering acknowledgment , that if such an expression were indicative of merriment , the merriment must be that of a demon .
of this singular being many anecdotes were prevalent among the <unk> men of nantucket .
these anecdotes went to prove his prodigious strength when under excitement , and some of them had given rise to a doubt of his sanity .
but on board the grampus , it seems , he was regarded , at the time of the mutiny , with feelings more of derision than of anything else .
i have been thus particular in speaking of <name> peters , because , ferocious as he appeared , he proved the main instrument in preserving the life of <name> , and because i shall have frequent occasion to mention him hereafter in the course of my narrative  a narrative , let me here say , which , in its latter portions , <name> be found to include incidents of a nature so entirely out of the range of human experience , and for this reason so far beyond the limits of human credulity , that i proceed in utter hopelessness of obtaining <unk> for all that i shall tell , yet confidently trusting in time and progressing science to verify some of the most important and most improbable of my statements .
after much indecision and two or three violent quarrels , it was determined at last that all the prisoners ( with the exception of <name> , whom peters insisted in a <unk> manner upon keeping as his clerk ) should be set adrift in one of the smallest <unk> .
the mate went down into the cabin to see if captain barnard was still living  for , it <name> be remembered , he was left below when the mutineers came up .
presently the two made their appearance , the captain pale as death , but somewhat recovered from the effects of his wound .
he spoke to the men in a voice hardly articulate , entreated them not to set him adrift , but to return to their duty , and promising to land them wherever they chose , and to take no steps for bringing them to justice .
he might as well have spoken to the winds .
two of the ruffians seized him by the arms and hurled him over the brig 's side into the boat , which had been lowered while the mate went below .
the four men who were lying on the deck were then untied and ordered to follow , which they did without attempting any resistance  <name> being still left in his painful position , although he struggled and prayed only for the poor satisfaction of being permitted to bid his father farewell .
a handful of <unk> and a jug of water were now handed down ; but neither mast , sail , oar , nor compass .
the boat was towed astern for a few minutes , during which the mutineers held another consultation  it was then finally cut adrift .
by this time night had come on  there were neither moon nor stars visible  and a short and ugly sea was running , although there was no great deal of wind .
the boat was instantly out of sight , and little <name> could be entertained for the unfortunate sufferers who were in it .
this event happened , however , in latitude 35 degrees <unk> north , longitude 61 degrees 20 ' west , and consequently at no very great distance from the bermuda islands .
<name> therefore endeavored to console himself with the idea that the boat might either succeed in reaching the land , or come sufficiently near to be fallen in with by vessels off the coast .
all sail was now put upon the brig , and she continued her original course to the southwest  the mutineers being bent upon some piratical expedition , in which , from all that could be understood , a ship was to be intercepted on her way from the cape verd islands to porto <name> .
no attention was paid to <name> , who was untied and suffered to go about anywhere forward of the cabin <unk> .
<name> peters treated him with some degree of kindness , and on one occasion saved him from the brutality of the cook .
his situation was still one of the most precarious , as the men were continually intoxicated , and there was no relying upon their continued <unk> or carelessness in regard to himself .
his anxiety on my account be represented , however , as the most distressing result of his condition ; and , indeed , i had never reason to doubt the sincerity of his friendship .
more than once he had resolved to acquaint the mutineers with the secret of my being on board , but was restrained from so doing , partly through recollection of the atrocities he had already beheld , and partly through a <name> of being able soon to bring me relief .
for the latter purpose he was constantly on the watch ; but , in spite of the most constant vigilance , three days elapsed after the boat was cut adrift before any chance occurred .
at length , on the night of the third day , there came on a heavy blow from the eastward , and all hands were called up to take in sail .
during the confusion which ensued , he made his way below unobserved , and into the stateroom .
what was his grief and horror in discovering that the latter had been rendered a place of deposit for a variety of <unk> and <unk> , and that several fathoms of old <unk> , which had been stowed away beneath the <unk> , had been dragged thence to make room for a chest , and were now lying immediately upon the trap !
to remove it without discovery was impossible , and he returned on deck as quickly as he could .
as he came up , the mate seized him by the throat , and demanding what he had been doing in the cabin , was about flinging him over the larboard bulwark , when his life was again preserved through the interference of <name> peters .
<name> was now put in handcuffs ( of which there were several pairs on board ) , and his feet lashed tightly together .
he was then taken into the steerage , and thrown into a lower berth next to the forecastle <unk> , with the assurance that he should never put his foot on deck again " until the brig was no longer a brig . "
this was the expression of the cook , who threw him into the berth  it is hardly possible to say what precise meaning intended by the phrase .
the whole affair , however , proved the ultimate means of my relief , as <name> presently appear .
chapter 5 for some minutes after the cook had left the forecastle , <name> abandoned himself to despair , never hoping to leave the berth alive .
he now came to the resolution of <unk> the first of the men who should come down with my situation , thinking it better to let me take my chance with the mutineers than perish of thirst in the hold ,  for it had been ten days since i was first imprisoned , and my jug of water was not a plentiful supply even for four .
as he was thinking on this subject , the idea came all at once into his head that it might be possible to communicate with me by the way of the main hold .
in any other circumstances , the difficulty and hazard of the undertaking would have prevented him from attempting it ; but now he had , at all events , little prospect of life , and consequently little to lose , he bent his whole mind , therefore , upon the task .
his handcuffs were the first consideration .
at first he saw no method of removing them , and feared that he should thus be baffled in the very outset ; but upon a closer scrutiny he discovered that the irons could be slipped off and on at pleasure , with very little effort or inconvenience , merely by squeezing his hands through them ,  this species of <unk> being altogether ineffectual in confining young persons , in whom the smaller bones readily yield to pressure .
he now untied his feet , and , leaving the cord in such a manner that it could easily be <unk> in the event of any person 's coming down , proceeded to examine the bulkhead where it joined the berth .
the partition here was of soft pine board , an inch thick , and he saw that he should have little trouble in cutting his way through .
a voice was now heard at the forecastle <unk> , and he had just time to put his right hand into its <unk> ( the left had not been removed ) and to draw the rope in a <unk> around his ankle , when <name> peters came below , followed by tiger , who immediately leaped into the berth and lay down .
the dog had been brought on board by <name> , who knew my attachment to the animal , and thought it would give me pleasure to have him with me during the voyage .
he went up to our house for him immediately after first taking me into the hold , but did not think of mentioning the circumstance upon his bringing the watch .
since the mutiny , <name> had not seen him before his appearance with <name> peters , and had given him up for lost , supposing him to have been thrown overboard by some of the malignant villains belonging to the mate 's gang .
it appeared afterward that he had crawled into a hole beneath a <unk> , from which , not having room to turn round , he could not extricate himself .
peters at last let him out , and , with a species of good feeling which my friend knew well how to appreciate , had now brought him to him in the forecastle as a companion , leaving at the same time some salt junk and potatoes , with a can of water , he then went on deck , promising to come down with something more to eat on the next day .
when he had gone , <name> freed both hands from the <unk> and unfastened his feet .
he then turned down the head of the mattress on which he had been lying , and with his penknife ( for the ruffians had not thought it worth while to search him ) commenced cutting vigorously across one of the partition planks , as closely as possible to the floor of the berth .
he chose to cut here , because , if suddenly interrupted , he would be able to conceal what had been done by letting the head of the mattress fall into its proper position .
for the remainder of the day , however , no disturbance occurred , and by night he had completely divided the plank .
it should here be observed that none of the crew occupied the forecastle as a <unk> , living altogether in the cabin since the mutiny , drinking the wines and feasting on the <unk> of captain barnard , and giving no more heed than was absolutely necessary to the navigation of the brig .
these circumstances proved fortunate both for myself and <name> ; for , had matters been otherwise , he would have found it impossible to reach me .
as it was , he proceeded with confidence in his design .
it was near daybreak , however , before he completed the second division of the board ( which was about a foot above the first cut ) , thus making an aperture quite large enough to admit his passage through with facility to the main <unk> deck .
having got here , he made his way with but little trouble to the lower main hatch , although in so doing he had to scramble over tiers of <unk> piled nearly as high as the upper deck , there being barely room enough left for his body .
upon reaching the hatch he found that tiger had followed him below , squeezing between two rows of the casks .
it was now too late , however , to attempt getting to me before <name> , as the chief difficulty lay in passing through the close stowage in the lower hold .
he therefore resolved to return , and wait till the next night .
with this design , he proceeded to loosen the hatch , so that he might have as little detention as possible when he should come again .
no sooner had he loosened it than tiger sprang eagerly to the small opening produced , snuffed for a moment , and then uttered a long whine , scratching at the same time , as if anxious to remove the covering with his paws .
there could be no doubt , from his behaviour , that he was aware of my being in the hold , and <name> thought it possible that he would be able to get to me if he put him down .
he now hit upon the expedient of sending the note , as it was especially desirable that i should make no attempt at forcing my way out at least under existing circumstances , and there could be no certainty of his getting to me himself on the morrow as he intended .
<unk> proved how fortunate it was that the idea occurred to him as it did ; for , had it not been for the receipt of the note , i should undoubtedly have fallen upon some plan , however desperate , of alarming the crew , and both our lives would most probably have been sacrificed in consequence .
having concluded to write , the difficulty was now to procure the materials for so doing .
an old toothpick was soon made into a pen ; and this by means of feeling altogether , for the <unk> was as dark as pitch .
paper enough was obtained from the back of a letter  a duplicate of the forged letter from mr. <name> .
this had been the original draught ; but the handwriting not being sufficiently well imitated , <name> had written another , thrusting the first , by good fortune , into his <unk> , where it was now most <unk> discovered .
ink alone was thus wanting , and a substitute was immediately found for this by means of a slight <unk> with the <unk> on the back of a finger just above the nail  a copious flow of blood ensuing , as usual , from wounds in that vicinity .
the note was now written , as well as it could be in the dark and under the circumstances .
it briefly explained that a mutiny had taken place ; that captain barnard was set adrift ; and that i might expect immediate relief as far as provisions were concerned , but must not venture upon making any disturbance .
it concluded with these words : " i have scrawled this with blood  your life depends upon lying <unk> " this slip of paper being tied upon the dog , he was now put down the hatchway , and <name> made the best of his way back to the forecastle , where he found no reason to believe that any of the crew had been in his absence .
to conceal the hole in the partition , he drove his knife in just above it , and <name> up a <unk> which he found in the berth .
his handcuffs were then replaced , and also the rope around his ankles .
these arrangements were scarcely completed when <name> peters came below , very drunk , but in excellent humour , and bringing with him my <unk> allowance of provision for the day .
this consisted of a dozen large <name> potatoes roasted , and a pitcher of water .
he sat for some time on a chest by the berth , and talked freely about the mate and the general concerns of the brig .
his demeanour was exceedingly capricious , and even grotesque .
at one time <name> was much alarmed by odd conduct .
at last , however , he went on deck , muttering a promise to bring his prisoner a good dinner on the morrow .
during the day two of the crew ( <unk> ) came down , accompanied by the cook , all three in nearly the last stage of intoxication .
like peters , they made no scruple of talking unreservedly about their plans .
it appeared that they were much divided among themselves as to their ultimate course , agreeing in no point , except the attack on the ship from the cape verd islands , with which they were in hourly expectation of meeting .
as far as could be ascertained , the mutiny had not been brought about altogether for the sake of booty ; a private pique of the chief mate 's against captain barnard having been the main <unk> .
there now seemed to be two principal factions among the crew  one headed by the mate , the other by the cook .
the former party were for seizing the first suitable vessel which should present itself , and <unk> it at some of the west <name> islands for a piratical cruise .
the latter division , however , which was the stronger , and included <name> peters among its partisans , were bent upon pursuing the course originally laid out for the brig into the south pacific ; there either to take whale , or act otherwise , as circumstances should suggest .
the representations of peters , who had frequently visited these regions , had great weight , apparently , with the mutineers , wavering , as they were , between <unk> notions of profit and pleasure .
he dwelt on the world of novelty and amusement to be found among the innumerable islands of the pacific , on the perfect security and freedom from all restraint to be enjoyed , but , more particularly , on the <unk> of the climate , on the abundant means of good living , and on the voluptuous beauty of the women .
as yet , nothing had been absolutely determined upon ; but the pictures of the hybrid <unk> were taking strong hold upon the ardent imaginations of the seamen , and there was every possibility that his intentions would be finally carried into effect .
the three men went away in about an hour , and no one else entered the forecastle all day .
<name> lay quiet until nearly night .
he then freed himself from the rope and irons , and prepared for his attempt .
a bottle was found in one of the berths , and this he filled with water from the pitcher left by peters , storing his pockets at the same time with cold potatoes .
to his great <name> he also came across a lantern , with a small piece of tallow candle in it .
this he could light at any moment , as he had in his possession a box of phosphorus matches .
when it was quite dark , he got through the hole in the bulkhead , having taken the precaution to arrange the <unk> in the berth so as to convey the idea of a person covered up .
when through , he <name> up the <unk> on his knife , as before , to conceal the aperture  this manoeuvre being easily effected , as he did not <unk> the piece of plank taken out until afterward .
he was now on the main <unk> deck , and proceeded to make his way , as before , between the upper deck and the <unk> to the main hatchway .
having reached this , he lit the piece of candle , and descended , groping with extreme difficulty among the compact stowage of the hold .
in a few moments he became alarmed at the insufferable stench and the <unk> of the atmosphere .
he could not think it possible that i had survived my confinement for so long a period breathing so oppressive an air .
he called my name repeatedly , but i made him no reply , and his apprehensions seemed thus to be confirmed .
the brig was rolling violently , and there was so much noise in consequence , that it was useless to listen for any weak sound , such as those of my breathing or snoring .
he threw open the lantern , and held it as high as possible , whenever an opportunity occurred , in order that , by observing the light , i might , if alive , be aware that succor was approaching .
still nothing was heard from me , and the supposition of my death began to assume the character of certainty .
he determined , nevertheless , to force a passage , if possible , to the box , and at least ascertain beyond a doubt the truth of his surmises .
he pushed on for some time in a most pitiable state of anxiety , until , at length , he found the pathway utterly blocked up , and that there was no possibility of making any farther way by the course in which he had set out .
overcome now by his feelings , he threw himself among the lumber in despair , and wept like a child .
it was at this period that he heard the crash occasioned by the bottle which i had thrown down .
fortunate , indeed , was it that the incident occurred  for , upon this incident , trivial as it appears , the thread of my <name> depended .
many years elapsed , however , before i was aware of this fact .
a natural shame and regret for his weakness and indecision prevented <name> from confiding to me at once what a more intimate and <unk> communion afterward induced him to reveal .
upon finding his further progress in the hold impeded by obstacles which he could not overcome , he had resolved to abandon his attempt at reaching me , and return at once to the forecastle .
before condemning him entirely on this head , the harassing circumstances which embarrassed him should be taken into consideration .
the night was fast wearing away , and his absence from the forecastle might be discovered ; and indeed would necessarily be so , if he should fail to get back to the berth by daybreak .
his candle was <unk> in the socket , and there would be the greatest difficulty in <unk> his way to the hatchway in the dark .
it must be allowed , too , that he had every good reason to believe me dead ; in which event no benefit could result to me from his reaching the box , and a world of danger would be encountered to no purpose by himself .
he had repeatedly called , and i had made him no answer .
i had been now eleven days and nights with no more water than that contained in the jug which he had left with me  a supply which it was not at all probable i had <unk> in the beginning of my confinement , as i had every cause to expect a speedy release .
the atmosphere of the hold , too , must have appeared to him , coming from the comparatively open air of the steerage , of a nature absolutely poisonous , and by far more intolerable than it had seemed to me upon my first taking up my quarters in the box  the <unk> at that time having been constantly open for many months previous .
add to these considerations that of the scene of bloodshed and terror so lately witnessed by my friend ; his confinement , privations , and narrow escapes from death , together with the frail and equivocal tenure by which he still existed  circumstances all so well calculated to prostrate every energy of mind  and the reader <name> be easily brought , as i have been , to regard his apparent falling off in friendship and in <name> with sentiments rather of sorrow than of anger .
the crash of the bottle was distinctly heard , yet <name> was not sure that it proceeded from the hold .
the doubt , however , was sufficient inducement to persevere .
he clambered up nearly to the <unk> deck by means of the stowage , and then , watching for a lull in the <unk> of the vessel , he called out to me in as loud a tone as he could command , regardless , for the moment , of being overheard by the crew .
it <name> be remembered that on this occasion the voice reached me , but i was so entirely overcome by violent agitation as to be incapable of reply .
confident , now , that his worst apprehensions were well founded , he descended , with a view of getting back to the forecastle without loss of time .
in his haste some small boxes were thrown down , the noise occasioned by which i heard , as <name> be recollected .
he had made considerable progress on his return when the fall of the knife again caused him to hesitate .
he retraced his steps immediately , and , clambering up the stowage a second time , called out my name , loudly as before , having watched for a lull .
this time i found voice to answer .
overjoyed at discovering me to be still alive , he now resolved to brave every difficulty and danger in reaching me .
having extricated himself as quickly as possible from the labyrinth of lumber by which he was hemmed in , he at length struck into an opening which promised better , and finally , after a series of struggles , arrived at the box in a state of utter exhaustion .
chapter 6 the leading particulars of this narration were all that <name> communicated to me while we remained near the box .
it was not until afterward that he entered fully into all the details .
he was apprehensive of being missed , and i was wild with impatience to leave my detested place of confinement .
we resolved to make our way at once to the hole in the bulkhead , near which i was to remain for the present , while he went through to reconnoiter .
to leave tiger in the box was what neither of us could endure to think of , yet , how to act otherwise was the question .
he now seemed to be perfectly quiet , and we could not even distinguish the sound of his breathing upon applying our ears closely to the box .
i was convinced that he was dead , and determined to open the door .
we found him lying at full length , apparently in a deep stupor , yet still alive .
no time was to be lost , yet i could not bring myself to abandon an animal who had now been twice instrumental in saving my life , without some attempt at preserving him .
we therefore dragged him along with us as well as we could , although with the greatest difficulty and fatigue ; <name> , during part of the time , being forced to clamber over the <unk> in our way with the huge dog in his arms  a feat to which the feebleness of my frame rendered me totally inadequate .
at length we succeeded in reaching the hole , when <name> got through , and tiger was pushed in afterward .
all was found to be safe , and we did not fail to return sincere thanks to god for our deliverance from the imminent danger we had escaped .
for the present , it was agreed that i should remain near the opening , through which my companion could readily supply me with a part of his daily provision , and where i could have the advantages of breathing an atmosphere comparatively pure .
in explanation of some portions of this narrative , wherein i have spoken of the stowage of the brig , and which may appear <unk> to some of my readers who may have seen a proper or regular stowage , i must here state that the manner in which this most important duty had been per formed on board the grampus was a most shameful piece of neglect on the part of captain barnard , who was by no means as careful or as experienced a seaman as the hazardous nature of the service on which he was employed would seem necessarily to demand .
a proper stowage can not be accomplished in a careless manner , and many most disastrous accidents , even within the limits of my own experience , have arisen from neglect or ignorance in this particular .
coasting vessels , in the frequent hurry and bustle attendant upon taking in or discharging cargo , are the most liable to mishap from the want of a proper attention to stowage .
the great point is to allow no possibility of the cargo or ballast shifting position even in the most violent <unk> of the vessel .
with this end , great attention must be paid , not only to the bulk taken in , but to the nature of the bulk , and whether there be a full or only a partial cargo .
in most kinds of freight the stowage is accomplished by means of a screw .
thus , in a load of tobacco or flour , the whole is screwed so tightly into the hold of the vessel that the barrels or <unk> , upon discharging , are found to be completely flattened , and take some time to regain their original shape .
this screwing , however , is resorted to principally with a view of obtaining more room in the hold ; for in a full load of any such commodities as flour or tobacco , there can be no danger of any shifting whatever , at least none from which inconvenience can result .
there have been instances , indeed , where this method of screwing has resulted in the most lamentable consequences , arising from a cause altogether distinct from the danger attendant upon a shifting of cargo .
a load of cotton , for example , tightly screwed while in certain conditions , has been known , through the expansion of its bulk , to rend a vessel asunder at sea .
there can be no doubt either that the same result would ensue in the case of tobacco , while undergoing its usual course of <unk> , were it not for the interstices consequent upon the <unk> of the <unk> .
it is when a partial cargo is received that danger is chiefly to be apprehended from shifting , and that precautions should be always taken to guard against such misfortune .
only those who have encountered a violent <name> of wind , or rather who have experienced the rolling of a vessel in a sudden calm after the <name> , can form an idea of the tremendous force of the plunges , and of the consequent terrible impetus given to all loose articles in the vessel .
it is then that the necessity of a cautious stowage , when there is a partial cargo , becomes obvious .
when <unk> ( especially with a small bead sail ) , a vessel which is not properly modelled in the bows is frequently thrown upon her <unk> ; this occurring even every fifteen or twenty minutes upon an average , yet without any serious consequences resulting , provided there be a proper stowage .
if this , however , has not been strictly attended to , in the first of these heavy <unk> the whole of the cargo tumbles over to the side of the vessel which lies upon the water , and , being thus prevented from regaining her equilibrium , as she would otherwise necessarily do , she is certain to fill in a few seconds and go down .
it is not too much to say that at least one-half of the instances in which vessels have <unk> in heavy gales at sea may be attributed to a shifting of cargo or of ballast .
when a partial cargo of any kind is taken on board , the whole , after being first stowed as compactly as may be , should be covered with a layer of stout <unk> , extending completely across the vessel .
upon these boards strong temporary stanchions should be erected , reaching to the timbers above , and thus securing every thing in its place .
in cargoes consisting of grain , or any similar matter , additional precautions are requisite .
a hold filled entirely with grain upon leaving port <name> be found not more than three fourths full upon reaching its destination  this , too , although the freight , when measured bushel by bushel by the <unk> , <name> overrun by a vast deal ( on account of the swelling of the grain ) the quantity consigned .
this result is occasioned by settling during the voyage , and is the more perceptible in proportion to the roughness of the weather experienced .
if grain loosely thrown in a vessel , then , is ever so well secured by <unk> and stanchions , it <name> be liable to shift in a long passage so greatly as to bring about the most distressing calamities .
to prevent these , every method should be employed before leaving port to settle the cargo as much as possible ; and for this there are many contrivances , among which may be mentioned the driving of wedges into the grain .
even after all this is done , and unusual pains taken to secure the <unk> , no seaman who knows what he is about <name> feel altogether secure in a <name> of any violence with a cargo of grain on board , and , least of all , with a partial cargo .
yet there are hundreds of our coasting vessels , and , it is likely , many more from the ports of europe , which sail daily with partial cargoes , even of the most dangerous species , and without any precaution whatever .
the wonder is that no more accidents occur than do actually happen .
a lamentable instance of this <unk> occurred to my knowledge in the case of captain <name> rice of the schooner firefly , which sailed from richmond , <name> , to madeira , with a cargo of corn , in the year 1825 .
the captain had gone many voyages without serious accident , although he was in the habit of paying no attention whatever to his stowage , more than to secure it in the ordinary manner .
he had never before sailed with a cargo of grain , and on this occasion had the corn thrown on board loosely , when it did not much more than half fill the vessel .
for the first portion of the voyage he met with nothing more than light breezes ; but when within a day 's sail of madeira there came on a strong <name> from the n. n. e. which forced him to <unk> .
he brought the schooner to the wind under a <unk> foresail alone , when she rode as well as any vessel could be expected to do , and shipped not a drop of water .
toward night the <name> somewhat abated , and she rolled with more <unk> than before , but still did very well , until a heavy lurch threw her upon her <unk> to starboard .
the corn was then heard to shift bodily , the force of the movement bursting open the main hatchway .
the vessel went down like a shot .
this happened within hail of a small sloop from madeira , which picked up one of the crew ( the only person saved ) , and which rode out the <name> in perfect security , as indeed a jolly boat might have done under proper management .
the stowage on board the grampus was most clumsily done , if stowage that could be called which was little better than a promiscuous <unk> together of <unk> { *1 } and ship furniture .
i have already spoken of the condition of articles in the hold .
on the <unk> deck there was space enough for my body ( as i have stated ) between the <unk> and the upper deck ; a space was left open around the main hatchway ; and several other large spaces were left in the stowage .
near the hole cut through the bulkhead by <name> there was room enough for an entire cask , and in this space i found myself comfortably situated for the present .
by the time my friend had got safely into the berth , and <unk> his handcuffs and the rope , it was broad daylight .
we had made a narrow escape indeed ; for scarcely had he arranged all matters , when the mate came below , with <name> peters and the cook .
they talked for some time about the vessel from the cape <unk> , and seemed to be excessively anxious for her appearance .
at length the cook came to the berth in which <name> was lying , and seated himself in it near the head .
i could see and hear every thing from my hiding-place , for the piece cut out had not been put back , and i was in momentary expectation that the negro would fall against the <unk> , which was <name> up to conceal the aperture , in which case all would have been discovered , and our lives would , no doubt , have been instantly sacrificed .
our good fortune prevailed , however ; and although he frequently touched it as the vessel rolled , he never pressed against it sufficiently to bring about a discovery .
the bottom of the jacket had been carefully fastened to the bulkhead , so that the hole might not be seen by its swinging to one side .
all this time tiger was lying in the foot of the berth , and appeared to have recovered in some measure his faculties , for i could see him occasionally open his eyes and draw a long breath .
after a few minutes the mate and cook went above , leaving <name> peters behind , who , as soon as they were gone , came and sat himself down in the place just occupied by the mate .
he began to talk very <unk> with <name> , and we could now see that the greater part of his apparent intoxication , while the two others were with him , was a <unk> .
he answered all my companion 's questions with perfect freedom ; told him that he had no doubt of his father 's having been picked up , as there were no less than five sail in sight just before sundown on the day he was cut adrift ; and used other language of a <unk> nature , which occasioned me no less surprise than pleasure .
indeed , i began to entertain hopes , that through the instrumentality of peters we might be finally enabled to regain possession of the brig , and this idea i mentioned to <name> as soon as i found an opportunity .
he thought the matter possible , but urged the necessity of the greatest caution in making the attempt , as the conduct of the hybrid appeared to be <unk> by the most arbitrary <name> alone ; and , indeed , it was difficult to say if he was at any moment of sound mind .
peters went upon deck in about an hour , and did not return again until noon , when he brought <name> a plentiful supply of junk beef and pudding .
of this , when we were left alone , i partook heartily , without returning through the hole .
no one else came down into the forecastle during the day , and at night , i got into <name> ' berth , where i slept soundly and sweetly until nearly daybreak , when he awakened me upon hearing a stir upon deck , and i regained my hiding-place as quickly as possible .
when the day was fully broke , we found that tiger had recovered his strength almost entirely , and gave no indications of hydrophobia , drinking a little water that was offered him with great apparent eagerness .
during the day he regained all his former vigour and appetite .
his strange conduct had been brought on , no doubt , by the <unk> quality of the air of the hold , and had no connexion with canine madness .
i could not sufficiently rejoice that i had persisted in bringing him with me from the box .
this day was the thirtieth of <name> , and the thirteenth since the grampus made sad from nantucket .
on the second of july the mate came below drunk as usual , and in an excessively <unk> .
he came to <name> 's berth , and , giving him a slap on the back , asked him if he thought he could behave himself if he let him loose , and whether he would promise not to be going into the cabin again .
to this , of course , my friend answered in the affirmative , when the ruffian set him at <name> , after making him drink from a flask of rum which he <name> from his <unk> .
both now went on deck , and i did not see <name> for about three hours .
he then came below with the good news that he had obtained permission to go about the brig as he pleased anywhere forward of the mainmast , and that he had been ordered to sleep , as usual , in the forecastle .
he brought me , too , a good dinner , and a plentiful supply of water .
the brig was still cruising for the vessel from the cape <unk> , and a sail was now in sight , which was thought to be the one in question .
as the events of the ensuing eight days were of little importance , and had no direct bearing upon the main incidents of my narrative , i <name> here throw them into the form of a journal , as i do not wish to omit them altogether .
july 3 .
<name> furnished me with three blankets , with which i contrived a comfortable bed in my hiding-place .
no one came below , except my companion , during the day .
tiger took his station in the berth just by the aperture , and slept heavily , as if not yet entirely recovered from the effects of his sickness .
toward night a flaw of wind struck the brig before sail could be taken in , and very nearly <unk> her .
the puff died away immediately , however , and no damage was done beyond the splitting of the <unk> .
<name> peters treated <name> all this day with great kindness and entered into a long conversation with him respecting the pacific ocean , and the islands he had visited in that region .
he asked him whether he would not like to go with the mutineers on a kind of exploring and pleasure voyage in those quarters , and said that the men were gradually coming over to the mate 's views .
to this <name> thought it best to reply that he would be glad to go on such an adventure , since nothing better could be done , and that any thing was preferable to a piratical life .
july 4th .
the vessel in sight proved to be a small brig from liverpool , and was allowed to pass unmolested .
<name> spent most of his time on deck , with a view of obtaining all the information in his power respecting the intentions of the mutineers .
they had frequent and violent quarrels among themselves , in one of which a <unk> , <name> <unk> , was thrown overboard .
the party of the mate was gaining ground .
<name> <unk> belonged to the cook 's gang , of which peters was a partisan .
july 5th .
about daybreak there came on a stiff breeze from the west , which at noon freshened into a <name> , so that the brig could <name> nothing more than her <unk> and foresail .
in taking in the <unk> , <unk> , one of the common hands , and belonging also to the cook 's gang , fell overboard , being very much in liquor , and was drowned  no attempt being made to save him .
the whole number of persons on board was now thirteen , to wit : <name> peters ; <name> , the black cook ; jones , <unk> , <unk> rogers and <name> <name> , all of the cook 's party ; the mate , whose name i never learned ; <unk> hicks , <name> , <name> <unk> <name> <name> , of the <unk> party ;  besides <name> and myself .
july 6th .
the <name> lasted all this day , blowing in heavy squalls , accompanied with rain .
the brig took in a good deal of water through her seams , and one of the pumps was kept continually going , <name> being forced to take his turn .
just at twilight a large ship passed close by us , without having been discovered until within hail .
the ship was supposed to be the one for which the mutineers were on the lookout .
the mate hailed her , but the reply was drowned in the roaring of the <name> .
at eleven , a sea was shipped amidships , which tore away a great portion of the larboard bulwarks , and did some other slight damage .
toward morning the weather <unk> , and at sunrise there was very little wind .
july 7th .
there was a heavy swell running all this day , during which the brig , being light , rolled excessively , and many articles broke loose in the hold , as i could hear distinctly from my hiding-place .
i suffered a great deal from <unk> .
peters had a long conversation this day with <name> , and told him that two of his gang , <unk> and <name> , had gone over to the mate , and were resolved to turn pirates .
he put several questions to <name> which he did not then exactly understand .
during a part of this evening the leak gained upon the vessel ; and little could be done to remedy it , as it was occasioned by the <unk> straining , and taking in the water through her seams .
a sail was <unk> , and got under the bows , which aided us in some measure , so that we began to gain upon the leak .
july 8th .
a light breeze sprang up at sunrise from the eastward , when the mate headed the brig to the southwest , with the intention of making some of the west <name> islands in pursuance of his piratical designs .
no opposition was made by peters or the cook  at least none in the hearing of <name> .
all idea of taking the vessel from the cape <unk> was abandoned .
the leak was now easily kept under by one pump going every three quarters of an hour .
the sail was drawn from beneath the bows .
spoke two small schooners during the day .
july 9th .
fine weather .
all hands employed in repairing bulwarks .
peters had again a long conversation with <name> , and spoke more plainly than he had done heretofore .
he said nothing should induce him to come into the mate 's views , and even hinted his intention of taking the brig out of his hands .
he asked my friend if he could depend upon his aid in such case , to which <name> said , " yes , " without hesitation .
peters then said he would sound the others of his party upon the subject , and went away .
during the remainder of the day <name> had no opportunity of speaking with him privately .
chapter 7 july 10 .
spoke a brig from rio , bound to norfolk .
weather hazy , with a light baffling wind from the eastward .
to-day <unk> rogers died , having been attacked on the eighth with spasms after drinking a glass of <unk> .
this man was of the cook 's party , and one upon whom peters placed his main reliance .
he told <name> that he believed the mate had poisoned him , and that he expected , if he did not be on the look-out , his own turn would come shortly .
there were now only himself , jones , and the cook belonging to his own gang  on the other side there were five .
he had spoken to jones about taking the command from the mate ; but the project having been coolly received , he had been deterred from pressing the matter any further , or from saying any thing to the cook .
it was well , as it happened , that he was so prudent , for in the afternoon the cook expressed his determination of siding with the mate , and went over formally to that party ; while jones took an opportunity of quarrelling with peters , and hinted that he would let the mate know of the plan in agitation .
there was now , evidently , no time to be lost , and peters expressed his determination of attempting to take the vessel at all hazards , provided <name> would lend him his aid .
my friend at once assured him of his willingness to enter into any plan for that purpose , and , thinking the opportunity a favourable one , made known the fact of my being on board .
at this the hybrid was not more astonished than delighted , as he had no reliance whatever upon jones , whom he already considered as belonging to the party of the mate .
they went below immediately , when <name> called to me by name , and peters and myself were soon made acquainted .
it was agreed that we should attempt to <unk> the vessel upon the first good opportunity , leaving jones altogether out of our councils .
in the event of success , we were to run the brig into the first port that offered , and deliver her up .
the desertion of his party had frustrated peters ' design of going into the pacific  an adventure which could not be accomplished without a crew , and he depended upon either getting acquitted upon trial , on the score of insanity ( which he solemnly avowed had actuated him in lending his aid to the mutiny ) , or upon obtaining a pardon , if found guilty , through the representations of <name> and myself .
our deliberations were interrupted for the present by the cry of , " all hands take in sail , " and peters and <name> ran up on deck .
as usual , the crew were nearly all drunk ; and , before sail could be properly taken in , a violent squall laid the brig on her <unk> .
by keeping her away , however , she righted , having shipped a good deal of water .
scarcely was everything secure , when another squall took the vessel , and immediately afterward another  no damage being done .
there was every appearance of a <name> of wind , which , indeed , shortly came on , with great fury , from the northward and westward .
all was made as snug as possible , and we <unk> , as usual , under a <unk> foresail .
as night <name> on , the wind increased in violence , with a remarkably heavy sea .
peters now came into the forecastle with <name> , and we resumed our deliberations .
we agreed that no opportunity could be more favourable than the present for carrying our designs into effect , as an attempt at such a moment would never be anticipated .
as the brig was snugly <unk> , there would be no necessity of manoeuvring her until good weather , when , if we succeeded in our attempt , we might liberate one , or perhaps two of the men , to aid us in taking her into port .
the main difficulty was the great disproportion in our forces .
there were only three of us , and in the cabin there were nine .
all the arms on board , too , were in their possession , with the exception of a pair of small pistols which peters had concealed about his person , and the large seaman 's knife which he always wore in the <unk> of his pantaloons .
from certain indications , too  such , for example , as there being no such thing as an axe or a <unk> lying in their customary places  we began to fear that the mate had his suspicions , at least in regard to peters , and that he would let slip no opportunity of getting rid of him .
it was clear , indeed , that what we should determine to do could not be done too soon .
still the odds were too much against us to allow of our proceeding without the greatest caution .
peters proposed that he should go up on deck , and enter into conversation with the watch ( <name> ) , when he would be able to throw him into the sea without trouble , and without making any disturbance , by seizing a good opportunity , that <name> and myself should then come up , and endeavour to provide ourselves with some kind of weapons from the deck , and that we should then make a rush together , and secure the <unk> before any opposition could be offered .
i objected to this , because i could not believe that the mate ( who was a cunning fellow in all matters which did not affect his superstitious prejudices ) would suffer himself to be so easily <unk> .
the very fact of there being a watch on deck at all was sufficient proof that he was upon the alert ,  it not being usual except in vessels where discipline is most rigidly enforced , to station a watch on deck when a vessel is <unk> in a <name> of wind .
as i address myself principally , if not altogether , to persons who have never been to sea , it may be as well to state the exact condition of a vessel under such circumstances .
<unk> , or , in <unk> , " <unk> , " is a measure resorted to for various purposes , and effected in various manners .
in moderate weather it is frequently done with a view of merely bringing the vessel to a <unk> , to wait for another vessel or any similar object .
if the vessel which <unk> is under full sail , the manoeuvre is usually accomplished by throwing round some portion of her sails , so as to let the wind take them aback , when she becomes stationary .
but we are now speaking of <unk> in a <name> of wind .
this is done when the wind is ahead , and too violent to admit of carrying sail without danger of <unk> ; and sometimes even when the wind is fair , but the sea too heavy for the vessel to be put before it .
if a vessel be suffered to scud before the wind in a very heavy sea , much damage is usually done her by the shipping of water over her stern , and sometimes by the violent plunges she makes forward .
this manoeuvre , then , is seldom resorted to in such case , unless through necessity .
when the vessel is in a leaky condition she is often put before the wind even in the heaviest seas ; for , when <unk> , her seams are sure to be greatly opened by her violent straining , and it is not so much the case when <unk> .
often , too , it becomes necessary to scud a vessel , either when the blast is so exceedingly furious as to tear in pieces the sail which is employed with a view of bringing her head to the wind , or when , through the false <unk> of the frame or other causes , this main object can not be effected .
vessels in a <name> of wind are <unk> in different manners , according to their peculiar construction .
some <unk> best under a foresail , and this , i believe , is the sail most usually employed .
large <unk> vessels have sails for the express purpose , called <unk> .
but the jib is occasionally employed by itself ,  sometimes the jib and foresail , or a <unk> foresail , and not unfrequently the <unk> , are made use of .
<unk> are very often found to answer the purpose better than any other species of sail .
the grampus was generally <unk> under a <unk> foresail .
when a vessel is to be <unk> , her head is brought up to the wind just so nearly as to fill the sail under which she lies when hauled flat aft , that is , when brought diagonally across the vessel .
this being done , the bows point within a few degrees of the direction from which the wind issues , and the windward bow of course receives the shock of the waves .
in this situation a good vessel <name> ride out a very heavy <name> of wind without shipping a drop of water , and without any further attention being requisite on the part of the crew .
the helm is usually lashed down , but this is altogether unnecessary ( except on account of the noise it makes when loose ) , for the rudder has no effect upon the vessel when <unk> .
indeed , the helm had far better be left loose than lashed very fast , for the rudder is apt to be torn off by heavy seas if there be no room for the helm to play .
as long as the sail holds , a well modelled vessel <name> maintain her situation , and ride every sea , as if instinct with life and reason .
if the violence of the wind , however , should tear the sail into pieces ( a feat which it requires a perfect hurricane to accomplish under ordinary circumstances ) , there is then imminent danger .
the vessel falls off from the wind , and , coming broadside to the sea , is completely at its <name> : the only resource in this case is to put her quietly before the wind , letting her scud until some other sail can be set .
some vessels <name> <unk> under no sail whatever , but such are not to be trusted at sea .
but to return from this digression .
it had never been customary with the mate to have any watch on deck when <unk> in a <name> of wind , and the fact that he had now one , coupled with the circumstance of the missing axes and <unk> , fully convinced us that the crew were too well on the watch to be taken by surprise in the manner peters had suggested .
something , however , was to be done , and that with as little delay as practicable , for there could be no doubt that a suspicion having been once entertained against peters , he would be sacrificed upon the earliest occasion , and one would certainly be either found or made upon the breaking of the <name> .
<name> now suggested that if peters could contrive to remove , under any pretext , the piece of <unk> which lay over the trap in the stateroom , we might possibly be able to come upon them unawares by means of the hold ; but a little reflection convinced us that the vessel rolled and pitched too violently for any attempt of that nature .
by good fortune i at length hit upon the idea of working upon the superstitious terrors and guilty conscience of the mate .
it <name> be remembered that one of the crew , <unk> rogers , had died during the morning , having been attacked two days before with spasms after drinking some spirits and water .
peters had expressed to us his opinion that this man had been poisoned by the mate , and for this belief he had reasons , so he said , which were <unk> , but which he could not be prevailed upon to explain to us  this wayward refusal being only in keeping with other points of his singular character .
but whether or not he had any better grounds for suspecting the mate than we had ourselves , we were easily led to fall in with his suspicion , and determined to act accordingly .
rogers had died about eleven in the forenoon , in violent convulsions ; and the corpse presented in a few minutes after death one of the most horrid and loathsome spectacles i ever remember to have seen .
the stomach was swollen immensely , like that of a man who has been drowned and lain under water for many weeks .
the hands were in the same condition , while the face was shrunken , shrivelled , and of a <unk> whiteness , except where relieved by two or three glaring red blotches like those occasioned by the <unk> : one of these blotches extended diagonally across the face , completely covering up an eye as if with a band of red <name> .
in this disgusting condition the body had been brought up from the cabin at noon to be thrown overboard , when the mate getting a glimpse of it ( for he now saw it for the first time ) , and being either touched with remorse for his crime or struck with terror at so horrible a sight , ordered the men to sew the body up in its hammock , and allow it the usual rites of <unk> .
having given these directions , he went below , as if to avoid any further sight of his victim .
while preparations were making to obey his orders , the <name> came on with great fury , and the design was abandoned for the present .
the corpse , left to itself , was washed into the larboard scuppers , where it still lay at the time of which i speak , floundering about with the furious <unk> of the brig .
having arranged our plan , we set about putting it in execution as speedily as possible .
peters went upon deck , and , as he had anticipated , was immediately accosted by <name> , who appeared to be stationed more as a watch upon the forecastle than for any other purpose .
the fate of this villain , however , was speedily and silently decided ; for peters , approaching him in a careless manner , as if about to address him , seized him by the throat , and , before he could utter a single cry , tossed him over the bulwarks .
he then called to us , and we came up .
our first precaution was to look about for something with which to arm ourselves , and in doing this we had to proceed with great care , for it was impossible to stand on deck an instant without holding fast , and violent seas broke over the vessel at every plunge forward .
it was indispensable , too , that we should be quick in our operations , for every minute we expected the mate to be up to set the pumps going , as it was evident the brig must be taking in water very fast .
after searching about for some time , we could find nothing more fit for our purpose than the two <unk> , one of which <name> took , and i the other .
having secured these , we stripped off the shirt of the corpse and dropped the body overboard .
peters and myself then went below , leaving <name> to watch upon deck , where he took his station just where <name> had been placed , and with his back to the cabin companionway , so that , if any of the mates gang should come up , he might suppose it was the watch .
as soon as i got below i commenced <unk> myself so as to represent the corpse of rogers .
the shirt which we had taken from the body aided us very much , for it was of singular form and character , and easily recognizable  a kind of <unk> , which the deceased wore over his other clothing .
it was a blue <unk> , with large white stripes running across .
having put this on , i proceeded to equip myself with a false stomach , in imitation of the horrible deformity of the swollen corpse .
this was soon effected by means of stuffing with some <unk> .
i then gave the same appearance to my hands by drawing on a pair of white woollen <unk> , and filling them in with any kind of rags that offered themselves .
peters then arranged my face , first rubbing it well over with white chalk , and afterward <unk> it with blood , which he took from a cut in his finger .
the streak across the eye was not forgotten and presented a most shocking appearance .
chapter 8 as i viewed myself in a fragment of looking-glass which <name> up in the cabin , and by the dim light of a kind of <unk> , i was so impressed with a sense of vague awe at my appearance , and at the recollection of the terrific reality which i was thus representing , that i was seized with a violent <unk> , and could scarcely summon resolution to go on with my part .
it was necessary , however , to act with decision , and peters and myself went upon deck .
we there found everything safe , and , keeping close to the bulwarks , the three of us crept to the cabin <unk> .
it was only partially closed , precautions having been taken to prevent its being suddenly pushed to from without , by means of placing billets of wood on the upper step so as to interfere with the shutting .
we found no difficulty in getting a full view of the interior of the cabin through the cracks where the hinges were placed .
it now proved to have been very fortunate for us that we had not attempted to take them by surprise , for they were evidently on the alert .
only one was asleep , and he lying just at the foot of the <unk> , with a musket by his side .
the rest were seated on several <unk> , which had been taken from the berths and thrown on the floor .
they were engaged in <name> conversation ; and although they had been carousing , as appeared from two empty <unk> , with some tin tumblers which lay about , they were not as much intoxicated as usual .
all had knives , one or two of them pistols , and a great many muskets were lying in a berth close at hand .
we listened to their conversation for some time before we could make up our minds how to act , having as yet resolved on nothing determinate , except that we would attempt to <unk> their exertions , when we should attack them , by means of the apparition of rogers .
they were discussing their piratical plans , in which all we could hear distinctly was , that they would unite with the crew of a schooner hornet , and , if possible , get the schooner herself into their possession preparatory to some attempt on a large scale , the particulars of which could not be made out by either of us .
one of the men spoke of peters , when the mate replied to him in a low voice which could not be distinguished , and afterward added more loudly , that " he could not understand his being so much forward with the captain 's brat in the forecastle , and he thought the sooner both of them were overboard the better . "
to this no answer was made , but we could easily perceive that the hint was well received by the whole party , and more particularly by jones .
at this period i was excessively agitated , the more so as i could see that neither <name> nor peters could determine how to act .
i made up my mind , however , to sell my life as dearly as possible , and not to suffer myself to be overcome by any feelings of trepidation .
the tremendous noise made by the roaring of the wind in the rigging , and the washing of the sea over the deck , prevented us from hearing what was said , except during momentary <unk> .
in one of these , we all distinctly heard the mate tell one of the men to " go forward , have an eye upon them , for he wanted no such secret doings on board the brig . "
it was well for us that the pitching of the vessel at this moment was so violent as to prevent this order from being carried into instant execution .
the cook got up from his mattress to go for us , when a tremendous lurch , which i thought would <name> away the masts , threw him headlong against one of the larboard stateroom doors , bursting it open , and creating a good deal of other confusion .
luckily , neither of our party was thrown from his position , and we had time to make a precipitate retreat to the forecastle , and arrange a hurried plan of action before the messenger made his appearance , or rather before he put his head out of the <unk> , for he did not come on deck .
from this station he could not notice the absence of <name> , and he accordingly bawled out , as if to him , repeating the orders of the mate .
peters cried out , " ay , ay , " in a disguised voice , and the cook immediately went below , without entertaining a suspicion that all was not right .
my two companions now proceeded boldly aft and down into the cabin , peters closing the door after him in the same manner he had found it .
the mate received them with feigned cordiality , and told <name> that , since he had behaved himself so well of late , he might take up his quarters in the cabin and be one of them for the future .
he then poured him out a tumbler half full of rum , and made him drink it .
all this i saw and heard , for i followed my friends to the cabin as soon as the door was shut , and took up my old point of observation .
i had brought with me the two <unk> , one of which i secured near the <unk> , to be ready for use when required .
i now steadied myself as well as possible so as to have a good view of all that was passing within , and endeavoured to nerve myself to the task of descending among the mutineers when peters should make a signal to me , as agreed upon .
presently he contrived to turn the conversation upon the bloody deeds of the mutiny , and by degrees led the men to talk of the thousand superstitions which are so universally current among seamen .
i could not make out all that was said , but i could plainly see the effects of the conversation in the countenances of those present .
the mate was evidently much agitated , and presently , when some one mentioned the terrific appearance of rogers ' corpse , i thought he was upon the point of <unk> .
peters now asked him if he did not think it would be better to have the body thrown overboard at once as it was too horrible a sight to see it floundering about in the scuppers .
at this the villain absolutely gasped for breath , and turned his head slowly round upon his companions , as if imploring some one to go up and perform the task .
no one , however , stirred , and it was quite evident that the whole party were wound up to the highest pitch of nervous excitement .
peters now made me the signal .
i immediately threw open the door of the <unk> , and , descending , without uttering a syllable , stood erect in the midst of the party .
the intense effect produced by this sudden apparition is not at all to be wondered at when the various circumstances are taken into consideration .
usually , in cases of a similar nature , there is left in the mind of the spectator some glimmering of doubt as to the reality of the vision before his eyes ; a degree of <name> , however feeble , that he is the victim of <unk> , and that the apparition is not actually a <unk> from the old world of shadows .
it is not too much to say that such remnants of doubt have been at the bottom of almost every such visitation , and that the appalling horror which has sometimes been brought about , is to be attributed , even in the cases most in point , and where most suffering has been experienced , more to a kind of <unk> horror , lest the apparition might possibly be real , than to an <unk> belief in its reality .
but , in the present instance , it <name> be seen immediately , that in the minds of the mutineers there was not even the shadow of a basis upon which to rest a doubt that the apparition of rogers was indeed a <unk> of his disgusting corpse , or at least its spiritual image .
the isolated situation of the brig , with its entire <unk> on account of the <name> , confined the apparently possible means of deception within such narrow and definite limits , that they must have thought themselves enabled to survey them all at a glance .
they had now been at sea twenty-four days , without holding more than a speaking communication with any vessel whatever .
the whole of the crew , too  at least all whom they had the most remote reason for suspecting to be on board  were assembled in the cabin , with the exception of <name> , the watch ; and his gigantic stature ( he was six feet six inches high ) was too familiar in their eyes to permit the notion that he was the apparition before them to enter their minds even for an instant .
add to these considerations the awe-inspiring nature of the tempest , and that of the conversation brought about by peters ; the deep impression which the <unk> of the actual corpse had made in the morning upon the imaginations of the men ; the excellence of the imitation in my person , and the uncertain and wavering light in which they beheld me , as the glare of the cabin lantern , swinging violently to and fro , fell dubiously and fitfully upon my figure , and there <name> be no reason to wonder that the deception had even more than the entire effect which we had anticipated .
the mate sprang up from the mattress on which he was lying , and , without uttering a syllable , fell back , stone dead , upon the cabin floor , and was hurled to the leeward like a log by a heavy roll of the brig .
of the remaining seven , there were but three who had at first any degree of presence of mind .
the four others sat for some time rooted apparently to the floor , the most pitiable objects of horror and utter despair my eyes ever encountered .
the only opposition we experienced at all was from the cook , <name> hunt , and <name> <name> ; but they made but a feeble and irresolute defence .
the two former were shot instantly by peters , and i felled <name> with a blow on the head from the <unk> which i had brought with me .
in the meantime , <name> seized one of the muskets lying on the floor and shot another mutineer <name> through the breast .
there were now but three remaining ; but by this time they had become aroused from their lethargy , and perhaps began to see that a deception had been practised upon them , for they fought with great resolution and fury , and , but for the immense muscular strength of peters , might have ultimately got the better of us .
these three men were  jones , <unk> , and <unk> hicks .
jones had thrown <name> to the floor , stabbed him in several places along the right arm , and would no doubt have soon dispatched him ( as neither peters nor myself could immediately get rid of our own antagonists ) , had it not been for the timely aid of a friend , upon whose assistance we , surely , had never depended .
this friend was no other than tiger .
with a low growl , he bounded into the cabin , at a most critical moment for <name> , and throwing himself upon jones , pinned him to the floor in an instant .
my friend , however , was now too much injured to render us any aid whatever , and i was so encumbered with my disguise that i could do but little .
the dog would not leave his hold upon the throat of jones  peters , nevertheless , was far more than a match for the two men who remained , and would , no doubt , have dispatched them sooner , had it not been for the narrow space in which he had to act , and the tremendous <unk> of the vessel .
presently he was enabled to get hold of a heavy stool , several of which lay about the floor .
with this he beat out the brains of <unk> as he was in the act of discharging a musket at me , and immediately afterward a roll of the brig throwing him in contact with hicks , he seized him by the throat , and , by dint of sheer strength , strangled him instantaneously .
thus , in far less time than i have taken to tell it , we found ourselves masters of the brig .
the only person of our opponents who was left alive was <name> <name> .
this man , it <name> be remembered , i had knocked down with a blow from the <unk> at the commencement of the attack .
he now lay motionless by the door of the shattered stateroom ; but , upon peters touching him with his foot , he spoke , and entreated for <name> .
his head was only slightly cut , and otherwise he had received no injury , having been merely stunned by the blow .
he now got up , and , for the present , we secured his hands behind his back .
the dog was still growling over jones ; but , upon examination , we found him completely dead , the blood issuing in a stream from a deep wound in the throat , inflicted , no doubt , by the sharp teeth of the animal .
it was now about one o'clock in the morning , and the wind was still blowing tremendously .
the brig evidently laboured much more than usual , and it became absolutely necessary that something should be done with a view of <unk> her in some measure .
at almost every roll to leeward she shipped a sea , several of which came partially down into the cabin during our scuffle , the hatchway having been left open by myself when i descended .
the entire range of bulwarks to larboard had been swept away , as well as the <unk> , together with the <unk> from the counter .
the creaking and working of the mainmast , too , gave indication that it was nearly sprung .
to make room for more stowage in the <unk> , the heel of this mast had been stepped between decks ( a very reprehensible practice , occasionally resorted to by ignorant <unk> ) , so that it was in imminent danger of working from its step .
but , to crown all our difficulties , we <unk> the well , and found no less than seven feet of water .
leaving the bodies of the crew lying in the cabin , we got to work immediately at the pumps  <name> , of course , being set at <name> to assist us in the labour .
<name> 's arm was bound up as well as we could effect it , and he did what he could , but that was not much .
however , we found that we could just manage to keep the leak from gaining upon us by having one pump constantly going .
as there were only four of us , this was severe labour ; but we endeavoured to keep up our spirits , and looked anxiously for daybreak , when we hoped to lighten the brig by cutting away the mainmast .
in this manner we passed a night of terrible anxiety and fatigue , and , when the day at length broke , the <name> had neither abated in the least , nor were there any signs of its abating .
we now dragged the bodies on deck and threw them overboard .
our next care was to get rid of the mainmast .
the necessary preparations having been made , peters cut away at the mast ( having found axes in the cabin ) , while the rest of us stood by the stays and <unk> .
as the brig gave a tremendous <unk> , the word was given to cut away the <unk> , which being done , the whole mass of wood and rigging plunged into the sea , clear of the brig , and without doing any material injury .
we now found that the vessel did not labour quite as much as before , but our situation was still exceedingly precarious , and in spite of the utmost exertions , we could not gain upon the leak without the aid of both pumps .
the little assistance which <name> could render us was not really of any importance .
to add to our distress , a heavy sea , striking the brig to the windward , threw her off several points from the wind , and , before she could regain her position , another broke completely over her , and hurled her full upon her <unk> .
the ballast now shifted in a mass to leeward ( the stowage had been knocking about perfectly at random for some time ) , and for a few moments we thought nothing could save us from <unk> .
presently , however , we partially righted ; but the ballast still retaining its place to larboard , we lay so much along that it was useless to think of working the pumps , which indeed we could not have done much longer in any case , as our hands were entirely raw with the excessive labour we had undergone , and were bleeding in the most horrible manner .
contrary to <name> 's advice , we now proceeded to cut away the foremast , and at length accomplished it after much difficulty , owing to the position in which we lay .
in going overboard the wreck took with it the bowsprit , and left us a complete hulk .
so far we had had reason to rejoice in the escape of our <unk> , which had received no damage from any of the huge seas which had come on board .
but we had not long to congratulate ourselves ; for the foremast having gone , and , of course , the foresail with it , by which the brig had been steadied , every sea now made a complete breach over us , and in five minutes our deck was swept from stern to stern , the <unk> and starboard bulwarks torn off , and even the windlass shattered into fragments .
it was , indeed , hardly possible for us to be in a more pitiable condition .
at noon there seemed to be some slight appearance of the <name> 's abating , but in this we were sadly disappointed , for it only lulled for a few minutes to blow with redoubled fury .
about four in the afternoon it was utterly impossible to stand up against the violence of the blast ; and , as the night closed in upon us , i had not a shadow of <name> that the vessel would hold together until morning .
by midnight we had settled very deep in the water , which was now up to the <unk> deck .
the rudder went soon afterward , the sea which tore it away lifting the after portion of the brig entirely from the water , against which she thumped in her descent with such a concussion as would be occasioned by going ashore .
we had all calculated that the rudder would hold its own to the last , as it was unusually strong , being rigged as i have never seen one rigged either before or since .
down its main timber there ran a succession of stout iron hooks , and others in the same manner down the <unk> .
through these hooks there extended a very thick <unk> <name> , the rudder being thus held to the <unk> and swinging freely on the <name> .
the tremendous force of the sea which tore it off may be estimated by the fact , that the hooks in the <unk> , which ran entirely through it , being clinched on the inside , were drawn every one of them completely out of the solid wood .
we had scarcely time to draw breath after the violence of this shock , when one of the most tremendous waves i had then ever known broke right on board of us , sweeping the <unk> clear off , bursting in the <unk> , and filling every inch of the vessel with water .
chapter 9 luckily , just before night , all four of us had lashed ourselves firmly to the fragments of the windlass , lying in this manner as flat upon the deck as possible .
this precaution alone saved us from destruction .
as it was , we were all more or less stunned by the immense weight of water which tumbled upon us , and which did not roll from above us until we were nearly exhausted .
as soon as i could recover breath , i called aloud to my companions .
<name> alone replied , saying : " it is all over with us , and may god have <name> upon our souls ! "
by-and-by both the others were enabled to speak , when they <unk> us to take courage , as there was still <name> ; it being impossible , from the nature of the cargo , that the brig could go down , and there being every chance that the <name> would blow over by the morning .
these words inspired me with new life ; for , strange as it may seem , although it was obvious that a vessel with a cargo of empty <unk> would not sink , i had been hitherto so confused in mind as to have overlooked this consideration altogether ; and the danger which i had for some time regarded as the most imminent was that of <unk> .
as <name> revived within me , i made use of every opportunity to strengthen the lashings which held me to the remains of the windlass , and in this occupation i soon discovered that my companions were also busy .
the night was as dark as it could possibly be , and the horrible shrieking din and confusion which surrounded us it is useless to attempt describing .
our deck lay level with the sea , or rather we were encircled with a towering ridge of foam , a portion of which swept over us even instant .
it is not too much to say that our heads were not fairly out of the water more than one second in three .
although we lay close together , no one of us could see the other , or , indeed , any portion of the brig itself , upon which we were so <unk> hurled about .
at intervals we called one to the other , thus endeavouring to keep alive <name> , and render consolation and encouragement to such of us as stood most in need of it .
the feeble condition of <name> made him an object of solicitude with us all ; and as , from the <unk> condition of his right arm , it must have been impossible for him to secure his lashings with any degree of firmness , we were in momentary expectation of finding that he had gone overboard  yet to render him aid was a thing altogether out of the question .
fortunately , his station was more secure than that of any of the rest of us ; for the upper part of his body lying just beneath a portion of the shattered windlass , the seas , as they tumbled in upon him , were greatly broken in their violence .
in any other situation than this ( into which he had been accidentally thrown after having lashed himself in a very exposed spot ) he must inevitably have perished before morning .
owing to the brig 's lying so much along , we were all less liable to be washed off than otherwise would have been the case .
the heel , as i have before stated , was to larboard , about one half of the deck being constantly under water .
the seas , therefore , which struck us to starboard were much broken , by the vessel 's side , only reaching us in fragments as we lay flat on our faces ; while those which came from larboard being what are called <unk> seas , and obtaining little hold upon us on account of our posture , had not sufficient force to drag us from our fastenings .
in this frightful situation we lay until the day broke so as to show us more fully the horrors which surrounded us .
the brig was a mere log , rolling about at the <name> of every wave ; the <name> was upon the increase , if any thing , blowing indeed a complete hurricane , and there appeared to us no earthly prospect of deliverance .
for several hours we held on in silence , expecting every moment that our lashings would either give way , that the remains of the windlass would go by the board , or that some of the huge seas , which roared in every direction around us and above us , would drive the hulk so far beneath the water that we should be drowned before it could regain the surface .
by the <name> of god , however , we were preserved from these imminent dangers , and about midday were cheered by the light of the blessed sun .
shortly afterward we could perceive a sensible diminution in the force of the wind , when , now for the first time since the latter part of the evening before , <name> spoke , asking peters , who lay closest to him , if he thought there was any possibility of our being saved .
as no reply was at first made to this question , we all concluded that the hybrid had been drowned where he lay ; but presently , to our great <name> , he spoke , although very feebly , saying that he was in great pain , being so cut by the <unk> of his lashings across the stomach , that he must either find means of loosening them or perish , as it was impossible that he could endure his misery much longer .
this occasioned us great distress , as it was altogether useless to think of aiding him in any manner while the sea continued washing over us as it did .
we <unk> him to bear his sufferings with fortitude , and promised to seize the first opportunity which should offer itself to relieve him .
he replied that it would soon be too late ; that it would be all over with him before we could help him ; and then , after moaning for some minutes , lay silent , when we concluded that he had perished .
as the evening <name> on , the sea had fallen so much that scarcely more than one wave broke over the hulk from windward in the course of five minutes , and the wind had abated a great deal , although still blowing a severe <name> .
i had not heard any of my companions speak for hours , and now called to <name> .
he replied , although very feebly , so that i could not distinguish what he said .
i then spoke to peters and to <name> , neither of whom returned any answer .
shortly after this period i fell into a state of partial insensibility , during which the most pleasing images floated in my imagination ; such as green trees , waving meadows of ripe grain , processions of dancing girls , troops of cavalry , and other <unk> .
i now remember that , in all which passed before my mind 's eye , motion was a predominant idea .
thus , i never fancied any stationary object , such as a house , a mountain , or any thing of that kind ; but <unk> , ships , large birds , balloons , people on horseback , carriages driving furiously , and similar moving objects , presented themselves in endless succession .
when i recovered from this state , the sun was , as near as i could guess , an hour high .
i had the greatest difficulty in bringing to recollection the various circumstances connected with my situation , and for some time remained firmly convinced that i was still in the hold of the brig , near the box , and that the body of <name> was that of tiger .
when i at length completely came to my senses , i found that the wind blew no more than a moderate breeze , and that the sea was comparatively calm ; so much so that it only washed over the brig amidships .
my left arm had broken loose from its lashings , and was much cut about the elbow ; my right was entirely benumbed , and the hand and wrist swollen prodigiously by the pressure of the rope , which had worked from the shoulder downward .
i was also in great pain from another rope which went about my waist , and had been drawn to an insufferable degree of <unk> .
looking round upon my companions , i saw that peters still lived , although a thick line was pulled so forcibly around his loins as to give him the appearance of being cut nearly in two ; as i stirred , he made a feeble motion to me with his hand , pointing to the rope .
<name> gave no indication of life whatever , and was bent nearly double across a splinter of the windlass .
<name> spoke to me when he saw me moving , and asked me if i had not sufficient strength to release him from his situation , saying that if i would summon up what spirits i could , and contrive to untie him , we might yet save our lives ; but that otherwise we must all perish .
i told him to take courage , and i would endeavor to free him .
feeling in my pantaloons ' pocket , i got hold of my penknife , and , after several ineffectual attempts , at length succeeded in opening it .
i then , with my left hand , managed to free my right from its fastenings , and afterward cut the other ropes which held me .
upon attempting , however , to move from my position , i found that my legs failed me altogether , and that i could not get up ; neither could i move my right arm in any direction .
upon mentioning this to <name> , he advised me to lie quiet for a few minutes , holding on to the windlass with my left hand , so as to allow time for the blood to circulate .
doing this , the <unk> presently began to die away so that i could move first one of my legs , and then the other , and , shortly afterward i regained the partial use of my right arm .
i now crawled with great caution toward <name> , without getting on my legs , and soon cut loose all the lashings about him , when , after a short delay , he also recovered the partial use of his limbs .
we now lost no time in getting loose the rope from peters .
it had cut a deep gash through the <unk> of his woollen pantaloons , and through two shirts , and made its way into his <unk> , from which the blood flowed out copiously as we removed the cordage .
no sooner had we removed it , however , than he spoke , and seemed to experience instant relief  being able to move with much greater ease than either <name> or myself  this was no doubt owing to the discharge of blood .
we had little hopes that <name> would recover , as he evinced no signs of life ; but , upon getting to him , we discovered that he had merely swooned from the loss of blood , the bandages we had placed around his wounded arm having been torn off by the water ; none of the ropes which held him to the windlass were drawn sufficiently tight to occasion his death .
having relieved him from the fastenings , and got him clear of the broken wood about the windlass , we secured him in a dry place to windward , with his head somewhat lower than his body , and all three of us busied ourselves in chafing his limbs .
in about half an hour he came to himself , although it was not until the next morning that he gave signs of recognizing any of us , or had sufficient strength to speak .
by the time we had thus got clear of our lashings it was quite dark , and it began to cloud up , so that we were again in the greatest agony lest it should come on to blow hard , in which event nothing could have saved us from perishing , exhausted as we were .
by good fortune it continued very moderate during the night , the sea subsiding every minute , which gave us great hopes of ultimate preservation .
a gentle breeze still blew from the n. w. , but the weather was not at all cold .
<name> was lashed carefully to windward in such a manner as to prevent him from slipping overboard with the rolls of the vessel , as he was still too weak to hold on at all .
for ourselves there was no such necessity .
we sat close together , supporting each other with the aid of the broken ropes about the windlass , and devising methods of escape from our frightful situation .
we derived much comfort from taking off our clothes and wringing the water from them .
when we put them on after this , they felt remarkably warm and pleasant , and served to <unk> us in no little degree .
we helped <name> off with his , and wrung them for him , when he experienced the same comfort .
our chief sufferings were now those of hunger and thirst , and when we looked forward to the means of relief in this respect , our hearts sunk within us , and we were induced to regret that we had escaped the less dreadful perils of the sea .
we endeavoured , however , to console ourselves with the <name> of being speedily picked up by some vessel and encouraged each other to bear with fortitude the evils that might happen .
the morning of the fourteenth at length dawned , and the weather still continued clear and pleasant , with a steady but very light breeze from the n. w. the sea was now quite smooth , and as , from some cause which we could not determine , the brig did not lie so much along as she had done before , the deck was comparatively dry , and we could move about with freedom .
we had now been better than three entire days and nights without either food or drink , and it became absolutely necessary that we should make an attempt to get up something from below .
as the brig was completely full of water , we went to this work <unk> , and with but little expectation of being able to obtain anything .
we made a kind of drag by driving some nails which we broke out from the remains of the <unk> into two pieces of wood .
tying these across each other , and fastening them to the end of a rope , we threw them into the cabin , and dragged them to and fro , in the faint <name> of being thus able to <unk> some article which might be of use to us for food , or which might at least render us assistance in getting it .
we spent the greater part of the morning in this labour without effect , fishing up nothing more than a few <unk> , which were readily caught by the nails .
indeed , our contrivance was so very clumsy that any greater success was hardly to be anticipated .
we now tried the forecastle , but equally in vain , and were upon the brink of despair , when peters proposed that we should fasten a rope to his body , and let him make an attempt to get up something by diving into the cabin .
this proposition we hailed with all the delight which reviving <name> could inspire .
he proceeded immediately to strip off his clothes with the exception of his pantaloons ; and a strong rope was then carefully fastened around his middle , being brought up over his shoulders in such a manner that there was no possibility of its slipping .
the undertaking was one of great difficulty and danger ; for , as we could hardly expect to find much , if any , provision in the cabin itself , it was necessary that the <unk> , after letting himself down , should make a turn to the right , and proceed under water a distance of ten or twelve feet , in a narrow passage , to the storeroom , and return , without drawing breath .
everything being ready , peters now descended in the cabin , going down the <unk> until the water reached his <name> .
he then plunged in , head first , turning to the right as he plunged , and endeavouring to make his way to the storeroom .
in this first attempt , however , he was altogether unsuccessful .
in less than half a minute after his going down we felt the rope jerked violently ( the signal we had agreed upon when he desired to be drawn up ) .
we accordingly <name> him up instantly , but so <unk> as to bruise him badly against the ladder .
he had brought nothing with him , and had been unable to penetrate more than a very little way into the passage , owing to the constant exertions he found it necessary to make in order to keep himself from floating up against the deck .
upon getting out he was very much exhausted , and had to rest full fifteen minutes before he could again venture to descend .
the second attempt met with even worse success ; for he remained so long under water without giving the signal , that , becoming alarmed for his safety , we <name> him out without it , and found that he was almost at the last gasp , having , as he said , repeatedly jerked at the rope without our feeling it .
this was probably owing to a portion of it having become entangled in the balustrade at the foot of the ladder .
this balustrade was , indeed , so much in the way , that we determined to remove it , if possible , before proceeding with our design .
as we had no means of getting it away except by main force , we all descended into the water as far as we could on the ladder , and giving a pull against it with our united strength , succeeded in breaking it down .
the third attempt was equally unsuccessful with the two first , and it now became evident that nothing could be done in this manner without the aid of some weight with which the <unk> might steady himself , and keep to the floor of the cabin while making his search .
for a long time we looked about in vain for something which might answer this purpose ; but at length , to our great <name> , we discovered one of the <unk> so loose that we had not the least difficulty in <unk> it off .
having fastened this securely to one of his ankles , peters now made his fourth descent into the cabin , and this time succeeded in making his way to the door of the steward 's room .
to his inexpressible grief , however , he found it locked , and was obliged to return without effecting an entrance , as , with the greatest exertion , he could remain under water not more , at the utmost extent , than a single minute .
our affairs now looked gloomy indeed , and neither <name> nor myself could refrain from bursting into tears , as we thought of the host of difficulties which encompassed us , and the slight probability which existed of our finally making an escape .
but this weakness was not of long duration .
throwing ourselves on our knees to god , we implored his aid in the many dangers which beset us ; and arose with renewed <name> and vigor to think what could yet be done by mortal means toward accomplishing our deliverance .
chapter 10 shortly afterward an incident occurred which i am induced to look upon as more intensely productive of emotion , as far more replete with the extremes first of delight and then of horror , than even any of the thousand chances which afterward befell me in nine long years , crowded with events of the most startling and , in many cases , of the most <unk> and <unk> character .
we were lying on the deck near the <unk> , and debating the possibility of yet making our way into the storeroom , when , looking toward <name> , who lay fronting myself , i perceived that he had become all at once deadly pale , and that his lips were quivering in the most singular and unaccountable manner .
greatly alarmed , i spoke to him , but he made me no reply , and i was beginning to think that he was suddenly taken ill , when i took notice of his eyes , which were glaring apparently at some object behind me .
i turned my head , and shall never forget the ecstatic <name> which thrilled through every particle of my frame , when i perceived a large brig bearing down upon us , and not more than a couple of miles off .
i sprung to my feet as if a musket bullet had suddenly struck me to the heart ; and , stretching out my arms in the direction of the vessel , stood in this manner , motionless , and unable to articulate a syllable .
peters and <name> were equally affected , although in different ways .
the former danced about the deck like a madman , uttering the most extravagant <unk> , intermingled with howls and imprecations , while the latter burst into tears , and continued for many minutes weeping like a child .
the vessel in sight was a large hermaphrodite brig , of a dutch build , and painted black , with a tawdry gilt <unk> .
she had evidently seen a good deal of rough weather , and , we supposed , had suffered much in the <name> which had proved so disastrous to ourselves ; for her <unk> was gone , and some of her starboard bulwarks .
when we first saw her , she was , as i have already said , about two miles off and to windward , bearing down upon us .
the breeze was very gentle , and what astonished us chiefly was , that she had no other sails set than her foremast and mainsail , with a flying jib  of course she came down but slowly , and our impatience amounted nearly to phrensy .
the awkward manner in which she steered , too , was remarked by all of us , even excited as we were .
she <unk> about so considerably , that once or twice we thought it impossible she could see us , or imagined that , having seen us , and discovered no person on board , she was about to tack and make off in another direction .
upon each of these occasions we screamed and shouted at the top of our voices , when the stranger would appear to change for a moment her intention , and again hold on toward us  this singular conduct being repeated two or three times , so that at last we could think of no other manner of accounting for it than by supposing the helmsman to be in liquor .
no person was seen upon her decks until she arrived within about a quarter of a mile of us .
we then saw three seamen , whom by their dress we took to be <unk> .
two of these were lying on some old sails near the forecastle , and the third , who appeared to be looking at us with great curiosity , was leaning over the starboard bow near the bowsprit .
this last was a stout and tall man , with a very dark skin .
he seemed by his manner to be encouraging us to have <name> , nodding to us in a cheerful although rather odd way , and smiling constantly , so as to display a set of the most brilliantly white teeth .
as his vessel <name> nearer , we saw a red flannel cap which he had on fall from his head into the water ; but of this he took little or no notice , continuing his odd smiles and gesticulations .
i relate these things and circumstances minutely , and i relate them , it must be understood , precisely as they appeared to us .
the brig came on slowly , and now more steadily than before , and  i can not speak calmly of this event  our hearts leaped up wildly within us , and we poured out our whole souls in shouts and thanksgiving to god for the complete , unexpected , and glorious deliverance that was so palpably at hand .
of a sudden , and all at once , there came wafted over the ocean from the strange vessel ( which was now close upon us ) a smell , a stench , such as the whole world has no name for  no <name> of  <unk>  utterly suffocating  insufferable , inconceivable .
i gasped for breath , and turning to my companions , perceived that they were paler than marble .
but we had now no time left for question or surmise  the brig was within fifty feet of us , and it seemed to be her intention to run under our counter , that we might board her without putting out a boat .
we rushed aft , when , suddenly , a wide <unk> threw her off full five or six points from the course she had been running , and , as she passed under our stern at the distance of about twenty feet , we had a full view of her decks .
shall i ever forget the triple horror of that spectacle ?
twenty-five or thirty human bodies , among whom were several females , lay scattered about between the counter and the galley in the last and most loathsome state of <unk> .
we plainly saw that not a soul lived in that fated vessel !
yet we could not help shouting to the dead for help !
yes , long and loudly did we beg , in the agony of the moment , that those silent and disgusting images would stay for us , would not abandon us to become like them , would receive us among their goodly company !
we were raving with horror and despair  thoroughly mad through the anguish of our grievous disappointment .
as our first loud yell of terror broke forth , it was replied to by something , from near the bowsprit of the stranger , so closely resembling the scream of a human voice that the nicest ear might have been startled and deceived .
at this instant another sudden <unk> brought the region of the forecastle for a moment into view , and we beheld at once the origin of the sound .
we saw the tall stout figure still leaning on the bulwark , and still nodding his head to and fro , but his face was now turned from us so that we could not behold it .
his arms were extended over the rail , and the palms of his hands fell outward .
his knees were lodged upon a stout rope , tightly stretched , and reaching from the heel of the bowsprit to a <unk> .
on his back , from which a portion of the shirt had been torn , leaving it bare , there sat a huge <unk> , busily <unk> itself with the horrible flesh , its <name> and talons deep buried , and its white plumage spattered all over with blood .
as the brig moved farther round so as to bring us close in view , the bird , with much apparent difficulty , <name> out its <unk> head , and , after eyeing us for a moment as if stupefied , arose lazily from the body upon which it had been feasting , and , flying directly above our deck , hovered there a while with a portion of clotted and <unk> substance in its beak .
the horrid morsel dropped at length with a sullen splash immediately at the feet of <name> .
may god forgive me , but now , for the first time , there flashed through my mind a thought , a thought which i <name> not mention , and i felt myself making a step toward the <unk> spot .
i looked upward , and the eyes of <name> met my own with a degree of intense and eager meaning which immediately brought me to my senses .
i sprang forward quickly , and , with a deep shudder , threw the frightful thing into the sea .
the body from which it had been taken , resting as it did upon the rope , had been easily swayed to and fro by the exertions of the carnivorous bird , and it was this motion which had at first impressed us with the belief of its being alive .
as the gull relieved it of its weight , it swung round and fell partially over , so that the face was fully discovered .
never , surely , was any object so terribly full of awe !
the eyes were gone , and the whole flesh around the mouth , leaving the teeth utterly naked .
this , then , was the smile which had cheered us on to <name> !
this the  but i forbear .
the brig , as i have already told , passed under our stern , and made its way slowly but steadily to leeward .
with her and with her terrible crew went all our <name> visions of deliverance and <name> .
deliberately as she went by , we might possibly have found means of boarding her , had not our sudden disappointment and the appalling nature of the discovery which accompanied it laid entirely prostrate every active faculty of mind and body .
we had seen and felt , but we could neither think nor act , until , alas !
too late .
how much our intellects had been weakened by this incident may be estimated by the fact , that when the vessel had proceeded so far that we could perceive no more than the half of her hull , the proposition was seriously entertained of attempting to overtake her by swimming !
i have , since this period , vainly endeavoured to obtain some clew to the hideous uncertainty which enveloped the fate of the stranger .
her build and general appearance , as i have before stated , led us to the belief that she was a dutch trader , and the dresses of the crew also sustained this opinion .
we might have easily seen the name upon her stern , and , indeed , taken other observations , which would have guided us in making out her character ; but the intense excitement of the moment blinded us to every thing of that nature .
from the <unk> <name> of such of the corpses as were not entirely decayed , we concluded that the whole of her company had perished by the yellow fever , or some other <unk> disease of the same fearful kind .
if such were the case ( and i know not what else to imagine ) , death , to judge from the positions of the bodies , must have come upon them in a manner awfully sudden and overwhelming , in a way totally distinct from that which generally <unk> even the most deadly <unk> with which mankind are acquainted .
it is possible , indeed , that poison , accidentally introduced into some of their <unk> , may have brought about the disaster , or that the eating of some unknown venomous species of fish , or other <name> animal , or oceanic bird , might have induced it  but it is utterly useless to form conjectures where all is involved , and <name> , no doubt , remain for ever involved , in the most appalling and unfathomable mystery .
chapter 11 we spent the remainder of the day in a condition of stupid lethargy , gazing after the retreating vessel until the darkness , hiding her from our sight , recalled us in some measure to our senses .
the pangs of hunger and thirst then returned , absorbing all other cares and considerations .
nothing , however , could be done until the morning , and , securing ourselves as well as possible , we endeavoured to snatch a little repose .
in this i succeeded beyond my expectations , sleeping until my companions , who had not been so fortunate , aroused me at daybreak to renew our attempts at getting up provisions from the hull .
it was now a dead calm , with the sea as smooth as have ever known it ,  the weather warm and pleasant .
the brig was out of sight .
we commenced our operations by <unk> off , with some trouble , another of the <unk> ; and having fastened both to peters ' feet , he again made an endeavour to reach the door of the storeroom , thinking it possible that he might be able to force it open , provided he could get at it in sufficient time ; and this he hoped to do , as the hulk lay much more steadily than before .
he succeeded very quickly in reaching the door , when , loosening one of the chains from his ankle , he made every exertion to force the passage with it , but in vain , the framework of the room being far stronger than was anticipated .
he was quite exhausted with his long stay under water , and it became absolutely necessary that some other one of us should take his place .
for this service <name> immediately volunteered ; but , after making three ineffectual efforts , found that he could never even succeed in getting near the door .
the condition of <name> 's wounded arm rendered it useless for him to attempt going down , as he would be unable to force the room open should he reach it , and it accordingly now devolved upon me to exert myself for our common deliverance .
peters had left one of the chains in the passage , and i found , upon plunging in , that i had not sufficient balance to keep me firmly down .
i determined , therefore , to attempt no more , in my first effort , than merely to recover the other chain .
in groping along the floor of the passage for this , i felt a hard substance , which i immediately grasped , not having time to ascertain what it was , but returning and ascending instantly to the surface .
the prize proved to be a bottle , and our <name> may be conceived when i say that it was found to be full of port wine .
giving thanks to god for this timely and cheering assistance , we immediately <name> the cork with my penknife , and , each taking a moderate sup , felt the most indescribable comfort from the warmth , strength , and spirits with which it inspired us .
we then carefully <unk> the bottle , and , by means of a handkerchief , swung it in such a manner that there was no possibility of its getting broken .
having rested a while after this fortunate discovery , i again descended , and now recovered the chain , with which i instantly came up .
i then fastened it on and went down for the third time , when i became fully satisfied that no exertions whatever , in that situation , would enable me to force open the door of the storeroom .
i therefore returned in despair .
there seemed now to be no longer any room for <name> , and i could perceive in the countenances of my companions that they had made up their minds to perish .
the wine had evidently produced in them a species of delirium , which , perhaps , i had been prevented from feeling by the immersion i had undergone since drinking it .
they talked <unk> , and about matters unconnected with our condition , peters repeatedly asking me questions about nantucket .
<name> , too , i remember , approached me with a serious air , and requested me to lend him a <unk> , as his hair was full of <unk> , and he wished to get them out before going on shore .
<name> appeared somewhat less affected , and urged me to dive at random into the cabin , and bring up any article which might come to hand .
to this i consented , and , in the first attempt , after staying under a full minute , brought up a small leather trunk belonging to captain barnard .
this was immediately opened in the faint <name> that it might contain something to eat or drink .
we found nothing , however , except a box of razors and two linen shirts .
i now went down again , and returned without any success .
as my head came above water i heard a crash on deck , and , upon getting up , saw that my companions had <unk> taken advantage of my absence to drink the remainder of the wine , having let the bottle fall in the endeavour to replace it before i saw them .
i remonstrated with them on the <unk> of their conduct , when <name> burst into tears .
the other two endeavoured to laugh the matter off as a joke , but i <name> never again to behold laughter of such a species : the <unk> of countenance was absolutely frightful .
indeed , it was apparent that the stimulus , in the empty state of their stomachs , had taken instant and violent effect , and that they were all exceedingly intoxicated .
with great difficulty i prevailed upon them to lie down , when they fell very soon into a heavy slumber , accompanied with loud <unk> breathing .
i now found myself , as it were , alone in the brig , and my reflections , to be sure , were of the most fearful and gloomy nature .
no prospect offered itself to my view but a lingering death by famine , or , at the best , by being overwhelmed in the first <name> which should spring up , for in our present exhausted condition we could have no <name> of living through another .
the gnawing hunger which i now experienced was nearly insupportable , and i felt myself capable of going to any lengths in order to appease it .
with my knife i cut off a small portion of the leather trunk , and endeavoured to eat it , but found it utterly impossible to swallow a single morsel , although i fancied that some little <unk> of my suffering was obtained by chewing small pieces of it and spitting them out .
toward night my companions awoke , one by one , each in an indescribable state of weakness and horror , brought on by the wine , whose fumes had now evaporated .
they shook as if with a violent ague , and uttered the most lamentable cries for water .
their condition affected me in the most lively degree , at the same time causing me to rejoice in the fortunate train of circumstances which had prevented me from indulging in the wine , and consequently from sharing their melancholy and most distressing sensations .
their conduct , however , gave me great uneasiness and alarm ; for it was evident that , unless some favourable change took place , they could afford me no assistance in providing for our common safety .
i had not yet abandoned all idea being able to get up something from below ; but the attempt could not possibly be resumed until some one of them was sufficiently master of himself to aid me by holding the end of the rope while i went down .
<name> appeared to be somewhat more in possession of his senses than the others , and i endeavoured , by every means in my power , to rouse him .
thinking that a plunge in the sea-water might have a beneficial effect , i contrived to fasten the end of a rope around his body , and then , leading him to the <unk> ( he remaining quite passive all the while ) , pushed him in , and immediately <name> him out .
i had good reason to congratulate myself upon having made this experiment ; for he appeared much revived and <unk> , and , upon getting out , asked me , in a rational manner , why i had so served him .
having explained my object , he expressed himself indebted to me , and said that he felt greatly better from the immersion , afterward conversing sensibly upon our situation .
we then resolved to treat <name> and peters in the same way , which we immediately did , when they both experienced much benefit from the shock .
this idea of sudden immersion had been suggested to me by reading in some medical work the good effect of the <unk> in a case where the patient was suffering from mania a <unk> .
finding that i could now trust my companions to hold the end of the rope , i again made three or four plunges into the cabin , although it was now quite dark , and a gentle but long swell from the northward rendered the hulk somewhat unsteady .
in the course of these attempts i succeeded in bringing up two <unk> , a <unk> jug , empty , and a blanket , but nothing which could serve us for food .
i continued my efforts , after getting these articles , until i was completely exhausted , but brought up nothing else .
during the night <name> and peters occupied themselves by turns in the same manner ; but nothing coming to hand , we now gave up this attempt in despair , concluding that we were exhausting ourselves in vain .
we passed the remainder of this night in a state of the most intense mental and bodily anguish that can possibly be imagined .
the morning of the sixteenth at length dawned , and we looked eagerly around the horizon for relief , but to no purpose .
the sea was still smooth , with only a long swell from the northward , as on yesterday .
this was the sixth day since we had tasted either food or drink , with the exception of the bottle of port wine , and it was clear that we could hold out but a very little while longer unless something could be obtained .
i never saw before , nor wish to see again , human beings so utterly emaciated as peters and <name> .
had i met them on shore in their present condition i should not have had the slightest suspicion that i had ever beheld them .
their countenances were totally changed in character , so that i could not bring myself to believe them really the same individuals with whom i had been in company but a few days before .
<name> , although sadly reduced , and so feeble that he could not raise his head from his bosom , was not so far gone as the other two .
he suffered with great <name> , making no complaint , and endeavouring to inspire us with <name> in every manner he could devise .
for myself , although at the commencement of the voyage i had been in bad health , and was at all times of a delicate constitution , i suffered less than any of us , being much less reduced in frame , and retaining my powers of mind in a surprising degree , while the rest were completely prostrated in intellect , and seemed to be brought to a species of second childhood , generally <unk> in their expressions , with idiotic smiles , and uttering the most absurd <unk> .
at intervals , however , they would appear to revive suddenly , as if inspired all at once with a consciousness of their condition , when they would spring upon their feet in a momentary flash of vigour , and speak , for a short period , of their prospects , in a manner altogether rational , although full of the most intense despair .
it is possible , however , that my companions may have entertained the same opinion of their own condition as i did of mine , and that i may have unwittingly been guilty of the same <unk> and <unk> as themselves  this is a matter which can not be determined .
about noon <name> declared that he saw land off the larboard quarter , and it was with the utmost difficulty i could restrain him from plunging into the sea with the view of swimming toward it .
peters and <name> took little notice of what he said , being apparently wrapped up in moody contemplation .
upon looking in the direction pointed out , i could not perceive the faintest appearance of the shore  indeed , i was too well aware that we were far from any land to indulge in a <name> of that nature .
it was a long time , nevertheless , before i could convince <name> of his mistake .
he then burst into a flood of tears , weeping like a child , with loud cries and sobs , for two or three hours , when becoming exhausted , he fell asleep .
peters and <name> now made several ineffectual efforts to swallow portions of the leather .
i advised them to chew it and spit it out ; but they were too excessively <unk> to be able to follow my advice .
i continued to chew pieces of it at intervals , and found some relief from so doing ; my chief distress was for water , and i was only prevented from taking a draught from the sea by remembering the horrible consequences which thus have resulted to others who were similarly situated with ourselves .
the day wore on in this manner , when i suddenly discovered a sail to the eastward , and on our larboard bow .
she appeared to be a large ship , and was coming nearly athwart us , being probably twelve or fifteen miles distant .
none of my companions had as yet discovered her , and i forbore to tell them of her for the present , lest we might again be disappointed of relief .
at length upon her getting nearer , i saw distinctly that she was heading immediately for us , with her light sails filled .
i could now contain myself no longer , and pointed her out to my <unk> .
they immediately sprang to their feet , again indulging in the most extravagant demonstrations of <name> , weeping , laughing in an idiotic manner , jumping , stamping upon the deck , tearing their hair , and praying and cursing by turns .
i was so affected by their conduct , as well as by what i considered a sure prospect of deliverance , that i could not refrain from joining in with their madness , and gave way to the impulses of my gratitude and ecstasy by lying and rolling on the deck , clapping my hands , shouting , and other similar acts , until i was suddenly called to my recollection , and once more to the extreme human misery and despair , by perceiving the ship all at once with her stern fully presented toward us , and steering in a direction nearly opposite to that in which i had at first perceived her .
it was some time before i could induce my poor companions to believe that this sad reverse in our prospects had actually taken place .
they replied to all my assertions with a stare and a gesture implying that they were not to be deceived by such <unk> .
the conduct of <name> most sensibly affected me .
in spite of all i could say or do to the contrary , he persisted in saying that the ship was rapidly nearing us , and in making preparations to go on board of her .
some seaweed floating by the brig , he maintained that it was the ship 's boat , and endeavoured to throw himself upon it , howling and shrieking in the most <unk> manner , when i forcibly restrained him from thus casting himself into the sea .
having become in some degree pacified , we continued to watch the ship until we finally lost sight of her , the weather becoming hazy , with a light breeze springing up .
as soon as she was entirely gone , <name> turned suddenly toward me with an expression of countenance which made me shudder .
there was about him an air of self-possession which i had not noticed in him until now , and before he opened his lips my heart told me what he would say .
he proposed , in a few words , that one of us should die to preserve the existence of the others .
chapter 12 i had for some time past , dwelt upon the prospect of our being reduced to this last horrible extremity , and had secretly made up my mind to suffer death in any shape or under any circumstances rather than resort to such a course .
nor was this resolution in any degree weakened by the present intensity of hunger under which i laboured .
the proposition had not been heard by either peters or <name> .
i therefore took <name> aside ; and mentally praying to god for power to dissuade him from the horrible purpose he entertained , i expostulated with him for a long time , and in the most supplicating manner , begging him in the name of every thing which he held sacred , and urging him by every species of argument which the extremity of the case suggested , to abandon the idea , and not to mention it to either of the other two .
he heard all i said without attempting to <unk> any of my arguments , and i had begun to <name> that he would be prevailed upon to do as i desired .
but when i had ceased speaking , he said that he knew very well all i had said was true , and that to resort to such a course was the most horrible alternative which could enter into the mind of man ; but that he had now held out as long as human nature could be sustained ; that it was unnecessary for all to perish , when , by the death of one , it was possible , and even probable , that the rest might be finally preserved ; adding that i might save myself the trouble of trying to turn him from his purpose , his mind having been thoroughly made up on the subject even before the appearance of the ship , and that only her heaving in sight had prevented him from mentioning his intention at an earlier period .
i now begged him , if he would not be prevailed upon to abandon his design , at least to defer it for another day , when some vessel might come to our relief ; again <unk> every argument i could devise , and which i thought likely to have influence with one of his rough nature .
he said , in reply , that he had not spoken until the very last possible moment , that he could exist no longer without sustenance of some kind , and that therefore in another day his suggestion would be too late , as regarded himself at least .
finding that he was not to be moved by anything i could say in a mild tone , i now assumed a different demeanor , and told him that he must be aware i had suffered less than any of us from our calamities ; that my health and strength , consequently , were at that moment far better than his own , or than that either of peters or <name> ; in short , that i was in a condition to have my own way by force if i found it necessary ; and that if he attempted in any manner to acquaint the others with his bloody and <unk> designs , i would not hesitate to throw him into the sea .
upon this he immediately seized me by the throat , and drawing a knife , made several ineffectual efforts to stab me in the stomach ; an atrocity which his excessive <unk> alone prevented him from accomplishing .
in the meantime , being roused to a high pitch of anger , i forced him to the vessel 's side , with the full intention of throwing him overboard .
he was saved from his fate , however , by the interference of peters , who now approached and separated us , asking the cause of the disturbance .
this <name> told before i could find means in any manner to prevent him .
the effect of his words was even more terrible than what i had anticipated .
both <name> and peters , who , it seems , had long secretly entertained the same fearful idea which <name> had been merely the first to <unk> , joined with him in his design and insisted upon its immediately being carried into effect .
i had calculated that one at least of the two former would be found still possessed of sufficient strength of mind to side with myself in resisting any attempt to execute so dreadful a purpose , and , with the aid of either one of them , i had no fear of being able to prevent its accomplishment .
being disappointed in this expectation , it became absolutely necessary that i should attend to my own safety , as a further resistance on my part might possibly be considered by men in their frightful condition a sufficient excuse for refusing me fair play in the tragedy that i knew would speedily be enacted .
i now told them i was willing to submit to the proposal , merely requesting a delay of about one hour , in order that the fog which had gathered around us might have an opportunity of lifting , when it was possible that the ship we had seen might be again in sight .
after great difficulty i obtained from them a promise to wait thus long ; and , as i had anticipated ( a breeze rapidly coming in ) , the fog lifted before the hour had expired , when , no vessel appearing in sight , we prepared to draw lots .
it is with extreme reluctance that i dwell upon the appalling scene which ensued ; a scene which , with its minutest details , no after events have been able to efface in the slightest degree from my memory , and whose stern recollection <name> <unk> every future moment of my existence .
let me run over this portion of my narrative with as much haste as the nature of the events to be spoken of <name> permit .
the only method we could devise for the terrific lottery , in which we were to take each a chance , was that of drawing straws .
small splinters of wood were made to answer our purpose , and it was agreed that i should be the holder .
i retired to one end of the hulk , while my poor companions silently took up their station in the other with their backs turned toward me .
the bitterest anxiety which i endured at any period of this fearful drama was while i occupied myself in the arrangement of the lots .
there are few conditions into which man can possibly fall where he <name> not feel a deep interest in the preservation of his existence ; an interest momentarily increasing with the <unk> of the tenure by which that existence may be held .
but now that the silent , definite , and stern nature of the business in which i was engaged ( so different from the tumultuous dangers of the storm or the gradually approaching horrors of famine ) allowed me to reflect on the few chances i had of escaping the most appalling of deaths  a death for the most appalling of purposes  every particle of that energy which had so long buoyed me up departed like feathers before the wind , leaving me a helpless prey to the most abject and pitiable terror .
i could not , at first , even summon up sufficient strength to tear and fit together the small splinters of wood , my fingers absolutely refusing their office , and my knees knocking violently against each other .
my mind ran over rapidly a thousand absurd projects by which to avoid becoming a partner in the awful speculation .
i thought of falling on my knees to my companions , and entreating them to let me escape this necessity ; of suddenly rushing upon them , and , by putting one of them to death , of rendering the decision by lot useless  in short , of every thing but of going through with the matter i had in hand .
at last , after wasting a long time in this imbecile conduct , i was recalled to my senses by the voice of <name> , who urged me to relieve them at once from the terrible anxiety they were enduring .
even then i could not bring myself to arrange the splinters upon the spot , but thought over every species of <unk> by which i could trick some one of my <unk> to draw the short straw , as it had been agreed that whoever <name> the shortest of four splinters from my hand was to die for the preservation of the rest .
before any one condemn me for this apparent <unk> , let him be placed in a situation precisely similar to my own .
at length delay was no longer possible , and , with a heart almost bursting from my bosom , i advanced to the region of the forecastle , where my companions were awaiting me .
i held out my hand with the splinters , and peters immediately <name> .
he was free  his , at least , was not the shortest ; and there was now another chance against my escape .
i summoned up all my strength , and passed the lots to <name> .
he also <name> immediately , and he also was free ; and now , whether i should live or die , the chances were no more than precisely even .
at this moment all the fierceness of the tiger possessed my bosom , and i felt toward my poor fellow-creature , <name> , the most intense , the most diabolical hatred .
but the feeling did not last ; and , at length , with a convulsive shudder and closed eyes , i held out the two remaining splinters toward him .
it was fully five minutes before he could summon resolution to draw , during which period of <unk> suspense i never once opened my eyes .
presently one of the two lots was quickly drawn from my hand .
the decision was then over , yet i knew not whether it was for me or against me .
no one spoke , and still i dared not satisfy myself by looking at the splinter i held .
peters at length took me by the hand , and i forced myself to look up , when i immediately saw by the countenance of <name> that i was safe , and that he it was who had been doomed to suffer .
gasping for breath , i fell senseless to the deck .
i recovered from my swoon in time to behold the consummation of the tragedy in the death of him who had been chiefly instrumental in bringing it about .
he made no resistance whatever , and was stabbed in the back by peters , when he fell instantly dead .
i must not dwell upon the fearful repast which immediately ensued .
such things may be imagined , but words have no power to impress the mind with the exquisite horror of their reality .
let it suffice to say that , having in some measure appeased the raging thirst which consumed us by the blood of the victim , and having by common consent taken off the hands , feet , and head , throwing them together with the entrails , into the sea , we devoured the rest of the body , <unk> , during the four ever memorable days of the seventeenth , eighteenth , nineteenth , and twentieth of the month .
on the nineteenth , there coming on a smart shower which lasted fifteen or twenty minutes , we contrived to catch some water by means of a sheet which had been fished up from the cabin by our drag just after the <name> .
the quantity we took in all did not amount to more than half a gallon ; but even this scanty allowance supplied us with comparative strength and <name> .
on the <unk> we were again reduced to the last necessity .
the weather still remained warm and pleasant , with occasional fogs and light breezes , most usually from n. to w. on the twenty-second , as we were sitting close huddled together , gloomily revolving over our lamentable condition , there flashed through my mind all at once an idea which inspired me with a bright gleam of <name> .
i remembered that , when the foremast had been cut away , peters , being in the windward chains , passed one of the axes into my hand , requesting me to put it , if possible , in a place of security , and that a few minutes before the last heavy sea struck the brig and filled her i had taken this axe into the forecastle and laid it in one of the larboard berths .
i now thought it possible that , by getting at this axe , we might cut through the deck over the storeroom , and thus readily supply ourselves with provisions .
when i communicated this object to my companions , they uttered a feeble shout of <name> , and we all proceeded forthwith to the forecastle .
the difficulty of descending here was greater than that of going down in the cabin , the opening being much smaller , for it <name> be remembered that the whole framework about the cabin <unk> had been carried away , whereas the <unk> , being a simple hatch of only about three feet square , had remained uninjured .
i did not hesitate , however , to attempt the descent ; and a rope being fastened round my body as before , i plunged boldly in , feet foremost , made my way quickly to the berth , and at the first attempt brought up the axe .
it was hailed with the most ecstatic <name> and triumph , and the ease with which it had been obtained was regarded as an omen of our ultimate preservation .
we now commenced cutting at the deck with all the energy of <unk> <name> , peters and myself taking the axe by turns , <name> 's wounded arm not permitting him to aid us in any degree .
as we were still so feeble as to be scarcely able to stand unsupported , and could consequently work but a minute or two without resting , it soon became evident that many long hours would be necessary to accomplish our task  that is , to cut an opening sufficiently large to admit of a free access to the storeroom .
this consideration , however , did not discourage us ; and , working all night by the light of the moon , we succeeded in effecting our purpose by daybreak on the morning of the twenty-third .
peters now volunteered to go down ; and , having made all arrangements as before , he descended , and soon returned bringing up with him a small jar , which , to our great <name> , proved to be full of olives .
having shared these among us , and devoured them with the greatest avidity , we proceeded to let him down again .
this time he succeeded beyond our utmost expectations , returning instantly with a large ham and a bottle of madeira wine .
of the latter we each took a moderate sup , having learned by experience the pernicious consequences of indulging too freely .
the ham , except about two pounds near the bone , was not in a condition to be eaten , having been entirely spoiled by the salt water .
the sound part was divided among us .
peters and <name> , not being able to restrain their appetite , swallowed theirs upon the instant ; but i was more cautious , and ate but a small portion of mine , dreading the thirst which i knew would ensue .
we now rested a while from our labors , which had been intolerably severe .
by noon , feeling somewhat strengthened and refreshed , we again renewed our attempt at getting up provisions , peters and myself going down alternately , and always with more or less success , until sundown .
during this interval we had the good fortune to bring up , altogether , four more small jars of olives , another ham , a <unk> containing nearly three gallons of excellent cape madeira wine , and , what gave us still more delight , a small tortoise of the <unk> breed , several of which had been taken on board by captain barnard , as the grampus was leaving port , from the schooner <name> <unk> , just returned from a <unk> voyage in the pacific .
in a subsequent portion of this narrative i shall have frequent occasion to mention this species of tortoise .
it is found principally , as most of my readers may know , in the group of islands called the <unk> , which , indeed , derive their name from the animal  the spanish word <unk> meaning a fresh-water <unk> .
from the peculiarity of their shape and action they have been sometimes called the elephant tortoise .
they are frequently found of an enormous size .
i have myself seen several which would weigh from twelve to fifteen hundred pounds , although i do not remember that any navigator speaks of having seen them weighing more than eight hundred .
their appearance is singular , and even disgusting .
their steps are very slow , measured , and heavy , their bodies being carried about a foot from the ground .
their neck is long , and exceedingly slender , from eighteen inches to two feet is a very common length , and i killed one , where the distance from the shoulder to the extremity of the head was no less than three feet ten inches .
the head has a striking resemblance to that of a serpent .
they can exist without food for an almost incredible length of time , instances having been known where they have been thrown into the hold of a vessel and lain two years without nourishment of any kind  being as fat , and , in every respect , in as good order at the expiration of the time as when they were first put in .
in one particular these extraordinary animals bear a resemblance to the dromedary , or camel of the desert .
in a bag at the root of the neck they <name> with them a constant supply of water .
in some instances , upon killing them after a full year 's deprivation of all nourishment , as much as three gallons of perfectly sweet and fresh water have been found in their bags .
their food is chiefly wild <unk> and celery , with <unk> , <unk> , and prickly pears , upon which latter vegetable they thrive wonderfully , a great quantity of it being usually found on the hillsides near the shore wherever the animal itself is discovered .
they are excellent and highly nutritious food , and have , no doubt , been the means of preserving the lives of thousands of seamen employed in the <unk> and other pursuits in the pacific .
the one which we had the good fortune to bring up from the storeroom was not of a large size , weighing probably sixty-five or seventy pounds .
it was a female , and in excellent condition , being exceedingly fat , and having more than a quart of limpid and sweet water in its bag .
this was indeed a treasure ; and , falling on our knees with one accord , we returned fervent thanks to god for so <unk> a relief .
we had great difficulty in getting the animal up through the opening , as its struggles were fierce and its strength prodigious .
it was upon the point of making its escape from <name> 's grasp , and slipping back into the water , when <name> , throwing a rope with a <unk> around its throat , held it up in this manner until i jumped into the hole by the side of peters , and assisted him in lifting it out .
the water we <name> carefully from the bag into the jug ; which , it <name> be remembered , had been brought up before from the cabin .
having done this , we broke off the neck of a bottle so as to form , with the cork , a kind of glass , holding not quite half a gill .
we then each drank one of these measures full , and resolved to limit ourselves to this quantity per day as long as it should hold out .
during the last two or three days , the weather having been dry and pleasant , the bedding we had obtained from the cabin , as well as our clothing , had become thoroughly dry , so that we passed this night ( that of the twenty-third ) in comparative comfort , enjoying a tranquil repose , after having <unk> <unk> on olives and ham , with a small allowance of the wine .
being afraid of losing some of our stores overboard during the night , in the event of a breeze springing up , we secured them as well as possible with cordage to the fragments of the windlass .
our tortoise , which we were anxious to preserve alive as long as we could , we threw on its back , and otherwise carefully fastened .
chapter 13 july 24 .
this morning saw us wonderfully recruited in spirits and strength .
notwithstanding the perilous situation in which we were still placed , ignorant of our position , although certainly at a great distance from land , without more food than would last us for a fortnight even with great care , almost entirely without water , and floating about at the <name> of every wind and wave on the merest wreck in the world , still the infinitely more terrible distresses and dangers from which we had so lately and so <unk> been delivered caused us to regard what we now endured as but little more than an ordinary evil  so strictly comparative is either good or ill. at sunrise we were preparing to renew our attempts at getting up something from the storeroom , when , a smart shower coming on , with some lightning , we turn our attention to the catching of water by means of the sheet we had used before for this purpose .
we had no other means of collecting the rain than by holding the sheet spread out with one of the <unk> in the middle of it .
the water , thus conducted to the centre , was drained through into our jug .
we had nearly filled it in this manner , when , a heavy squall coming on from the northward , obliged us to desist , as the hulk began once more to roll so violently that we could no longer keep our feet .
we now went forward , and , lashing ourselves securely to the remnant of the windlass as before , awaited the event with far more calmness than could have been anticipated or would have been imagined possible under the circumstances .
at noon the wind had freshened into a <unk> breeze , and by night into a stiff <name> , accompanied with a tremendously heavy swell .
experience having taught us , however , the best method of arranging our lashings , we weathered this dreary night in tolerable security , although thoroughly drenched at almost every instant by the sea , and in momentary dread of being washed off .
fortunately , the weather was so warm as to render the water rather grateful than otherwise .
july 25 .
this morning the <name> had diminished to a mere <unk> breeze , and the sea had gone down with it so considerably that we were able to keep ourselves dry upon the deck .
to our great grief , however , we found that two jars of our olives , as well as the whole of our ham , had been washed overboard , in spite of the careful manner in which they had been fastened .
we determined not to kill the tortoise as yet , and contented ourselves for the present with a breakfast on a few of the olives , and a measure of water each , which latter we mixed half and half , with wine , finding great relief and strength from the mixture , without the distressing intoxication which had ensued upon drinking the port .
the sea was still far too rough for the renewal of our efforts at getting up provision from the storeroom .
several articles , of no importance to us in our present situation , floated up through the opening during the day , and were immediately washed overboard .
we also now observed that the hulk lay more along than ever , so that we could not stand an instant without lashing ourselves .
on this account we passed a gloomy and uncomfortable day .
at noon the sun appeared to be nearly vertical , and we had no doubt that we had been driven down by the long succession of northward and <unk> winds into the near vicinity of the equator .
toward evening we saw several sharks , and were somewhat alarmed by the audacious manner in which an enormously large one approached us .
at one time , a lurch throwing the deck very far beneath the water , the monster actually swam in upon us , floundering for some moments just over the <unk> , and striking peters violently with his tail .
a heavy sea at length hurled him overboard , much to our relief .
in moderate weather we might have easily captured him .
july 26 .
this morning , the wind having greatly abated , and the sea not being very rough , we determined to renew our exertions in the storeroom .
after a great deal of hard labor during the whole day , we found that nothing further was to be expected from this quarter , the partitions of the room having been stove during the night , and its contents swept into the hold .
this discovery , as may be supposed , filled us with despair .
july 27 .
the sea nearly smooth , with a light wind , and still from the northward and westward .
the sun coming out hotly in the afternoon , we occupied ourselves in drying our clothes .
found great relief from thirst , and much comfort otherwise , by bathing in the sea ; in this , however , we were forced to use great caution , being afraid of sharks , several of which were seen swimming around the brig during the day .
july 28 .
good weather still .
the brig now began to lie along so <unk> that we feared she would eventually roll bottom up .
prepared ourselves as well as we could for this emergency , lashing our tortoise , <unk> , and two remaining jars of olives as far as possible over to the windward , placing them outside the hull below the <unk> .
the sea very smooth all day , with little or no wind .
july 29 .
a continuance of the same weather .
<name> 's wounded arm began to evince symptoms of mortification .
he complained of drowsiness and excessive thirst , but no acute pain .
nothing could be done for his relief beyond rubbing his wounds with a little of the vinegar from the olives , and from this no benefit seemed to be experienced .
we did every thing in our power for his comfort , and <unk> his allowance of water .
july 30 .
an excessively hot day , with no wind .
an enormous shark kept close by the hulk during the whole of the forenoon .
we made several unsuccessful attempts to capture him by means of a noose .
<name> much worse , and evidently sinking as much from want of proper nourishment as from the effect of his wounds .
he constantly prayed to be relieved from his sufferings , wishing for nothing but death .
this evening we ate the last of our olives , and found the water in our jug so putrid that we could not swallow it at all without the addition of wine .
determined to kill our tortoise in the morning .
july 31 .
after a night of excessive anxiety and fatigue , owing to the position of the hulk , we set about killing and cutting up our tortoise .
he proved to be much smaller than we had supposed , although in good condition ,  the whole meat about him not amounting to more than ten pounds .
with a view of preserving a portion of this as long as possible , we cut it into fine pieces , and filled with them our three remaining <name> jars and the <unk> ( all of which had been kept ) , pouring in afterward the vinegar from the olives .
in this manner we put away about three pounds of the tortoise , intending not to touch it until we had consumed the rest .
we concluded to restrict ourselves to about four ounces of the meat per day ; the whole would thus last us thirteen days .
a brisk shower , with severe thunder and lightning , came on about dusk , but lasted so short a time that we only succeeded in catching about half a pint of water .
the whole of this , by common consent , was given to <name> , who now appeared to be in the last extremity .
he drank the water from the sheet as we caught it ( we holding it above him as he lay so as to let it run into his mouth ) , for we had now nothing left capable of holding water , unless we had chosen to empty out our wine from the <unk> , or the stale water from the jug .
either of these <unk> would have been resorted to had the shower lasted .
the sufferer seemed to derive but little benefit from the draught .
his arm was completely black from the wrist to the shoulder , and his feet were like ice .
we expected every moment to see him breathe his last .
he was frightfully emaciated ; so much so that , although he weighed a hundred and twenty-seven pounds upon his leaving nantucket , he now did not weigh more than forty or fifty at the farthest .
his eyes were sunk far in his head , being scarcely perceptible , and the skin of his cheeks <name> so loosely as to prevent his <unk> any food , or even swallowing any liquid , without great difficulty .
<name> 1 .
a continuance of the same calm weather , with an <unk> hot sun .
suffered exceedingly from thirst , the water in the jug being absolutely putrid and swarming with vermin .
we contrived , nevertheless , to swallow a portion of it by mixing it with wine ; our thirst , however , was but little abated .
we found more relief by bathing in the sea , but could not avail ourselves of this expedient except at long intervals , on account of the continual presence of sharks .
we now saw clearly that <name> could not be saved ; that he was evidently dying .
we could do nothing to relieve his sufferings , which appeared to be great .
about twelve o'clock he expired in strong convulsions , and without having spoken for several hours .
his death filled us with the most gloomy forebodings , and had so great an effect upon our spirits that we sat motionless by the corpse during the whole day , and never addressed each other except in a whisper .
it was not until some time after dark that we took courage to get up and throw the body overboard .
it was then loathsome beyond expression , and so far decayed that , as peters attempted to lift it , an entire leg came off in his grasp .
as the mass of <unk> slipped over the vessel 's side into the water , the glare of phosphoric light with which it was surrounded plainly discovered to us seven or eight large sharks , the <unk> of whose horrible teeth , as their prey was torn to pieces among them , might have been heard at the distance of a mile .
we shrunk within ourselves in the extremity of horror at the sound .
<name> 2 .
the same fearfully calm and hot weather .
the <name> found us in a state of pitiable dejection as well as bodily exhaustion .
the water in the jug was now absolutely useless , being a thick gelatinous mass ; nothing but <unk> worms mingled with slime .
we threw it out , and washed the jug well in the sea , afterward pouring a little vinegar in it from our bottles of pickled tortoise .
our thirst could now scarcely be endured , and we tried in vain to relieve it by wine , which seemed only to add fuel to the flame , and excited us to a high degree of intoxication .
we afterward endeavoured to relieve our sufferings by mixing the wine with <unk> ; but this instantly brought about the most violent <unk> , so that we never again attempted it .
during the whole day we anxiously sought an opportunity of bathing , but to no purpose ; for the hulk was now entirely besieged on all sides with sharks  no doubt the identical monsters who had devoured our poor companion on the evening before , and who were in momentary expectation of another similar feast .
this circumstance occasioned us the most bitter regret and filled us with the most depressing and melancholy forebodings .
we had experienced indescribable relief in bathing , and to have this resource cut off in so frightful a manner was more than we could bear .
nor , indeed , were we altogether free from the apprehension of immediate danger , for the least slip or false movement would have thrown us at once within reach of those <unk> fish , who frequently thrust themselves directly upon us , swimming up to leeward .
no shouts or exertions on our part seemed to alarm them .
even when one of the largest was struck with an axe by peters and much wounded , he persisted in his attempts to push in where we were .
a cloud came up at dusk , but , to our extreme anguish , passed over without discharging itself .
it is quite impossible to conceive our sufferings from thirst at this period .
we passed a sleepless night , both on this account and through dread of the sharks .
<name> 3 .
no prospect of relief , and the brig lying still more and more along , so that now we could not maintain a footing upon deck at all .
busied ourselves in securing our wine and <unk> , so that we might not lose them in the event of our rolling over .
got out two stout spikes from the <unk> , and , by means of the axe , drove them into the hull to windward within a couple of feet of the water , this not being very far from the keel , as we were nearly upon our <unk> .
to these spikes we now lashed our provisions , as being more secure than their former position beneath the chains .
suffered great agony from thirst during the whole day  no chance of bathing on account of the sharks , which never left us for a moment .
found it impossible to sleep .
<name> 4 .
a little before daybreak we perceived that the hulk was <unk> over , and aroused ourselves to prevent being thrown off by the movement .
at first the roll was slow and gradual , and we contrived to clamber over to windward very well , having taken the precaution to leave ropes hanging from the spikes we had driven in for the provision .
but we had not calculated sufficiently upon the <unk> of the impetus ; for , presently the heel became too violent to allow of our keeping pace with it ; and , before either of us knew what was to happen , we found ourselves hurled furiously into the sea , and struggling several fathoms beneath the surface , with the huge hull immediately above us .
in going under the water i had been obliged to let go my hold upon the rope ; and finding that i was completely beneath the vessel , and my strength nearly exhausted , i scarcely made a struggle for life , and resigned myself , in a few seconds , to die .
but here again i was deceived , not having taken into consideration the natural <unk> of the hull to windward .
the whirl of the water upward , which the vessel occasioned in rolling partially back , brought me to the surface still more violently than i had been plunged beneath .
upon coming up i found myself about twenty yards from the hulk , as near as i could judge .
she was lying keel up , rocking furiously from side to side , and the sea in all directions around was much agitated , and full of strong <unk> .
i could see nothing of peters .
an <unk> was floating within a few feet of me , and various other articles from the brig were scattered about .
my principal terror was now on account of the sharks , which i knew to be in my vicinity .
in order to <unk> these , if possible , from approaching me , i splashed the water vigorously with both hands and feet as i swam towards the hulk , creating a body of foam .
i have no doubt that to this expedient , simple as it was , i was indebted for my preservation ; for the sea all round the brig , just before her rolling over , was so crowded with these monsters , that i must have been , and really was , in actual contact with some of them during my progress .
by great good fortune , however , i reached the side of the vessel in safety , although so utterly weakened by the violent exertion i had used that i should never have been able to get upon it but for the timely assistance of peters , who , now , to my great <name> , made his appearance ( having scrambled up to the keel from the opposite side of the hull ) , and threw me the end of a rope  one of those which had been attached to the spikes .
having barely escaped this danger , our attention was now directed to the dreadful <unk> of another  that of absolute starvation .
our whole stock of provision had been swept overboard in spite of all our care in securing it ; and seeing no longer the remotest possibility of obtaining more , we gave way both of us to despair , weeping aloud like children , and neither of us attempting to offer consolation to the other .
such weakness can scarcely be conceived , and to those who have never been similarly situated <name> , no doubt , appear unnatural ; but it must be remembered that our intellects were so entirely disordered by the long course of privation and terror to which we had been subjected , that we could not justly be considered , at that period , in the light of rational beings .
in subsequent perils , nearly as great , if not greater , i bore up with fortitude against all the evils of my situation , and peters , it <name> be seen , evinced a <unk> philosophy nearly as incredible as his present childlike <unk> and imbecility  the mental condition made the difference .
the overturning of the brig , even with the consequent loss of the wine and turtle , would not , in fact , have rendered our situation more deplorable than before , except for the disappearance of the <unk> by which we had been hitherto enabled to catch <unk> , and of the jug in which we had kept it when caught ; for we found the whole bottom , from within two or three feet of the bends as far as the keel , together with the keel itself , thickly covered with large barnacles , which proved to be excellent and highly nutritious food .
thus , in two important respects , the accident we had so greatly dreaded proved to be a benefit rather than an injury ; it had opened to us a supply of provisions which we could not have exhausted , using it moderately , in a month ; and it had greatly contributed to our comfort as regards position , we being much more at ease , and in infinitely less danger , than before .
the difficulty , however , of now obtaining water blinded us to all the benefits of the change in our condition .
that we might be ready to avail ourselves , as far as possible , of any shower which might fall we took off our shirts , to make use of them as we had of the sheets  not hoping , of course , to get more in this way , even under the most favorable circumstances , than half a gill at a time .
no signs of a cloud appeared during the day , and the agonies of our thirst were nearly intolerable .
at night , peters obtained about an hour 's disturbed sleep , but my intense sufferings would not permit me to close my eyes for a single moment .
<name> 5 .
to-day , a gentle breeze springing up carried us through a vast quantity of seaweed , among which we were so fortunate as to find eleven small crabs , which afforded us several delicious meals .
their shells being quite soft , we ate them entire , and found that they irritated our thirst far less than the barnacles .
seeing no trace of sharks among the seaweed , we also ventured to bathe , and remained in the water for four or five hours , during which we experienced a very sensible diminution of our thirst .
were greatly refreshed , and spent the night somewhat more comfortably than before , both of us snatching a little sleep .
<name> 6 .
this day we were blessed by a brisk and continual rain , lasting from about noon until after dark .
bitterly did we now regret the loss of our jug and <unk> ; for , in spite of the little means we had of catching the water , we might have filled one , if not both of them .
as it was , we contrived to satisfy the cravings of thirst by suffering the shirts to become saturated , and then wringing them so as to let the grateful fluid trickle into our mouths .
in this occupation we passed the entire day .
<name> 7 .
just at daybreak we both at the same instant descried a sail to the eastward , and evidently coming towards us !  we hailed the glorious sight with a long , although feeble shout of rapture ; and began instantly to make every signal in our power , by flaring the shirts in the air , leaping as high as our weak condition would permit , and even by <unk> with all the strength of our lungs , although the vessel could not have been less than fifteen miles distant .
however , she still continued to near our hulk , and we felt that , if she but held her present course , she must eventually come so close as to perceive us .
in about an hour after we first discovered her , we could clearly see the people on her decks .
she was a long , low , and <unk> <unk> schooner , with a black ball in her <unk> , and had , apparently , a full crew .
we now became alarmed , for we could hardly imagine it possible that she did not observe us , and were apprehensive that she meant to leave us to perish as we were  an act of fiendish <unk> , which , however incredible it may appear , has been repeatedly perpetuated at sea , under circumstances very nearly similar , and by beings who were regarded as belonging to the human species .
{ <unk> } in this instance , however , by the <name> of god , we were destined to be most happily deceived ; for , presently we were aware of a sudden commotion on the deck of the stranger , who immediately afterward ran up a british flag , and , hauling her wind , bore up directly upon us .
in half an hour more we found ourselves in her cabin .
she proved to be the <name> <name> , of liverpool , captain <name> , bound on a <unk> and trading voyage to the south seas and pacific .
chapter 14 the <name> <name> was a fine-looking <unk> schooner of a hundred and eighty tons burden .
she was unusually sharp in the bows , and on a wind , in moderate weather , the fastest <unk> i have ever seen .
her qualities , however , as a rough <unk> , were not so good , and her draught of water was by far too great for the trade to which she was destined .
for this peculiar service , a larger vessel , and one of a light proportionate draught , is desirable  say a vessel of from three hundred to three hundred and fifty tons .
she should be <unk> , and in other respects of a different construction from the usual south sea ships .
it is absolutely necessary that she should be well armed .
she should have , say ten or twelve <unk> <unk> , and two or three long <unk> , with brass <unk> , and <unk> <unk> for each top .
her anchors and cables should be of far greater strength than is required for any other species of trade , and , above all , her crew should be numerous and efficient  not less , for such a vessel as i have described , than fifty or sixty able-bodied men .
the <name> <name> had a crew of thirty-five , all able seamen , besides the captain and mate , but she was not altogether as well armed or otherwise equipped , as a navigator acquainted with the difficulties and dangers of the trade could have desired .
captain <name> was a gentleman of great <unk> of manner , and of considerable experience in the southern traffic , to which he had devoted a great portion of his life .
he was deficient , however , in energy , and , consequently , in that spirit of enterprise which is here so absolutely requisite .
he was part owner of the vessel in which he sailed , and was invested with <unk> powers to cruise in the south seas for any cargo which might come most readily to hand .
he had on board , as usual in such voyages , beads , <unk> , <unk> , axes , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , planes , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , files , <unk> , <unk> , hammers , nails , knives , scissors , razors , needles , thread , <unk> , calico , trinkets , and other similar articles .
the schooner sailed from liverpool on the tenth of july , crossed the tropic of cancer on the <unk> , in longitude twenty degrees west , and reached <name> , one of the cape verd islands , on the <unk> , where she took in salt and other necessaries for the voyage .
on the third of <name> , she left the cape <unk> and steered southwest , stretching over toward the coast of brazil , so as to cross the equator between the <unk> of twenty-eight and thirty degrees west longitude .
this is the course usually taken by vessels bound from europe to the cape of good <name> , or by that route to the east indies .
by proceeding thus they avoid the <unk> and strong contrary currents which continually prevail on the coast of guinea , while , in the end , it is found to be the shortest track , as westerly winds are never wanting afterward by which to reach the cape .
it was captain <name> 's intention to make his first <unk> at kerguelen 's land  i hardly know for what reason .
on the day we were picked up the schooner was off cape st. <unk> , in longitude thirty-one degrees west ; so that , when found , we had drifted probably , from north to south , not less than five-and-twenty degrees !  on board the <name> <name> we were treated with all the kindness our distressed situation demanded .
in about a fortnight , during which time we continued steering to the southeast , with gentle breezes and fine weather , both peters and myself recovered entirely from the effects of our late privation and dreadful sufferings , and we began to remember what had passed rather as a frightful dream from which we had been happily awakened , than as events which had taken place in sober and naked reality .
i have since found that this species of partial oblivion is usually brought about by sudden transition , whether from <name> to sorrow or from sorrow to <name>  the degree of forgetfulness being proportioned to the degree of difference in the exchange .
thus , in my own case , i now feel it impossible to realize the full extent of the misery which i endured during the days spent upon the hulk .
the incidents are remembered , but not the feelings which the incidents elicited at the time of their occurrence .
i only know , that when they did occur , i then thought human nature could sustain nothing more of agony .
we continued our voyage for some weeks without any incidents of greater moment than the occasional meeting with <unk> , and more frequently with the black or right whale , so called in <unk> to the spermaceti .
these , however , were chiefly found south of the <unk> parallel .
on the sixteenth of <name> , being in the vicinity of the cape of good <name> , the schooner encountered her first <name> of any violence since leaving liverpool .
in this neighborhood , but more frequently to the south and east of the promontory ( we were to the westward ) , navigators have often to contend with storms from the northward , which rage with great fury .
they always bring with them a heavy sea , and one of their most dangerous features is the instantaneous chopping round of the wind , an occurrence almost certain to take place during the greatest force of the <name> .
a perfect hurricane <name> be blowing at one moment from the northward or northeast , and in the next not a breath of wind <name> be felt in that direction , while from the southwest it <name> come out all at once with a violence almost inconceivable .
a bright spot to the southward is the sure forerunner of the change , and vessels are thus enabled to take the proper precautions .
it was about six in the morning when the blow came on with a white squall , and , as usual , from the northward .
by eight it had increased very much , and brought down upon us one of the most tremendous seas i had then ever beheld .
every thing had been made as snug as possible , but the schooner laboured excessively , and gave evidence of her bad qualities as a <unk> , pitching her forecastle under at every plunge and with the greatest difficulty struggling up from one wave before she was buried in another .
just before sunset the bright spot for which we had been on the look-out made its appearance in the southwest , and in an hour afterward we perceived the little <unk> we carried flapping listlessly against the mast .
in two minutes more , in spite of every preparation , we were hurled on our <unk> , as if by magic , and a perfect wilderness of foam made a clear breach over us as we lay .
the blow from the southwest , however , luckily proved to be nothing more than a squall , and we had the good fortune to right the vessel without the loss of a spar .
a heavy cross sea gave us great trouble for a few hours after this , but toward morning we found ourselves in nearly as good condition as before the <name> .
captain <name> considered that he had made an escape little less than miraculous .
on the thirteenth of october we came in sight of <name> <name> 's island , in latitude 46 degrees 53 ' s. , longitude 37 degrees 46 ' e. two days afterward we found ourselves near possession island , and presently passed the islands of <unk> , in latitude 42 degrees 59 ' s. , longitude 48 degrees e. on the eighteenth we made kerguelen 's or desolation island , in the southern indian ocean , and came to anchor in christmas harbour , having four fathoms of water .
this island , or rather group of islands , bears southeast from the cape of good <name> , and is distant therefrom nearly eight hundred leagues .
it was first discovered in <unk> , by the baron de <unk> , or kerguelen , a frenchman , who , thinking the land to form a portion of an extensive southern continent carried home information to that effect , which produced much excitement at the time .
the government , taking the matter up , sent the baron back in the following year for the purpose of giving his new discovery a critical examination , when the mistake was discovered .
in <unk> , captain cook fell in with the same group , and gave to the principal one the name of desolation island , a title which it certainly well deserves .
upon approaching the land , however , the navigator might be induced to suppose otherwise , as the sides of most of the hills , from <name> to march , are clothed with very brilliant verdure .
this deceitful appearance is caused by a small plant resembling <unk> , which is abundant , growing in large patches on a species of crumbling moss .
besides this plant there is scarcely a sign of vegetation on the island , if we except some coarse rank grass near the harbor , some lichen , and a shrub which bears resemblance to a cabbage shooting into seed , and which has a bitter and acrid taste .
the face of the country is hilly , although none of the hills can be called lofty .
their tops are perpetually covered with snow .
there are several harbors , of which christmas harbour is the most convenient .
it is the first to be met with on the northeast side of the island after passing cape <unk> , which forms the northern shore , and , by its peculiar shape , serves to distinguish the harbour .
its projecting point terminates in a high rock , through which is a large hole , forming a natural arch .
the entrance is in latitude 48 degrees 40 ' s. , longitude 69 degrees 6 ' e. passing in here , good anchorage may be found under the shelter of several small islands , which form a sufficient protection from all easterly winds .
proceeding on <unk> from this anchorage you come to wasp bay , at the head of the harbour .
this is a small basin , completely <unk> , into which you can go with four fathoms , and find anchorage in from ten to three , hard <name> bottom .
a ship might lie here with her best bower ahead all the year round without risk .
to the westward , at the head of wasp bay , is a small stream of excellent water , easily procured .
some seal of the fur and hair species are still to be found on kerguelen 's island , and sea elephants abound .
the feathered tribes are discovered in great <name> .
<unk> are very plenty , and of these there are four different kinds .
the <name> penguin , so called from its size and beautiful plumage , is the largest .
the upper part of the body is usually gray , sometimes of a lilac tint ; the under portion of the purest white imaginable .
the head is of a glossy and most brilliant black , the feet also .
the chief beauty of plumage , however , consists in two broad stripes of a gold color , which pass along from the head to the breast .
the <name> is long , and either pink or bright <name> .
these birds walk erect ; with a stately carriage .
they <name> their heads high with their wings drooping like two arms , and , as their tails project from their body in a line with the legs , the resemblance to a human figure is very striking , and would be apt to deceive the spectator at a casual glance or in the gloom of the evening .
the <name> <unk> which we met with on kerguelen 's land were rather larger than a goose .
the other kinds are the <unk> , the jackass , and the <unk> penguin .
these are much smaller , less beautiful in plumage , and different in other respects .
besides the penguin many other birds are here to be found , among which may be mentioned <unk> , blue <unk> , <unk> , ducks , port <unk> hens , <unk> , cape pigeons , the <name> , sea swallows , terns , sea gulls , mother <name> 's chickens , mother <name> 's geese , or the great <unk> , and , lastly , the albatross .
the great <unk> is as large as the common albatross , and is carnivorous .
it is frequently called the <unk> , or <unk> <unk> .
they are not at all shy , and , when properly cooked , are <unk> food .
in flying they sometimes sail very close to the surface of the water , with the wings expanded , without appearing to move them in the least degree , or make any exertion with them whatever .
the albatross is one of the largest and <unk> of the south sea birds .
it is of the gull species , and takes its prey on the wing , never coming on land except for the purpose of breeding .
between this bird and the penguin the most singular friendship exists .
their nests are constructed with great uniformity upon a plan concerted between the two species  that of the albatross being placed in the centre of a little square formed by the nests of four <unk> .
navigators have agreed in calling an assemblage of such encampments a <unk> .
these <unk> have been often described , but as my readers may not all have seen these descriptions , and as i shall have occasion hereafter to speak of the penguin and albatross , it <name> not be amiss to say something here of their mode of building and living .
when the season for incubation arrives , the birds assemble in vast <name> , and for some days appear to be <unk> upon the proper course to be pursued .
at length they proceed to action .
a level piece of ground is selected , of suitable extent , usually comprising three or four acres , and situated as near the sea as possible , being still beyond its reach .
the spot is chosen with reference to its <unk> of surface , and that is preferred which is the least encumbered with stones .
this matter being arranged , the birds proceed , with one accord , and actuated apparently by one mind , to trace out , with mathematical accuracy , either a square or other <unk> , as may best suit the nature of the ground , and of just sufficient size to accommodate easily all the birds assembled , and no more  in this particular seeming determined upon preventing the access of future stragglers who have not participated in the labor of the encampment .
one side of the place thus marked out runs parallel with the water 's edge , and is left open for ingress or egress .
having defined the limits of the <unk> , the colony now begin to clear it of every species of rubbish , picking up stone by stone , and carrying them outside of the lines , and close by them , so as to form a wall on the three inland sides .
just within this wall a perfectly level and smooth walk is formed , from six to eight feet wide , and extending around the encampment  thus serving the purpose of a general promenade .
the next process is to partition out the whole area into small squares exactly equal in size .
this is done by forming narrow paths , very smooth , and crossing each other at right angles throughout the entire extent of the <unk> .
at each intersection of these paths the nest of an albatross is constructed , and a penguin 's nest in the centre of each square  thus every penguin is surrounded by four <unk> , and each albatross by a like number of <unk> .
the penguin 's nest consists of a hole in the earth , very shallow , being only just of sufficient depth to keep her single egg from rolling .
the albatross is somewhat less simple in her arrangements , erecting a hillock about a foot high and two in diameter .
this is made of earth , seaweed , and shells .
on its summit she builds her nest .
the birds take especial care never to leave their nests unoccupied for an instant during the period of incubation , or , indeed , until the young progeny are sufficiently strong to take care of themselves .
while the male is absent at sea in search of food , the female remains on duty , and it is only upon the return of her partner that she ventures abroad .
the eggs are never left uncovered at all  while one bird leaves the nest the other nestling in by its side .
this precaution is rendered necessary by the <unk> propensities prevalent in the <unk> , the inhabitants making no scruple to <unk> each other 's eggs at every good opportunity .
although there are some <unk> in which the penguin and albatross are the sole population , yet in most of them a variety of oceanic birds are to be met with , enjoying all the privileges of citizenship , and scattering their nests here and there , wherever they can find room , never interfering , however , with the stations of the larger species .
the appearance of such encampments , when seen from a distance , is exceedingly singular .
the whole atmosphere just above the settlement is darkened with the immense number of the albatross ( mingled with the smaller tribes ) which are continually hovering over it , either going to the ocean or returning home .
at the same time a crowd of <unk> are to be observed , some passing to and fro in the narrow alleys , and some marching with the military strut so peculiar to them , around the general promenade ground which <unk> the <unk> .
in short , survey it as we <name> , nothing can be more astonishing than the spirit of reflection evinced by these feathered beings , and nothing surely can be better calculated to <unk> reflection in every <unk> human intellect .
on the morning after our arrival in christmas harbour the chief mate , mr. patterson , took the boats , and ( although it was somewhat early in the season ) went in search of seal , leaving the captain and a young relation of his on a point of barren land to the westward , they having some business , whose nature i could not ascertain , to transact in the interior of the island .
captain <name> took with him a bottle , in which was a sealed letter , and made his way from the point on which he was set on shore toward one of the highest peaks in the place .
it is probable that his design was to leave the letter on that height for some vessel which he expected to come after him .
as soon as we lost sight of him we proceeded ( peters and myself being in the mate 's boat ) on our cruise around the coast , looking for seal .
in this business we were occupied about three weeks , examining with great care every nook and corner , not only of kerguelen 's land , but of the several small islands in the vicinity .
our labours , however , were not crowned with any important success .
we saw a great many fur seal , but they were exceedingly shy , and with the greatest exertions , we could only procure three hundred and fifty skins in all .
sea elephants were abundant , especially on the western coast of the mainland , but of these we killed only twenty , and this with great difficulty .
on the smaller islands we discovered a good many of the hair seal , but did not molest them .
we returned to the schooner : on the eleventh , where we found captain <name> and his nephew , who gave a very bad account of the interior , representing it as one of the most dreary and utterly barren countries in the world .
they had remained two nights on the island , owing to some misunderstanding , on the part of the second mate , in regard to the sending a <unk> from the schooner to take them off .
chapter 15 on the twelfth we made sail from christmas harbour <unk> our way to the westward , and leaving <name> 's island , one of <unk> 's group , on the larboard .
we afterward passed <name> <name> 's island , leaving it also on our left , then , steering more to the northward , made , in fifteen days , the islands of <name> <unk> , in latitude 37 degrees 8 ' s , longitude 12 degrees 8 ' w. this group , now so well known , and which consists of three circular islands , was first discovered by the portuguese , and was visited afterward by the dutch in <unk> , and by the french in <unk> .
the three islands together form a triangle , and are distant from each other about ten miles , there being fine open passages between .
the land in all of them is very high , especially in <name> <unk> , properly so called .
this is the largest of the group , being fifteen miles in circumference , and so elevated that it can be seen in clear weather at the distance of eighty or ninety miles .
a part of the land toward the north rises more than a thousand feet perpendicularly from the sea .
a <unk> at this height extends back nearly to the centre of the island , and from this <unk> arises a lofty cone like that of teneriffe .
the lower half of this cone is clothed with trees of good size , but the upper region is barren rock , usually hidden among the clouds , and covered with snow during the greater part of the year .
there are no shoals or other dangers about the island , the shores being remarkably bold and the water deep .
on the northwestern coast is a bay , with a beach of black sand where a landing with boats can be easily effected , provided there be a southerly wind .
plenty of excellent water may here be readily procured ; also cod and other fish may be taken with hook and line .
the next island in point of size , and the most <unk> of the group , is that called the inaccessible .
its precise situation is 37 degrees <unk> s. latitude , longitude 12 degrees 24 ' w. it is seven or eight miles in circumference , and on all sides presents a forbidding and precipitous aspect .
its top is perfectly flat , and the whole region is sterile , nothing growing upon it except a few stunted shrubs .
nightingale island , the smallest and most southerly , is in latitude 37 degrees 26 ' s. , longitude 12 degrees 12 ' w. off its southern extremity is a high ledge of <name> islets ; a few also of a similar appearance are seen to the northeast .
the ground is irregular and sterile , and a deep valley partially separates it .
the shores of these islands abound , in the proper season , with sea lions , sea elephants , the hair and fur seal , together with a great variety of oceanic birds .
whales are also plenty in their vicinity .
owing to the ease with which these various animals were here formerly taken , the group has been much visited since its discovery .
the dutch and french frequented it at a very early period .
in <unk> , captain <unk> , of the ship industry , of philadelphia , made <name> <unk> , where he remained seven months ( from <name> , <unk> , to <name> , <unk> ) for the purpose of collecting <unk> .
in this time he gathered no less than five thousand six hundred , and says that he would have had no difficulty in loading a large ship with oil in three weeks .
upon his arrival he found no quadrupeds , with the exception of a few wild goats ; the island now abounds with all our most valuable domestic animals , which have been introduced by subsequent navigators .
i believe it was not long after captain <unk> 's visit that captain <unk> , of the american brig <name> , touched at the largest of the islands for the purpose of refreshment .
he planted onions , potatoes , cabbages , and a great many other vegetables , an abundance of all which is now to be met with .
in 1811 , a captain <name> , in the <unk> , visited <name> .
he found there three americans , who were residing upon the island to prepare <unk> and oil .
one of these men was named <name> lambert , and he called himself the sovereign of the country .
he had cleared and cultivated about sixty acres of land , and turned his attention to raising the <unk> and sugar-cane , with which he had been furnished by the american minister at rio janeiro .
this settlement , however , was finally abandoned , and in 1817 the islands were taken possession of by the british government , who sent a detachment for that purpose from the cape of good <name> .
they did not , however , retain them long ; but , upon the <unk> of the country as a british possession , two or three english families took up their residence there independently of the government .
on the <unk> of march , 1824 , the berwick , captain <name> , from london to van diemen 's land , arrived at the place , where they found an englishman of the name of glass , formerly a corporal in the british artillery .
he claimed to be supreme governor of the islands , and had under his control twenty-one men and three women .
he gave a very favourable account of the <unk> of the climate and of the productiveness of the soil .
the population occupied themselves chiefly in collecting <unk> and sea elephant oil , with which they traded to the cape of good <name> , glass owning a small schooner .
at the period of our arrival the governor was still a resident , but his little community had multiplied , there being fifty-six persons upon <name> , besides a smaller settlement of seven on nightingale island .
we had no difficulty in procuring almost every kind of refreshment which we required  sheep , hogs , bullocks , rabbits , poultry , goats , fish in great variety , and vegetables were abundant .
having come to anchor close in with the large island , in eighteen fathoms , we took all we wanted on board very conveniently .
captain <name> also purchased of glass five hundred <unk> and some <name> .
we remained here a week , during which the prevailing winds were from the northward and westward , and the weather somewhat hazy .
on the fifth of november we made sail to the southward and westward , with the intention of having a thorough search for a group of islands called the <unk> , respecting whose existence a great diversity of opinion has existed .
these islands are said to have been discovered as early as <unk> , by the commander of the ship <name> .
in <unk> , captain <name> de <unk> , , in the ship <name> , belonging to the <name> philippine company , sailed , as he asserts , directly among them .
in 1794 , the spanish <unk> <unk> went with the determination of ascertaining their precise situation , and , in a paper published by the <name> <unk> society of madrid in the year 1809 , the following language is used respecting this expedition : " the <unk> <unk> practised , in their immediate vicinity , from the <unk> to the <unk> of <name> , all the necessary observations , and measured by <unk> the difference of longitude between these islands and the port of <name> in the <unk> .
the islands are three , they are very nearly in the same meridian ; the centre one is rather low , and the other two may be seen at nine leagues ' distance . "
the observations made on board the <unk> give the following results as the precise situation of each island .
the most northern is in latitude 52 degrees 37 ' 24 " s. , longitude 47 degrees , 43 ' 15 " w. ; the middle one in latitude 53 degrees 2 ' 40 " s. , longitude 47 degrees 55 ' 15 " w. ; and the most southern in latitude 53 degrees 15 ' 22 " s. , longitude 47 degrees 57 ' 15 " w. on the <unk> of <name> , 1820 , captain <name> <unk> , of the british navy , sailed from <unk> land also in search of the <unk> .
he reports that , having made the most diligent search and passed not only immediately over the spots indicated by the commander of the <unk> , but in every direction throughout the vicinity of these spots , he could discover no indication of land .
these conflicting statements have induced other navigators to look out for the islands ; and , strange to say , while some have sailed through every inch of sea where they are supposed to lie without finding them , there have been not a few who declare positively that they have seen them ; and even been close in with their shores .
it was captain <name> 's intention to make every exertion within his power to settle the question so oddly in dispute .
{ <unk> } we kept on our course , between the south and west , with variable weather , until the twentieth of the month , when we found ourselves on the debated ground , being in latitude 53 degrees 15 ' s. , longitude 47 degrees 58 ' w.  that is to say , very nearly upon the spot indicated as the situation of the most southern of the group .
not perceiving any sign of land , we continued to the westward of the parallel of fifty-three degrees south , as far as the meridian of fifty degrees west .
we then stood to the north as far as the parallel of fifty-two degrees south , when we turned to the eastward , and kept our parallel by double altitudes , morning and evening , and meridian altitudes of the planets and moon .
having thus gone <unk> to the meridian of the western coast of <name> , we kept that meridian until we were in the latitude from which we set out .
we then took diagonal courses throughout the entire extent of sea circumscribed , keeping a lookout constantly at the masthead , and repeating our examination with the greatest care for a period of three weeks , during which the weather was remarkably pleasant and fair , with no haze whatsoever .
of course we were thoroughly satisfied that , whatever islands might have existed in this vicinity at any former period , no vestige of them remained at the present day .
since my return home i find that the same ground was traced over , with equal care , in 1822 , by captain <name> , of the american schooner <name> , and by captain <unk> in the american schooner wasp  in both cases with the same result as in our own .
chapter 16 it had been captain <name> 's original intention , after satisfying himself about the <unk> , to proceed through the strait of magellan , and up along the western coast of patagonia ; but information received at <name> <unk> induced him to steer to the southward , in the <name> of falling in with some small islands said to lie about the parallel of 60 degrees s. , longitude 41 degrees 20 ' w. in the event of his not discovering these lands , he designed , should the season prove favourable , to push on toward the pole .
accordingly , on the twelfth of december , we made sail in that direction .
on the eighteenth we found ourselves about the station indicated by glass , and <unk> for three days in that neighborhood without finding any traces of the islands he had mentioned .
on the <unk> , the weather being unusually pleasant , we again made sail to the southward , with the resolution of penetrating in that course as far as possible .
before entering upon this portion of my narrative , it may be as well , for the information of those readers who have paid little attention to the progress of discovery in these regions , to give some brief account of the very few attempts at reaching the southern pole which have hitherto been made .
that of captain cook was the first of which we have any distinct account .
in <unk> he sailed to the south in the resolution , accompanied by lieutenant <unk> in the adventure .
in december he found himself as far as the <unk> parallel of south latitude , and in longitude 26 degrees 57 ' e. here he met with narrow fields of ice , about eight or ten inches thick , and running northwest and southeast .
this ice was in large cakes , and usually it was packed so closely that the vessel had great difficulty in forcing a passage .
at this period captain cook supposed , from the vast number of birds to be seen , and from other indications , that he was in the near vicinity of land .
he kept on to the southward , the weather being exceedingly cold , until he reached the <unk> parallel , in longitude 38 degrees 14 ' <unk>
here he had mild weather , with gentle breezes , for five days , the thermometer being at thirty-six .
in <name> , <unk> , the vessels crossed the antarctic circle , but did not succeed in penetrating much farther ; for upon reaching latitude 67 degrees 15 ' they found all farther progress impeded by an immense body of ice , extending all along the southern horizon as far as the eye could reach .
this ice was of every variety  and some large <unk> of it , miles in extent , formed a compact mass , rising eighteen or twenty feet above the water .
it being late in the season , and no <name> entertained of rounding these obstructions , captain cook now reluctantly turned to the northward .
in the november following he renewed his search in the antarctic .
in latitude 59 degrees 40 ' he met with a strong current setting to the southward .
in december , when the vessels were in latitude 67 degrees 31 ' , longitude 142 degrees 54 ' w. , the cold was excessive , with heavy gales and fog .
here also birds were abundant ; the albatross , the penguin , and the <unk> especially .
in latitude 70 degrees 23 ' some large islands of ice were encountered , and shortly afterward the clouds to the southward were observed to be of a snowy whiteness , indicating the vicinity of field ice .
in latitude 71 degrees 10 ' , longitude 106 degrees 54 ' w. , the navigators were stopped , as before , by an immense frozen expanse , which filled the whole area of the southern horizon .
the northern edge of this expanse was ragged and broken , so firmly wedged together as to be utterly <unk> , and extending about a mile to the southward .
behind it the frozen surface was comparatively smooth for some distance , until terminated in the extreme background by gigantic ranges of ice mountains , the one towering above the other .
captain cook concluded that this vast field reached the southern pole or was joined to a continent .
mr. j. n. reynolds , whose great exertions and perseverance have at length succeeded in getting set on foot a national expedition , partly for the purpose of exploring these regions , thus speaks of the attempt of the resolution .
" we are not surprised that captain cook was unable to go beyond 71 degrees 10 ' , but we are astonished that he did attain that point on the meridian of 106 degrees 54 ' west longitude .
<name> 's land lies south of the shetland , latitude sixty-four degrees , and tends to the southward and westward farther than any navigator has yet penetrated .
cook was standing for this land when his progress was arrested by the ice ; which , we apprehend , must always be the case in that point , and so early in the season as the sixth of <name>  and we should not be surprised if a portion of the icy mountains described was attached to the main body of <name> 's land , or to some other portions of land lying farther to the southward and westward . "
in <unk> , captains <unk> and <unk> were dispatched by <name> of russia for the purpose of <unk> the globe .
in endeavouring to get south , they made no farther than 59 degrees 58 ' , in longitude 70 degrees 15 ' w. they here met with strong currents setting <unk> .
whales were abundant , but they saw no ice .
in regard to this voyage , mr. reynolds observes that , if <unk> had arrived where he did earlier in the season , he must have encountered ice  it was march when he reached the latitude specified .
the winds , prevailing , as they do , from the southward and westward , had carried the <unk> , aided by currents , into that icy region bounded on the north by <name> , east by sandwich land and the south <unk> , and west by the south shetland islands .
in 1822 , captain <name> <unk> , of the british navy , with two very small vessels , penetrated farther to the south than any previous navigator , and this , too , without encountering extraordinary difficulties .
he states that although he was frequently hemmed in by ice before reaching the <unk> parallel , yet , upon attaining it , not a particle was to be discovered , and that , upon arriving at the latitude of 74 degrees 15 ' , no fields , and only three islands of ice were visible .
it is somewhat remarkable that , although vast flocks of birds were seen , and other usual indications of land , and although , south of the <unk> , unknown coasts were observed from the masthead tending <unk> , <unk> <unk> the idea of land existing in the polar regions of the south .
on the 11th of <name> , 1823 , captain <name> <unk> , of the american schooner wasp , sailed from kerguelen 's land with a view of penetrating as far south as possible .
on the first of february he found himself in latitude 64 degrees 52 ' s. , longitude 118 degrees 27 ' e. the following passage is extracted from his journal of that date .
" the wind soon freshened to an <unk> breeze , and we embraced this opportunity of making to the west ; being however convinced that the farther we went south beyond latitude sixty-four degrees , the less ice was to be apprehended , we steered a little to the southward , until we crossed the antarctic circle , and were in latitude 69 degrees 15 ' e. in this latitude there was no field ice , and very few ice islands in sight . "
under the date of march fourteenth i find also this entry .
" the sea was now entirely free of field ice , and there were not more than a dozen ice islands in sight .
at the same time the temperature of the air and water was at least thirteen degrees higher ( more mild ) than we had ever found it between the parallels of sixty and sixty-two south .
we were now in latitude 70 degrees 14 ' s. , and the temperature of the air was forty-seven , and that of the water forty-four .
in this situation i found the variation to be 14 degrees 27 ' easterly , per <unk> ... .
i have several times passed within the antarctic circle , on different <unk> , and have uniformly found the temperature , both of the air and the water , to become more and more mild the farther i advanced beyond the <unk> degree of south latitude , and that the variation decreases in the same proportion .
while north of this latitude , say between sixty and sixty-five south , we frequently had great difficulty in finding a passage for the vessel between the immense and almost innumerable ice islands , some of which were from one to two miles in circumference , and more than five hundred feet above the surface of the water . "
being nearly destitute of fuel and water , and without proper instruments , it being also late in the season , captain <unk> was now obliged to put back , without attempting any further progress to the westward , although an entirely open , sea lay before him .
he expresses the opinion that , had not these <unk> considerations obliged him to retreat , he could have penetrated , if not to the pole itself , at least to the <unk> parallel .
i have given his ideas respecting these matters somewhat at length , that the reader may have an opportunity of seeing how far they were borne out by my own subsequent experience .
in 1831 , captain <unk> , in the employ of the messieurs enderby , <unk> owners of london , sailed in the brig lively for the south seas , accompanied by the cutter <name> .
on the <unk> of february , being in latitude 66 degrees 30 ' s. , longitude 47 degrees 31 ' e. , he descried land , and " clearly discovered through the snow the black peaks of a range of mountains running e. s. e. " he remained in this neighbourhood during the whole of the following month , but was unable to approach the coast nearer than within ten leagues , owing to the boisterous state of the weather .
finding it impossible to make further discovery during this season , he returned northward to <name> in van diemen 's land .
in the beginning of 1832 he again proceeded <unk> , and on the fourth of february was seen to the southeast in latitude 67 degrees <unk> longitude 69 degrees 29 ' w. this was soon found to be an island near the headland of the country he had first discovered .
on the <unk> of the month he succeeded in landing on the latter , and took possession of it in the name of <name> iv , calling it <name> 's island , in honour of the english <name> .
these particulars being made known to the <name> geographical society of london , the conclusion was drawn by that body " that there is a continuous tract of land extending from 47 degrees 30 ' e. to 69 degrees 29 ' w. longitude , running the parallel of from sixty-six to sixty-seven degrees south latitude . "
in respect to this conclusion mr. reynolds observes : " in the correctness of it we by no means concur ; nor do the discoveries of <unk> warrant any such indifference .
it was within these limits that <unk> proceeded south on a meridian to the east of <name> , sandwich land , and the south <unk> and shetland islands . "
my own experience <name> be found to testify most directly to the <unk> of the conclusion arrived at by the society .
these are the principal attempts which have been made at penetrating to a high southern latitude , and it <name> now be seen that there remained , previous to the voyage of the <name> , nearly three hundred degrees of longitude in which the antarctic circle had not been crossed at all .
of course a wide field lay before us for discovery , and it was with feelings of most intense interest that i heard captain <name> express his resolution of pushing boldly to the southward .
chapter 17 we kept our course <unk> for four days after giving up the search for glass 's islands , without meeting with any ice at all .
on the <unk> , at noon , we were in latitude 63 degrees 23 ' s. , longitude 41 degrees 25 ' w. we now saw several large ice islands , and a floe of field ice , not , however , of any great extent .
the winds generally blew from the southeast , or the northeast , but were very light .
whenever we had a westerly wind , which was seldom , it was invariably attended with a rain squall .
every day we had more or less snow .
the thermometer , on the <unk> stood at thirty-five .
<name> 1 , <unk>  this day we found ourselves completely hemmed in by the ice , and our prospects looked cheerless indeed .
a strong <name> blew , during the whole forenoon , from the northeast , and drove large cakes of the drift against the rudder and counter with such violence that we all trembled for the consequences .
toward evening , the <name> still blowing with fury , a large field in front separated , and we were enabled , by carrying a press of sail to force a passage through the smaller flakes into some open water beyond .
as we approached this space we took in sail by degrees , and having at length got clear , <unk> under a single <unk> foresail .
<name> 2.  we had now tolerably pleasant weather .
at noon we found ourselves in latitude 69 degrees 10 ' s , longitude 42 degrees 20 ' w , having crossed the antarctic circle .
very little ice was to be seen to the southward , although large fields of it lay behind us .
this day we rigged some sounding gear , using a large iron pot capable of holding twenty gallons , and a line of two hundred fathoms .
we found the current setting to the north , about a quarter of a mile per hour .
the temperature of the air was now about thirty-three .
here we found the variation to be 14 degrees 28 ' easterly , per <unk> .
<name> 5.  we had still held on to the southward without any very great <unk> .
on this morning , however , being in latitude 73 degrees <unk> e. , longitude 42 degrees 10 ' w , we were again brought to a stand by an immense expanse of firm ice .
we saw , nevertheless , much open water to the southward , and felt no doubt of being able to reach it eventually .
standing to the eastward along the edge of the floe , we at length came to a passage of about a mile in width , through which we warped our way by sundown .
the sea in which we now were was thickly covered with ice islands , but had no field ice , and we pushed on boldly as before .
the cold did not seem to increase , although we had snow very frequently , and now and then hail squalls of great violence .
immense flocks of the albatross flew over the schooner this day , going from southeast to northwest .
<name> 7.  the sea still remained pretty well open , so that we had no difficulty in holding on our course .
to the westward we saw some icebergs of incredible size , and in the afternoon passed very near one whose summit could not have been less than four hundred fathoms from the surface of the ocean .
its girth was probably , at the base , three-quarters of a league , and several streams of water were running from crevices in its sides .
we remained in sight of this island two days , and then only lost it in a fog .
<name> <unk>  early this morning we had the misfortune to lose a man overboard .
he was an american named <name> <unk> , a native of new york , and was one of the most valuable hands on board the schooner .
in going over the bows his foot slipped , and he fell between two cakes of ice , never rising again .
at noon of this day we were in latitude 78 degrees 30 ' , longitude 40 degrees 15 ' w. the cold was now excessive , and we had hail squalls continually from the northward and eastward .
in this direction also we saw several more immense icebergs , and the whole horizon to the eastward appeared to be blocked up with field ice , rising in tiers , one mass above the other .
some driftwood floated by during the evening , and a great quantity of birds flew over , among which were <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and a large bird of a brilliant blue plumage .
the variation here , per <unk> , was less than it had been previously to our passing the antarctic circle .
<name> <unk> passage to the south again looked doubtful , as nothing was to be seen in the direction of the pole but one apparently limitless floe , backed by absolute mountains of ragged ice , one precipice of which arose <unk> above the other .
we stood to the westward until the fourteenth , in the <name> of finding an entrance .
<name> <unk> morning we reached the western extremity of the field which had impeded us , and , <unk> it , came to an open sea , without a particle of ice .
upon sounding with two hundred fathoms , we here found a current setting <unk> at the rate of half a mile per hour .
the temperature of the air was forty-seven , that of the water <unk> .
we now sailed to the southward without meeting any interruption of moment until the sixteenth , when , at noon , we were in latitude 81 degrees 21 ' , longitude 42 degrees w. we here again sounded , and found a current setting still <unk> , and at the rate of three quarters of a mile per hour .
the variation per <unk> had diminished , and the temperature of the air was mild and pleasant , the thermometer being as high as fifty-one .
at this period not a particle of ice was to be discovered .
all hands on board now felt certain of attaining the pole .
<name> <unk>  this day was full of incident .
innumerable flights of birds flew over us from the southward , and several were shot from the deck , one of them , a species of pelican , proved to be excellent eating .
about midday a small floe of ice was seen from the masthead off the larboard bow , and upon it there appeared to be some large animal .
as the weather was good and nearly calm , captain <name> ordered out two of the boats to see what it was .
<name> peters and myself accompanied the mate in the larger boat .
upon coming up with the floe , we perceived that it was in the possession of a gigantic creature of the race of the arctic bear , but far exceeding in size the largest of these animals .
being well armed , we made no scruple of attacking it at once .
several shots were fired in quick succession , the most of which took effect , apparently , in the head and body .
nothing discouraged , however , the monster threw himself from the ice , and swam with open jaws , to the boat in which were peters and myself .
owing to the confusion which ensued among us at this unexpected turn of the adventure , no person was ready immediately with a second shot , and the bear had actually succeeded in getting half his vast bulk across our gunwale , and seizing one of the men by the small of his back , before any efficient means were taken to repel him .
in this extremity nothing but the promptness and agility of peters saved us from destruction .
leaping upon the back of the huge beast , he plunged the blade of a knife behind the neck , reaching the spinal marrow at a blow .
the brute tumbled into the sea lifeless , and without a struggle , rolling over peters as he fell .
the latter soon recovered himself , and a rope being thrown him , he secured the carcass before entering the boat .
we then returned in triumph to the schooner , towing our trophy behind us .
this bear , upon <unk> , proved to be full fifteen feet in his greatest length .
his wool was perfectly white , and very coarse , curling tightly .
the eyes were of a blood red , and larger than those of the arctic bear , the snout also more rounded , rather resembling the snout of the bulldog .
the meat was tender , but excessively rank and fishy , although the men devoured it with avidity , and declared it excellent eating .
scarcely had we got our prize alongside , when the man at the masthead gave the joyful shout of " land on the starboard bow ! "
all hands were now upon the alert , and , a breeze springing up very <unk> from the northward and eastward , we were soon close in with the coast .
it proved to be a low <name> islet , of about a league in circumference , and altogether destitute of vegetation , if we except a species of prickly pear .
in approaching it from the northward , a singular ledge of rock is seen projecting into the sea , and bearing a strong resemblance to <unk> bales of cotton .
around this ledge to the westward is a small bay , at the bottom of which our boats effected a convenient landing .
it did not take us long to explore every portion of the island , but , with one exception , we found nothing worthy of our observation .
in the southern extremity , we picked up near the shore , half buried in a pile of loose stones , a piece of wood , which seemed to have formed the prow of a canoe .
there had been evidently some attempt at carving upon it , and captain <name> fancied that he made out the figure of a tortoise , but the resemblance did not strike me very forcibly .
besides this prow , if such it were , we found no other token that any living creature had ever been here before .
around the coast we discovered occasional small <unk> of ice  but these were very few .
the exact situation of the islet ( to which captain <name> gave the name of <unk> 's islet , in honour of his partner in the ownership of the schooner ) is 82 degrees 50 ' s. latitude , 42 degrees 20 ' w. longitude .
we had now advanced to the southward more than eight degrees farther than any previous navigators , and the sea still lay perfectly open before us .
we found , too , that the variation uniformly decreased as we proceeded , and , what was still more surprising , that the temperature of the air , and latterly of the water , became milder .
the weather might even be called pleasant , and we had a steady but very gentle breeze always from some northern point of the compass .
the sky was usually clear , with now and then a slight appearance of thin vapour in the southern horizon  this , however , was invariably of brief duration .
two difficulties alone presented themselves to our view ; we were getting short of fuel , and symptoms of scurvy had occurred among several of the crew .
these considerations began to impress upon captain <name> the necessity of returning , and he spoke of it frequently .
for my own part , confident as i was of soon arriving at land of some description upon the course we were pursuing , and having every reason to believe , from present appearances , that we should not find it the sterile soil met with in the higher arctic latitudes , i warmly pressed upon him the expediency of persevering , at least for a few days longer , in the direction we were now holding .
so tempting an opportunity of solving the great problem in regard to an antarctic continent had never yet been afforded to man , and i confess that i felt myself bursting with indignation at the timid and <unk> suggestions of our commander .
i believe , indeed , that what i could not refrain from saying to him on this head had the effect of inducing him to push on .
while , therefore , i can not but lament the most unfortunate and bloody events which immediately arose from my advice , i must still be allowed to feel some degree of gratification at having been instrumental , however remotely , in opening to the eye of science one of the most intensely exciting secrets which has ever engrossed its attention .
chapter 18 <name> <unk>  this morning { <unk> } we continued to the southward , with the same pleasant weather as before .
the sea was entirely smooth , the air tolerably warm and from the northeast , the temperature of the water fifty-three .
we now again got our <unk> in order , and , with a hundred and fifty fathoms of line , found the current setting toward the pole at the rate of a mile an hour .
this constant tendency to the southward , both in the wind and current , caused some degree of speculation , and even of alarm , in different quarters of the schooner , and i saw distinctly that no little impression had been made upon the mind of captain <name> .
he was exceedingly sensitive to ridicule , however , and i finally succeeded in laughing him out of his apprehensions .
the variation was now very trivial .
in the course of the day we saw several large whales of the right species , and innumerable flights of the albatross passed over the vessel .
we also picked up a bush , full of red berries , like those of the hawthorn , and the carcass of a <unk> <unk> .
it was three feet in length , and but six inches in height , with four very short legs , the feet armed with long claws of a brilliant <name> , and resembling <name> in substance .
the body was covered with a straight silky hair , perfectly white .
the tail was peaked like that of a rat , and about a foot and a half long .
the head resembled a cat 's , with the exception of the ears  these were flopped like the ears of a dog .
the teeth were of the same brilliant <name> as the claws .
<name> <unk>  to-day , being in latitude 83 degrees 20 ' , longitude 43 degrees 5 ' w. ( the sea being of an extraordinarily dark colour ) , we again saw land from the masthead , and , upon a closer scrutiny , found it to be one of a group of very large islands .
the shore was precipitous , and the interior seemed to be well wooded , a circumstance which occasioned us great <name> .
in about four hours from our first discovering the land we came to anchor in ten fathoms , <name> bottom , a league from the coast , as a high surf , with strong ripples here and there , rendered a nearer approach of doubtful expediency .
the two largest boats were now ordered out , and a party , well armed ( among whom were peters and myself ) , proceeded to look for an opening in the reef which appeared to <unk> the island .
after searching about for some time , we discovered an inlet , which we were entering , when we saw four large canoes put off from the shore , filled with men who seemed to be well armed .
we waited for them to come up , and , as they moved with great rapidity , they were soon within hail .
captain <name> now held up a white handkerchief on the blade of an oar , when the strangers made a full stop , and commenced a loud <unk> all at once , intermingled with occasional shouts , in which we could distinguish the words <unk> !
and <unk> !
they continued this for at least half an hour , during which we had a good opportunity of observing their appearance .
in the four canoes , which might have been fifty feet long and five broad , there were a hundred and ten savages in all .
they were about the ordinary stature of europeans , but of a more muscular and brawny frame .
their complexion a jet black , with thick and long woolly hair .
they were clothed in skins of an unknown black animal , shaggy and silky , and made to fit the body with some degree of skill , the hair being inside , except where turned out about the neck , wrists , and ankles .
their arms consisted principally of clubs , of a dark , and apparently very heavy wood .
some spears , however , were observed among them , headed with flint , and a few slings .
the bottoms of the canoes were full of black stones about the size of a large egg .
when they had concluded their harangue ( for it was clear they intended their <unk> for such ) , one of them who seemed to be the chief stood up in the prow of his canoe , and made signs for us to bring our boats alongside of him .
this hint we pretended not to understand , thinking it the wiser plan to maintain , if possible , the interval between us , as their number more than <unk> our own .
finding this to be the case , the chief ordered the three other canoes to hold back , while he advanced toward us with his own .
as soon as he came up with us he leaped on board the largest of our boats , and seated himself by the side of captain <name> , pointing at the same time to the schooner , and repeating the word <unk> !
and <unk> !
we now put back to the vessel , the four canoes following at a little distance .
upon getting alongside , the chief evinced symptoms of extreme surprise and delight , clapping his hands , slapping his thighs and breast , and laughing <unk> .
his followers behind joined in his merriment , and for some minutes the din was so excessive as to be absolutely deafening .
quiet being at length restored , captain <name> ordered the boats to be hoisted up , as a necessary precaution , and gave the chief ( whose name we soon found to be too-wit ) to understand that we could admit no more than twenty of his men on deck at one time .
with this arrangement he appeared perfectly satisfied , and gave some directions to the canoes , when one of them approached , the rest remaining about fifty yards off .
twenty of the savages now got on board , and proceeded to ramble over every part of the deck , and scramble about among the rigging , making themselves much at home , and examining every article with great <unk> .
it was quite evident that they had never before seen any of the white race  from whose complexion , indeed , they appeared to recoil .
they believed the <name> to be a living creature , and seemed to be afraid of hurting it with the points of their spears , carefully turning them up .
our crew were much amused with the conduct of too-wit in one instance .
the cook was splitting some wood near the galley , and , by accident , struck his axe into the deck , making a gash of considerable depth .
the chief immediately ran up , and pushing the cook on one side rather roughly , commenced a half whine , half howl , strongly indicative of sympathy in what he considered the sufferings of the schooner , patting and smoothing the gash with his hand , and washing it from a bucket of <unk> which stood by .
this was a degree of ignorance for which we were not prepared , and for my part i could not help thinking some of it affected .
when the visitors had satisfied , as well as they could , their curiosity in regard to our upper works , they were admitted below , when their amazement exceeded all bounds .
their astonishment now appeared to be far too deep for words , for they roamed about in silence , broken only by low ejaculations .
the arms afforded them much food for speculation , and they were suffered to handle and examine them at leisure .
i do not believe that they had the least suspicion of their actual use , but rather took them for idols , seeing the care we had of them , and the attention with which we watched their movements while handling them .
at the great guns their wonder was redoubled .
they approached them with every <name> of the profoundest reverence and awe , but forbore to examine them minutely .
there were two large mirrors in the cabin , and here was the acme of their amazement .
too-wit was the first to approach them , and he had got in the middle of the cabin , with his face to one and his back to the other , before he fairly perceived them .
upon raising his eyes and seeing his reflected self in the glass , i thought the savage would go mad ; but , upon turning short round to make a retreat , and beholding himself a second time in the opposite direction , i was afraid he would expire upon the spot .
no persuasion could prevail upon him to take another look ; throwing himself upon the floor , with his face buried in his hands , he remained thus until we were obliged to drag him upon deck .
the whole of the savages were admitted on board in this manner , twenty at a time , too-wit being suffered to remain during the entire period .
we saw no disposition to <unk> among them , nor did we miss a single article after their departure .
throughout the whole of their visit they evinced the most friendly manner .
there were , however , some points in their demeanour which we found it impossible to understand ; for example , we could not get them to approach several very harmless objects  such as the schooner 's sails , an egg , an open book , or a pan of flour .
we endeavoured to ascertain if they had among them any articles which might be turned to account in the way of traffic , but found great difficulty in being comprehended .
we made out , nevertheless , what greatly astonished us , that the islands abounded in the large tortoise of the <unk> , one of which we saw in the canoe of too-wit .
we saw also some <unk> de mer in the hands of one of the savages , who was greedily devouring it in its natural state .
these anomalies  for they were such when considered in regard to the latitude  induced captain <name> to wish for a thorough investigation of the country , in the <name> of making a profitable speculation in his discovery .
for my own part , anxious as i was to know something more of these islands , i was still more earnestly bent on prosecuting the voyage to the southward without delay .
we had now fine weather , but there was no telling how long it would last ; and being already in the <unk> parallel , with an open sea before us , a current setting strongly to the southward , and the wind fair , i could not listen with any <name> to a proposition of stopping longer than was absolutely necessary for the health of the crew and the taking on board a proper supply of fuel and fresh provisions .
i represented to the captain that we might easily make this group on our return , and <name> here in the event of being blocked up by the ice .
he at length came into my views ( for in some way , hardly known to myself , i had acquired much influence over him ) , and it was finally resolved that , even in the event of our finding <unk> de mer , we should only stay here a week to recruit , and then push on to the southward while we might .
accordingly we made every necessary preparation , and , under the guidance of too-wit , got the <name> through the reef in safety , coming to anchor about a mile from the shore , in an excellent bay , completely <unk> , on the southeastern coast of the main island , and in ten fathoms of water , black <name> bottom .
at the head of this bay there were three fine springs ( we were told ) of good water , and we saw abundance of wood in the vicinity .
the four canoes followed us in , keeping , however , at a respectful distance .
too-wit himself remained on board , and , upon our dropping anchor , invited us to accompany him on shore , and visit his village in the interior .
to this captain <name> consented ; and ten savages being left on board as hostages , a party of us , twelve in all , got in readiness to attend the chief .
we took care to be well armed , yet without evincing any distrust .
the schooner had her guns run out , her <unk> up , and every other proper precaution was taken to guard against surprise .
directions were left with the chief mate to admit no person on board during our absence , and , in the event of our not appearing in twelve hours , to send the cutter , with a <unk> , around the island in search of us .
at every step we took inland the conviction forced itself upon us that we were in a country differing essentially from any hitherto visited by civilized men .
we saw nothing with which we had been formerly conversant .
the trees resembled no growth of either the torrid , the temperate , of the northern frigid zones , and were altogether unlike those of the lower southern latitudes we had already traversed .
the very rocks were novel in their mass , their color , and their stratification ; and the streams themselves , utterly incredible as it may appear , had so little in common with those of other climates , that we were scrupulous of tasting them , and , indeed , had difficulty in bringing ourselves to believe that their qualities were purely those of nature .
at a small <name> which crossed our path ( the first we had reached ) too-wit and his attendants halted to drink .
on account of the singular character of the water , we refused to taste it , supposing it to be polluted ; and it was not until some time afterward we came to understand that such was the appearance of the streams throughout the whole group .
i am at a loss to give a distinct idea of the nature of this liquid , and can not do so without many words .
although it flowed with rapidity in all declivities where common water would do so , yet never , except when falling in a cascade , had it the customary appearance of <unk> .
it was , nevertheless , in point of fact , as perfectly limpid as any limestone water in existence , the difference being only in appearance .
at first sight , and especially in cases where little declivity was found , it bore resemblance , as regards consistency , to a thick infusion of gum arabic in common water .
but this was only the least remarkable of its extraordinary qualities .
it was not colourless , nor was it of any one uniform colour  presenting to the eye , as it flowed , every possible shade of purple ; like the hues of a <unk> silk .
this variation in shade was produced in a manner which excited as profound astonishment in the minds of our party as the mirror had done in the case of too-wit .
upon collecting a <unk> , and allowing it to settle thoroughly , we perceived that the whole mass of liquid was made up of a number of distinct veins , each of a distinct <name> ; that these veins did not <unk> ; and that their <unk> was perfect in regard to their own particles among themselves , and imperfect in regard to neighbouring veins .
upon passing the blade of a knife athwart the veins , the water closed over it immediately , as with us , and also , in withdrawing it , all traces of the passage of the knife were instantly obliterated .
if , however , the blade was passed down accurately between the two veins , a perfect separation was effected , which the power of <unk> did not immediately <unk> .
the phenomena of this water formed the first definite link in that vast chain of apparent miracles with which i was destined to be at length encircled .
chapter 19 we were nearly three hours in reaching the village , it being more than nine miles in the interior , and the path lying through a rugged country .
as we passed along , the party of too-wit ( the whole hundred and ten savages of the canoes ) was momentarily strengthened by smaller detachments , of from two to six or seven , which joined us , as if by accident , at different turns of the road .
there appeared so much of system in this that i could not help feeling distrust , and i spoke to captain <name> of my apprehensions .
it was now too late , however , to recede , and we concluded that our best security lay in evincing a perfect confidence in the good <name> of too-wit .
we accordingly went on , keeping a wary eye upon the manoeuvres of the savages , and not permitting them to divide our <name> by pushing in between .
in this way , passing through a precipitous ravine , we at length reached what we were told was the only collection of habitations upon the island .
as we came in sight of them , the chief set up a shout , and frequently repeated the word <unk> , which we supposed to be the name of the village , or perhaps the generic name for villages .
the dwellings were of the most miserable description imaginable , and , unlike those of even the lowest of the savage races with which mankind are acquainted , were of no uniform plan .
some of them ( and these we found belonged to the <unk> or <unk> , the great men of the land ) consisted of a tree cut down at about four feet from the root , with a large black skin thrown over it , and hanging in loose folds upon the ground .
under this the savage nestled .
others were formed by means of rough limbs of trees , with the withered foliage upon them , made to <unk> , at an <name> of forty-five degrees , against a bank of <name> , heaped up , without regular form , to the height of five or six feet .
others , again , were mere holes dug in the earth perpendicularly , and covered over with similar branches , these being removed when the tenant was about to enter , and pulled on again when he had entered .
a few were built among the forked limbs of trees as they stood , the upper limbs being partially cut through , so as to bend over upon the lower , thus forming thicker shelter from the weather .
the greater number , however , consisted of small shallow caverns , apparently scratched in the face of a precipitous ledge of dark stone , resembling fuller 's earth , with which three sides of the village were bounded .
at the door of each of these primitive caverns was a small rock , which the tenant carefully placed before the entrance upon leaving his residence , for what purpose i could not ascertain , as the stone itself was never of sufficient size to close up more than a third of the opening .
this village , if it were worthy of the name , lay in a valley of some depth , and could only be approached from the southward , the precipitous ledge of which i have already spoken cutting off all access in other directions .
through the middle of the valley ran a brawling stream of the same <unk> water which has been described .
we saw several strange animals about the dwellings , all appearing to be thoroughly domesticated .
the largest of these creatures resembled our common hog in the structure of the body and snout ; the tail , however , was bushy , and the legs slender as those of the antelope .
its motion was exceedingly awkward and <unk> , and we never saw it attempt to run .
we noticed also several animals very similar in appearance , but of a greater length of body , and covered with a black wool .
there were a great variety of tame fowls running about , and these seemed to constitute the chief food of the natives .
to our astonishment we saw black albatross among these birds in a state of entire domestication , going to sea periodically for food , but always returning to the village as a home , and using the southern shore in the vicinity as a place of incubation .
there they were joined by their friends the pelicans as usual , but these latter never followed them to the dwellings of the savages .
among the other kinds of tame fowls were ducks , differing very little from the <unk> of our own country , black <unk> , and a large bird not unlike the buzzard in appearance , but not carnivorous .
of fish there seemed to be a great abundance .
we saw , during our visit , a quantity of dried salmon , rock cod , blue <unk> , mackerel , <unk> , skate , <unk> eels , <unk> , <unk> , soles , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and innumerable other varieties .
we noticed , too , that most of them were similar to the fish about the group of lord auckland islands , in a latitude as low as fifty-one degrees south .
the <unk> tortoise was also very plentiful .
we saw but few wild animals , and none of a large size , or of a species with which we were familiar .
one or two serpents of a formidable aspect crossed our path , but the natives paid them little attention , and we concluded that they were not venomous .
as we approached the village with too-wit and his party , a vast crowd of the people rushed out to meet us , with loud shouts , among which we could only distinguish the everlasting <unk> !
and <unk> !
we were much surprised at perceiving that , with one or two exceptions , these new comers were entirely naked , and skins being used only by the men of the canoes .
all the weapons of the country seemed also to be in the possession of the latter , for there was no appearance of any among the villagers .
there were a great many women and children , the former not altogether wanting in what might be termed personal beauty .
they were straight , tall , and well formed , with a <name> and freedom of carriage not to be found in civilized society .
their lips , however , like those of the men , were thick and clumsy , so that , even when laughing , the teeth were never disclosed .
their hair was of a finer texture than that of the males .
among these naked villagers there might have been ten or twelve who were clothed , like the party of too-wit , in dresses of black skin , and armed with lances and heavy clubs .
these appeared to have great influence among the rest , and were always addressed by the title <unk> .
these , too , were the tenants of the black skin palaces .
that of too-wit was situated in the centre of the village , and was much larger and somewhat better constructed than others of its kind .
the tree which formed its support was cut off at a distance of twelve feet or thereabouts from the root , and there were several branches left just below the cut , these serving to extend the covering , and in this way prevent its flapping about the trunk .
the covering , too , which consisted of four very large skins fastened together with wooden <unk> , was secured at the bottom with pegs driven through it and into the ground .
the floor was strewed with a quantity of dry leaves by way of carpet .
to this hut we were conducted with great solemnity , and as many of the natives crowded in after us as possible .
too-wit seated himself on the leaves , and made signs that we should follow his example .
this we did , and presently found ourselves in a situation peculiarly uncomfortable , if not indeed critical .
we were on the ground , twelve in number , with the savages , as many as forty , sitting on their hams so closely around us that , if any disturbance had arisen , we should have found it impossible to make use of our arms , or indeed to have risen to our feet .
the pressure was not only inside the tent , but outside , where probably was every individual on the whole island , the crowd being prevented from trampling us to death only by the incessant exertions and <unk> of too-wit .
our chief security lay , however , in the presence of too-wit himself among us , and we resolved to stick by him closely , as the best chance of <unk> ourselves from the dilemma , sacrificing him immediately upon the first appearance of hostile design .
after some trouble a certain degree of quiet was restored , when the chief addressed us in a speech of great length , and very nearly resembling the one delivered in the canoes , with the exception that the <unk> !
were now somewhat more strenuously insisted upon than the <unk> !
we listened in profound silence until the conclusion of this harangue , when captain <name> replied by assuring the chief of his eternal friendship and goodwill , concluding what he had to say be a present of several strings of blue beads and a knife .
at the former the monarch , much to our surprise , turned up his nose with some expression of contempt , but the knife gave him the most unlimited satisfaction , and he immediately ordered dinner .
this was handed into the tent over the heads of the attendants , and consisted of the palpitating entrails of a <unk> of unknown animal , probably one of the <unk> hogs which we had observed in our approach to the village .
seeing us at a loss how to proceed , he began , by way of setting us an example , to devour yard after yard of the enticing food , until we could positively stand it no longer , and evinced such manifest symptoms of rebellion of stomach as inspired his majesty with a degree of astonishment only inferior to that brought about by the <unk> .
we declined , however , partaking of the delicacies before us , and endeavoured to make him understand that we had no appetite whatever , having just finished a hearty <unk> .
when the monarch had made an end of his meal , we commenced a series of <unk> in every ingenious manner we could devise , with a view of discovering what were the chief productions of the country , and whether any of them might be turned to profit .
at length he seemed to have some idea of our meaning , and offered to accompany us to a part of coast where he assured us the <unk> de mer ( pointing to a specimen of that animal ) was to be found in great abundance .
we were glad of this early opportunity of escaping from the oppression of the crowd , and signified our eagerness to proceed .
we now left the tent , and , accompanied by the whole population of the village , followed the chief to the southeastern extremity of the island , nor far from the bay where our vessel lay at anchor .
we waited here for about an hour , until the four canoes were brought around by some of the savages to our station .
the whole of our party then getting into one of them , we were paddled along the edge of the reef before mentioned , and of another still farther out , where we saw a far greater quantity of <unk> de mer than the oldest seamen among us had ever seen in those groups of the lower latitudes most celebrated for this article of commerce .
we stayed near these reefs only long enough to satisfy ourselves that we could easily load a dozen vessels with the animal if necessary , when we were taken alongside the schooner , and parted with too-wit , after obtaining from him a promise that he would bring us , in the course of twenty-four hours , as many of the <unk> ducks and <unk> tortoises as his canoes would hold .
in the whole of this adventure we saw nothing in the demeanour of the natives calculated to create suspicion , with the single exception of the systematic manner in which their party was strengthened during our route from the schooner to the village .
chapter 20 the chief was as good as his word , and we were soon <unk> supplied with fresh provisions .
we found the tortoises as fine as we had ever seen , and the ducks surpassed our best species of wild fowl , being exceedingly tender , juicy , and <unk> .
besides these , the savages brought us , upon our making them comprehend our wishes , a vast quantity of brown celery and scurvy grass , with a <unk> of fresh fish and some dried .
the celery was a treat indeed , and the scurvy grass proved of incalculable benefit in restoring those of our men who had shown symptoms of disease .
in a very short time we had not a single person on the <unk> .
we had also plenty of other kinds of fresh provisions , among which may be mentioned a species of <unk> resembling the <unk> in shape , but with the taste of an oyster .
<unk> , too , and <unk> were abundant , and albatross and other <unk> eggs with dark shells .
we took in , too , a plentiful stock of the flesh of the hog which i have mentioned before .
most of the men found it a <unk> food , but i thought it fishy and otherwise disagreeable .
in return for these good things we presented the natives with blue beads , brass trinkets , nails , knives , and pieces of red cloth , they being fully delighted in the exchange .
we established a regular market on shore , just under the guns of the schooner , where our <unk> were carried on with every appearance of good <name> , and a degree of order which their conduct at the village of <unk> had not led us to expect from the savages .
matters went on thus very <unk> for several days , during which parties of the natives were frequently on board the schooner , and parties of our men frequently on shore , making long excursions into the interior , and receiving no molestation whatever .
finding the ease with which the vessel might be loaded with <unk> de mer , owing to the friendly disposition of the islanders , and the readiness with which they would render us assistance in collecting it , captain <name> resolved to enter into negotiations with too-wit for the erection of suitable houses in which to cure the article , and for the services of himself and tribe in gathering as much as possible , while he himself took advantage of the fine weather to prosecute his voyage to the southward .
upon mentioning this project to the chief he seemed very willing to enter into an agreement .
a bargain was accordingly struck , perfectly satisfactory to both parties , by which it was arranged that , after making the necessary preparations , such as laying off the proper grounds , erecting a portion of the buildings , and doing some other work in which the whole of our crew would be required , the schooner should proceed on her route , leaving three of her men on the island to superintend the fulfilment of the project , and instruct the natives in drying the <unk> de mer .
in regard to terms , these were made to depend upon the exertions of the savages in our absence .
they were to receive a stipulated quantity of blue beads , knives , red cloth , and so forth , for every certain number of <unk> of the <unk> de mer which should be ready on our return .
a description of the nature of this important article of commerce , and the method of preparing it , may prove of some interest to my readers , and i can find no more suitable place than this for introducing an account of it .
the following comprehensive notice of the substance is taken from a modern history of a voyage to the south seas .
" it is that mollusca from the indian seas which is known to commerce by the french name <unk> de mer ( a nice morsel from the sea ) .
if i am not much mistaken , the celebrated cuvier calls it <unk> <unk> .
it is abundantly gathered in the coasts of the pacific islands , and gathered especially for the chinese market , where it commands a great price , perhaps as much as their <unk> <unk> birds ' nests , which are properly made up of the gelatinous matter picked up by a species of swallow from the body of these <unk> .
they have no shell , no legs , nor any prominent part , except an absorbing and an <unk> , opposite organs ; but , by their elastic wings , like caterpillars or worms , they creep in shallow waters , in which , when low , they can be seen by a kind of swallow , the sharp <name> of which , inserted in the soft animal , draws a <unk> and <unk> substance , which , by drying , can be wrought into the solid walls of their nest .
hence the name of <unk> <unk> .
" this mollusca is oblong , and of different sizes , from three to eighteen inches in length ; and i have seen a few that were not less than two feet long .
they were nearly round , a little <unk> on one side , which lies next to the bottom of the sea ; and they are from one to eight inches thick .
they crawl up into shallow water at particular seasons of the year , probably for the purpose of <unk> , as we often find them in pairs .
it is when the sun has the most power on the water , rendering it tepid , that they approach the shore ; and they often go up into places so shallow that , on the tide 's receding , they are left dry , exposed to the beat of the sun .
but they do not bring forth their young in shallow water , as we never see any of their progeny , and full-grown ones are always observed coming in from deep water .
they feed principally on that class of <unk> which produce the <name> .
" the <unk> de mer is generally taken in three or four feet of water ; after which they are brought on shore , and split at one end with a knife , the <unk> being one inch or more , according to the size of the mollusca .
through this opening the entrails are forced out by pressure , and they are much like those of any other small tenant of the deep .
the article is then washed , and afterward boiled to a certain degree , which must not be too much or too little .
they are then buried in the ground for four hours , then boiled again for a short time , after which they are dried , either by the fire or the sun .
those cured by the sun are worth the most ; but where one <unk> ( 133 <unk> lbs . )
can be cured that way , i can cure thirty <unk> by the fire .
when once properly cured , they can be kept in a dry place for two or three years without any risk ; but they should be examined once in every few months , say four times a year , to see if any dampness is likely to affect them .
" the chinese , as before stated , consider <unk> de mer a very great luxury , believing that it wonderfully strengthens and <unk> the system , and <unk> the exhausted system of the immoderate <unk> .
the first quality commands a high price in canton , being worth ninety dollars a <unk> ; the second quality , seventy-five dollars ; the third , fifty dollars ; the fourth , thirty dollars ; the fifth , twenty dollars ; the sixth , twelve dollars ; the seventh , eight dollars ; and the eighth , four dollars ; small cargoes , however , <name> often bring more in <unk> , singapore , and <unk> . "
an agreement having been thus entered into , we proceeded immediately to land everything necessary for preparing the buildings and clearing the ground .
a large flat space near the eastern shore of the bay was selected , where there was plenty of both wood and water , and within a convenient distance of the principal reefs on which the <unk> de mer was to be procured .
we now all set to work in good <name> , and soon , to the great astonishment of the savages , had felled a sufficient number of trees for our purpose , getting them quickly in order for the framework of the houses , which in two or three days were so far under way that we could safely trust the rest of the work to the three men whom we intended to leave behind .
these were <name> <name> , <name> <name> , and  peterson ( all natives of london , i believe ) , who volunteered their services in this respect .
by the last of the month we had everything in readiness for departure .
we had agreed , however , to pay a formal visit of <unk> to the village , and too-wit insisted so pertinaciously upon our keeping the promise that we did not think it advisable to run the risk of offending him by a final refusal .
i believe that not one of us had at this time the slightest suspicion of the good <name> of the savages .
they had uniformly behaved with the greatest decorum , aiding us with alacrity in our work , offering us their commodities , frequently without price , and never , in any instance , <unk> a single article , although the high value they set upon the goods we had with us was evident by the extravagant demonstrations of <name> always manifested upon our making them a present .
the women especially were most obliging in every respect , and , upon the whole , we should have been the most suspicious of human beings had we entertained a single thought of <unk> on the part of a people who treated us so well .
a very short while sufficed to prove that this apparent kindness of disposition was only the result of a deeply laid plan for our destruction , and that the islanders for whom we entertained such inordinate feelings of esteem , were among the most barbarous , subtle , and bloodthirsty wretches that ever <unk> the face of the globe .
it was on the first of february that we went on shore for the purpose of visiting the village .
although , as said before , we entertained not the slightest suspicion , still no proper precaution was neglected .
six men were left in the schooner , with instructions to permit none of the savages to approach the vessel during our absence , under any pretence whatever , and to remain constantly on deck .
the <unk> were up , the guns <unk> with grape and <unk> , and the <unk> loaded with <unk> of <unk> .
she lay , with her anchor <unk> , about a mile from the shore , and no canoe could approach her in any direction without being distinctly seen and exposed to the full fire of our <unk> immediately .
the six men being left on board , our <unk> consisted of thirty-two persons in all .
we were armed to the teeth , having with us muskets , pistols , and cutlasses ; besides , each had a long kind of seaman 's knife , somewhat resembling the bowie knife now so much used throughout our western and southern country .
a hundred of the black skin warriors met us at the landing for the purpose of accompanying us on our way .
we noticed , however , with some surprise , that they were now entirely without arms ; and , upon questioning too-wit in relation to this circumstance , he merely answered that <unk> non we <name> <name> si  meaning that there was no need of arms where all were brothers .
we took this in good part , and proceeded .
we had passed the spring and rivulet of which i before spoke , and were now entering upon a narrow gorge leading through the chain of <unk> hills among which the village was situated .
this gorge was very <name> and uneven , so much so that it was with no little difficulty we scrambled through it on our first visit to <unk> .
the whole length of the ravine might have been a mile and a half , or probably two miles .
it wound in every possible direction through the hills ( having apparently formed , at some remote period , the bed of a torrent ) , in no instance proceeding more than twenty yards without an abrupt turn .
the sides of this <name> would have averaged , i am sure , seventy or eighty feet in perpendicular altitude throughout the whole of their extent , and in some portions they arose to an astonishing height , overshadowing the pass so completely that but little of the light of day could penetrate .
the general width was about forty feet , and occasionally it diminished so as not to allow the passage of more than five or six persons abreast .
in short , there could be no place in the world better adapted for the consummation of an ambuscade , and it was no more than natural that we should look carefully to our arms as we entered upon it .
when i now think of our <unk> folly , the chief subject of astonishment seems to be , that we should have ever ventured , under any circumstances , so completely into the power of unknown savages as to permit them to march both before and behind us in our progress through this ravine .
yet such was the order we blindly took up , trusting foolishly to the force of our party , the unarmed condition of too-wit and his men , the certain efficacy of our firearms ( whose effect was yet a secret to the natives ) , and , more than all , to the <unk> pretension of friendship kept up by these infamous wretches .
five or six of them went on before , as if to lead the way , ostentatiously <unk> themselves in removing the larger stones and rubbish from the path .
next came our own party .
we walked closely together , taking care only to prevent separation .
behind followed the main body of the savages , observing unusual order and decorum .
<name> peters , a man named <name> <name> , and myself were on the right of our companions , examining , as we went along , the singular stratification of the precipice which overhung us .
a fissure in the soft rock attracted our attention .
it was about wide enough for one person to enter without squeezing , and extended back into the hill some eighteen or twenty feet in a straight course , sloping afterward to the left .
the height of the opening , is far as we could see into it from the main gorge , was perhaps sixty or seventy feet .
there were one or two stunted shrubs growing from the crevices , bearing a species of <unk> which i felt some curiosity to examine , and pushed in briskly for that purpose , gathering five or six of the nuts at a grasp , and then hastily retreating .
as i turned , i found that peters and <name> had followed me .
i desired them to go back , as there was not room for two persons to pass , saying they should have some of my nuts .
they accordingly turned , and were scrambling back , <name> being close to the mouth of the fissure , when i was suddenly aware of a concussion resembling nothing i had ever before experienced , and which impressed me with a vague <name> , if indeed i then thought of anything , that the whole foundations of the solid globe were suddenly rent asunder , and that the day of universal dissolution was at hand .
chapter 21 as soon as i could collect my scattered senses , i found myself nearly suffocated , and <unk> in utter darkness among a quantity of loose earth , which was also falling upon me heavily in every direction , threatening to bury me entirely .
horribly alarmed at this idea , i struggled to gain my feet , and at last succeeded .
i then remained motionless for some moments , endeavouring to conceive what had happened to me , and where i was .
presently i heard a deep groan just at my ear , and afterward the smothered voice of peters calling to me for aid in the name of god .
i scrambled one or two paces forward , when i fell directly over the head and shoulders of my companion , who , i soon discovered , was buried in a loose mass of earth as far as his middle , and struggling desperately to free himself from the pressure .
i tore the dirt from around him with all the energy i could command , and at length succeeded in getting him out .
as soon as we sufficiently recovered from our fright and surprise to be capable of conversing rationally , we both came to the conclusion that the walls of the fissure in which we had ventured had , by some convulsion of nature , or probably from their own weight , caved in overhead , and that we were consequently lost for ever , being thus entombed alive .
for a long time we gave up <unk> to the most intense agony and despair , such as can not be adequately imagined by those who have never been in a similar position .
i firmly believed that no incident ever occurring in the course of human events is more adapted to inspire the <unk> of mental and bodily distress than a case like our own , of living <unk> .
the blackness of darkness which <unk> the victim , the terrific oppression of lungs , the stifling fumes from the damp earth , unite with the ghastly considerations that we are beyond the remotest confines of <name> , and that such is the allotted portion of the dead , to <name> into the human heart a degree of appalling awe and horror not to be tolerated  never to be conceived .
at length peters proposed that we should endeavour to ascertain precisely the extent of our calamity , and grope about our prison ; it being barely possible , he observed , that some opening might yet be left us for escape .
i caught eagerly at this <name> , and , arousing myself to exertion , attempted to force my way through the loose earth .
hardly had i advanced a single step before a glimmer of light became perceptible , enough to convince me that , at all events , we should not immediately perish for want of air .
we now took some degree of heart , and encouraged each other to <name> for the best .
having scrambled over a bank of rubbish which impeded our farther progress in the direction of the light , we found less difficulty in advancing and also experienced some relief from the excessive oppression of lungs which had tormented us .
presently we were enabled to obtain a glimpse of the objects around , and discovered that we were near the extremity of the straight portion of the fissure , where it made a turn to the left .
a few struggles more , and we reached the bend , when to our inexpressible <name> , there appeared a long seam or crack extending upward a vast distance , generally at an <name> of about forty-five degrees , although sometimes much more precipitous .
we could not see through the whole extent of this opening ; but , as a good deal of light came down it , we had little doubt of finding at the top of it ( if we could by any means reach the top ) a clear passage into the open air .
i now called to mind that three of us had entered the fissure from the main gorge , and that our companion , <name> , was still missing ; we determined at once to retrace our steps and look for him .
after a long search , and much danger from the farther <unk> in of the earth above us , peters at length cried out to me that he had hold of our <unk> foot , and that his whole body was deeply buried beneath the rubbish beyond the possibility of <unk> him .
i soon found that what he said was too true , and that , of course , life had been long extinct .
with sorrowful hearts , therefore , we left the corpse to its fate , and again made our way to the bend .
the breadth of the seam was barely sufficient to admit us , and , after one or two ineffectual efforts at getting up , we began once more to despair .
i have before said that the chain of hills through which ran the main gorge was composed of a species of soft rock resembling <unk> .
the sides of the cleft we were now attempting to ascend were of the same material , and so excessively slippery , being wet , that we could get but little foothold upon them even in their least precipitous parts ; in some places , where the ascent was nearly perpendicular , the difficulty was , of course , much aggravated ; and , indeed , for some time we thought insurmountable .
we took courage , however , from despair , and what , by dint of cutting steps in the soft stone with our bowie knives , and swinging at the risk of our lives , to small projecting points of a harder species of slaty rock which now and then protruded from the general mass , we at length reached a natural platform , from which was perceptible a patch of blue sky , at the extremity of a <unk> ravine .
looking back now , with somewhat more leisure , at the passage through which we had thus far proceeded , we clearly saw from the appearance of its sides , that it was of late formation , and we concluded that the concussion , whatever it was , which had so unexpectedly overwhelmed us , had also , at the same moment , laid open this path for escape .
being quite exhausted with exertion , and indeed , so weak that we were scarcely able to stand or articulate , peters now proposed that we should endeavour to bring our companions to the rescue by firing the pistols which still remained in our <unk>  the muskets as well as cutlasses had been lost among the loose earth at the bottom of the chasm .
subsequent events proved that , had we fired , we should have sorely repented it , but luckily a half suspicion of foul play had by this time arisen in my mind , and we forbore to let the savages know of our whereabouts .
after having reposed for about an hour , we pushed on slowly up the ravine , and had gone no great way before we heard a succession of tremendous yells .
at length we reached what might be called the surface of the ground ; for our path hitherto , since leaving the platform , had lain beneath an archway of high rock and foliage , at a vast distance overhead .
with great caution we stole to a narrow opening , through which we had a clear sight of the surrounding country , when the whole dreadful secret of the concussion broke upon us in one moment and at one view .
the spot from which we looked was not far from the summit of the highest peak in the range of the <unk> hills .
the gorge in which our party of thirty-two had entered ran within fifty feet to the left of us .
but , for at least one hundred yards , the channel or bed of this gorge was entirely filled up with the chaotic ruins of more than a million tons of earth and stone that had been artificially tumbled within it .
the means by which the vast mass had been precipitated were not more simple than evident , for sure traces of the murderous work were yet remaining .
in several spots along the top of the eastern side of the gorge ( we were now on the western ) might be seen stakes of wood driven into the earth .
in these spots the earth had not given way , but throughout the whole extent of the face of the precipice from which the mass had fallen , it was clear , from marks left in the soil resembling those made by the drill of the rock <unk> , that stakes similar to those we saw standing had been inserted , at not more than a yard apart , for the length of perhaps three hundred feet , and ranging at about ten feet back from the edge of the gulf .
strong cords of grape vine were attached to the stakes still remaining on the hill , and it was evident that such cords had also been attached to each of the other stakes .
i have already spoken of the singular stratification of these <unk> hills ; and the description just given of the narrow and deep fissure through which we effected our escape from <unk> <name> afford a further <name> of its nature .
this was such that almost every natural convulsion would be sure to split the soil into perpendicular layers or ridges running parallel with one another , and a very moderate exertion of <name> would be sufficient for effecting the same purpose .
of this stratification the savages had availed themselves to accomplish their treacherous ends .
there can be no doubt that , by the continuous line of stakes , a partial rupture of the soil had been brought about probably to the depth of one or two feet , when by means of a savage pulling at the end of each of the cords ( these cords being attached to the tops of the stakes , and extending back from the edge of the <name> ) , a vast <unk> power was obtained , capable of hurling the whole face of the hill , upon a given signal , into the bosom of the abyss below .
the fate of our poor companions was no longer a matter of uncertainty .
we alone had escaped from the tempest of that overwhelming destruction .
we were the only living white men upon the island .
chapter 22 our situation , as it now appeared , was scarcely less dreadful than when we had conceived ourselves entombed forever .
we saw before us no prospect but that of being put to death by the savages , or of dragging out a miserable existence in captivity among them .
we might , to be sure , conceal ourselves for a time from their observation among the fastnesses of the hills , and , as a final resort , in the chasm from which we had just issued ; but we must either perish in the long polar <name> through cold and famine , or be ultimately discovered in our efforts to obtain relief .
the whole country around us seemed to be swarming with savages , crowds of whom , we now perceived , had come over from the islands to the southward on flat rafts , doubtless with a view of lending their aid in the capture and plunder of the <name> .
the vessel still lay calmly at anchor in the bay , those on board being apparently quite unconscious of any danger awaiting them .
how we longed at that moment to be with them !
either to aid in effecting their escape , or to perish with them in attempting a defence .
we saw no chance even of warning them of their danger without bringing immediate destruction upon our own heads , with but a remote <name> of benefit to them .
a pistol fired might suffice to <unk> them that something wrong had occurred ; but the report could not possibly inform them that their only prospect of safety lay in getting out of the harbour forthwith  it could not tell them that no principles of honour now bound them to remain , that their companions were no longer among the living .
upon hearing the discharge they could not be more thoroughly prepared to meet the foe , who were now getting ready to attack , than they already were , and always had been .
no good , therefore , and infinite harm , would result from our firing , and after mature deliberation , we forbore .
our next thought was to attempt to rush toward the vessel , to seize one of the four canoes which lay at the head of the bay , and endeavour to force a passage on board .
but the utter impossibility of succeeding in this desperate task soon became evident .
the country , as i said before , was literally swarming with the natives , skulking among the bushes and recesses of the hills , so as not to be observed from the schooner .
in our immediate vicinity especially , and <unk> the sole path by which we could <name> to attain the shore at the proper point were stationed the whole party of the black skin warriors , with too-wit at their head , and apparently only waiting for some <unk> to commence his onset upon the <name> .
the canoes , too , which lay at the head of the bay , were manned with savages , unarmed , it is true , but who undoubtedly had arms within reach .
we were forced , therefore , however unwillingly , to remain in our place of concealment , mere spectators of the conflict which presently ensued .
in about half an hour we saw some sixty or seventy rafts , or <unk> , without <unk> , filled with savages , and coming round the southern bight of the harbor .
they appeared to have no arms except short clubs , and stones which lay in the bottom of the rafts .
immediately afterward another detachment , still larger , appeared in an opposite direction , and with similar weapons .
the four canoes , too , were now quickly filled with natives , starting up from the bushes at the head of the bay , and put off swiftly to join the other parties .
thus , in less time than i have taken to tell it , and as if by magic , the <name> saw herself surrounded by an immense multitude of desperadoes evidently bent upon capturing her at all hazards .
that they would succeed in so doing could not be doubted for an instant .
the six men left in the vessel , however resolutely they might engage in her defence , were altogether unequal to the proper management of the guns , or in any manner to sustain a contest at such odds .
i could hardly imagine that they would make resistance at all , but in this was deceived ; for presently i saw them get springs upon the cable , and bring the vessel 's starboard broadside to bear upon the canoes , which by this time were within pistol range , the rafts being nearly a quarter of a mile to windward .
owing to some cause unknown , but most probably to the agitation of our poor friends at seeing themselves in so hopeless a situation , the discharge was an entire failure .
not a canoe was hit or a single savage injured , the shots striking short and <unk> over their heads .
the only effect produced upon them was astonishment at the unexpected report and smoke , which was so excessive that for some moments i almost thought they would abandon their design entirely , and return to the shore .
and this they would most likely have done had our men followed up their broadside by a discharge of small arms , in which , as the canoes were now so near at hand , they could not have failed in doing some execution , sufficient , at least , to <unk> this party from a farther advance , until they could have given the rafts also a broadside .
but , in place of this , they left the canoe party to recover from their panic , and , by looking about them , to see that no injury had been sustained , while they flew to the larboard to get ready for the rafts .
the discharge to larboard produced the most terrible effect .
the <name> and <unk> shot of the large guns cut seven or eight of the rafts completely asunder , and killed , perhaps , thirty or forty of the savages outright , while a hundred of them , at least , were thrown into the water , the most of them dreadfully wounded .
the remainder , frightened out of their senses , commenced at once a precipitate retreat , not even waiting to pick up their maimed companions , who were swimming about in every direction , screaming and yelling for aid .
this great success , however , came too late for the salvation of our devoted people .
the canoe party were already on board the schooner to the number of more than a hundred and fifty , the most of them having succeeded in scrambling up the chains and over the <unk> even before the matches had been applied to the larboard guns .
nothing now could withstand their brute rage .
our men were borne down at once , overwhelmed , trodden under foot , and absolutely torn to pieces in an instant .
seeing this , the savages on the rafts got the better of their fears , and came up in shoals to the plunder .
in five minutes the <name> was a pitiable scene indeed of havoc and tumultuous outrage .
the decks were split open and ripped up ; the cordage , sails , and everything movable on deck demolished as if by magic , while , by dint of pushing at the stern , towing with the canoes , and hauling at the sides , as they swam in thousands around the vessel , the wretches finally forced her on shore ( the cable having been slipped ) , and delivered her over to the good offices of too-wit , who , during the whole of the engagement , had maintained , like a skilful general , his post of security and <unk> among the hills , but , now that the victory was completed to his satisfaction , condescended to scamper down with his warriors of the black skin , and become a <unk> in the spoils .
too-wit 's descent left us at <name> to quit our hiding place and reconnoitre the hill in the vicinity of the chasm .
at about fifty yards from the mouth of it we saw a small spring of water , at which we <unk> the burning thirst that now consumed us .
not far from the spring we discovered several of the <unk> which i mentioned before .
upon tasting the nuts we found them <unk> , and very nearly resembling in flavour the common english <unk> .
we collected our hats full immediately , deposited them within the ravine , and returned for more .
while we were busily employed in gathering these , a rustling in the bushes alarmed us , and we were upon the point of stealing back to our covert , when a large black bird of the <unk> species <unk> and slowly arose above the shrubs .
i was so much startled that i could do nothing , but peters had sufficient presence of mind to run up to it before it could make its escape , and seize it by the neck .
its struggles and screams were tremendous , and we had thoughts of letting it go , lest the noise should alarm some of the savages who might be still lurking in the neighbourhood .
a stab with a bowie knife , however , at length brought it to the ground , and we dragged it into the ravine , congratulating ourselves that , at all events , we had thus obtained a supply of food enough to last us for a week .
we now went out again to look about us , and ventured a considerable distance down the southern declivity of the hill , but met with nothing else which could serve us for food .
we therefore collected a quantity of dry wood and returned , seeing one or two large parties of the natives on their way to the village , laden with the plunder of the vessel , and who , we were apprehensive , might discover us in passing beneath the hill .
our next care was to render our place of concealment as secure as possible , and with this object , we arranged some brushwood over the aperture which i have before spoken of as the one through which we saw the patch of blue sky , on reaching the platform from the interior of the chasm .
we left only a very small opening just wide enough to admit of our seeing the bay , without the risk of being discovered from below .
having done this , we congratulated ourselves upon the security of the position ; for we were now completely excluded from observation , as long as we chose to remain within the ravine itself , and not venture out upon the hill , we could perceive no traces of the savages having ever been within this hollow ; but , indeed , when we came to reflect upon the probability that the fissure through which we attained it had been only just now created by the fall of the <name> opposite , and that no other way of attaining it could be perceived , we were not so much rejoiced at the thought of being secure from molestation as fearful lest there should be absolutely no means left us for descent .
we resolved to explore the summit of the hill thoroughly , when a good opportunity should offer .
in the meantime we watched the motions of the savages through our <unk> .
they had already made a complete wreck of the vessel , and were now preparing to set her on fire .
in a little while we saw the smoke ascending in huge volumes from her main hatchway , and , shortly afterward , a dense mass of flame burst up from the forecastle .
the rigging , masts and what remained of the sails caught immediately , and the fire spread rapidly along the decks .
still a great many of the savages retained their stations about her , hammering with large stones , axes , and cannon balls at the bolts and other iron and copper work .
on the beach , and in canoes and rafts , there were not less , altogether , in the immediate vicinity of the schooner , than ten thousand natives , besides the shoals of them who , laden with booty , were making their way inland and over to the neighbouring islands .
we now anticipated a catastrophe , and were not disappointed .
first of all there came a smart shock ( which we felt as distinctly where we were as if we had been slightly <unk> ) , but unattended with any visible signs of an explosion .
the savages were evidently startled , and paused for an instant from their labours and <unk> .
they were upon the point of <unk> , when suddenly a mass of smoke puffed up from the decks , resembling a black and heavy <unk>  then , as if from its bowels , arose a tall stream of vivid fire to the height , apparently , of a quarter of a mile  then there came a sudden circular expansion of the flame  then the whole atmosphere was magically crowded , in a single instant , with a wild chaos of wood , and metal , and human <unk> , lastly , came the concussion in its fullest fury , which hurled us impetuously from our feet , while the hills echoed and <unk> the tumult , and a dense shower of the minutest fragments of the ruins tumbled headlong in every direction around us .
the havoc among the savages far exceeded our utmost expectation , and they had now , indeed , <unk> the full and perfect fruits of their treachery .
perhaps a thousand perished by the explosion , while at least an equal number were desperately mangled .
the whole surface of the bay was literally strewn with the struggling and drowning wretches , and on shore matters were even worse .
they seemed utterly appalled by the suddenness and completeness of their discomfiture , and made no efforts at assisting one another .
at length we observed a total change in their demeanour .
from absolute stupor , they appeared to be , all at once , aroused to the highest pitch of excitement , and rushed wildly about , going to and from a certain point on the beach , with the strangest expressions of mingled horror , rage , and intense curiosity depicted on their countenances , and shouting , at the top of their voices , " <unk> !
<unk> ! "
presently we saw a large body go off into the hills , whence they returned in a short time , carrying stakes of wood .
these they brought to the station where the crowd was the thickest , which now separated so as to afford us a view of the object of all this excitement .
we perceived something white lying upon the ground , but could not immediately make out what it was .
at length we saw that it was the carcass of the strange animal with the <name> teeth and claws which the schooner had picked up at sea on the eighteenth of <name> .
captain <name> had had the body preserved for the purpose of stuffing the skin and taking it to england .
i remember he had given some directions about it just before our making the island , and it had been brought into the cabin and stowed away in one of the lockers .
it had now been thrown on shore by the explosion ; but why it had occasioned so much concern among the savages was more than we could comprehend .
although they crowded around the carcass at a little distance , none of them seemed willing to approach it closely .
by-and-by the men with the stakes drove them in a circle around it , and no sooner was this arrangement completed , than the whole of the vast assemblage rushed into the interior of the island , with loud screams of " <unk> !
<unk> ! "
chapter 23 during the six or seven days immediately following we remained in our hiding-place upon the hill , going out only occasionally , and then with the greatest precaution , for water and <unk> .
we had made a kind of <unk> on the platform , furnishing it with a bed of dry leaves , and placing in it three large flat stones , which served us for both fireplace and table .
we kindled a fire without difficulty by rubbing two pieces of dry wood together , the one soft , the other hard .
the bird we had taken in such good season proved excellent eating , although somewhat tough .
it was not an oceanic fowl , but a species of <unk> , with jet black and grizzly plumage , and diminutive wings in proportion to its bulk .
we afterward saw three of the same kind in the vicinity of the ravine , apparently seeking for the one we had captured ; but , as they never alighted , we had no opportunity of catching them .
as long as this fowl lasted we suffered nothing from our situation , but it was now entirely consumed , and it became absolutely necessary that we should look out for provision .
the <unk> would not satisfy the cravings of hunger , <unk> us , too , with severe <unk> of the bowels , and , if freely indulged in , with violent headache .
we had seen several large tortoises near the seashore to the eastward of the hill , and perceived they might be easily taken , if we could get at them without the observation of the natives .
it was resolved , therefore , to make an attempt at descending .
we commenced by going down the southern declivity , which seemed to offer the <unk> difficulties , but had not proceeded a hundred yards before ( as we had anticipated from appearances on the hilltop ) our progress was entirely arrested by a branch of the gorge in which our companions had perished .
we now passed along the edge of this for about a quarter of a mile , when we were again stopped by a precipice of immense depth , and , not being able to make our way along the brink of it , we were forced to retrace our steps by the main ravine .
we now pushed over to the eastward , but with precisely similar fortune .
after an hour 's scramble , at the risk of breaking our necks , we discovered that we had merely descended into a vast pit of black granite , with fine dust at the bottom , and whence the only egress was by the rugged path in which we had come down .
toiling again up this path , we now tried the northern edge of the hill .
here we were obliged to use the greatest possible caution in our maneuvers , as the least indiscretion would expose us to the full view of the savages in the village .
we crawled along , therefore , on our hands and knees , and , occasionally , were even forced to throw ourselves at full length , dragging our bodies along by means of the shrubbery .
in this careful manner we had proceeded but a little way , when we arrived at a chasm far deeper than any we had yet seen , and leading directly into the main gorge .
thus our fears were fully confirmed , and we found ourselves cut off entirely from access to the world below .
thoroughly exhausted by our exertions , we made the best of our way back to the platform , and throwing ourselves upon the bed of leaves , slept sweetly and soundly for some hours .
for several days after this fruitless search we were occupied in exploring every part of the summit of the hill , in order to inform ourselves of its actual resources .
we found that it would afford us no food , with the exception of the unwholesome <unk> , and a rank species of scurvy grass , which grew in a little patch of not more than four rods square , and would be soon exhausted .
on the fifteenth of february , as near as i can remember , there was not a blade of this left , and the nuts were growing scarce ; our situation , therefore , could hardly be more lamentable .
{ <unk> } on the sixteenth we again went round the walls of our prison , in <name> of finding some avenue of escape ; but to no purpose .
we also descended the chasm in which we had been overwhelmed , with the faint expectation of discovering , through this channel , some opening to the main ravine .
here , too , we were disappointed , although we found and brought up with us a musket .
on the seventeenth we set out with the determination of examining more thoroughly the chasm of black granite into which we had made our way in the first search .
we remembered that one of the fissures in the sides of this pit had been but partially looked into , and we were anxious to explore it , although with no expectation of discovering here any opening .
we found no great difficulty in reaching the bottom of the hollow as before , and were now sufficiently calm to survey it with some attention .
it was , indeed , one of the most <unk> places imaginable , and we could scarcely bring ourselves to believe it altogether the work of nature .
the pit , from its eastern to its western extremity , was about five hundred yards in length , when all its windings were threaded ; the distance from east to west in a straight line not being more ( i should suppose , having no means of accurate examination ) than forty or fifty yards .
upon first descending into the chasm , that is to say , for a hundred feet downward from the summit of the hill , the sides of the abyss bore little resemblance to each other , and , apparently , had at no time been connected , the one surface being of the <unk> , and the other of marl , <unk> with some metallic matter .
the average breadth or interval between the two cliffs was probably here sixty feet , but there seemed to be no regularity of formation .
passing down , however , beyond the limit spoken of , the interval rapidly contracted , and the sides began to run parallel , although , for some distance farther , they were still dissimilar in their material and form of surface .
upon arriving within fifty feet of the bottom , a perfect regularity commenced .
the sides were now entirely uniform in substance , in colour , and in lateral direction , the material being a very black and shining granite , and the distance between the two sides , at all points facing each other , exactly twenty yards .
the precise formation of the chasm <name> be best understood by means of a <unk> taken upon the spot ; for i had luckily with me a pocketbook and pencil , which i preserved with great care through a long series of subsequent adventure , and to which i am indebted for memoranda of many subjects which would otherwise have been crowded from my remembrance .
this figure [ no figures in text ] gives the general outlines of the chasm , without the minor cavities in the sides , of which there were several , each cavity having a corresponding protuberance opposite .
the bottom of the gulf was covered to the depth of three or four inches with a powder almost impalpable , beneath which we found a continuation of the black granite .
to the right , at the lower extremity , <name> be noticed the appearance of a small opening ; this is the fissure alluded to above , and to examine which more minutely than before was the object of our second visit .
we now pushed into it with vigor , cutting away a quantity of brambles which impeded us , and removing a vast heap of sharp flints somewhat resembling <unk> in shape .
we were encouraged to persevere , however , by perceiving some little light proceeding from the farther end .
we at length squeezed our way for about thirty feet , and found that the aperture was a low and regularly formed arch , having a bottom of the same impalpable powder as that in the main chasm .
a strong light now broke upon us , and , turning a short bend , we found ourselves in another lofty chamber , similar to the one we had left in every respect but longitudinal form .
its general figure is here given .
the total length of this chasm , commencing at the opening a and proceeding round the curve b to the extremity d , is five hundred and fifty yards .
at c we discovered a small aperture similar to the one through which we had issued from the other chasm , and this was choked up in the same manner with brambles and a quantity of the white <unk> flints .
we forced our way through it , finding it about forty feet long , and emerged into a third chasm .
this , too , was precisely like the first , except in its longitudinal shape , which was thus .
we found the entire length of the third chasm three hundred and twenty yards .
at the point a was an opening about six feet wide , and extending fifteen feet into the rock , where it terminated in a bed of marl , there being no other chasm beyond , as we had expected .
we were about leaving this fissure , into which very little light was admitted , when peters called my attention to a range of <unk> <unk> in the surface of the marl forming the termination of the <unk> .
with a very slight exertion of the imagination , the left , or most northern of these <unk> might have been taken for the intentional , although rude , representation of a human figure standing erect , with outstretched arm .
the rest of them bore also some little resemblance to <unk> characters , and peters was willing , at all events , to adopt the idle opinion that they were really such .
i convinced him of his error , finally , by directing his attention to the floor of the fissure , where , among the powder , we picked up , piece by piece , several large flakes of the marl , which had evidently been broken off by some convulsion from the surface where the <unk> were found , and which had projecting points exactly fitting the <unk> ; thus proving them to have been the work of nature .
after satisfying ourselves that these singular caverns afforded us no means of escape from our prison , we made our way back , dejected and <unk> , to the summit of the hill .
nothing worth mentioning occurred during the next twenty-four hours , except that , in examining the ground to the eastward of the third chasm , we found two triangular holes of great depth , and also with black granite sides .
into these holes we did not think it worth while to attempt descending , as they had the appearance of mere natural wells , without outlet .
they were each about twenty yards in circumference , and their shape , as well as relative position in regard to the third chasm , is shown in figure 5 .
{ image } chapter 24 on the twentieth of the month , finding it altogether impossible to subsist any longer upon the <unk> , the use of which occasioned us the most excruciating torment , we resolved to make a desperate attempt at descending the southern declivity of the hill .
the face of the precipice was here of the softest species of <unk> , although nearly perpendicular throughout its whole extent ( a depth of a hundred and fifty feet at the least ) , and in many places even <unk> .
after a long search we discovered a narrow ledge about twenty feet below the brink of the gulf ; upon this peters contrived to leap , with what assistance i could render him by means of our <unk> tied together .
with somewhat more difficulty i also got down ; and we then saw the possibility of descending the whole way by the process in which we had clambered up from the chasm when we had been buried by the fall of the <unk> is , by cutting steps in the face of the <unk> with our knives .
the extreme hazard of the attempt can scarcely be conceived ; but , as there was no other resource , we determined to undertake it .
upon the ledge where we stood there grew some <unk> ; and to one of these we made fast an end of our rope of handkerchiefs .
the other end being tied round peters ' waist , i lowered him down over the edge of the precipice until the handkerchiefs were stretched tight .
he now proceeded to dig a deep hole in the <unk> ( as far in as eight or ten inches ) , sloping away the rock above to the height of a foot , or <unk> , so as to allow of his driving , with the butt of a pistol , a tolerably strong <name> into the levelled surface .
i then <name> him up for about four feet , when he made a hole similar to the one below , driving in a <name> as before , and having thus a resting-place for both feet and hands .
i now unfastened the handkerchiefs from the bush , throwing him the end , which he tied to the <name> in the uppermost hole , letting himself down gently to a station about three feet lower than he had yet been that is , to the full extent of the handkerchiefs .
here he dug another hole , and drove another <name> .
he then <name> himself up , so as to rest his feet in the hole just cut , taking hold with his hands upon the <name> in the one above .
it was now necessary to untie the handkerchiefs from the topmost <name> , with the view of fastening them to the second ; and here he found that an error had been committed in cutting the holes at so great a distance apart .
however , after one or two unsuccessful and dangerous attempts at reaching the knot ( having to hold on with his left hand while he labored to undo the fastening with his right ) , he at length cut the string , leaving six inches of it affixed to the <name> .
tying the handkerchiefs now to the second <name> , he descended to a station below the third , taking care not to go too far down .
by these means ( means which i should never have conceived of myself , and for which we were indebted altogether to peters ' ingenuity and resolution ) my companion finally succeeded , with the occasional aid of projections in the <name> , in reaching the bottom without accident .
it was some time before i could summon sufficient resolution to follow him ; but i did at length attempt it .
peters had taken off his shirt before descending , and this , with my own , formed the rope necessary for the adventure .
after throwing down the musket found in the chasm , i fastened this rope to the bushes , and let myself down rapidly , striving , by the vigor of my movements , to banish the trepidation which i could overcome in no other manner .
this answered sufficiently well for the first four or five steps ; but presently i found my imagination growing terribly excited by thoughts of the vast depths yet to be descended , and the precarious nature of the pegs and <unk> holes which were my only support .
it was in vain i endeavored to banish these reflections , and to keep my eyes steadily bent upon the flat surface of the <name> before me .
the more earnestly i struggled not to think , the more intensely vivid became my conceptions , and the more horribly distinct .
at length arrived that crisis of fancy , so fearful in all similar cases , the crisis in which we began to anticipate the feelings with which we shall <unk> picture to ourselves the sickness , and dizziness , and the last struggle , and the half swoon , and the final bitterness of the rushing and headlong descent .
and now i found these fancies creating their own realities , and all imagined horrors crowding upon me in fact .
i felt my knees strike violently together , while my fingers were gradually but certainly relaxing their grasp .
there was a ringing in my ears , and i said , " this is my knell of death ! "
and now i was consumed with the irrepressible <name> of looking below .
i could not , i would not , confine my glances to the <name> ; and , with a wild , indefinable emotion , half of horror , half of a relieved oppression , i threw my vision far down into the abyss .
for one moment my fingers clutched convulsively upon their hold , while , with the movement , the faintest possible idea of ultimate escape wandered , like a shadow , through my mind  in the next my whole soul was pervaded with a longing to fall ; a <name> , a yearning , a passion utterly uncontrollable .
i let go at once my grasp upon the <name> , and , turning half round from the precipice , remained tottering for an instant against its naked face .
but now there came a spinning of the <name> ; a <unk> and phantom voice screamed within my ears ; a dusky , fiendish , and filmy figure stood immediately beneath me ; and , sighing , i sunk down with a bursting heart , and plunged within its arms .
i had swooned , and peters had caught me as i fell .
he had observed my proceedings from his station at the bottom of the <name> ; and perceiving my imminent danger , had endeavored to inspire me with courage by every suggestion he could devise ; although my confusion of mind had been so great as to prevent my hearing what he said , or being conscious that he had even spoken to me at all .
at length , seeing me totter , he hastened to ascend to my rescue , and arrived just in time for my preservation .
had i fallen with my full weight , the rope of linen would inevitably have snapped , and i should have been precipitated into the abyss ; as it was , he contrived to let me down gently , so as to remain suspended without danger until animation returned .
this was in about fifteen minutes .
on recovery , my trepidation had entirely vanished ; i felt a new being , and , with some little further aid from my companion , reached the bottom also in safety .
we now found ourselves not far from the ravine which had proved the tomb of our friends , and to the southward of the spot where the hill had fallen .
the place was one of singular wildness , and its aspect brought to my mind the descriptions given by travellers of those dreary regions marking the site of degraded babylon .
not to speak of the ruins of the <unk> <name> , which formed a chaotic barrier in the vista to the northward , the surface of the ground in every other direction was strewn with huge <unk> , apparently the wreck of some gigantic structures of <name> ; although , in detail , no semblance of <name> could be detected .
<unk> were abundant , and large shapeless blocks of the black granite , intermingled with others of marl , { <unk> } and both <unk> with metal .
of vegetation there were no traces whatsoever throughout the whole of the desolate area within sight .
several immense scorpions were seen , and various reptiles not elsewhere to be found in the high latitudes .
as food was our most immediate object , we resolved to make our way to the seacoast , distant not more than half a mile , with a view of catching turtle , several of which we had observed from our place of concealment on the hill .
we had proceeded some hundred yards , threading our route cautiously between the huge rocks and <unk> , when , upon turning a corner , five savages sprung upon us from a small cavern , <unk> peters to the ground with a blow from a club .
as he fell the whole party rushed upon him to secure their victim , leaving me time to recover from my astonishment .
i still had the musket , but the barrel had received so much injury in being thrown from the precipice that i cast it aside as useless , preferring to trust my pistols , which had been carefully preserved in order .
with these i advanced upon the assailants , firing one after the other in quick succession .
two savages fell , and one , who was in the act of thrusting a spear into peters , sprung to his feet without accomplishing his purpose .
my companion being thus released , we had no further difficulty .
he had his pistols also , but <unk> declined using them , confiding in his great personal strength , which far exceeded that of any person i have ever known .
seizing a club from one of the savages who had fallen , he dashed out the brains of the three who remained , killing each instantaneously with a single blow of the weapon , and leaving us completely masters of the field .
so rapidly bad these events passed , that we could scarcely believe in their reality , and were standing over the bodies of the dead in a species of stupid contemplation , when we were brought to recollection by the sound of shouts in the distance .
it was clear that the savages had been alarmed by the firing , and that we had little chance of avoiding discovery .
to regain the <name> , it would be necessary to proceed in the direction of the shouts , and even should we succeed in arriving at its base , we should never be able to ascend it without being seen .
our situation was one of the greatest peril , and we were hesitating in which path to commence a flight , when one of the savages whom i had shot , and supposed dead , sprang briskly to his feet , and attempted to make his escape .
we overtook him , however , before he had advanced many paces , and were about to put him to death , when peters suggested that we might derive some benefit from forcing him to accompany us in our attempt to escape .
we therefore dragged him with us , making him understand that we would shoot him if he offered resistance .
in a few minutes he was perfectly submissive , and ran by our sides as we pushed in among the rocks , making for the seashore .
so far , the irregularities of the ground we had been traversing hid the sea , except at intervals , from our sight , and , when we first had it fairly in view , it was perhaps two hundred yards distant .
as we emerged into the open beach we saw , to our great dismay , an immense crowd of the natives pouring from the village , and from all visible quarters of the island , making toward us with gesticulations of extreme fury , and howling like wild beasts .
we were upon the point of turning upon our steps , and trying to secure a retreat among the fastnesses of the rougher ground , when i discovered the bows of two canoes projecting from behind a large rock which ran out into the water .
toward these we now ran with all speed , and , reaching them , found them unguarded , and without any other freight than three of the large <unk> turtles and the usual supply of paddles for sixty rowers .
we instantly took possession of one of them , and , forcing our captive on board , pushed out to sea with all the strength we could command .
we had not made , however , more than fifty yards from the shore before we became sufficiently calm to perceive the great oversight of which we had been guilty in leaving the other canoe in the power of the savages , who , by this time , were not more than twice as far from the beach as ourselves , and were rapidly advancing to the pursuit .
no time was now to be lost .
our <name> was , at best , a forlorn one , but we had none other .
it was very doubtful whether , with the utmost exertion , we could get back in time to anticipate them in taking possession of the canoe ; but yet there was a chance that we could .
we might save ourselves if we succeeded , while not to make the attempt was to resign ourselves to inevitable butchery .
the canoe was modelled with the bow and stern alike , and , in place of turning it around , we merely changed our position in paddling .
as soon as the savages perceived this they redoubled their yells , as well as their speed , and approached with inconceivable rapidity .
we pulled , however , with all the energy of desperation , and arrived at the <unk> point before more than one of the natives had attained it .
this man paid dearly for his superior agility , peters shooting him through the head with a pistol as he approached the shore .
the foremost among the rest of his party were probably some twenty or thirty paces distant as we seized upon the canoe .
we at first endeavored to pull her into the deep water , beyond the reach of the savages , but , finding her too firmly aground , and there being no time to spare , peters , with one or two heavy strokes from the butt of the musket , succeeded in dashing out a large portion of the bow and of one side .
we then pushed off .
two of the natives by this time had got hold of our boat , obstinately refusing to let go , until we were forced to despatch them with our knives .
we were now clear off , and making great way out to sea .
the main body of the savages , upon reaching the broken canoe , set up the most tremendous yell of rage and disappointment conceivable .
in truth , from everything i could see of these wretches , they appeared to be the most wicked , hypocritical , vindictive , bloodthirsty , and altogether fiendish race of men upon the face of the globe .
it is clear we should have had no <name> had we fallen into their hands .
they made a mad attempt at following us in the fractured canoe , but , finding it useless , again <unk> their rage in a series of hideous <unk> , and rushed up into the hills .
we were thus relieved from immediate danger , but our situation was still sufficiently gloomy .
we knew that four canoes of the kind we had were at one time in the possession of the savages , and were not aware of the fact ( afterward ascertained from our captive ) that two of these had been blown to pieces in the explosion of the <name> <name> .
we calculated , therefore , upon being yet pursued , as soon as our enemies could get round to the bay ( distant about three miles ) where the boats were usually laid up .
fearing this , we made every exertion to leave the island behind us , and went rapidly through the water , forcing the prisoner to take a paddle .
in about half an hour , when we had gained probably five or six miles to the southward , a large fleet of the flat-bottomed canoes or rafts were seen to emerge from the bay evidently with the design of pursuit .
presently they put back , despairing to overtake us .
chapter 25 we now found ourselves in the wide and desolate antarctic ocean , in a latitude exceeding eighty-four degrees , in a frail canoe , and with no provision but the three turtles .
the long polar <name> , too , could not be considered as far distant , and it became necessary that we should deliberate well upon the course to be pursued .
there were six or seven islands in sight belonging to the same group , and distant from each other about five or six leagues ; but upon neither of these had we any intention to venture .
in coming from the northward in the <name> <name> we had been gradually leaving behind us the severest regions of <unk> , however little it maybe in accordance with the generally received notions respecting the antarctic , was a fact  experience would not permit us to deny .
to attempt , therefore , getting back would be folly  especially at so late a period of the season .
only one course seemed to be left open for <name> .
we resolved to steer boldly to the southward , where there was at least a probability of discovering other lands , and more than a probability of finding a still milder climate .
so far we had found the antarctic , like the arctic ocean , peculiarly free from violent storms or <unk> rough water ; but our canoe was , at best , of frail structure , although large , and we set busily to work with a view of rendering her as safe as the limited means in our possession would admit .
the body of the boat was of no better material than bark  the bark of a tree unknown .
the ribs were of a tough <unk> , well adapted to the purpose for which it was used .
we had fifty feet room from stem to stern , from four to six in breadth , and in depth throughout four feet and a <unk> boats thus differing vastly in shape from those of any other inhabitants of the southern ocean with whom civilized nations are acquainted .
we never did believe them the workmanship of the ignorant islanders who owned them ; and some days after this period discovered , by questioning our captive , that they were in fact made by the natives of a group to the southwest of the country where we found them , having fallen accidentally into the hands of our barbarians .
what we could do for the security of our boat was very little indeed .
several wide rents were discovered near both ends , and these we contrived to patch up with pieces of woollen jacket .
with the help of the superfluous paddles , of which there were a great many , we erected a kind of framework about the bow , so as to break the force of any seas which might threaten to fill us in that quarter .
we also set up two <unk> for masts , placing them opposite each other , one by each gunwale , thus saving the necessity of a yard .
to these masts we attached a sail made of our <unk> this with some difficulty , as here we could get no assistance from our prisoner whatever , although he bad been willing enough to labor in all the other operations .
the sight of the linen seemed to affect him in a very singular manner .
he could not be prevailed upon to touch it or go near it , shuddering when we attempted to force him , and shrieking out ,  " <unk> !
"  having completed our arrangements in regard to the security of the canoe , we now set sail to the <unk> for the present , with the view of <unk> the most southerly of the group in sight .
this being done , we turned the bow full to the southward .
the weather could by no means be considered disagreeable .
we had a prevailing and very gentle wind from the northward , a smooth sea , and continual daylight .
no ice whatever was to be seen ; nor did i ever see one particle of this after leaving the parallel of <unk> 's islet .
indeed , the temperature of the water was here far too warm for its existence in any quantity .
having killed the largest of our tortoises , and obtained from him not only food but a copious supply of water , we continued on our course , without any incident of moment , for perhaps seven or eight days , during which period we must have proceeded a vast distance to the southward , as the wind blew constantly with us , and a very strong current set continually in the direction we were pursuing .
march 1st .
{ <unk> } many unusual phenomena now  indicated that we were entering upon a region of novelty and wonder .
a high range of light gray vapor appeared constantly in the southern horizon , flaring up occasionally in lofty streaks , now darting from east to west , now from west to east , and again presenting a level and uniform <unk> short , having all the wild variations of the <name> borealis .
the average height of this vapor , as apparent from our station , was about twenty-five degrees .
the temperature of the sea seemed to be increasing momentarily , and there was a very perceptible alteration in its color .
march <unk> by repeated questioning of our captive , we came to the knowledge of many particulars in regard to the island of the massacre , its inhabitants , and <unk> with these how can i now detain the reader ?
i may say , however , that we learned there were eight islands in the <unk> they were governed by a common king , named <unk> or <unk> , who resided in one of the smallest of the islands ; that the black skins forming the dress of the warriors came from an animal of huge size to be found only in a valley near the court of the <unk> the inhabitants of the group <unk> no other boats than the flat-bottomed rafts ; the four canoes being all of the kind in their possession , and , these having been obtained , by mere accident , from some large island in the <unk> his own name was <unk> he had no knowledge of <unk> 's <unk> that the appellation of the island he had left was <unk> .
the commencement of the words <unk> and <unk> was given with a prolonged hissing sound , which 'we found it impossible to imitate , even after repeated endeavors , and which was precisely the same with the note of the black <unk> we had eaten up on the summit of the hill .
march <unk> heat of the water was now truly remarkable , and in color was undergoing a rapid change , being no longer transparent , but of a milky consistency and <name> .
in our immediate vicinity it was usually smooth , never so rough as to endanger the <unk> we were frequently surprised at perceiving , to our right and left , at different distances , sudden and extensive agitations of the surface ; these , we at length noticed , were always preceded by wild <unk> in the region of vapor to the southward .
march <unk> , with the view of widening our sail , the breeze from the northward dying away perceptibly , i took from my <unk> a white handkerchief .
<unk> was seated at my elbow , and the linen accidentally flaring in his face , he became violently affected with convulsions .
these were succeeded by drowsiness and stupor , and low <unk> of  " <unk> !
<unk> !
"  march <unk> wind had entirely ceased , but it was evident that we were still hurrying on to the southward , under the influence of a powerful current .
and now ,  indeed , it would seem reasonable that we should experience some alarm at the turn events were <unk> we felt none .
the countenance of peters indicated nothing of this nature , although it wore at times an expression i could not fathom .
the polar <name> appeared to be coming on  but coming without its terrors .
i felt a <unk> of body and mind  a <unk> of sensation but this was all .
march <unk> gray vapor had now arisen many more degrees above the horizon , and was gradually losing its <unk> of tint .
the heat of the water was extreme , even unpleasant to the touch , and its milky <name> was more evident than ever .
today a violent agitation of the water occurred very close to the canoe .
it was attended , as usual , with a wild flaring up of the vapor at its summit , and a momentary division at its base .
a fine white powder , resembling <unk> certainly not <unk> over the canoe and over a large surface of the water , as the flickering died away among the vapor and the commotion subsided in the sea .
<unk> now threw himself on his face in the bottom of the boat , and no persuasions could induce him to arise .
march <unk> day we questioned <unk> concerning the motives of his countrymen in destroying our companions ; but he appeared to be too utterly overcome by terror to afford us any rational reply .
he still obstinately lay in the bottom of the boat ; and , upon <unk> the questions as to the motive , made use only of idiotic gesticulations , such as raising with his forefinger the upper lip , and displaying the teeth which lay beneath it .
these were black .
we had never before seen the teeth of an inhabitant of <unk> .
march <unk> there floated by us one of the white animals whose appearance upon the beach at <unk> had occasioned so wild a commotion among the savages .
i would have picked it up , but there came over me a sudden <unk> , and i forbore .
the heat of the water still increased , and the hand could no longer be endured within it .
peters spoke little , and i knew not what to think of his apathy .
<unk> breathed , and no more .
march <unk> whole ashy material fell now continually around us , and in vast quantities .
the range of vapor to the southward had arisen prodigiously in the horizon , and began to assume more distinctness of form .
i can <unk> it to nothing but a limitless cataract , rolling silently into the sea from some immense and <unk> rampart in the heaven .
the gigantic curtain ranged along the whole extent of the southern horizon .
it emitted no sound .
march <unk> sullen darkness now hovered above <unk> from out the milky depths of the ocean a luminous glare arose , and stole up along the bulwarks of the boat .
we were nearly overwhelmed by the white ashy shower which settled upon us and upon the canoe , but melted into the water as it fell .
the summit of the cataract was utterly lost in the dimness and the distance .
yet we were evidently approaching it with a hideous velocity .
at intervals there were visible in it wide , yawning , but momentary rents , and from out these rents , within which was a chaos of flitting and indistinct images , there came rushing and mighty , but <unk> winds , tearing up the <unk> ocean in their course .
march <unk> darkness had materially increased , relieved only by the glare of the water thrown back from the white curtain before us .
many gigantic and <unk> white birds flew continuously now from beyond the veil , and their scream was the eternal <unk> !
as they retreated from our vision .
hereupon <unk> stirred in the bottom of the boat ; but upon touching him we found his spirit departed .
and now we rushed into the embraces of the cataract , where a chasm threw itself open to receive us .
but there arose in our pathway a shrouded human figure , very far larger in its proportions than any <unk> among men .
and the <name> of the skin of the figure was of the perfect whiteness of the snow .
note the circumstances connected with the late sudden and distressing death of mr. <unk> are already well known to the public through the medium of the daily press .
it is feared that the few remaining chapters which were to have completed his narrative , and which were retained by him , while the above were in type , for the purpose of revision , have been <unk> lost through the accident by which he perished himself .
this , however , may prove not to be the case , and the papers , if ultimately found , <name> be given to the public .
no means have been left untried to remedy the deficiency .
the gentleman whose name is mentioned in the preface , and who , from the statement there made , might be supposed able to fill the vacuum , has declined the <unk> , for satisfactory reasons connected with the general <unk> of the details afforded him , and his disbelief in the entire truth of the latter portions of the narration .
peters , from whom some information might be expected , is still alive , and a resident of illinois , but can not be met with at present .
he may hereafter be found , and <name> , no doubt , afford material for a conclusion of mr. <unk> account .
the loss of two or three final chapters ( for there were but two or three ) is the more deeply to be regretted , as it can not be doubted they contained matter relative to the pole itself , or at least to regions in its very near proximity ; and as , too , the statements of the author in relation to these regions may shortly be verified or contradicted by means of the governmental expedition now preparing for the southern ocean .
on one point in the narrative some remarks may well be offered ; and it would afford the writer of this appendix much pleasure if what he may here observe should have a tendency to throw credit , in any degree , upon the very singular pages now published .
we allude to the chasms found in the island of <unk> , and to the whole of the figures upon pages <unk> { of the printed edition  <name> . } .
( note : no figures were included with this text ) mr. <unk> has given the figures of the chasms without comment , and speaks decidedly of the <unk> found at the extremity of the most easterly of these chasms as having but a fanciful resemblance to <unk> characters , and , in short , as being positively not such .
this assertion is made in a manner so simple , and sustained by a species of demonstration so conclusive ( viz. , the fitting of the projections of the fragments found among the dust into the <unk> upon the wall ) , that we are forced to believe the writer in <name> ; and no reasonable reader should suppose otherwise .
but as the facts in relation to all the figures are most singular ( especially when taken in connection with statements made in the body of the narrative ) , it may be as well to say a word or two concerning them <unk> , too , the more especially as the facts in question have , beyond doubt , escaped the attention of mr. poe .
figure 1 , then , figure 2 , figure 3 , and figure 5 , when conjoined with one another in the precise order which the chasms themselves presented , and when deprived of the small lateral branches or arches ( which , it <name> be remembered , served only as a means of communication between the main chambers , and were of totally distinct character ) , constitute an ethiopian verbal <unk> root " to be shady , '  whence all the <unk> of shadow or darkness .
in regard to the " left or most <unk> " of the <unk> in figure 4 , it is more than probable that the opinion of peters was correct , and that the <unk> appearance was really the work of <name> , and intended as the representation of a human form .
the <unk> is before the reader , and he may , or may not , perceive the resemblance suggested ; but the rest of the <unk> afford strong confirmation of peters ' idea .
the upper range is evidently the arabic verbal root " to be white , " whence all the <unk> of brilliancy and whiteness .
the lower range is not so immediately <unk> .
the characters are somewhat broken and disjointed ; nevertheless , it can not be doubted that , in their perfect state , they formed the full egyptian word .
" the region of the south . '
it should be observed that these interpretations confirm the opinion of peters in regard to the " most <unk> " of the figures .
the arm is outstretched toward the south .
conclusions such as these open a wide field for speculation and exciting conjecture .
they should be regarded , perhaps , in connection with some of the most faintly detailed incidents of the narrative ; although in no visible manner is this chain of connection complete .
<unk> !
was the cry of the <unk> natives of <unk> upon discovering the <unk> of the white animal picked up at sea .
this also was the shuddering <unk> of <unk> upon discovering the carcass of the white materials in possession of mr. <unk> .
this also was the shriek of the <unk> , white , and gigantic birds which issued from the <unk> white curtain of the south .
nothing white was to be found at <unk> , and nothing otherwise in the subsequent voyage to the region beyond .
it is not impossible that " <unk> , " the appellation of the island of the chasms , may be found , upon minute <unk> scrutiny , to betray either some alliance with the chasms themselves , or some reference to the ethiopian characters so mysteriously written in their windings .
 " i have graven it within the hills , and my vengeance upon the dust within the rock .
"  notes { *1 } whaling vessels are usually fitted with iron <unk>  why the grampus was not i have never been able to ascertain .
{ <unk> } the case of the brig <name> , of boston , is one so much in point , and her fate , in many respects , so remarkably similar to our own , that i can not forbear alluding to it here .
this vessel , of one hundred and thirty tons burden , sailed from boston , with a cargo of lumber and provisions , for <name> <unk> , on the twelfth of december , 1811 , under the command of captain <unk> .
there were eight souls on board besides the captain  the mate , four seamen , and the cook , together with a mr. hunt , and a negro girl belonging to him .
on the fifteenth , having cleared the shoal of <unk> , she sprung a leak in a <name> of wind from the southeast , and was finally <unk> ; but , the masts going by the board , she afterward righted .
they remained in this situation , without fire , and with very little provision , for the period of one hundred and <unk> days ( from december the fifteenth to <name> the twentieth ) , when captain <unk> and <name> badger , the only survivors , were taken off the wreck by the fame , of hull , captain <unk> , bound home from rio janeiro .
when picked up , they were in latitude 28 degrees n. , longitude 13 degrees w. , having drifted above two thousand miles !
on the ninth of july the fame fell in with the brig <unk> , captain perkins , who landed the two sufferers in <unk> .
the narrative from which we gather these details ends in the following words : " it is natural to inquire how they could float such a vast distance , upon the most frequented part of the atlantic , and not be discovered all this time .
they were passed by more than a dozen sail , one of which came so nigh them that they could distinctly see the people on deck and on the rigging looking at them ; but , to the inexpressible disappointment of the starving and freezing men , they stifled the dictates of compassion , hoisted sail , and cruelly abandoned them to their fate . "
{ <unk> } among the vessels which at various times have professed to meet with the <unk> may be mentioned the ship san <name> , in <unk> ; the ship <name> , in <unk> ; the brig <name> , in <unk> ; and the ship <name> , in <unk> .
they all agree in giving the mean latitude fifty-three degrees south .
{ <unk> } the terms morning and evening , which i have made use of to avoid confusion in my narrative , as far as possible , must not , of course , be taken in their ordinary sense .
for a long time past we had had no night at all , the daylight being continual .
the dates throughout are according to nautical time , and the bearing must be understood as per compass .
i would also remark , in this place , that i can not , in the first portion of what is here written , pretend to strict accuracy in respect to dates , or latitudes and <unk> , having kept no regular journal until after the period of which this first portion treats .
in many instances i have relied altogether upon memory .
{ <unk> } this day was rendered remarkable by our observing in the south several huge wreaths of the <unk> vapour i have spoken of .
{ <unk> } the marl was also black ; indeed , we noticed no light colored substances of any kind upon the island .
{ <unk> } for obvious reasons i can not pretend to strict accuracy in these dates .
they are given principally with a view to <unk> of narrative , and as set down in my pencil <unk> ligeia and the <name> therein lieth , which <unk> not .
who knoweth the mysteries of the <name> , with its vigor ?
for god is but a great <name> pervading all things by nature of its <unk> .
man doth not yield himself to the angels , nor unto death utterly , save only through the weakness of his feeble <unk>  <name> <unk> .
i can not , for my soul , remember how , when , or even precisely where , i first became acquainted with the <name> ligeia .
long years have since elapsed , and my memory is feeble through much suffering .
or , perhaps , i can not now bring these points to mind , because , in truth , the character of my beloved , her rare learning , her singular yet placid cast of beauty , and the thrilling and <unk> eloquence of her low musical language , made their way into my heart by paces so steadily and stealthily progressive that they have been unnoticed and unknown .
yet i believe that i met her first and most frequently in some large , old , decaying city near the rhine .
of her family  i have surely heard her speak .
that it is of a remotely ancient date can not be doubted .
ligeia !
ligeia !
in studies of a nature more than all else adapted to <unk> impressions of the outward world , it is by that sweet word alone  by ligeia  that i bring before mine eyes in fancy the image of her who is no more .
and now , while i write , a recollection flashes upon me that i have never known the paternal name of her who was my friend and my betrothed , and who became the partner of my studies , and finally the wife of my bosom .
was it a playful charge on the part of my ligeia ?
or was it a test of my strength of affection , that i should institute no inquiries upon this point ?
or was it rather a <name> of my own  a wildly romantic offering on the shrine of the most passionate devotion ?
i but indistinctly recall the fact itself  what wonder that i have utterly forgotten the circumstances which originated or attended it ?
and , indeed , if ever she , the <name> and the <unk> <unk> of idolatrous egypt , presided , as they tell , over marriages <unk> , then most surely she presided over mine .
there is one dear topic , however , on which my memory falls me not .
it is the person of ligeia .
in stature she was tall , somewhat slender , and , in her latter days , even emaciated .
i would in vain attempt to portray the majesty , the quiet ease , of her demeanor , or the incomprehensible lightness and elasticity of her footfall .
she came and departed as a shadow .
i was never made aware of her entrance into my closed study save by the dear music of her low sweet voice , as she placed her marble hand upon my shoulder .
in beauty of face no maiden ever equalled her .
it was the radiance of an <unk>  an airy and <unk> vision more wildly divine than the <unk> which hovered vision about the slumbering souls of the daughters of <unk> .
yet her features were not of that regular mould which we have been falsely taught to worship in the classical labors of the heathen .
" there is no exquisite beauty , " says bacon , lord <unk> , speaking truly of all the forms and genera of beauty , " without some strangeness in the proportion . "
yet , although i saw that the features of ligeia were not of a classic regularity  although i perceived that her loveliness was indeed " exquisite , " and felt that there was much of " strangeness " pervading it , yet i have tried in vain to detect the irregularity and to trace home my own perception of " the strange . "
i examined the contour of the lofty and pale forehead  it was faultless  how cold indeed that word when applied to a majesty so divine !  the skin <unk> the purest <name> , the commanding extent and repose , the gentle prominence of the regions above the temples ; and then the <unk> , the glossy , the luxuriant and <unk> tresses , setting forth the full force of the <unk> epithet , " <unk> ! "
i looked at the delicate outlines of the nose  and nowhere but in the graceful <unk> of the <unk> had i beheld a similar perfection .
there were the same luxurious smoothness of surface , the same scarcely perceptible tendency to the <unk> , the same harmoniously curved nostrils speaking the free spirit .
i regarded the sweet mouth .
here was indeed the triumph of all things heavenly  the magnificent turn of the short upper lip  the soft , voluptuous slumber of the under  the <unk> which <unk> , and the color which spoke  the teeth glancing back , with a brilliancy almost startling , every <name> of the holy light which fell upon them in her serene and placid , yet most <unk> radiant of all smiles .
i scrutinized the formation of the <name>  and here , too , i found the gentleness of breadth , the softness and the majesty , the fullness and the <unk> , of the greek  the contour which the god apollo revealed but in a dream , to <unk> , the son of the athenian .
and then i peered into the large eyes of ligeia .
for eyes we have no models in the remotely antique .
it might have been , too , that in these eyes of my beloved lay the secret to which lord <unk> alludes .
they were , i must believe , far larger than the ordinary eyes of our own race .
they were even fuller than the fullest of the <unk> eyes of the tribe of the valley of <unk> .
yet it was only at intervals  in moments of intense excitement  that this peculiarity became more than slightly noticeable in ligeia .
and at such moments was her beauty  in my heated fancy thus it appeared perhaps  the beauty of beings either above or apart from the earth  the beauty of the fabulous <unk> of the turk .
the <name> of the orbs was the most brilliant of black , and , far over them , <name> <unk> lashes of great length .
the brows , slightly irregular in outline , had the same tint .
the " strangeness , " however , which i found in the eyes , was of a nature distinct from the formation , or the color , or the brilliancy of the features , and must , after all , be referred to the expression .
ah , word of no meaning !
behind whose vast latitude of mere sound we <unk> our ignorance of so much of the spiritual .
the expression of the eyes of ligeia !
how for long hours have i pondered upon it !
how have i , through the whole of a midsummer night , struggled to fathom it !
what was it  that something more profound than the well of <unk>  which lay far within the pupils of my beloved ?
what was it ?
i was possessed with a passion to discover .
those eyes !
those large , those shining , those divine orbs !
they became to me twin stars of <name> , and i to them <unk> of <unk> .
there is no point , among the many incomprehensible anomalies of the science of mind , more <unk> exciting than the fact  never , i believe , noticed in the schools  that , in our endeavors to recall to memory something long forgotten , we often find ourselves upon the very verge of remembrance , without being able , in the end , to remember .
and thus how frequently , in my intense scrutiny of ligeia 's eyes , have i felt approaching the full knowledge of their expression  felt it approaching  yet not quite be mine  and so at length entirely depart !
and ( strange , oh strangest mystery of all ! )
i found , in the commonest objects of the universe , a circle of analogies to that expression .
i mean to say that , subsequently to the period when ligeia 's beauty passed into my spirit , there dwelling as in a shrine , i derived , from many existences in the material world , a sentiment such as i felt always aroused within me by her large and luminous orbs .
yet not the more could i define that sentiment , or analyze , or even steadily view it .
i recognized it , let me repeat , sometimes in the survey of a <unk> vine  in the contemplation of a moth , a butterfly , a chrysalis , a stream of running water .
i have felt it in the ocean ; in the falling of a meteor .
i have felt it in the glances of unusually aged people .
and there are one or two stars in heaven  ( one especially , a <name> of the sixth magnitude , double and <unk> , to be found near the large <name> in <unk> ) in a <unk> scrutiny of which i have been made aware of the feeling .
i have been filled with it by certain sounds from <unk> instruments , and not unfrequently by passages from books .
among innumerable other instances , i well remember something in a volume of <name> <unk> , which ( perhaps merely from its <unk>  who shall say ? )
never failed to inspire me with the sentiment ;  " and the <name> therein lieth , which <unk> not .
who knoweth the mysteries of the <name> , with its vigor ?
for god is but a great <name> pervading all things by nature of its <unk> .
man doth not yield him to the angels , nor unto death utterly , save only through the weakness of his feeble <name> . "
length of years , and subsequent reflection , have enabled me to trace , indeed , some remote connection between this passage in the english <unk> and a portion of the character of ligeia .
an intensity in thought , action , or speech , was possibly , in her , a result , or at least an index , of that gigantic volition which , during our long intercourse , failed to give other and more immediate evidence of its existence .
of all the women whom i have ever known , she , the outwardly calm , the <unk> ligeia , was the most violently a prey to the tumultuous vultures of stern passion .
and of such passion i could form no estimate , save by the miraculous expansion of those eyes which at once so delighted and appalled me  by the almost magical <name> , <unk> , distinctness and <unk> of her very low voice  and by the fierce energy ( rendered doubly effective by contrast with her manner of utterance ) of the wild words which she habitually uttered .
i have spoken of the learning of ligeia : it was immense  such as i have never known in woman .
in the classical tongues was she deeply <unk> , and as far as my own acquaintance extended in regard to the modern dialects of europe , i have never known her at fault .
indeed upon any theme of the most admired , because simply the most abstruse of the boasted erudition of the academy , have i ever found ligeia at fault ?
how singularly  how <unk> , this one point in the nature of my wife has forced itself , at this late period only , upon my attention !
i said her knowledge was such as i have never known in woman  but where breathes the man who has traversed , and successfully , all the wide areas of moral , physical , and mathematical science ?
i saw not then what i now clearly perceive , that the <unk> of ligeia were gigantic , were astounding ; yet i was sufficiently aware of her infinite supremacy to resign myself , with a <unk> confidence , to her guidance through the chaotic world of metaphysical investigation at which i was most busily occupied during the earlier years of our marriage .
with how vast a triumph  with how vivid a delight  with how much of all that is ethereal in <name>  did i feel , as she bent over me in studies but little sought  but less known  that delicious vista by slow degrees expanding before me , down whose long , gorgeous , and all <unk> path , i might at length pass onward to the goal of a wisdom too divinely precious not to be forbidden !
how poignant , then , must have been the grief with which , after some years , i beheld my <unk> expectations take wings to themselves and fly away !
without ligeia i was but as a child groping benighted .
her presence , her readings alone , rendered vividly luminous the many mysteries of the <unk> in which we were immersed .
wanting the radiant lustre of her eyes , letters , <unk> and golden , grew duller than <unk> lead .
and now those eyes shone less and less frequently upon the pages over which i <unk> .
ligeia grew ill .
the wild eyes blazed with a too  too glorious <unk> ; the pale fingers became of the transparent waxen <name> of the grave , and the blue veins upon the lofty forehead swelled and sank impetuously with the tides of the gentle emotion .
i saw that she must die  and i struggled desperately in spirit with the grim <unk> .
and the struggles of the passionate wife were , to my astonishment , even more energetic than my own .
there had been much in her stern nature to impress me with the belief that , to her , death would have come without its terrors ;  but not so .
words are impotent to convey any just idea of the fierceness of resistance with which she wrestled with the shadow .
i groaned in anguish at the pitiable spectacle .
i would have soothed  i would have reasoned ; but , in the intensity of her wild <name> for life ,  for life  but for life  solace and reason were the uttermost folly .
yet not until the last instance , amid the most convulsive <unk> of her fierce spirit , was shaken the external <unk> of her demeanor .
her voice grew more gentle  grew more low  yet i would not wish to dwell upon the wild meaning of the quietly uttered words .
my <name> reeled as i <unk> entranced , to a <name> more than mortal  to assumptions and aspirations which mortality had never before known .
that she loved me i should not have doubted ; and i might have been easily aware that , in a bosom such as hers , love would have reigned no ordinary passion .
but in death only , was i fully impressed with the strength of her affection .
for long hours , <unk> my hand , would she pour out before me the overflowing of a heart whose more than passionate devotion amounted to idolatry .
how had i deserved to be so blessed by such confessions ?  how had i deserved to be so cursed with the removal of my beloved in the hour of her making them , but upon this subject i can not bear to <unk> .
let me say only , that in ligeia 's more than womanly abandonment to a love , alas !
all <unk> , all <unk> bestowed , i at length recognized the principle of her longing with so wildly <name> a <name> for the life which was now fleeing so rapidly away .
it is this wild longing  it is this eager vehemence of <name> for life  but for life  that i have no power to portray  no utterance capable of expressing .
at high noon of the night in which she departed , beckoning me , peremptorily , to her side , she bade me repeat certain verses composed by herself not many days before .
i obeyed her.  they were these : lo !
't is a <name> night within the lonesome latter years !
an <name> throng , <unk> , <unk> in veils , and drowned in tears , sit in a theatre , to see a play of hopes and fears , while the orchestra breathes fitfully the music of the spheres .
<unk> , in the form of god on high , mutter and mumble low , and hither and thither fly ; mere <unk> they , who come and go at bidding of vast formless things that shift the scenery to and fro , flapping from out their condor wings invisible wo !
that motley drama !  oh , be sure it shall not be forgot !
with its phantom chased forever more , by a crowd that seize it not , through a circle that ever <unk> in to the self-same spot , and much of madness and more of sin and horror the soul of the plot .
but see , amid the mimic rout , a crawling shape intrude !
a blood-red thing that <unk> from out the <unk> solitude !
it <unk> !  it <unk> !  with mortal pangs the <unk> become its food , and the <unk> sob at vermin fangs in human gore imbued .
out  out are the lights  out all !
and over each quivering form , the curtain , a funeral pall , comes down with the rush of a storm , and the angels , all pallid and <name> , uprising , <unk> , affirm that the play is the tragedy , " man , " and its hero the conqueror worm .
" o god ! "
half shrieked ligeia , leaping to her feet and extending her arms aloft with a spasmodic movement , as i made an end of these lines  " o god !
o divine father !  shall these things be <unk> so ?  shall this conqueror be not once conquered ?
are we not part and parcel in thee ?
who  who knoweth the mysteries of the <name> with its vigor ?
man doth not yield him to the angels , nor unto death utterly , save only through the weakness of his feeble <name> . "
and now , as if exhausted with emotion , she suffered her white arms to fall , and returned solemnly to her bed of death .
and as she breathed her last sighs , there came mingled with them a low murmur from her lips .
i bent to them my ear and distinguished , again , the concluding words of the passage in <unk>  " man doth not yield him to the angels , nor unto death utterly , save only through the weakness of his feeble <name> . "
she died ;  and i , crushed into the very dust with sorrow , could no longer endure the lonely desolation of my dwelling in the dim and decaying city by the rhine .
i had no lack of what the world calls wealth .
ligeia had brought me far more , very far more than ordinarily falls to the lot of mortals .
after a few months , therefore , of weary and aimless wandering , i purchased , and put in some repair , an <name> , which i shall not name , in one of the wildest and least frequented portions of fair england .
the gloomy and dreary grandeur of the building , the almost savage aspect of the domain , the many melancholy and <unk> memories connected with both , had much in unison with the feelings of utter abandonment which had driven me into that remote and <unk> region of the country .
yet although the external <name> , with its verdant decay hanging about it , suffered but little alteration , i gave way , with a <unk> perversity , and perchance with a faint <name> of <unk> my sorrows , to a display of more than regal magnificence <unk>  for such follies , even in childhood , i had imbibed a taste and now they came back to me as if in the <unk> of grief .
alas , i feel how much even of incipient madness might have been discovered in the gorgeous and fantastic draperies , in the solemn carvings of egypt , in the wild cornices and furniture , in the bedlam patterns of the carpets of tufted gold !
i had become a <unk> slave in the <unk> of opium , and my labors and my orders had taken a coloring from my dreams .
but these absurdities must not pause to detail .
let me speak only of that one chamber , ever accursed , whither in a moment of mental <unk> , i led from the altar as my bride  as the successor of the <unk> ligeia  the <unk> and blue-eyed <name> <name> <unk> , of <unk> .
there is no individual portion of the architecture and decoration of that bridal chamber which is not now visibly before me .
where were the souls of the haughty family of the bride , when , through thirst of gold , they permitted to pass the threshold of an apartment so <unk> , a maiden and a daughter so beloved ?
i have said that i minutely remember the details of the chamber  yet i am sadly forgetful on topics of deep moment  and here there was no system , no keeping , in the fantastic display , to take hold upon the memory .
the room lay in a high turret of the <unk> <name> , was <unk> in shape , and of capacious size .
occupying the whole southern face of the <unk> was the sole window  an immense sheet of unbroken glass from <name>  a single pane , and tinted of a leaden <name> , so that the rays of either the sun or moon , passing through it , fell with a ghastly lustre on the objects within .
over the upper portion of this huge window , extended the <unk> of an aged vine , which clambered up the massy walls of the turret .
the ceiling , of <unk> oak , was excessively lofty , vaulted , and elaborately fretted with the wildest and most grotesque specimens of a <unk> , <unk> device .
from out the most central recess of this melancholy <unk> , depended , by a single chain of gold with long links , a huge censer of the same metal , <unk> in pattern , and with many <unk> so contrived that there writhed in and out of them , as if <unk> with a serpent vitality , a continual succession of <unk> fires .
some few <unk> and golden <unk> , of eastern figure , were in various stations about  and there was the couch , too  bridal couch  of an indian model , and low , and sculptured of solid <name> , with a <unk> canopy above .
in each of the angles of the chamber stood on end a gigantic sarcophagus of black granite , from the tombs of the kings over against <unk> , with their aged lids full of immemorial sculpture .
but in the <unk> of the apartment lay , alas !
the chief <unk> of all .
the lofty walls , gigantic in height  even <unk> so  were <name> from summit to foot , in vast folds , with a heavy and <unk> tapestry  tapestry of a material which was found alike as a carpet on the floor , as a covering for the <unk> and the <name> bed , as a canopy for the bed , and as the gorgeous <unk> of the curtains which partially shaded the window .
the material was the richest cloth of gold .
it was spotted all over , at irregular intervals , with <unk> figures , about a foot in diameter , and wrought upon the cloth in patterns of the most <unk> black .
but these figures partook of the true character of the <unk> only when regarded from a single point of view .
by a contrivance now common , and indeed traceable to a very remote period of antiquity , they were made <unk> in aspect .
to one entering the room , they bore the appearance of simple monstrosities ; but upon a farther advance , this appearance gradually departed ; and step by step , as the visitor moved his station in the chamber , he saw himself surrounded by an endless succession of the ghastly forms which belong to the superstition of the <name> , or arise in the guilty slumbers of the monk .
the <unk> effect was vastly heightened by the artificial introduction of a strong continual current of wind behind the draperies  giving a hideous and uneasy animation to the whole .
in halls such as these  in a bridal chamber such as this  i passed , with the <name> of <unk> , the <unk> hours of the first month of our marriage  passed them with but little <unk> .
that my wife dreaded the fierce <unk> of my temper  that she shunned me and loved me but little  i could not help perceiving ; but it gave me rather pleasure than otherwise .
i loathed her with a hatred belonging more to demon than to man .
my memory flew back , ( oh , with what intensity of regret ! )
to ligeia , the beloved , the <name> , the beautiful , the entombed .
i revelled in recollections of her purity , of her wisdom , of her lofty , her ethereal nature , of her passionate , her idolatrous love .
now , then , did my spirit fully and freely burn with more than all the fires of her own .
in the excitement of my opium dreams ( for i was habitually fettered in the shackles of the drug ) i would call aloud upon her name , during the silence of the night , or among the sheltered recesses of the glens by day , as if , through the wild eagerness , the solemn passion , the consuming ardor of my longing for the departed , i could restore her to the pathway she had abandoned  ah , could it be forever ?  upon the earth .
about the commencement of the second month of the marriage , the <name> <name> was attacked with sudden illness , from which her recovery was slow .
the fever which consumed her rendered her nights uneasy ; and in her <unk> state of <unk> , she spoke of sounds , and of motions , in and about the chamber of the turret , which i concluded had no origin save in the distemper of her fancy , or perhaps in the <unk> influences of the chamber itself .
she became at length convalescent  finally well .
yet but a brief period elapsed , ere a second more violent disorder again threw her upon a bed of suffering ; and from this attack her frame , at all times feeble , never altogether recovered .
her <unk> were , after this epoch , of alarming character , and of more alarming recurrence , defying alike the knowledge and the great exertions of her physicians .
with the increase of the chronic disease which had thus , apparently , taken too sure hold upon her constitution to be <unk> by human means , i could not fall to observe a similar increase in the nervous irritation of her temperament , and in her <unk> by trivial causes of fear .
she spoke again , and now more frequently and pertinaciously , of the sounds  of the slight sounds  and of the unusual motions among the tapestries , to which she had formerly alluded .
one night , near the closing in of <name> , she pressed this distressing subject with more than usual emphasis upon my attention .
she had just awakened from an unquiet slumber , and i had been watching , with feelings half of anxiety , half of vague terror , the workings of her emaciated countenance .
i sat by the side of her <name> bed , upon one of the <unk> of <name> .
she partly arose , and spoke , in an <name> low whisper , of sounds which she then heard , but which i could not hear  of motions which she then saw , but which i could not perceive .
the wind was rushing hurriedly behind the tapestries , and i wished to show her ( what , let me confess it , i could not all believe ) that those almost inarticulate <unk> , and those very gentle variations of the figures upon the wall , were but the natural effects of that customary rushing of the wind .
but a deadly pallor , <unk> her face , had proved to me that my exertions to reassure her would be fruitless .
she appeared to be fainting , and no attendants were within call .
i remembered where was deposited a <unk> of light wine which had been ordered by her physicians , and hastened across the chamber to procure it .
but , as i stepped beneath the light of the censer , two circumstances of a startling nature attracted my attention .
i had felt that some palpable although invisible object had passed lightly by my person ; and i saw that there lay upon the golden carpet , in the very middle of the <name> lustre thrown from the censer , a shadow  a faint , indefinite shadow of <name> aspect  such as might be fancied for the shadow of a shade .
but i was wild with the excitement of an immoderate dose of opium , and heeded these things but little , nor spoke of them to <name> .
having found the wine , i recrossed the chamber , and poured out a <unk> , which i held to the lips of the fainting <name> .
she had now partially recovered , however , and took the vessel herself , while i sank upon an ottoman near me , with my eyes fastened upon her person .
it was then that i became distinctly aware of a gentle footfall upon the carpet , and near the couch ; and in a second thereafter , as <name> was in the act of raising the wine to her lips , i saw , or may have dreamed that i saw , fall within the <unk> , as if from some invisible spring in the atmosphere of the room , three or four large drops of a brilliant and <name> colored fluid .
if this i saw  not so <name> .
she swallowed the wine unhesitatingly , and i forbore to speak to her of a circumstance which must , after all , i considered , have been but the suggestion of a vivid imagination , rendered <unk> active by the terror of the <name> , by the opium , and by the hour .
yet i can not conceal it from my own perception that , immediately subsequent to the fall of the <unk> , a rapid change for the worse took place in the disorder of my wife ; so that , on the third subsequent night , the hands of her <unk> prepared her for the tomb , and on the fourth , i sat alone , with her shrouded body , in that fantastic chamber which had received her as my <unk>  wild visions , <unk> , flitted , <unk> , before me .
i gazed with unquiet eye upon the <unk> in the angles of the room , upon the varying figures of the drapery , and upon the writhing of the <unk> fires in the censer overhead .
my eyes then fell , as i called to mind the circumstances of a former night , to the spot beneath the glare of the censer where i had seen the faint traces of the shadow .
it was there , however , no longer ; and breathing with greater freedom , i turned my glances to the pallid and rigid figure upon the bed .
then rushed upon me a thousand memories of ligeia  and then came back upon my heart , with the turbulent violence of a flood , the whole of that unutterable wo with which i had regarded her thus enshrouded .
the night waned ; and still , with a bosom full of bitter thoughts of the one only and supremely beloved , i remained gazing upon the body of <name> .
it might have been midnight , or perhaps earlier , or later , for i had taken no note of time , when a sob , low , gentle , but very distinct , startled me from my <unk>  i felt that it came from the bed of <name>  the bed of death .
i listened in an agony of superstitious terror  but there was no repetition of the sound .
i strained my vision to detect any motion in the corpse  but there was not the slightest perceptible .
yet i could not have been deceived .
i had heard the noise , however faint , and my soul was awakened within me .
i resolutely and perseveringly kept my attention riveted upon the body .
many minutes elapsed before any circumstance occurred tending to throw light upon the mystery .
at length it became evident that a slight , a very feeble , and barely noticeable tinge of color had flushed up within the cheeks , and along the sunken small veins of the eyelids .
through a species of unutterable horror and awe , for which the language of mortality has no sufficiently energetic expression , i felt my heart cease to beat , my limbs grow rigid where i sat .
yet a sense of duty finally operated to restore my self-possession .
i could no longer doubt that we had been precipitate in our preparations  that <name> still lived .
it was necessary that some immediate exertion be made ; yet turret was altogether apart from the portion of the <name> tenanted by the servants  there were none within call  i had no means of summoning them to my aid without leaving the room for many minutes  and this i could not venture to do .
i therefore struggled alone in my endeavors to call back the spirit ill hovering .
in a short period it was certain , however , that a relapse had taken place ; the color disappeared from both eyelid and cheek , leaving a <unk> even more than that of marble ; the lips became doubly shrivelled and pinched up in the ghastly expression of death ; a repulsive <unk> and coldness overspread rapidly the surface of the body ; and all the usual rigorous illness immediately supervened .
i fell back with a shudder upon the couch from which i had been so startlingly aroused , and again gave myself up to passionate waking visions of ligeia .
an hour thus elapsed when ( could it be possible ? )
i was a second time aware of some vague sound issuing from the region of the bed .
i listened  in extremity of horror .
the sound came again  it was a sigh .
rushing to the corpse , i saw  distinctly saw  a tremor upon the lips .
in a minute afterward they relaxed , disclosing a bright line of the <name> teeth .
amazement now struggled in my bosom with the profound awe which had hitherto reigned there alone .
i felt that my vision grew dim , that my reason wandered ; and it was only by a violent effort that i at length succeeded in <unk> myself to the task which duty thus once more had pointed out .
there was now a partial glow upon the forehead and upon the cheek and throat ; a perceptible warmth pervaded the whole frame ; there was even a slight <unk> at the heart .
the <name> lived ; and with redoubled ardor i betook myself to the task of restoration .
i chafed and bathed the temples and the hands , and used every exertion which experience , and no little medical reading , could suggest .
but in vain .
suddenly , the color fled , the <unk> ceased , the lips resumed the expression of the dead , and , in an instant afterward , the whole body took upon itself the icy <unk> , the livid <name> , the intense rigidity , the sunken outline , and all the loathsome peculiarities of that which has been , for many days , a tenant of the tomb .
and again i sunk into visions of ligeia  and again , ( what <name> that i shudder while i write , ) again there reached my ears a low sob from the region of the <name> bed .
but why shall i minutely detail the unspeakable horrors of that night ?
why shall i pause to relate how , time after time , until near the period of the gray <name> , this hideous drama of <unk> was repeated ; how each terrific relapse was only into a sterner and apparently more <unk> death ; how each agony wore the aspect of a struggle with some invisible foe ; and how each struggle was succeeded by i know not what of wild change in the personal appearance of the corpse ?
let me hurry to a conclusion .
the greater part of the fearful night had worn away , and she who had been dead , once again stirred  and now more vigorously than hitherto , although arousing from a dissolution more appalling in its utter hopelessness than any .
i had long ceased to struggle or to move , and remained sitting rigidly upon the ottoman , a helpless prey to a whirl of violent emotions , of which extreme awe was perhaps the least terrible , the least consuming .
the corpse , i repeat , stirred , and now more vigorously than before .
the hues of life flushed up with unwonted energy into the countenance  the limbs relaxed  and , save that the eyelids were yet pressed heavily together , and that the bandages and draperies of the grave still imparted their <unk> character to the figure , i might have dreamed that <name> had indeed shaken off , utterly , the fetters of death .
but if this idea was not , even then , altogether adopted , i could at least doubt no longer , when , arising from the bed , tottering , with feeble steps , with closed eyes , and with the manner of one bewildered in a dream , the thing that was enshrouded advanced boldly and palpably into the middle of the apartment .
i trembled not  i stirred not  for a crowd of unutterable fancies connected with the air , the stature , the demeanor of the figure , rushing hurriedly through my <name> , had paralyzed  had chilled me into stone .
i stirred not  but gazed upon the apparition .
there was a mad disorder in my thoughts  a tumult unappeasable .
could it , indeed , be the living <name> who confronted me ?
could it indeed be <name> at all  the <unk> , the blue-eyed <name> <name> <unk> of <unk> ?
why , why should i doubt it ?
the bandage lay heavily about the mouth  but then might it not be the mouth of the breathing <name> of <unk> ?
and the <unk> were the roses as in her noon of life  yes , these might indeed be the fair cheeks of the living <name> of <unk> .
and the <name> , with its <unk> , as in health , might it not be hers ?  but had she then grown taller since her malady ?
what inexpressible madness seized me with that thought ?
one bound , and i had reached her feet !
shrinking from my touch , she let fall from her head , <unk> , the ghastly <unk> which had confined it , and there streamed forth , into the rushing atmosphere of the chamber , huge masses of long and dishevelled hair ; it was blacker than the <name> wings of the midnight !
and now slowly opened the eyes of the figure which stood before me .
" here then , at least , " i shrieked aloud , " can i never  can i never be mistaken  these are the full , and the black , and the wild eyes  of my lost love  of the <name>  of the <name> ligeia . "
morella itself , by itself , solely , one everlasting , and single .
plato : <unk> .
with a feeling of deep yet most singular affection i regarded my friend morella .
thrown by accident into her society many years ago , my soul from our first meeting , burned with fires it had never before known ; but the fires were not of eros , and bitter and tormenting to my spirit was the gradual conviction that i could in no manner define their unusual meaning or regulate their vague intensity .
yet we met ; and fate bound us together at the altar , and i never spoke of passion nor thought of love .
she , however , shunned society , and , attaching herself to me alone rendered me happy .
it is a happiness to wonder ; it is a happiness to dream .
morella 's erudition was profound .
as i <name> to live , her talents were of no common order  her powers of mind were gigantic .
i felt this , and , in many matters , became her pupil .
i soon , however , found that , perhaps on account of her <unk> education , she placed before me a number of those <unk> writings which are usually considered the mere dross of the early <name> literature .
these , for what reason i could not imagine , were her favourite and constant study  and that in process of time they became my own , should be attributed to the simple but effectual influence of habit and example .
in all this , if i err not , my reason had little to do .
my convictions , or i forget myself , were in no manner acted upon by the ideal , nor was any <unk> of the <unk> which i read to be discovered , unless i am greatly mistaken , either in my deeds or in my thoughts .
persuaded of this , i abandoned myself implicitly to the guidance of my wife , and entered with an unflinching heart into the intricacies of her studies .
and then  then , when poring over forbidden pages , i felt a forbidden spirit <unk> within me  would morella place her cold hand upon my own , and rake up from the ashes of a dead philosophy some low , singular words , whose strange meaning burned themselves in upon my memory .
and then , hour after hour , would i linger by her side , and dwell upon the music of her voice , until at length its <name> was tainted with terror , and there fell a shadow upon my soul , and i grew pale , and shuddered inwardly at those too unearthly tones .
and thus , <name> suddenly faded into horror , and the most beautiful became the most hideous , as <unk> became <unk> .
it is unnecessary to state the exact character of those <unk> which , growing out of the volumes i have mentioned , formed , for so long a time , almost the sole conversation of morella and myself .
by the learned in what might be termed theological morality they <name> be readily conceived , and by the <unk> they would , at all events , be little understood .
the wild <unk> of <unk> ; the modified <unk> of the <unk> ; and , above all , the doctrines of identity as urged by <unk> , were generally the points of discussion presenting the most of beauty to the imaginative morella .
that identity which is termed personal , mr. locke , i think , truly <unk> to consist in the <unk> of rational being .
and since by person we understand an intelligent essence having reason , and since there is a consciousness which always accompanies thinking , it is this which makes us all to be that which we call ourselves , thereby distinguishing us from other beings that think , and giving us our personal identity .
but the <unk> <unk> , the notion of that identity which at death is or is not lost for ever , was to me , at all times , a consideration of intense interest ; not more from the perplexing and exciting nature of its consequences , than from the marked and agitated manner in which morella mentioned them .
but , indeed , the time had now arrived when the mystery of my <unk> manner oppressed me as a spell .
i could no longer bear the touch of her <name> fingers , nor the low tone of her musical language , nor the lustre of her melancholy eyes .
and she knew all this , but did not upbraid ; she seemed conscious of my weakness or my folly , and , smiling , called it fate .
she seemed also conscious of a cause , to me unknown , for the gradual <unk> of my regard ; but she gave me no hint or token of its nature .
yet was she woman , and pined away daily .
in time the crimson spot settled steadily upon the cheek , and the blue veins upon the pale forehead became prominent ; and one instant my nature melted into pity , but in , next i met the glance of her meaning eyes , and then my soul sickened and became giddy with the <unk> of one who gazes downward into some dreary and unfathomable abyss .
shall i then say that i longed with an <name> and consuming <name> for the moment of morella 's decease ?
i did ; but the fragile spirit clung to its tenement of <name> for many days , for many weeks and irksome months , until my tortured nerves obtained the mastery over my mind , and i grew furious through delay , and , with the heart of a fiend , cursed the days and the hours and the bitter moments , which seemed to <unk> and <unk> as her gentle life declined , like shadows in the dying of the day .
but one autumnal evening , when the winds lay still in heaven , morella called me to her bedside .
there was a dim mist over all the earth , and a warm glow upon the waters , and amid the <name> october leaves of the forest , a rainbow from the firmament had surely fallen .
" it is a day of days , " she said , as i approached ; " a day of all days either to live or die .
it is a fair day for the sons of earth and life  ah , more fair for the daughters of heaven and death ! "
i kissed her forehead , and she continued : " i am dying , yet shall i live . "
" morella ! "
" the days have never been when thou couldst love me  but her whom in life thou didst abhor , in death thou shalt adore . "
" morella ! "
" i repeat i am dying .
but within me is a pledge of that affection  ah , how little !  which thou didst feel for me , morella .
and when my spirit departs shall the child live  thy child and mine , morella 's .
but thy days shall be days of sorrow  that sorrow which is the most lasting of impressions , as the cypress is the most enduring of trees .
for the hours of thy happiness are over and <name> is not gathered twice in a life , as the roses of <unk> twice in a year .
thou shalt no longer , then , play the <unk> with time , but , being ignorant of the <name> and the vine , thou shalt bear about with thee thy shroud on the earth , as do the <unk> at mecca . "
" morella ! "
i cried , " morella !
how knowest thou this ? "
but she turned away her face upon the pillow and a slight tremor coming over her limbs , she thus died , and i heard her voice no more .
yet , as she had foretold , her child , to which in dying she had given birth , which breathed not until the mother breathed no more , her child , a daughter , lived .
and she grew strangely in stature and intellect , and was the perfect resemblance of her who had departed , and i loved her with a love more fervent than i had believed it possible to feel for any <unk> of earth .
but , ere long the heaven of this pure affection became darkened , and gloom , and horror , and grief swept over it in clouds .
i said the child grew strangely in stature and intelligence .
strange , indeed , was her rapid increase in bodily size , but terrible , oh !
terrible were the tumultuous thoughts which crowded upon me while watching the development of her mental being .
could it be otherwise , when i daily discovered in the conceptions of the child the adult powers and faculties of the woman ?
when the lessons of experience fell from the lips of infancy ?
and when the wisdom or the passions of maturity i found hourly gleaming from its full and speculative eye ?
when , i say , all this became evident to my appalled senses , when i could no longer hide it from my soul , nor throw it off from those perceptions which trembled to receive it , is it to be wondered at that suspicions , of a nature fearful and exciting , crept in upon my spirit , or that my thoughts fell back aghast upon the wild tales and thrilling theories of the entombed morella ?
i snatched from the scrutiny of the world a being whom <name> compelled me to adore , and in the rigorous seclusion of my home , watched with an agonizing anxiety over all which concerned the beloved .
and as years rolled away , and i gazed day after day upon her holy , and mild , and eloquent face , and poured over her maturing form , day after day did i discover new points of resemblance in the child to her mother , the melancholy and the dead .
and hourly grew darker these shadows of <unk> , and more full , and more definite , and more perplexing , and more hideously terrible in their aspect .
for that her smile was like her mother 's i could bear ; but then i shuddered at its too perfect identity , that her eyes were like morella 's i could endure ; but then they , too , often looked down into the depths of my soul with morella 's own intense and bewildering meaning .
and in the contour of the high forehead , and in the ringlets of the silken hair , and in the <name> fingers which buried themselves therein , and in the sad musical tones of her speech , and above all  oh , above all , in the phrases and expressions of the dead on the lips of the loved and the living , i found food for consuming thought and horror , for a worm that would not die .
thus passed away two <unk> of her life , and as yet my daughter remained nameless upon the earth .
" my child , " and " my love , " were the <unk> usually prompted by a father 's affection , and the rigid seclusion of her days <unk> all other intercourse .
morella 's name died with her at her death .
of the mother i had never spoken to the daughter , it was impossible to speak .
indeed , during the brief period of her existence , the latter had received no impressions from the outward world , save such as might have been afforded by the narrow limits of her privacy .
but at length the ceremony of baptism presented to my mind , in its unnerved and agitated condition , a present deliverance from the terrors of my <name> .
and at the <unk> font i hesitated for a name .
and many titles of the wise and beautiful , of old and modern times , of my own and foreign lands , came thronging to my lips , with many , many fair titles of the gentle , and the happy , and the good .
what prompted me then to disturb the memory of the buried dead ?
what demon urged me to breathe that sound , which in its very recollection was wont to make ebb the purple blood in torrents from the temples to the heart ?
what fiend spoke from the recesses of my soul , when amid those dim aisles , and in the silence of the night , i whispered within the ears of the holy man the syllables  morella ?
what more than fiend convulsed the features of my child , and overspread them with hues of death , as starting at that scarcely audible sound , she turned her glassy eyes from the earth to heaven , and falling prostrate on the black slabs of our ancestral vault , responded  " i am here ! "
distinct , coldly , calmly distinct , fell those few simple sounds within my ear , and thence like molten lead rolled <unk> into my <name> .
years  years may pass away , but the memory of that epoch never .
nor was i indeed ignorant of the flowers and the vine  but the hemlock and the cypress overshadowed me night and day .
and i kept no reckoning of time or place , and the stars of my fate faded from heaven , and therefore the earth grew dark , and its figures passed by me like flitting shadows , and among them all i beheld only  morella .
the winds of the firmament breathed but one sound within my ears , and the ripples upon the sea murmured evermore  morella .
but she died ; and with my own hands i bore her to the tomb ; and i laughed with a long and bitter laugh as i found no traces of the first in the channel where i laid the <unk>  morella .
a tale of the ragged mountains during the fall of the year 1827 , while residing near <unk> , <name> , i casually made the acquaintance of mr. <name> bedloe .
this young gentleman was remarkable in every respect , and excited in me a profound interest and curiosity .
i found it impossible to comprehend him either in his moral or his physical relations .
of his family i could obtain no satisfactory account .
whence he came , i never ascertained .
even about his age  although i call him a young gentleman  there was something which perplexed me in no little degree .
he certainly seemed young  and he made a point of speaking about his youth  yet there were moments when i should have had little trouble in imagining him a hundred years of age .
but in no regard was he more peculiar than in his personal appearance .
he was singularly tall and thin .
he stooped much .
his limbs were exceedingly long and emaciated .
his forehead was broad and low .
his complexion was absolutely bloodless .
his mouth was large and flexible , and his teeth were more wildly uneven , although sound , than i had ever before seen teeth in a human head .
the expression of his smile , however , was by no means <unk> , as might be supposed ; but it had no variation whatever .
it was one of profound melancholy  of a <unk> and unceasing gloom .
his eyes were abnormally large , and round like those of a cat .
the pupils , too , upon any accession or diminution of light , underwent contraction or <unk> , just such as is observed in the <unk> tribe .
in moments of excitement the orbs grew bright to a degree almost inconceivable ; seeming to emit luminous rays , not of a reflected but of an intrinsic lustre , as does a candle or the sun ; yet their ordinary condition was so totally <unk> , filmy , and dull as to convey the idea of the eyes of a <unk> corpse .
these peculiarities of person appeared to cause him much annoyance , and he was continually alluding to them in a sort of half explanatory , half apologetic strain , which , when i first heard it , impressed me very painfully .
i soon , however , grew accustomed to it , and my uneasiness wore off .
it seemed to be his design rather to insinuate than directly to assert that , physically , he had not always been what he was  that a long series of <unk> attacks had reduced him from a condition of more than usual personal beauty , to that which i saw .
for many years past he had been attended by a physician , named <unk>  an old gentleman , perhaps seventy years of age  whom he had first encountered at <unk> , and from whose attention , while there , he either received , or fancied that he received , great benefit .
the result was that bedloe , who was wealthy , had made an arrangement with dr. <unk> , by which the latter , in consideration of a liberal annual allowance , had consented to devote his time and medical experience exclusively to the care of the invalid .
doctor <unk> had been a traveller in his younger days , and at <name> had become a convert , in great measure , to the doctrines of <unk> .
it was altogether by means of magnetic remedies that he had succeeded in <unk> the acute pains of his patient ; and this success had very naturally inspired the latter with a certain degree of confidence in the opinions from which the remedies had been <unk> .
the doctor , however , like all <unk> , had struggled hard to make a thorough convert of his pupil , and finally so far gained his point as to induce the sufferer to submit to numerous experiments .
by a frequent repetition of these , a result had arisen , which of late days has become so common as to attract little or no attention , but which , at the period of which i write , had very rarely been known in <name> .
i mean to say , that between doctor <unk> and bedloe there had grown up , little by little , a very distinct and strongly marked <unk> , or magnetic relation .
i am not prepared to assert , however , that this <unk> extended beyond the limits of the simple <unk> power , but this power itself had attained great intensity .
at the first attempt to induce the magnetic <unk> , the <unk> entirely failed .
in the fifth or sixth he succeeded very partially , and after long continued effort .
only at the twelfth was the triumph complete .
after this the <name> of the patient succumbed rapidly to that of the physician , so that , when i first became acquainted with the two , sleep was brought about almost instantaneously by the mere volition of the operator , even when the invalid was unaware of his presence .
it is only now , in the year 1845 , when similar miracles are witnessed daily by thousands , that i dare venture to record this apparent impossibility as a matter of serious fact .
the temperature of bedloe was , in the highest degree sensitive , excitable , enthusiastic .
his imagination was singularly vigorous and creative ; and no doubt it derived additional force from the habitual use of <unk> , which he swallowed in great quantity , and without which he would have found it impossible to exist .
it was his practice to take a very large dose of it immediately after breakfast each morning  or , rather , immediately after a cup of strong coffee , for he ate nothing in the forenoon  and then set forth alone , or attended only by a dog , upon a long ramble among the chain of wild and dreary hills that lie westward and southward of <unk> , and are there dignified by the title of the ragged mountains .
upon a dim , warm , <name> day , toward the close of november , and during the strange <unk> of the seasons which in <name> is termed the indian summer , mr. bedloe departed as usual for the hills .
the day passed , and still he did not return .
about eight o'clock at night , having become seriously alarmed at his protracted absence , we were about setting out in search of him , when he unexpectedly made his appearance , in health no worse than usual , and in rather more than ordinary spirits .
the account which he gave of his expedition , and of the events which had detained him , was a singular one indeed .
" you <name> remember , " said he , " that it was about nine in the morning when i left <unk> .
i bent my steps immediately to the mountains , and , about ten , entered a gorge which was entirely new to me .
i followed the windings of this pass with much interest .
the scenery which presented itself on all sides , although scarcely entitled to be called grand , had about it an indescribable and to me a delicious aspect of dreary desolation .
the solitude seemed absolutely virgin .
i could not help believing that the green <unk> and the gray rocks upon which i trod had been trodden never before by the foot of a human being .
so entirely secluded , and in fact inaccessible , except through a series of accidents , is the entrance of the ravine , that it is by no means impossible that i was indeed the first adventurer  the very first and sole adventurer who had ever penetrated its recesses .
" the thick and peculiar mist , or smoke , which distinguishes the indian summer , and which now <name> heavily over all objects , served , no doubt , to deepen the vague impressions which these objects created .
so dense was this pleasant fog that i could at no time see more than a dozen yards of the path before me .
this path was excessively sinuous , and as the sun could not be seen , i soon lost all idea of the direction in which i journeyed .
in the meantime the <unk> had its customary effect  that of <unk> all the external world with an intensity of interest .
in the quivering of a leaf  in the <name> of a blade of grass  in the shape of a <unk>  in the humming of a <name>  in the gleaming of a <unk>  in the breathing of the wind  in the faint odors that came from the forest  there came a whole universe of suggestion  a <name> and motley train of <unk> and <unk> thought .
" busied in this , i walked on for several hours , during which the mist deepened around me to so great an extent that at length i was reduced to an absolute groping of the way .
and now an indescribable uneasiness possessed me  a species of nervous hesitation and tremor .
i feared to tread , lest i should be precipitated into some abyss .
i remembered , too , strange stories told about these ragged hills , and of the uncouth and fierce races of men who tenanted their groves and caverns .
a thousand vague fancies oppressed and disconcerted me  fancies the more distressing because vague .
very suddenly my attention was arrested by the loud beating of a drum .
" my amazement was , of course , extreme .
a drum in these hills was a thing unknown .
i could not have been more surprised at the sound of the trump of the archangel .
but a new and still more astounding source of interest and perplexity arose .
there came a wild rattling or jingling sound , as if of a bunch of large keys , and upon the instant a <unk> and <unk> man rushed past me with a shriek .
he came so close to my person that i felt his hot breath upon my face .
he bore in one hand an instrument composed of an assemblage of steel rings , and shook them vigorously as he ran .
scarcely had he disappeared in the mist before , panting after him , with open mouth and glaring eyes , there darted a huge beast .
i could not be mistaken in its character .
it was a hyena .
" the sight of this monster rather relieved than heightened my terrors  for i now made sure that i dreamed , and endeavored to arouse myself to waking consciousness .
i stepped boldly and briskly forward .
i rubbed my eyes .
i called aloud .
i pinched my limbs .
a small spring of water presented itself to my view , and here , stooping , i bathed my hands and my head and neck .
this seemed to <unk> the equivocal sensations which had hitherto annoyed me .
i arose , as i thought , a new man , and proceeded steadily and complacently on my unknown way .
" at length , quite overcome by exertion , and by a certain oppressive <unk> of the atmosphere , i seated myself beneath a tree .
presently there came a feeble gleam of <name> , and the shadow of the leaves of the tree fell faintly but definitely upon the grass .
at this shadow i gazed wonderingly for many minutes .
its character stupefied me with astonishment .
i looked upward .
the tree was a palm .
" i now arose hurriedly , and in a state of fearful agitation  for the fancy that i dreamed would serve me no longer .
i saw  i felt that i had perfect command of my senses  and these senses now brought to my soul a world of novel and singular sensation .
the heat became all at once intolerable .
a strange odor loaded the breeze .
a low , continuous murmur , like that arising from a full , but gently flowing river , came to my ears , intermingled with the peculiar hum of multitudinous human voices .
" while i listened in an extremity of astonishment which i need not attempt to describe , a strong and brief gust of wind bore off the incumbent fog as if by the wand of an <unk> .
" i found myself at the foot of a high mountain , and looking down into a vast plain , through which wound a majestic river .
on the margin of this river stood an <unk> city , such as we read of in the arabian tales , but of a character even more singular than any there described .
from my position , which was far above the level of the town , i could perceive its every nook and corner , as if delineated on a map .
the streets seemed innumerable , and crossed each other irregularly in all directions , but were rather long winding alleys than streets , and absolutely swarmed with inhabitants .
the houses were wildly picturesque .
on every hand was a wilderness of balconies , of verandas , of <unk> , of shrines , and fantastically carved <unk> .
bazaars abounded ; and in these were displayed <name> wares in infinite variety and profusion  silks , <unk> , the most dazzling <unk> , the most magnificent jewels and gems .
besides these things , were seen , on all sides , banners and palanquins , <unk> with stately dames close veiled , elephants gorgeously caparisoned , idols <unk> hewn , drums , banners , and gongs , spears , silver and gilded <unk> .
and amid the crowd , and the clamor , and the general intricacy and confusion  amid the million of black and yellow men , turbaned and robed , and of flowing beard , there roamed a countless multitude of holy <unk> bulls , while vast legions of the filthy but sacred ape clambered , chattering and shrieking , about the cornices of the <unk> , or clung to the <unk> and <unk> .
from the swarming streets to the banks of the river , there descended innumerable flights of steps leading to bathing places , while the river itself seemed to force a passage with difficulty through the vast fleets of deeply  <unk> ships that far and wide encountered its surface .
beyond the limits of the city arose , in frequent majestic groups , the palm and the cocoa , with other gigantic and weird trees of vast age , and here and there might be seen a field of rice , the thatched hut of a peasant , a tank , a stray <name> , a <unk> camp , or a solitary graceful maiden taking her way , with a pitcher upon her head , to the banks of the magnificent river .
" you <name> say now , of course , that i dreamed ; but not so .
what i saw  what i heard  what i felt  what i thought  had about it nothing of the unmistakable <unk> of the dream .
all was rigorously <unk> .
at first , doubting that i was really awake , i entered into a series of tests , which soon convinced me that i really was .
now , when one dreams , and , in the dream , suspects that he dreams , the suspicion never fails to confirm itself , and the sleeper is almost immediately aroused .
thus <unk> <unk> not in saying that 'we are near waking when we dream that we dream . '
had the vision occurred to me as i describe it , without my suspecting it as a dream , then a dream it might absolutely have been , but , occurring as it did , and suspected and tested as it was , i am forced to class it among other phenomena . "
" in this i am not sure that you are wrong , " observed dr. <unk> , " but proceed .
you arose and descended into the city . "
" i arose , " continued bedloe , regarding the doctor with an air of profound astonishment " i arose , as you say , and descended into the city .
on my way i fell in with an immense populace , crowding through every avenue , all in the same direction , and exhibiting in every action the wildest excitement .
very suddenly , and by some inconceivable impulse , i became intensely imbued with personal interest in what was going on .
i seemed to feel that i had an important part to play , without exactly understanding what it was .
against the crowd which <unk> me , however , i experienced a deep sentiment of animosity .
i shrank from amid them , and , swiftly , by a circuitous path , reached and entered the city .
here all was the wildest tumult and contention .
a small party of men , clad in garments <unk> , <unk> , and officered by gentlemen in a uniform partly british , were engaged , at great odds , with the swarming rabble of the alleys .
i joined the weaker party , arming myself with the weapons of a fallen officer , and fighting i knew not whom with the nervous ferocity of despair .
we were soon overpowered by <name> , and driven to seek refuge in a species of <unk> .
here we barricaded ourselves , and , for the present were secure .
from a <unk> near the summit of the <unk> , i perceived a vast crowd , in furious agitation , surrounding and assaulting a <name> palace that overhung the river .
presently , from an upper window of this place , there descended an <unk> person , by means of a string made of the turbans of his attendants .
a boat was at hand , in which he escaped to the opposite bank of the river .
" and now a new object took possession of my soul .
i spoke a few hurried but energetic words to my companions , and , having succeeded in gaining over a few of them to my purpose made a frantic <name> from the <unk> .
we rushed amid the crowd that surrounded it .
they retreated , at first , before us .
they rallied , fought madly , and retreated again .
in the mean time we were borne far from the <unk> , and became bewildered and entangled among the narrow streets of tall , overhanging houses , into the recesses of which the sun had never been able to shine .
the rabble pressed impetuously upon us , <unk> us with their spears , and overwhelming us with flights of arrows .
these latter were very remarkable , and resembled in some respects the writhing <unk> of the malay .
they were made to imitate the body of a creeping serpent , and were long and black , with a poisoned <name> .
one of them struck me upon the right <name> .
i reeled and fell .
an instantaneous and dreadful sickness seized me .
i struggled  i gasped  i died . "
" you <name> hardly persist now , " said i smiling , " that the whole of your adventure was not a dream .
you are not prepared to maintain that you are dead ? "
when i said these words , i of course expected some lively <name> from bedloe in reply , but , to my astonishment , he hesitated , trembled , became fearfully pallid , and remained silent .
i looked toward <unk> .
he sat erect and rigid in his chair  his teeth chattered , and his eyes were starting from their sockets .
" proceed ! "
he at length said hoarsely to bedloe .
" for many minutes , " continued the latter , " my sole sentiment  my sole feeling  was that of darkness and <unk> , with the consciousness of death .
at length there seemed to pass a violent and sudden shock through my soul , as if of electricity .
with it came the sense of elasticity and of light .
this latter i felt  not saw .
in an instant i seemed to rise from the ground .
but i had no bodily , no visible , audible , or palpable presence .
the crowd had departed .
the tumult had ceased .
the city was in comparative repose .
beneath me lay my corpse , with the arrow in my <name> , the whole head greatly swollen and disfigured .
but all these things i felt  not saw .
i took interest in nothing .
even the corpse seemed a matter in which i had no concern .
volition i had none , but appeared to be impelled into motion , and flitted <unk> out of the city , <unk> the circuitous path by which i had entered it .
when i had attained that point of the ravine in the mountains at which i had encountered the hyena , i again experienced a shock as of a galvanic battery , the sense of weight , of volition , of substance , returned .
i became my original self , and bent my steps eagerly homeward  but the past had not lost the vividness of the real  and not now , even for an instant , can i compel my understanding to regard it as a dream . "
" nor was it , " said <unk> , with an air of deep solemnity , " yet it would be difficult to say how otherwise it should be termed .
let us suppose only , that the soul of the man of to-day is upon the verge of some stupendous <unk> discoveries .
let us content ourselves with this supposition .
for the rest i have some explanation to make .
here is a <unk> drawing , which i should have shown you before , but which an unaccountable sentiment of horror has hitherto prevented me from showing . "
we looked at the picture which he presented .
i saw nothing in it of an extraordinary character , but its effect upon bedloe was prodigious .
he nearly fainted as he gazed .
and yet it was but a miniature portrait  a miraculously accurate one , to be sure  of his own very remarkable features .
at least this was my thought as i regarded it .
" you <name> perceive , " said <unk> , " the date of this picture  it is here , scarcely visible , in this corner  <unk> .
in this year was the portrait taken .
it is the likeness of a dead friend  a mr. <unk>  to whom i became much attached at calcutta , during the administration of <name> hastings .
i was then only twenty years old .
when i first saw you , mr. bedloe , at <unk> , it was the miraculous similarity which existed between yourself and the painting which induced me to accost you , to seek your friendship , and to bring about those arrangements which resulted in my becoming your constant companion .
in accomplishing this point , i was urged partly , and perhaps principally , by a <unk> memory of the deceased , but also , in part , by an uneasy , and not altogether <unk> curiosity respecting yourself .
" in your detail of the vision which presented itself to you amid the hills , you have described , with the minutest accuracy , the indian city of benares , upon the holy river .
the riots , the combat , the massacre , were the actual events of the insurrection of <unk> sing , which took place in <unk> , when hastings was put in imminent peril of his life .
the man escaping by the string of turbans was <unk> sing himself .
the party in the <unk> were <unk> and british officers , headed by hastings .
of this party i was one , and did all i could to prevent the rash and fatal <name> of the officer who fell , in the crowded alleys , by the poisoned arrow of a <unk> .
that officer was my dearest friend .
it was <unk> .
you <name> perceive by these manuscripts , " ( here the speaker produced a note-book in which several pages appeared to have been freshly written , ) " that at the very period in which you fancied these things amid the hills , i was engaged in <unk> them upon paper here at home . "
in about a week after this conversation , the following paragraphs appeared in a <unk> paper : " we have the painful duty of announcing the death of mr. <name> <unk> , a gentleman whose amiable manners and many virtues have long <unk> him to the citizens of <unk> .
" mr. b. , for some years past , has been subject to <unk> , which has often threatened to terminate fatally ; but this can be regarded only as the <unk> cause of his decease .
the proximate cause was one of especial <unk> .
in an excursion to the ragged mountains , a few days since , a slight cold and fever were contracted , attended with great determination of blood to the head .
to relieve this , dr. <unk> resorted to <unk> bleeding .
<unk> were applied to the temples .
in a fearfully brief period the patient died , when it appeared that in the jar containing the <unk> , had been introduced , by accident , one of the venomous <unk> <unk> which are now and then found in the neighboring ponds .
this creature fastened itself upon a small artery in the right <name> .
its close resemblance to the medicinal leech caused the mistake to be overlooked until too late .
" n. b .
the poisonous <unk> of <unk> may always be distinguished from the medicinal leech by its blackness , and especially by its writhing or <unk> motions , which very nearly resemble those of a snake . "
i was speaking with the editor of the paper in question , upon the topic of this remarkable accident , when it occurred to me to ask how it happened that the name of the deceased had been given as <unk> .
" i presume , " i said , " you have authority for this spelling , but i have always supposed the name to be written with an e at the end . "
" authority ?  no , " he replied .
" it is a mere <unk> error .
the name is <unk> with an e , all the world over , and i never knew it to be spelt otherwise in my life . "
" then , " said i <unk> , as i turned upon my heel , " then indeed has it come to pass that one truth is stranger than any fiction  for bedloe , without the e , what is it but <unk> conversed !
and this man tells me that it is a <unk> error . "
the spectacles many years ago , it was the fashion to ridicule the idea of " love at first sight ; " but those who think , not less than those who feel deeply , have always advocated its existence .
modern discoveries , indeed , in what may be termed ethical magnetism or <unk> , render it probable that the most natural , and , consequently , the truest and most intense of the human affections are those which arise in the heart as if by electric sympathy  in a word , that the brightest and most enduring of the <unk> fetters are those which are riveted by a glance .
the confession i am about to make <name> add another to the already almost innumerable instances of the truth of the position .
my story requires that i should be somewhat minute .
i am still a very young man  not yet twenty-two years of age .
my name , at present , is a very usual and rather plebeian one  simpson .
i say " at present ; " for it is only lately that i have been so called  having <unk> adopted this <unk> within the last year in order to receive a large inheritance left me by a distant male relative , <unk> simpson , esq .
the <unk> was <unk> upon my taking the name of the <unk> ,  the family , not the <name> name ; my <name> name is <name> bonaparte  or , more properly , these are my first and middle <unk> .
i assumed the name , simpson , with some reluctance , as in my true <unk> , <unk> , i felt a very pardonable pride  believing that i could trace a descent from the immortal author of the " chronicles . "
while on the subject of names , by the bye , i may mention a singular coincidence of sound attending the names of some of my immediate predecessors .
my father was a monsieur <unk> , of <name> .
his wife  my mother , whom he married at fifteen  was a mademoiselle <unk> , eldest daughter of <unk> the banker , whose wife , again , being only sixteen when married , was the eldest daughter of one <name> <unk> .
monsieur <unk> , very singularly , had married a <name> of similar name  a mademoiselle <unk> .
she , too , was quite a child when married ; and her mother , also , madame <unk> , was only fourteen when led to the altar .
these early marriages are usual in <name> .
here , however , are <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , all in the direct line of descent .
my own name , though , as i say , became simpson , by act of legislature , and with so much repugnance on my part , that , at one period , i actually hesitated about accepting the legacy with the useless and annoying <unk> attached .
as to personal endowments , i am by no means deficient .
on the contrary , i believe that i am well made , and possess what nine <unk> of the world would call a handsome face .
in height i am five feet eleven .
my hair is black and curling .
my nose is sufficiently good .
my eyes are large and gray ; and although , in fact they are weak a very inconvenient degree , still no defect in this regard would be suspected from their appearance .
the weakness itself , however , has always much annoyed me , and i have resorted to every remedy  short of wearing glasses .
being youthful and good-looking , i naturally dislike these , and have resolutely refused to employ them .
i know nothing , indeed , which so <unk> the countenance of a young person , or so impresses every feature with an air of <unk> , if not altogether of <unk> and of age .
an <unk> , on the other hand , has a <unk> of downright <unk> and affectation .
i have hitherto managed as well as i could without either .
but something too much of these merely personal details , which , after all , are of little importance .
i <name> content myself with saying , in addition , that my temperament is <unk> , rash , ardent , enthusiastic  and that all my life i have been a devoted admirer of the women .
one night last <name> i entered a box at the p  theatre , in company with a friend , mr. talbot .
it was an opera night , and the bills presented a very rare attraction , so that the house was excessively crowded .
we were in time , however , to obtain the front seats which had been reserved for us , and into which , with some little difficulty , we <unk> our way .
for two hours my companion , who was a musical <unk> , gave his undivided attention to the stage ; and , in the meantime , i amused myself by observing the audience , which consisted , in chief part , of the very <unk> of the city .
having satisfied myself upon this point , i was about turning my eyes to the <unk> <name> , when they were arrested and riveted by a figure in one of the private boxes which had escaped my observation .
if i live a thousand years , i can never forget the intense emotion with which i regarded this figure .
it was that of a female , the most exquisite i had ever beheld .
the face was so far turned toward the stage that , for some minutes , i could not obtain a view of it  but the form was divine ; no other word can sufficiently express its magnificent proportion  and even the term " divine " seems ridiculously feeble as i write it .
the magic of a lovely form in woman  the <unk> of female <unk>  was always a power which i had found it impossible to resist , but here was <name> <unk> , incarnate , the <name> ideal of my wildest and most enthusiastic visions .
the figure , almost all of which the construction of the box permitted to be seen , was somewhat above the medium height , and nearly approached , without positively reaching , the majestic .
its perfect fullness and <unk> were delicious .
the head of which only the back was visible , <unk> in outline that of the greek psyche , and was rather displayed than concealed by an elegant cap of gaze <unk> , which put me in mind of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> .
the right arm <name> over the balustrade of the box , and thrilled every nerve of my frame with its exquisite symmetry .
its upper portion was <unk> by one of the loose open sleeves now in fashion .
this extended but little below the elbow .
beneath it was worn an under one of some frail material , <unk> , and terminated by a cuff of <name> lace , which fell gracefully over the top of the hand , revealing only the delicate fingers , upon one of which sparkled a <name> ring , which i at once saw was of extraordinary value .
the admirable <unk> of the wrist was well set off by a bracelet which encircled it , and which also was ornamented and clasped by a magnificent <unk> of <unk> , in words that could not be mistaken , at once of the wealth and fastidious taste of the wearer .
i gazed at this queenly apparition for at least half an hour , as if i had been suddenly converted to stone ; and , during this period , i felt the full force and truth of all that has been said or <name> concerning " love at first sight . "
my feelings were totally different from any which i had hitherto experienced , in the presence of even the most celebrated specimens of female loveliness .
an unaccountable , and what i am compelled to consider a magnetic , sympathy of soul for soul , seemed to rivet , not only my vision , but my whole powers of thought and feeling , upon the admirable object before me .
i saw  i felt  i knew that i was deeply , madly , irrevocably in love  and this even before seeing the face of the person beloved .
so intense , indeed , was the passion that consumed me , that i really believe it would have received little if any <unk> had the features , yet unseen , proved of merely ordinary character , so anomalous is the nature of the only true love  of the love at first sight  and so little really dependent is it upon the external conditions which only seem to create and control it .
while i was thus wrapped in admiration of this lovely vision , a sudden disturbance among the audience caused her to turn her head partially toward me , so that i beheld the entire profile of the face .
its beauty even exceeded my anticipations  and yet there was something about it which disappointed me without my being able to tell exactly what it was .
i said " disappointed , " but this is not altogether the word .
my sentiments were at once quieted and exalted .
they partook less of transport and more of calm enthusiasm of enthusiastic repose .
this state of feeling arose , perhaps , from the <unk> and <unk> air of the face ; and yet i at once understood that it could not have arisen entirely from this .
there was something else  some mystery which i could not <unk>  some expression about the countenance which slightly disturbed me while it greatly heightened my interest .
in fact , i was just in that condition of mind which prepares a young and susceptible man for any act of extravagance .
had the <name> been alone , i should undoubtedly have entered her box and accosted her at all hazards ; but , fortunately , she was attended by two companions  a gentleman , and a strikingly beautiful woman , to all appearance a few years younger than herself .
i revolved in my mind a thousand schemes by which i might obtain , hereafter , an introduction to the elder <name> , or , for the present , at all events , a more distinct view of her beauty .
i would have removed my position to one nearer her own , but the crowded state of the theatre rendered this impossible ; and the stern decrees of fashion had , of late , imperatively prohibited the use of the <unk> in a case such as this , even had i been so fortunate as to have one with me  but i had not  and was thus in despair .
at length i bethought me of applying to my companion .
" talbot , " i said , " you have an <unk> .
let me have it . "
" an opera  glass !  no !  what do you suppose i would be doing with an <unk> ? "
here he turned impatiently toward the stage .
" but , talbot , " i continued , pulling him by the shoulder , " listen to me <name> you ?
do you see the stage  box ?  there !  no , the <unk>  did you ever behold as lovely a woman ? "
" she is very beautiful , no doubt , " he said .
" i wonder who she can be ? "
" why , in the name of all that is <name> , do n't you know who she is ?
'not to know her argues yourself unknown . '
she is the celebrated madame lalande  the beauty of the day par excellence , and the talk of the whole town .
immensely wealthy too  a widow , and a great match  has just arrived from <name> . "
" do you know her ? "
" yes ; i have the honor . "
" <name> you introduce me ? "
" assuredly , with the greatest pleasure ; when shall it be ? "
" to-morrow , at one , i <name> call upon you at b  's .
" very good ; and now do hold your tongue , if you can . "
in this latter respect i was forced to take talbot 's advice ; for he remained obstinately deaf to every further question or suggestion , and occupied himself exclusively for the rest of the evening with what was <unk> upon the stage .
in the meantime i kept my eyes riveted on madame lalande , and at length had the good fortune to obtain a full front view of her face .
it was exquisitely lovely  this , of course , my heart had told me before , even had not talbot fully satisfied me upon the point  but still the unintelligible something disturbed me .
i finally concluded that my senses were impressed by a certain air of gravity , sadness , or , still more properly , of weariness , which took something from the youth and freshness of the countenance , only to <unk> it with a <unk> tenderness and majesty , and thus , of course , to my enthusiastic and romantic <unk> , with an interest tenfold .
while i thus feasted my eyes , i perceived , at last , to my great trepidation , by an almost imperceptible start on the part of the <name> , that she had become suddenly aware of the intensity of my gaze .
still , i was absolutely fascinated , and could not withdraw it , even for an instant .
she turned aside her face , and again i saw only the <unk> contour of the back portion of the head .
after some minutes , as if urged by curiosity to see if i was still looking , she gradually brought her face again around and again encountered my burning gaze .
her large dark eyes fell instantly , and a deep blush <unk> her cheek .
but what was my astonishment at perceiving that she not only did not a second time avert her head , but that she actually took from her girdle a double <unk>  elevated it  adjusted it  and then regarded me through it , intently and deliberately , for the space of several minutes .
had a thunderbolt fallen at my feet i could not have been more thoroughly astounded  astounded only  not offended or disgusted in the slightest degree ; although an action so bold in any other woman would have been likely to offend or disgust .
but the whole thing was done with so much <unk>  so much nonchalance  so much repose  with so evident an air of the highest breeding , in short  that nothing of mere effrontery was perceptible , and my sole sentiments were those of admiration and surprise .
i observed that , upon her first elevation of the glass , she had seemed satisfied with a momentary inspection of my person , and was withdrawing the instrument , when , as if struck by a second thought , she resumed it , and so continued to regard me with fixed attention for the space of several minutes  for five minutes , at the very least , i am sure .
this action , so remarkable in an american theatre , attracted very general observation , and gave rise to an indefinite movement , or buzz , among the audience , which for a moment filled me with confusion , but produced no visible effect upon the countenance of madame lalande .
having satisfied her curiosity  if such it was  she dropped the glass , and quietly gave her attention again to the stage ; her profile now being turned toward myself , as before .
i continued to watch her <unk> , although i was fully conscious of my rudeness in so doing .
presently i saw the head slowly and slightly change its position ; and soon i became convinced that the <name> , while pretending to look at the stage was , in fact , attentively regarding myself .
it is needless to say what effect this conduct , on the part of so fascinating a woman , had upon my excitable mind .
having thus scrutinized me for perhaps a quarter of an hour , the fair object of my passion addressed the gentleman who attended her , and while she spoke , i saw distinctly , by the glances of both , that the conversation had reference to myself .
upon its conclusion , madame lalande again turned toward the stage , and , for a few minutes , seemed absorbed in the performance .
at the expiration of this period , however , i was thrown into an extremity of agitation by seeing her unfold , for the second time , the eye-glass which <name> at her side , fully confront me as before , and , disregarding the renewed buzz of the audience , survey me , from head to foot , with the same miraculous composure which had previously so delighted and confounded my soul .
this extraordinary behavior , by throwing me into a perfect fever of excitement  into an absolute delirium of <unk> rather to <unk> than to <unk> me .
in the mad intensity of my devotion , i forgot everything but the presence and the majestic loveliness of the vision which confronted my gaze .
watching my opportunity , when i thought the audience were fully engaged with the opera , i at length caught the eyes of madame lalande , and , upon the instant , made a slight but unmistakable bow .
she blushed very deeply  then averted her eyes  then slowly and cautiously looked around , apparently to see if my rash action had been noticed  then leaned over toward the gentleman who sat by her side .
i now felt a burning sense of the impropriety i had committed , and expected nothing less than instant exposure ; while a vision of pistols upon the morrow floated rapidly and uncomfortably through my <name> .
i was greatly and immediately relieved , however , when i saw the <name> merely hand the gentleman a <unk> , without speaking , but the reader may form some feeble <name> of my astonishment  of my profound amazement  my delirious bewilderment of heart and soul  when , instantly afterward , having again glanced furtively around , she allowed her bright eyes to set fully and steadily upon my own , and then , with a faint smile , disclosing a bright line of her <name> teeth , made two distinct , pointed , and unequivocal affirmative inclinations of the head .
it is useless , of course , to dwell upon my <name>  upon my transport  upon my illimitable ecstasy of heart .
if ever man was mad with excess of happiness , it was myself at that moment .
i loved .
this was my first love  so i felt it to be .
it was love <unk> .
it was " love at first sight ; " and at first sight , too , it had been appreciated and returned .
yes , returned .
how and why should i doubt it for an instant .
what other construction could i possibly put upon such conduct , on the part of a <name> so beautiful  so wealthy  evidently so accomplished  of so high breeding  of so lofty a position in society  in every regard so entirely respectable as i felt assured was madame lalande ?
yes , she loved me  she returned the enthusiasm of my love , with an enthusiasm as blind  as uncompromising  as <unk>  as abandoned  and as utterly unbounded as my own !
these delicious fancies and reflections , however , were now interrupted by the falling of the <unk> .
the audience arose ; and the usual tumult immediately supervened .
quitting talbot abruptly , i made every effort to force my way into closer proximity with madame lalande .
having failed in this , on account of the crowd , i at length gave up the <name> , and bent my steps homeward ; consoling myself for my disappointment in not having been able to touch even the hem of her robe , by the reflection that i should be introduced by talbot , in due form , upon the morrow .
this morrow at last came , that is to say , a day finally dawned upon a long and weary night of impatience ; and then the hours until " one " were <unk> , dreary , and innumerable .
but even <unk> , it is said , shall have an end , and there came an end to this long delay .
the clock struck .
as the last <name> ceased , i stepped into b  's and inquired for talbot .
" out , " said the footman  talbot 's own .
" out ! "
i replied , staggering back half a dozen paces  " let me tell you , my fine fellow , that this thing is thoroughly impossible and impracticable ; mr. talbot is not out .
what do you mean ? "
" nothing , sir ; only mr. talbot is not in , that 's all .
he rode over to s  , immediately after breakfast , and left word that he would not be in town again for a week . "
i stood petrified with horror and rage .
i endeavored to reply , but my tongue refused its office .
at length i turned on my heel , livid with wrath , and inwardly <unk> the whole tribe of the <unk> to the innermost regions of <unk> .
it was evident that my considerate friend , il <unk> , had quite forgotten his appointment with myself  had forgotten it as soon as it was made .
at no time was he a very scrupulous man of his word .
there was no help for it ; so smothering my vexation as well as i could , i strolled moodily up the street , <unk> futile inquiries about madame lalande to every male acquaintance i met .
by report she was known , i found , to all  to many by sight  but she had been in town only a few weeks , and there were very few , therefore , who claimed her personal acquaintance .
these few , being still comparatively strangers , could not , or would not , take the <name> of introducing me through the formality of a morning call .
while i stood thus in despair , conversing with a trio of friends upon the all absorbing subject of my heart , it so happened that the subject itself passed by .
" as i live , there she is ! "
cried one .
" surprisingly beautiful ! "
exclaimed a second .
" an <name> upon earth ! "
ejaculated a third .
i looked ; and in an open carriage which approached us , passing slowly down the street , sat the enchanting vision of the opera , accompanied by the younger <name> who had occupied a portion of her box .
" her companion also wears remarkably well , " said the one of my trio who had spoken first .
" astonishingly , " said the second ; " still quite a brilliant air , but <name> <name> do wonders .
upon my word , she looks better than she did at <name> five years ago .
a beautiful woman still ;  do n't you think so , <unk> ?  simpson , i mean . "
" still ! "
said i , " and why should n't she be ?
but compared with her friend she is as a rush  light to the evening <name>  a glow  worm to <unk> .
" <name> !
<name> !
<name> !  why , simpson , you have an astonishing tact at making discoveries  original ones , i mean . "
and here we separated , while one of the trio began humming a <name> <unk> , of which i caught only the lines  <unk> , <unk> , <unk> a <unk>  a <unk> <unk> de <unk> !
during this little scene , however , one thing had served greatly to console me , although it fed the passion by which i was consumed .
as the carriage of madame lalande rolled by our group , i had observed that she recognized me ; and more than this , she had blessed me , by the most <unk> of all imaginable smiles , with no equivocal <name> of the recognition .
as for an introduction , i was obliged to abandon all <name> of it until such time as talbot should think proper to return from the country .
in the meantime i perseveringly frequented every reputable place of public amusement ; and , at length , at the theatre , where i first saw her , i had the supreme bliss of meeting her , and of exchanging glances with her once again .
this did not occur , however , until the lapse of a fortnight .
every day , in the <unk> , i had inquired for talbot at his hotel , and every day had been thrown into a spasm of wrath by the everlasting " not come home yet " of his footman .
upon the evening in question , therefore , i was in a condition little short of madness .
madame lalande , i had been told , was a parisian  had lately arrived from <name>  might she not suddenly return ?  return before talbot came back  and might she not be thus lost to me forever ?
the thought was too terrible to bear .
since my future happiness was at issue , i resolved to act with a manly decision .
in a word , upon the breaking up of the play , i traced the <name> to her residence , noted the address , and the next morning sent her a full and elaborate letter , in which i poured out my whole heart .
i spoke boldly , freely  in a word , i spoke with passion .
i concealed nothing  nothing even of my weakness .
i alluded to the romantic circumstances of our first meeting  even to the glances which had passed between us .
i went so far as to say that i felt assured of her love ; while i offered this assurance , and my own intensity of devotion , as two excuses for my otherwise unpardonable conduct .
as a third , i spoke of my fear that she might quit the city before i could have the opportunity of a formal introduction .
i concluded the most wildly enthusiastic epistle ever penned , with a <name> declaration of my worldly circumstances  of my affluence  and with an offer of my heart and of my hand .
in an agony of expectation i awaited the reply .
after what seemed the lapse of a century it came .
yes , actually came .
romantic as all this may appear , i really received a letter from madame lalande  the beautiful , the wealthy , the idolized madame lalande .
her eyes  her magnificent eyes , had not belied her <name> heart .
like a true <unk> as she was she had obeyed the <name> dictates of her reason  the generous impulses of her nature  <unk> the conventional <unk> of the world .
she had not scorned my proposals .
she had not sheltered herself in silence .
she had not returned my letter unopened .
she had even sent me , in reply , one penned by her own exquisite fingers .
it ran thus : " monsieur simpson vill <unk> me for not compose de <unk> <unk> of his <unk> so vell as might .
it is only de late dat i am arrive , and not yet <unk> do <unk> for to  <unk> .
" <unk> dis <unk> for the <unk> , i vill now say dat , <unk> !  monsieur simpson <unk> guess but de too true .
need i say de more ?
<unk> !
am i not ready speak de too <name> ?
" <name> <unk> . "
this <name>  spirited note i kissed a million times , and committed , no doubt , on its account , a thousand other <unk> that have now escaped my memory .
still talbot would not return .
alas !
could he have formed even the <unk> idea of the suffering his absence had occasioned his friend , would not his sympathizing nature have flown immediately to my relief ?
still , however , he came not .
i wrote .
he replied .
he was detained by urgent business  but would shortly return .
he begged me not to be impatient  to moderate my transports  to read soothing books  to drink nothing stronger than <unk>  and to bring the consolations of philosophy to my aid .
the fool !
if he could not come himself , why , in the name of every thing rational , could he not have enclosed me a letter of presentation ?
i wrote him again , entreating him to forward one forthwith .
my letter was returned by that footman , with the following <unk> in pencil .
the scoundrel had joined his master in the country : " left s  yesterday , for parts unknown  did not say where  or when be back  so thought best to return letter , knowing your handwriting , and as how you is always , more or less , in a hurry .
" yours sincerely , " <unk> . "
after this , it is needless to say , that i devoted to the infernal deities both master and valet :  but there was little use in anger , and no consolation at all in complaint .
but i had yet a resource left , in my constitutional audacity .
hitherto it had served me well , and i now resolved to make it avail me to the end .
besides , after the correspondence which had passed between us , what act of mere <unk> could i commit , within bounds , that ought to be regarded as <unk> by madame lalande ?
since the affair of the letter , i had been in the habit of watching her house , and thus discovered that , about twilight , it was her custom to promenade , attended only by a negro in livery , in a public square overlooked by her windows .
here , amid the luxuriant and <unk> groves , in the gray gloom of a sweet midsummer evening , i observed my opportunity and accosted her .
the better to deceive the servant in attendance , i did this with the assured air of an old and familiar acquaintance .
with a presence of mind truly parisian , she took the cue at once , and , to greet me , held out the most <unk> little of hands .
the valet at once fell into the rear , and now , with hearts full to overflowing , we discoursed long and unreservedly of our love .
as madame lalande spoke english even less fluently than she wrote it , our conversation was necessarily in french .
in this sweet tongue , so adapted to passion , i gave loose to the impetuous enthusiasm of my nature , and , with all the eloquence i could command , besought her to consent to an immediate marriage .
at this impatience she smiled .
she urged the old story of decorum  that <unk> which <unk> so many from bliss until the opportunity for bliss has forever gone by .
i had most <unk> made it known among my friends , she observed , that i desired her acquaintance  thus that i did not possess it  thus , again , there was no possibility of concealing the date of our first knowledge of each other .
and then she <unk> , with a blush , to the extreme <unk> of this date .
to wed immediately would be improper  would be <unk>  would be <unk> .
all this she said with a charming air of <unk> which <unk> while it grieved and convinced me .
she went even so far as to accuse me , laughingly , of rashness  of <unk> .
she bade me remember that i really even know not who she was  what were her prospects , her connections , her standing in society .
she begged me , but with a sigh , to reconsider my proposal , and termed my love an infatuation  a <name> o ' the wisp  a fancy or <unk> of the moment  a <unk> and unstable creation rather of the imagination than of the heart .
these things she uttered as the shadows of the sweet twilight gathered darkly and more darkly around us  and then , with a gentle pressure of her <unk> hand , <unk> , in a single sweet instant , all the <unk> fabric she had reared .
i replied as best i could  as only a true lover can .
i spoke at length , and perseveringly of my devotion , of my passion  of her exceeding beauty , and of my own enthusiastic admiration .
in conclusion , i dwelt , with a convincing energy , upon the perils that <unk> the course of love  that course of true love that never did run smooth  and thus deduced the manifest danger of rendering that course unnecessarily long .
this latter argument seemed finally to soften the <unk> of her determination .
she relented ; but there was yet an obstacle , she said , which she felt assured i had not properly considered .
this was a delicate point  for a woman to urge , especially so ; in mentioning it , she saw that she must make a sacrifice of her feelings ; still , for me , every sacrifice should be made .
she alluded to the topic of age .
was i aware  was i fully aware of the discrepancy between us ?
that the age of the husband , should surpass by a few years  even by fifteen or twenty  the age of the wife , was regarded by the world as admissible , and , indeed , as even proper , but she had always entertained the belief that the years of the wife should never exceed in number those of the husband .
a discrepancy of this unnatural kind gave rise , too frequently , alas !
to a life of unhappiness .
now she was aware that my own age did not exceed two and twenty ; and i , on the contrary , perhaps , was not aware that the years of my <name> extended very considerably beyond that sum .
about all this there was a nobility of soul  a dignity of candor  which delighted  which enchanted me  which eternally riveted my chains .
i could scarcely restrain the excessive transport which possessed me .
" my sweetest <name> , " i cried , " what is all this about which you are <unk> ?
your years surpass in some measure my own .
but what then ?
the customs of the world are so many conventional follies .
to those who love as ourselves , in what respect differs a year from an hour ?
i am twenty-two , you say , granted : indeed , you may as well call me , at once , twenty-three .
now you yourself , my dearest <name> , can have numbered no more than  can have numbered no more than  no more than  than  than  than  " here i paused for an instant , in the expectation that madame lalande would interrupt me by supplying her true age .
but a <unk> is seldom direct , and has always , by way of answer to an embarrassing query , some little practical reply of her own .
in the present instance , <name> , who for a few moments past had seemed to be searching for something in her bosom , at length let fall upon the grass a miniature , which i immediately picked up and presented to her .
" keep it ! "
she said , with one of her most <unk> smiles .
" keep it for my sake  for the sake of her whom it too <unk> represents .
besides , upon the back of the <unk> you may discover , perhaps , the very information you seem to <name> .
it is now , to be sure , growing rather dark  but you can examine it at your leisure in the morning .
in the meantime , you shall be my escort home to-night .
my friends are about holding a little musical levee .
i can promise you , too , some good singing .
we french are not nearly so <unk> as you americans , and i shall have no difficulty in <unk> you in , in the character of an old acquaintance . "
with this , she took my arm , and i attended her home .
the mansion was quite a fine one , and , i believe , furnished in good taste .
of this latter point , however , i am scarcely qualified to judge ; for it was just dark as we arrived ; and in american mansions of the better sort lights seldom , during the heat of summer , make their appearance at this , the most pleasant period of the day .
in about an hour after my arrival , to be sure , a single shaded solar lamp was lit in the principal drawing-room ; and this apartment , i could thus see , was arranged with unusual good taste and even splendor ; but two other rooms of the suite , and in which the company chiefly assembled , remained , during the whole evening , in a very agreeable shadow .
this is a <unk> custom , giving the party at least a choice of light or shade , and one which our friends over the water could not do better than immediately adopt .
the evening thus spent was unquestionably the most delicious of my life .
madame lalande had not overrated the musical abilities of her friends ; and the singing i here heard i had never heard excelled in any private circle out of vienna .
the instrumental performers were many and of superior talents .
the <unk> were chiefly ladies , and no individual sang less than well .
at length , upon a peremptory call for " madame lalande , " she arose at once , without affectation or demur , from the chaise <unk> upon which she had sat by my side , and , accompanied by one or two gentlemen and her female friend of the opera , repaired to the piano in the main drawing-room .
i would have escorted her myself , but felt that , under the circumstances of my introduction to the house , i had better remain unobserved where i was .
i was thus deprived of the pleasure of seeing , although not of hearing , her sing .
the impression she produced upon the company seemed electrical but the effect upon myself was something even more .
i know not how adequately to describe it .
it arose in part , no doubt , from the sentiment of love with which i was imbued ; but chiefly from my conviction of the extreme sensibility of the singer .
it is beyond the reach of <name> to <unk> either air or <unk> with more impassioned expression than was hers .
her utterance of the romance in <unk>  the tone with which she gave the words " <unk> <unk> <unk> , " in the <unk>  is ringing in my memory yet .
her lower tones were absolutely miraculous .
her voice embraced three complete <unk> , extending from the <unk> d to the d upper <unk> , and , though sufficiently powerful to have filled the san <name> , executed , with the minutest precision , every difficulty of vocal <unk> and descending scales , cadences , or <unk> .
in the final of the <unk> , she brought about a most remarkable effect at the words : ah !
non <unk> <unk> <unk> <name> <unk> <unk> <unk> son <unk> .
here , in imitation of <unk> , she modified the original phrase of <unk> , so as to let her voice descend to the tenor g , when , by a rapid transition , she struck the g above the treble <unk> , springing over an interval of two <unk> .
upon rising from the piano after these miracles of vocal execution , she resumed her seat by my side ; when i expressed to her , in terms of the deepest enthusiasm , my delight at her performance .
of my surprise i said nothing , and yet was i most <unk> surprised ; for a certain feebleness , or rather a certain tremulous indecision of voice in ordinary conversation , had prepared me to anticipate that , in singing , she would not acquit herself with any remarkable ability .
our conversation was now long , <name> , uninterrupted , and totally <unk> .
she made me relate many of the earlier passages of my life , and listened with breathless attention to every word of the narrative .
i concealed nothing  felt that i had a right to conceal nothing  from her confiding affection .
encouraged by her candor upon the delicate point of her age , i entered , with perfect frankness , not only into a detail of my many minor vices , but made full confession of those moral and even of those physical infirmities , the disclosure of which , in demanding so much higher a degree of courage , is so much surer an evidence of love .
i touched upon my college <unk>  upon my <unk>  upon my <unk>  upon my debts  upon my flirtations .
i even went so far as to speak of a slightly <unk> cough with which , at one time , i had been troubled  of a chronic rheumatism  of a twinge of hereditary gout  and , in conclusion , of the disagreeable and inconvenient , but hitherto carefully concealed , weakness of my eyes .
" upon this latter point , " said madame lalande , laughingly , " you have been surely <unk> in coming to confession ; for , without the confession , i take it for granted that no one would have accused you of the crime .
by the by , " she continued , " have you any recollection " and here i fancied that a blush , even through the gloom of the apartment , became distinctly visible upon her cheek  " have you any recollection , mon <name> <name> of this little <unk> assistant , which now depends from my neck ? "
as she spoke she twirled in her fingers the identical double eye-glass which had so overwhelmed me with confusion at the opera .
" full well  alas !
do i remember it , " i exclaimed , pressing passionately the delicate hand which offered the glasses for my inspection .
they formed a complex and magnificent toy , richly chased and <unk> , and gleaming with jewels , which , even in the deficient light , i could not help perceiving were of high value .
" eh bien !
mon <name> " she resumed with a certain <unk> of manner that rather surprised me  " eh bien !
mon <name> , you have earnestly besought of me a favor which you have been pleased to <unk> priceless .
you have demanded of me my hand upon the morrow .
should i yield to your entreaties  and , i may add , to the pleadings of my own bosom  would i not be entitled to demand of you a very  a very little boon in return ? "
" name it ! "
i exclaimed with an energy that had nearly drawn upon us the observation of the company , and restrained by their presence alone from throwing myself impetuously at her feet .
" name it , my beloved , my <name> , my own !  name it !  but , alas !
it is already yielded ere named . "
" you shall conquer , then , mon <name> , " said she , " for the sake of the <name> whom you love , this little weakness which you have at last confessed  this weakness more moral than physical  and which , let me assure you , is so unbecoming the nobility of your real nature  so inconsistent with the candor of your usual character  and which , if permitted further control , <name> assuredly involve you , sooner or later , in some very disagreeable scrape .
you shall conquer , for my sake , this affectation which leads you , as you yourself acknowledge , to the tacit or implied denial of your infirmity of vision .
for , this infirmity you virtually deny , in refusing to employ the customary means for its relief .
you <name> understand me to say , then , that i wish you to wear spectacles ;  ah , hush !  you have already consented to wear them , for my sake .
you shall accept the little toy which i now hold in my hand , and which , though admirable as an aid to vision , is really of no very immense value as a gem .
you perceive that , by a trifling modification thus  or thus  it can be adapted to the eyes in the form of spectacles , or worn in the waistcoat pocket as an eye-glass .
it is in the former mode , however , and habitually , that you have already consented to wear it for my sake . "
this request  must i confess it ?  confused me in no little degree .
but the condition with which it was coupled rendered hesitation , of course , a matter altogether out of the question .
" it is done ! "
i cried , with all the enthusiasm that i could muster at the moment .
" it is done  it is most cheerfully agreed .
i sacrifice every feeling for your sake .
to-night i wear this dear eye-glass , as an eye-glass , and upon my heart ; but with the earliest <name> of that morning which gives me the pleasure of calling you wife , i <name> place it upon my  upon my nose ,  and there wear it ever afterward , in the less romantic , and less fashionable , but certainly in the more serviceable , form which you <name> . "
our conversation now turned upon the details of our arrangements for the morrow .
talbot , i learned from my betrothed , had just arrived in town .
i was to see him at once , and procure a carriage .
the <unk> would scarcely break up before two ; and by this hour the vehicle was to be at the door , when , in the confusion occasioned by the departure of the company , madame l. could easily enter it unobserved .
we were then to call at the house of a clergyman who would be in waiting ; there be married , drop talbot , and proceed on a short tour to the east , leaving the fashionable world at home to make whatever comments upon the matter it thought best .
having planned all this , i immediately took leave , and went in search of talbot , but , on the way , i could not refrain from stepping into a hotel , for the purpose of inspecting the miniature ; and this i did by the powerful aid of the glasses .
the countenance was a <unk> beautiful one !
those large luminous eyes !  that proud grecian nose !  those dark luxuriant curls !  " ah ! "
said i , <unk> to myself , " this is indeed the speaking image of my beloved ! "
i turned the reverse , and discovered the words  " <name> lalande  aged twenty-seven years and seven months . "
i found talbot at home , and proceeded at once to acquaint him with my good fortune .
he professed excessive astonishment , of course , but congratulated me most cordially , and proffered every assistance in his power .
in a word , we carried out our arrangement to the letter , and , at two in the morning , just ten minutes after the ceremony , i found myself in a close carriage with madame lalande  with mrs. simpson , i should say  and driving at a great rate out of town , in a direction northeast by north , <unk> .
it had been determined for us by talbot , that , as we were to be up all night , we should make our first stop at c  , a village about twenty miles from the city , and there get an early breakfast and some repose , before proceeding upon our route .
at four precisely , therefore , the carriage <name> up at the door of the principal inn .
i handed my adored wife out , and ordered breakfast forthwith .
in the meantime we were shown into a small parlor , and sat down .
it was now nearly if not altogether daylight ; and , as i gazed , <unk> , at the <name> by my side , the singular idea came , all at once , into my head , that this was really the very first moment since my acquaintance with the celebrated loveliness of madame lalande , that i had enjoyed a near inspection of that loveliness by daylight at all .
" and now , mon <name> , " said she , taking my hand , and so interrupting this train of reflection , " and now , mon <name> <name> , since we are <unk> one  since i have yielded to your passionate entreaties , and performed my portion of our agreement  i presume you have not forgotten that you also have a little favor to bestow  a little promise which it is your intention to keep .
ah !
let me see !
let me remember !
yes ; full easily do i call to mind the precise words of the dear promise you made to <name> last night .
listen !
you spoke thus : 'it is done !  it is most cheerfully agreed !
i sacrifice every feeling for your sake .
to-night i wear this dear eye-glass as an eye-glass , and upon my heart ; but with the earliest <name> of that morning which gives me the privilege of calling you wife , i <name> place it upon my  upon my nose ,  and there wear it ever afterward , in the less romantic , and less fashionable , but certainly in the more serviceable , form which you <name> . '
these were the exact words , my beloved husband , were they not ? "
" they were , " i said ; " you have an excellent memory ; and assuredly , my beautiful <name> , there is no disposition on my part to evade the performance of the trivial promise they imply .
see !
behold !
they are becoming  rather  are they not ? "
and here , having arranged the glasses in the ordinary form of spectacles , i applied them gingerly in their proper position ; while madame simpson , adjusting her cap , and folding her arms , sat bolt upright in her chair , in a somewhat stiff and prim , and indeed , in a somewhat undignified position .
" goodness gracious me ! "
i exclaimed , almost at the very instant that the rim of the spectacles had settled upon my nose  " my goodness gracious me !  why , what can be the matter with these glasses ? "
and taking them quickly off , i wiped them carefully with a silk handkerchief , and adjusted them again .
but if , in the first instance , there had occurred something which occasioned me surprise , in the second , this surprise became elevated into astonishment ; and this astonishment was profound  was extreme  indeed i may say it was <unk> .
what , in the name of everything hideous , did this mean ?
could i believe my eyes ?  could i ?  that was the question .
was that  was that  was that rouge ?
and were those  and were those  were those wrinkles , upon the visage of <name> lalande ?
and oh !
jupiter , and every one of the gods and goddesses , little and big !
what  what  what  what had become of her teeth ?
i dashed the spectacles violently to the ground , and , leaping to my feet , stood erect in the middle of the floor , confronting mrs. simpson , with my arms set <unk> , and grinning and foaming , but , at the same time , utterly speechless with terror and with rage .
now i have already said that madame <name> lalande  that is to say , simpson  spoke the english language but very little better than she wrote it , and for this reason she very properly never attempted to speak it upon ordinary occasions .
but rage <name> <name> a <name> to any extreme ; and in the present care it carried mrs. simpson to the very extraordinary extreme of attempting to hold a conversation in a tongue that she did not altogether understand .
" vell , monsieur , " said she , after surveying me , in great apparent astonishment , for some moments  " vell , monsieur ?  and vat den ?  vat de matter now ?
is it de dance of de saint <unk> dat you <unk> ?
if not like me , vat for vy buy de pig in the poke ? "
" you wretch ! "
said i , catching my breath  " you  you  you villainous old <unk> ! "
" <unk> ?  ole ?  me not so ver ole , after all !
me not one single day more <name> de <unk> . "
" eighty-two ! "
i ejaculated , staggering to the wall  " eighty-two hundred thousand baboons !
the miniature said twenty-seven years and seven months ! "
" to be sure !  dat is so !  ver true !
but den de <unk> has been take for dese fifty-five year .
ven i go marry my <unk> <unk> , monsieur lalande , at dat time i had de <unk> take for my daughter by my first <unk> , monsieur <unk> ! "
" <unk> ! "
said i .
" yes , <unk> , " said she , <unk> my pronunciation , which , to speak the truth , was none of the best ,  " and vat den ?
vat you know about de <unk> ? "
" nothing , you old fright !  i know nothing about him at all ; only i had an ancestor of that name , once upon a time . "
" dat name !
and vat you <unk> for say to dat name ?
't is ver goot name ; and so is <unk>  dat is ver goot name too .
my daughter , mademoiselle <unk> , she marry <name> monsieur <unk> ,  and de name is bot ver <unk> name . "
" <unk> ? "
i exclaimed , " and <unk> !
why , what is it you mean ? "
" vat i mean ?  i mean <unk> and <unk> ; and for de matter of dat , i mean <unk> and <unk> , too , if i only <unk> proper to mean it .
my daughter 's daughter , mademoiselle <unk> , she marry <name> monsieur <unk> , and den again , my daughter 's grande daughter , mademoiselle <unk> , she marry <name> monsieur <unk> ; and i suppose you say dat dat is not <name> ver <unk> <unk> " " <unk> ! "
said i , beginning to faint , " why , surely you do n't say <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> ? "
" yes , " she replied , leaning fully back in her chair , and stretching out her lower limbs at great length ; " yes , <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> , and <unk> .
but monsieur <unk> , he vas <name> ver big vat you call fool  he vas <name> ver great big <unk> like yourself  for he lef la <name> <name> for come to dis <unk> <unk>  and ven he get here he went and <unk> <name> ver <unk> , <name> ver , ver <unk> <unk> , so i hear , dough i not yet av ad de <unk> to meet <unk> him  neither me nor my companion , de madame <name> lalande .
he is name de <name> bonaparte <unk> , and i suppose you say dat dat , too , is not <name> ver respectable name . "
either the length or the nature of this speech , had the effect of working up mrs. simpson into a very extraordinary passion indeed ; and as she made an end of it , with great labor , she <unk> up from her chair like somebody bewitched , dropping upon the floor an entire universe of bustle as she <unk> .
once upon her feet , she <unk> her gums , <unk> her arms , rolled up her sleeves , shook her fist in my face , and concluded the performance by tearing the cap from her head , and with it an immense wig of the most valuable and beautiful black hair , the whole of which she dashed upon the ground with a yell , and there <unk> and danced a <unk> upon it , in an absolute ecstasy and agony of rage .
meantime i sank aghast into the chair which she had vacated .
" <unk> and <unk> ! "
i repeated , thoughtfully , as she cut one of her <unk> , and " <unk> and <unk> ! "
as she completed another  " <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <name> bonaparte <unk> !  why , you ineffable old serpent , that 's me  that 's me  d 'ye hear ?
that 's me "  here i screamed at the top of my voice  " that's <unk> !
i am <name> bonaparte <unk> !
and if i <unk> n't married my great , great , grandmother , i wish i may be <unk> confounded ! "
madame <name> lalande , <unk> simpson  formerly <unk>  was , in sober fact , my great , great , grandmother .
in her youth she had been beautiful , and even at eighty-two , retained the majestic height , the <unk> contour of head , the fine eyes and the grecian nose of her <unk> .
by the aid of these , of <unk> , of rouge , of false hair , false teeth , and false <unk> , as well as of the most skilful <unk> of <name> , she contrived to hold a respectable footing among the beauties en <unk> <unk> of the french metropolis .
in this respect , indeed , she might have been regarded as little less than the equal of the celebrated <unk> de <unk> .
she was immensely wealthy , and being left , for the second time , a widow without children , she bethought herself of my existence in <name> , and for the purpose of making me her heir , paid a visit to the united states , in company with a distant and exceedingly lovely relative of her second husband 's  a madame <name> lalande .
at the opera , my great , great , grandmother 's attention was arrested by my notice ; and , upon surveying me through her eye-glass , she was struck with a certain family resemblance to herself .
thus interested , and knowing that the heir she sought was actually in the city , she made inquiries of her party respecting me .
the gentleman who attended her knew my person , and told her who i was .
the information thus obtained induced her to renew her scrutiny ; and this scrutiny it was which so emboldened me that i behaved in the absurd manner already detailed .
she returned my bow , however , under the impression that , by some odd accident , i had discovered her identity .
when , deceived by my weakness of vision , and the arts of the toilet , in respect to the age and charms of the strange <name> , i demanded so enthusiastically of talbot who she was , he concluded that i meant the younger beauty , as a matter of course , and so informed me , with perfect truth , that she was " the celebrated widow , madame lalande . "
in the street , next morning , my great , great , grandmother encountered talbot , an old parisian acquaintance ; and the conversation , very naturally turned upon myself .
my deficiencies of vision were then explained ; for these were notorious , although i was entirely ignorant of their notoriety , and my good old relative discovered , much to her chagrin , that she had been deceived in supposing me aware of her identity , and that i had been merely making a fool of myself in making open love , in a theatre , to an old woman unknown .
by way of punishing me for this <unk> , she concocted with talbot a plot .
he purposely kept out of my way to avoid giving me the introduction .
my street inquiries about " the lovely widow , madame lalande , " were supposed to refer to the younger <name> , of course , and thus the conversation with the three gentlemen whom i encountered shortly after leaving talbot 's hotel <name> be easily explained , as also their allusion to <unk> de <unk> .
i had no opportunity of seeing madame lalande closely during daylight ; and , at her musical <unk> , my silly weakness in refusing the aid of glasses effectually prevented me from making a discovery of her age .
when " madame lalande " was called upon to sing , the younger <name> was intended ; and it was she who arose to obey the call ; my great , great , grandmother , to further the deception , arising at the same moment and accompanying her to the piano in the main drawing-room .
had i decided upon escorting her thither , it had been her design to suggest the propriety of my remaining where i was ; but my own prudential views rendered this unnecessary .
the songs which i so much admired , and which so confirmed my impression of the youth of my mistress , were executed by madame <name> lalande .
the <unk> was presented by way of adding a reproof to the hoax  a sting to the <unk> of the deception .
its presentation afforded an opportunity for the lecture upon affectation with which i was so especially <unk> .
it is almost superfluous to add that the glasses of the instrument , as worn by the old <name> , had been exchanged by her for a pair better adapted to my years .
they suited me , in fact , to a t. the clergyman , who merely pretended to tie the fatal knot , was a boon companion of talbot 's , and no priest .
he was an excellent " whip , " however ; and having <unk> his <unk> to put on a <unk> , he drove the hack which conveyed the " happy couple " out of town .
talbot took a seat at his side .
the two scoundrels were thus " in at the death , " and through a <unk> window of the back parlor of the inn , amused themselves in grinning at the <unk> of the drama .
i believe i shall be forced to call them both out .
nevertheless , i am not the husband of my great , great , grandmother ; and this is a reflection which affords me infinite relief ,  but i am the husband of madame lalande  of madame <name> lalande  with whom my good old relative , besides making me her sole heir when she dies  if she ever does  has been at the trouble of <unk> me a match .
in conclusion : i am done forever with billets <unk> and am never to be met without spectacles .
king pest .
a tale containing an allegory .
the gods do bear and <name> allow in kings the things which they abhor in rascal routes .
<unk> 's tragedy of <unk> and <unk> about twelve o'clock , one night in the month of october , and during the chivalrous reign of the third <name> , two seamen belonging to the crew of the " free and easy , " a trading schooner plying between <unk> and the thames , and then at anchor in that river , were much astonished to find themselves seated in the <unk> of an <unk> in the parish of st. andrews , london  which <unk> bore for sign the <unk> of a " jolly tar . "
the room , although <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and in every other respect agreeing with the general character of such places at the period  was , nevertheless , in the opinion of the grotesque groups scattered here and there within it , sufficiently well adapted to its purpose .
of these groups our two seamen formed , i think , the most interesting , if not the most conspicuous .
the one who appeared to be the elder , and whom his companion addressed by the characteristic appellation of " legs , " was at the same time much the taller of the two .
he might have measured six feet and a half , and an habitual stoop in the shoulders seemed to have been the necessary consequence of an altitude so <unk>  <unk> in height were , however , more than accounted for by deficiencies in other respects .
he was exceedingly thin ; and might , as his associates asserted , have answered , when drunk , for a <unk> at the <unk> , or , when sober , have served for a <unk> .
but these jests , and others of a similar nature , had evidently produced , at no time , any effect upon the <unk> muscles of the tar .
with high cheek-bones , a large <unk> , retreating <name> , fallen <unk> , and huge protruding white eyes , the expression of his countenance , although tinged with a species of dogged indifference to matters and things in general , was not the less utterly solemn and serious beyond all attempts at imitation or description .
the younger seaman was , in all outward appearance , the converse of his companion .
his stature could not have exceeded four feet .
a pair of stumpy <unk> supported his squat , unwieldy figure , while his unusually short and thick arms , with no ordinary fists at their extremities , swung off dangling from his sides like the fins of a <unk> .
small eyes , of no particular color , twinkled far back in his head .
his nose remained buried in the mass of flesh which enveloped his round , full , and purple face ; and his thick <unk> rested upon the still thicker one beneath with an air of complacent <unk> , much heightened by the owner 's habit of licking them at intervals .
he evidently regarded his tall <unk> with a feeling <unk> , <unk> ; and stared up occasionally in his face as the red setting sun stares up at the crags of <name> <unk> .
various and eventful , however , had been the <unk> of the worthy couple in and about the different <unk> of the neighbourhood during the earlier hours of the night .
funds even the most ample , are not always everlasting : and it was with empty pockets our friends had ventured upon the present <unk> .
at the precise period , then , when this history properly commences , legs , and his fellow <name> tarpaulin , sat , each with both elbows resting upon the large oaken table in the middle of the floor , and with a hand upon either cheek .
they were eyeing , from behind a huge <unk> of <unk> " <unk> , " the portentous words , " no chalk , " which to their indignation and astonishment were scored over the doorway by means of that very mineral whose presence they <unk> to deny .
not that the gift of <unk> written characters  a gift among the <unk> of that day considered little less <unk> than the <name> of <unk>  could , in strict justice , have been laid to the charge of either disciple of the sea ; but there was , to say the truth , a certain twist in the formation of the letters  an indescribable <unk> about the whole  which <unk> , in the opinion of both seamen , a long run of dirty weather ; and determined them at once , in the <unk> words of legs himself , to " pump ship , clew up all sail , and scud before the wind . "
having accordingly disposed of what remained of the ale , and looped up the points of their short <unk> , they finally made a bolt for the street .
although tarpaulin rolled twice into the fire-place , mistaking it for the door , yet their escape was at length happily effected  and half after twelve o'clock found our heroes ripe for mischief , and running for life down a dark alley in the direction of st. <unk> stair , hotly pursued by the landlady of the " jolly tar . "
at the epoch of this eventful tale , and periodically , for many years before and after , all england , but more especially the metropolis , resounded with the fearful cry of " plague ! "
the city was in a great measure <unk>  and in those horrible regions , in the vicinity of the thames , where amid the dark , narrow , and filthy lanes and alleys , the demon of disease was supposed to have had his nativity , awe , terror , and superstition were alone to be found stalking abroad .
by authority of the king such districts were placed under ban , and all persons forbidden , under pain of death , to intrude upon their dismal solitude .
yet neither the <unk> of the monarch , nor the huge barriers erected at the entrances of the streets , nor the prospect of that loathsome death which , with almost absolute certainty , overwhelmed the wretch whom no peril could <unk> from the adventure , prevented the <unk> and <unk> dwellings from being stripped , by the hand of nightly <unk> , of every article , such as iron , brass , or <unk> , which could in any manner be turned to a profitable account .
above all , it was usually found , upon the annual <name> opening of the barriers , that locks , bolts , and secret cellars , had proved but slender protection to those <name> stores of wines and liquors which , in consideration of the risk and trouble of removal , many of the numerous dealers having shops in the neighbourhood had consented to trust , during the period of exile , to so insufficient a security .
but there were very few of the terror-stricken people who attributed these doings to the agency of human hands .
<unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , were the popular <unk> of mischief ; and tales so <unk> were hourly told , that the whole mass of forbidden buildings was , at length , enveloped in terror as in a shroud , and the <unk> himself was often scared away by the horrors his own <unk> had created ; leaving the entire vast circuit of prohibited district to gloom , silence , pestilence , and death .
it was by one of the terrific barriers already mentioned , and which indicated the region beyond to be under the <unk> , that , in scrambling down an alley , legs and the worthy <name> tarpaulin found their progress suddenly impeded .
to return was out of the question , and no time was to be lost , as their pursuers were close upon their heels .
with <unk> seamen to clamber up the roughly fashioned <unk> was a trifle ; and , maddened with the twofold excitement of exercise and liquor , they leaped unhesitatingly down within the enclosure , and holding on their drunken course with shouts and <unk> , were soon bewildered in its <unk> and intricate recesses .
had they not , indeed , been intoxicated beyond moral sense , their reeling footsteps must have been <unk> by the horrors of their situation .
the air was cold and <name> .
the <unk> , loosened from their beds , lay in wild disorder amid the tall , rank grass , which sprang up around the feet and ankles .
fallen houses choked up the streets .
the most fetid and poisonous smells everywhere prevailed ;  and by the aid of that ghastly light which , even at midnight , never fails to <unk> from a <unk> and <unk> at atmosphere , might be discerned lying in the <unk> and alleys , or rotting in the <unk> habitations , the carcass of many a nocturnal <unk> arrested by the hand of the plague in the very <unk> of his robbery .
 but it lay not in the power of images , or sensations , or <unk> such as these , to stay the course of men who , naturally brave , and at that time especially , brimful of courage and of " <unk> ! "
would have reeled , as straight as their condition might have permitted , <unk> into the very jaws of death .
onward  still onward stalked the grim legs , making the desolate solemnity <name> and <unk> with yells like the terrific war-whoop of the indian : and onward , still onward rolled the <unk> tarpaulin , hanging on to the doublet of his more active companion , and far surpassing the latter 's most strenuous exertions in the way of vocal music , by <unk> in <unk> , from the profundity of his <unk> lungs .
they had now evidently reached the strong hold of the pestilence .
their way at every step or plunge grew more <unk> and more horrible  the paths more narrow and more intricate .
huge stones and beams falling momently from the decaying roofs above them , gave evidence , by their sullen and heavy descent , of the vast height of the surrounding houses ; and while actual exertion became necessary to force a passage through frequent heaps of rubbish , it was by no means seldom that the hand fell upon a skeleton or rested upon a more <unk> corpse .
suddenly , as the seamen stumbled against the entrance of a tall and <unk> building , a yell more than usually shrill from the throat of the excited legs , was replied to from within , in a rapid succession of wild , <unk> , and fiendish shrieks .
nothing <unk> at sounds which , of such a nature , at such a time , and in such a place , might have <unk> the very blood in hearts less irrevocably on fire , the drunken couple rushed headlong against the door , burst it open , and staggered into the midst of things with a volley of curses .
the room within which they found themselves proved to be the shop of an undertaker ; but an open trap-door , in a corner of the floor near the entrance , looked down upon a long range of <unk> , whose depths the occasional sound of bursting bottles proclaimed to be well stored with their appropriate contents .
in the middle of the room stood a table  in the centre of which again arose a huge tub of what appeared to be punch .
bottles of various wines and <unk> , together with <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> of every shape and quality , were scattered profusely upon the board .
around it , upon <unk> , was seated a company of six .
this company i <name> endeavor to <unk> one by one .
fronting the entrance , and elevated a little above his companions , sat a personage who appeared to be the president of the table .
his stature was gaunt and tall , and legs was confounded to behold in him a figure more emaciated than himself .
his face was as yellow as saffron  but no feature excepting one alone , was sufficiently marked to merit a particular description .
this one consisted in a forehead so unusually and hideously lofty , as to have the appearance of a bonnet or crown of flesh <unk> upon the natural head .
his mouth was puckered and dimpled into an expression of ghastly <unk> , and his eyes , as indeed the eyes of all at table , were glazed over with the fumes of intoxication .
this gentleman was clothed from head to foot in a <unk> black <unk> pall , wrapped <unk> around his form after the fashion of a spanish <unk>  his head was stuck full of sable <unk> , which he nodded to and fro with a <unk> and knowing air ; and , in his right hand , he held a huge human <unk> , with which he appeared to have been just knocking down some member of the company for a song .
opposite him , and with her back to the door , was a <name> of no whit the less extraordinary character .
although quite as tall as the person just described , she had no right to complain of his unnatural <unk> .
she was evidently in the last stage of a <unk> ; and her figure resembled nearly that of the huge puncheon of october beer which stood , with the head driven in , close by her side , in a corner of the chamber .
her face was exceedingly round , red , and full ; and the same peculiarity , or rather want of peculiarity , attached itself to her countenance , which i before mentioned in the case of the president  that is to say , only one feature of her face was sufficiently distinguished to need a separate <unk> : indeed the acute tarpaulin immediately observed that the same remark might have applied to each individual person of the party ; every one of whom seemed to possess a monopoly of some particular portion of physiognomy .
with the <name> in question this portion proved to be the mouth .
commencing at the right ear , it swept with a terrific chasm to the left  the short <unk> which she wore in either <unk> continually bobbing into the aperture .
she made , however , every exertion to keep her mouth closed and look dignified , in a dress consisting of a newly <unk> and <unk> shroud coming up close under her <name> , with a <unk> ruffle of <unk> muslin .
at her right hand sat a diminutive young <name> whom she appeared to <unk> .
this delicate little creature , in the trembling of her wasted fingers , in the livid <name> of her lips , and in the slight <unk> spot which tinged her otherwise leaden complexion , gave evident indications of a galloping consumption .
an air of gave extreme <unk> ton , however , pervaded her whole appearance ; she wore in a graceful and <unk> manner , a large and beautiful <unk> of the finest <name> lawn ; her hair <name> in ringlets over her neck ; a soft smile played about her mouth ; but her nose , extremely long , thin , sinuous , flexible and <unk> , <name> down far below her under lip , and in spite of the delicate manner in which she now and then moved it to one side or the other with her tongue , gave to her countenance a somewhat equivocal expression .
over against her , and upon the left of the <unk> <name> , was seated a little puffy , wheezing , and <unk> old man , whose cheeks reposed upon the shoulders of their owner , like two huge bladders of <unk> wine .
with his arms folded , and with one bandaged leg deposited upon the table , he seemed to think himself entitled to some consideration .
he evidently prided himself much upon every inch of his personal appearance , but took more especial delight in calling attention to his <unk> <unk> .
this , to say the truth , must have cost him no little money , and was made to fit him exceedingly well  being fashioned from one of the curiously embroidered silken covers <unk> to those glorious <unk> which , in england and elsewhere , are customarily <name> up , in some conspicuous place , upon the dwellings of departed aristocracy .
next to him , and at the right hand of the president , was a gentleman in long white hose and cotton drawers .
his frame shook , in a ridiculous manner , with a fit of what tarpaulin called " the horrors . "
his jaws , which had been newly shaved , were tightly tied up by a bandage of muslin ; and his arms being fastened in a similar way at the wrists , i i prevented him from helping himself too freely to the liquors upon the table ; a precaution rendered necessary , in the opinion of legs , by the peculiarly <unk> and <unk> cast of his visage .
a pair of prodigious ears , nevertheless , which it was no doubt found impossible to confine , towered away into the atmosphere of the apartment , and were occasionally pricked up in a spasm , at the sound of the drawing of a cork .
fronting him , <unk> and lastly , was situated a singularly <unk> personage , who , being afflicted with paralysis , must , to speak seriously , have felt very ill at ease in his <unk> <unk> .
he was <unk> , somewhat <unk> , in a new and handsome mahogany coffin .
its top or <unk> pressed upon the skull of the wearer , and extended over it in the fashion of a hood , giving to the entire face an air of indescribable interest .
<unk> had been cut in the sides , for the sake not more of elegance than of convenience ; but the dress , nevertheless , prevented its proprietor from sitting as erect as his associates ; and as he lay reclining against his <unk> , at an <name> of forty-five degrees , a pair of huge <unk> eyes rolled up their awful whites towards the ceiling in absolute amazement at their own enormity .
before each of the party lay a portion of a skull , which was used as a drinking cup .
overhead was suspended a human skeleton , by means of a rope tied round one of the legs and fastened to a ring in the ceiling .
the other limb , confined by no such fetter , stuck off from the body at right angles , causing the whole loose and rattling frame to <unk> and <unk> about at the <name> of every occasional puff of wind which found its way into the apartment .
in the <unk> of this hideous thing lay quantity of ignited charcoal , which threw a fitful but vivid light over the entire scene ; while coffins , and other wares <unk> to the shop of an undertaker , were piled high up around the room , and against the windows , preventing any <name> from escaping into the street .
at sight of this extraordinary assembly , and of their still more extraordinary paraphernalia , our two seamen did not conduct themselves with that degree of decorum which might have been expected .
legs , leaning against the wall near which he happened to be standing , dropped his lower jaw still lower than usual , and spread open his eyes to their fullest extent : while <name> tarpaulin , stooping down so as to bring his nose upon a level with the table , and spreading out a palm upon either knee , burst into a long , loud , and <unk> roar of very <unk> and immoderate laughter .
without , however , taking offence at behaviour so excessively rude , the tall president smiled very graciously upon the intruders  nodded to them in a dignified manner with his head of sable plumes  and , arising , took each by an arm , and led him to a seat which some others of the company had placed in the meantime for his accommodation .
legs to all this offered not the slightest resistance , but sat down as he was directed ; while the gallant <name> , removing his coffin <unk> from its station near the head of the table , to the vicinity of the little <unk> <name> in the winding sheet , <unk> down by her side in high glee , and pouring out a skull of red wine , <unk> it to their better acquaintance .
but at this presumption the stiff gentleman in the coffin seemed exceedingly nettled ; and serious consequences might have ensued , had not the president , rapping upon the table with his <unk> , diverted the attention of all present to the following speech : " it becomes our duty upon the present happy occasion "  " avast there ! "
interrupted legs , looking very serious , " avast there a bit , i say , and tell us who the devil ye all are , and what business ye have here , rigged off like the foul fiends , and <unk> the snug blue ruin stowed away for the <name> by my honest <unk> , <name> <unk> the undertaker ! "
at this unpardonable piece of <unk> , all the original company half started to their feet , and uttered the same rapid succession of wild fiendish shrieks which had before caught the attention of the seamen .
the president , however , was the first to recover his composure , and at length , turning to legs with great dignity , recommenced : " most willingly <name> we gratify any reasonable curiosity on the part of guests so illustrious , <unk> though they be .
know then that in these dominions i am monarch , and here rule with undivided empire under the title of <unk> pest the first . '
" this apartment , which you no doubt <unk> suppose to be the shop of <name> <unk> the undertaker  a man whom we know not , and whose plebeian appellation has never before this night thwarted our <name> ears  this apartment , i say , is the <unk> of our palace , devoted to the councils of our kingdom , and to other sacred and lofty purposes .
" the <name> <name> who sits opposite is <name> pest , our serene consort .
the other exalted personages whom you behold are all of our family , and wear the insignia of the blood <name> under the respective titles of 'his <name> the arch duke <unk> '  'his <name> the duke <unk> '  'his <name> the duke <unk> '  and 'her serene highness the arch duchess <unk> . '
" as regards , " continued he , " your demand of the business upon which we sit here in council , we might be pardoned for replying that it concerns , and concerns alone , our own private and regal interest , and is in no manner important to any other than <unk> .
but in consideration of those rights to which as guests and strangers you may feel yourselves entitled , we <name> furthermore explain that we are here this night , prepared by deep research and accurate investigation , to examine , analyze , and thoroughly determine the indefinable spirit  the incomprehensible qualities and nature  of those inestimable treasures of the palate , the wines , <unk> , and <unk> of this goodly metropolis : by so doing to advance not more our own designs than the true welfare of that unearthly sovereign whose reign is over us all , whose dominions are unlimited , and whose name is <unk> . '
" whose name is davy jones ! "
ejaculated tarpaulin , helping the <name> by his side to a skull of <unk> , and pouring out a second for himself .
" profane <unk> ! "
said the president , now turning his attention to the worthy <name> , " profane and execrable wretch !  we have said , that in consideration of those rights which , even in thy filthy person , we feel no inclination to violate , we have condescended to make reply to thy rude and <unk> inquiries .
we nevertheless , for your <unk> intrusion upon our councils , believe it our duty to <unk> thee and thy companion in each a gallon of black strap  having imbibed which to the prosperity of our kingdom  at a single draught  and upon your bended knees  ye shall be forthwith free either to proceed upon your way , or remain and be admitted to the privileges of our table , according to your respective and individual pleasures . "
" it would be a matter of utter impossibility , " replied legs , whom the assumptions and dignity of king pest the first had evidently inspired some feelings of respect , and who arose and steadied himself by the table as he spoke  " it would , please your majesty , be a matter of utter impossibility to stow away in my hold even one-fourth part of the same liquor which your majesty has just mentioned .
to say nothing of the stuffs placed on board in the forenoon by way of ballast , and not to mention the various <unk> and <unk> shipped this evening at different <unk> , i have , at present , a full cargo of <unk> stuff ' taken in and duly paid for at the sign of the <unk> tar . '
you <name> , therefore , please your majesty , be so good as to take the <name> for the deed  for by no manner of means either can i or <name> i swallow another drop  least of all a drop of that villainous <unk> that answers to the hall of <unk> strap . ' "
" <unk> that ! "
interrupted tarpaulin , astonished not more at the length of his companion 's speech than at the nature of his refusal  " <unk> that you <unk> !  and i say , legs , none of your <unk> !
my hull is still light , although i confess you yourself seem to be a little <unk> ; and as for the matter of your share of the cargo , why rather than raise a squall i would find <unk> for it myself , but "  " this proceeding , " interposed the president , " is by no means in accordance with the terms of the <unk> or sentence , which is in its nature median , and not to be altered or recalled .
the conditions we have imposed must be fulfilled to the letter , and that without a moment's hesitation  in failure of which fulfilment we decree that you do here be tied neck and heels together , and duly drowned as rebels in <name> hogshead of october beer ! "
" a sentence !  a sentence !  a righteous and just sentence !  a glorious decree !  a most worthy and upright , and holy condemnation ! "
shouted the pest family altogether .
the king elevated his forehead into innumerable wrinkles ; the <unk> little old man puffed like a pair of bellows ; the <name> of the winding sheet waved her nose to and fro ; the gentleman in the cotton drawers pricked up his ears ; she of the shroud gasped like a dying fish ; and he of the coffin looked stiff and rolled up his eyes .
" ugh !
ugh !
ugh ! "
chuckled tarpaulin without heeding the general excitation , " ugh !
ugh !
ugh !  ugh !
ugh !
ugh !  ugh !
ugh !
ugh !  i was saying , " said he , " i was saying when mr. king pest poked in his <unk> , that as for the matter of two or three gallons more or less of black strap , it was a trifle to a tight <unk> like myself not <unk>  but when it comes to drinking the health of the devil ( whom god <unk> ) and going down upon my marrow bones to his <unk> majesty there , whom i know , as well as i know myself to be a sinner , to be nobody in the whole world , but <name> <unk> the <unk>  why !
it 's quite another guess sort of a thing , and utterly and altogether past my comprehension . "
he was not allowed to finish this speech in tranquillity .
at the name <name> <unk> the whole assembly leaped from their name seats .
" treason ! "
shouted his majesty king pest the first .
" treason ! "
said the little man with the gout .
" treason ! "
screamed the arch duchess <unk> .
" treason ! "
muttered the gentleman with his jaws tied up .
" treason ! "
growled he of the coffin .
" treason !
treason ! "
shrieked her majesty of the mouth ; and , seizing by the hinder part of his breeches the unfortunate tarpaulin , who had just commenced pouring out for himself a skull of <unk> , she lifted him high into the air , and let him fall without ceremony into the huge open puncheon of his beloved ale .
bobbing up and down , for a few seconds , like an apple in a bowl of toddy , he , at length , finally disappeared amid the whirlpool of foam which , in the already <unk> liquor , his struggles easily succeeded in creating .
not <unk> , however , did the tall seaman behold the discomfiture of his companion .
jostling king pest through the open trap , the valiant legs slammed the door down upon him with an oath , and strode towards the centre of the room .
here tearing down the skeleton which swung over the table , he laid it about him with so much energy and good <name> , that , as the last glimpses of light died away within the apartment , he succeeded in knocking out the brains of the little gentleman with the gout .
rushing then with all his force against the fatal hogshead full of october ale and <name> tarpaulin , he rolled it over and over in an instant .
out burst a deluge of liquor so fierce  so impetuous  so overwhelming  that the room was flooded from wall to wall  the loaded table was overturned  the <unk> were thrown upon their backs  the tub of punch into the fire-place  and the ladies into hysterics .
piles of <unk> floundered about .
<unk> , <unk> , and <unk> mingled promiscuously in the <unk> , and wicker <unk> encountered desperately with bottles of junk .
the man with the horrors was drowned upon the <unk> little stiff gentleman floated off in his coffin  and the victorious legs , seizing by the waist the fat <name> in the shroud , rushed out with her into the street , and made a <unk> for the " free and easy , " followed under easy sail by the <unk> <name> tarpaulin , who , having sneezed three or four times , panted and puffed after him with the arch duchess <unk> .
three sundays in a week " you <unk> , <unk> , obstinate , <name> , <unk> , musty , <unk> , old savage ! "
said i , in fancy , one afternoon , to my grand uncle <unk>  shaking my fist at him in imagination .
only in imagination .
the fact is , some trivial discrepancy did exist , just then , between what i said and what i had not the courage to say  between what i did and what i had half a mind to do .
the old porpoise , as i opened the drawing-room door , was sitting with his feet upon the <unk> , and a <unk> of port in his paw , making strenuous efforts to accomplish the ditty .
<unk> ton <unk> <unk> !
<unk> ton <unk> <unk> !
" my dear uncle , " said i , closing the door gently , and approaching him with the <unk> of smiles , " you are always so very kind and considerate , and have evinced your benevolence in so many  so very many ways  that  that i feel i have only to suggest this little point to you once more to make sure of your full acquiescence . "
" hem ! "
said he , " good boy !
go on ! "
" i am sure , my dearest uncle ( you confounded old rascal !
) , that you have no design really , seriously , to oppose my union with <name> .
this is merely a joke of yours , i know  <name> !
<name> !
<name> !  how very pleasant you are at times . "
" <name> !
<name> !
<name> ! "
said he , " curse you !
yes ! "
" to be sure  of course !
i knew you were jesting .
now , uncle , all that <name> and myself wish at present , is that you would oblige us with your advice as  as regards the time  you know , uncle  in short , when <name> it be most convenient for yourself , that the wedding shall  shall come off , you know ? "
" come off , you scoundrel !  what do you mean by that ?  better wait till it goes on . "
" <name> !
<name> !
<name> !  he !
he !
he !  hi !
hi !
hi !  ho !
ho !
ho !  hu !
hu !
hu !  that's good !  oh that 's capital  such a wit !
but all we want just now , you know , uncle , is that you would indicate the time precisely . "
" ah !  precisely ? "
" yes , uncle  that is , if it would be quite agreeable to yourself . "
" would n't it answer , <name> , if i were to leave it at random  some time within a year or so , for example ?  must i say precisely ? "
" if you please , uncle  precisely . "
" well , then , <name> , my boy  you 're a fine fellow , are n't you ?  since you <name> have the exact time i 'll  why i 'll oblige you for once : " " dear uncle ! "
" hush , sir ! "
( drowning my voice )  " i 'll oblige you for once .
you shall have my consent  and the plum , we <unk> forget the plum  let me see !
when shall it be ?
to-day 's <name>  is n't it ?
well , then , you shall be married precisely  precisely , now mind !  when three sundays come together in a week !
do you hear me , sir !
what are you gaping at ?
i say , you shall have <name> and her plum when three sundays come together in a week  but not till then  you young <unk>  not till then , if i die for it .
you know me  i 'm a man of my word  now be off ! "
here he swallowed his <unk> of port , while i rushed from the room in despair .
a very " fine old english gentleman , " was my <unk> <unk> , but unlike him of the song , he had his weak points .
he was a little , <unk> , pompous , passionate semicircular somebody , with a red nose , a thick <unk> , ( sic ) a long purse , and a strong sense of his own consequence .
with the best heart in the world , he contrived , through a predominant whim of contradiction , to earn for himself , among those who only knew him <unk> , the character of a <unk> .
like many excellent people , he seemed possessed with a spirit of <unk> , which might easily , at a casual glance , have been mistaken for <unk> .
to every request , a positive " no ! "
was his immediate answer , but in the end  in the long , long end  there were exceedingly few requests which he refused .
against all attacks upon his purse he made the most sturdy defence ; but the amount extorted from him , at last , was generally in direct ratio with the length of the siege and the <unk> of the resistance .
in <name> no one gave more liberally or with a worse <name> .
for the fine arts , and especially for the <unk> , he entertained a profound contempt .
with this he had been inspired by <unk> <unk> , whose pert little query " a <unk> <name> <unk> est il bon ? "
he was in the habit of quoting , with a very droll pronunciation , as the ne plus <unk> of logical wit .
thus my own inkling for the muses had excited his entire displeasure .
he assured me one day , when i asked him for a new copy of <name> , that the translation of " <unk> <unk> non fit " was " a nasty poet for nothing fit "  a remark which i took in high <unk> .
his repugnance to " the <unk> " had , also , much increased of late , by an accidental bias in favor of what he supposed to be natural science .
somebody had accosted him in the street , mistaking him for no less a personage than doctor <unk> l. <name> , the lecturer upon quack physics .
this set him off at a <unk> ; and just at the epoch of this story  for story it is getting to be after all  my <unk> <unk> was accessible and pacific only upon points which happened to chime in with the <unk> of the hobby he was riding .
for the rest , he laughed with his arms and legs , and his politics were stubborn and easily understood .
he thought , with <unk> , that " the people have nothing to do with the laws but to obey them . "
i had lived with the old gentleman all my life .
my parents , in dying , had bequeathed me to him as a <name> legacy .
i believe the old villain loved me as his own child  nearly if not quite as well as he loved <name>  but it was a dog 's existence that he led me , after all .
from my first year until my fifth , he obliged me with very regular <unk> .
from five to fifteen , he threatened me , hourly , with the house of correction .
from fifteen to twenty , not a day passed in which he did not promise to cut me off with a shilling .
i was a sad dog , it is true  but then it was a part of my nature  a point of my <name> .
in <name> , however , i had a firm friend , and i knew it .
she was a good girl , and told me very sweetly that i might have her ( plum and all ) whenever i could badger my <unk> <unk> , into the necessary consent .
poor girl !  she was barely fifteen , and without this consent , her little amount in the funds was not <unk> until five immeasurable summers had " dragged their slow length along . "
what , then , to do ?
at fifteen , or even at twenty-one ( for i had now passed my fifth <unk> ) five years in prospect are very much the same as five hundred .
in vain we besieged the old gentleman with <unk> .
here was a piece de resistance ( as messieurs <unk> and <unk> would say ) which suited his perverse fancy to a t. it would have <unk> the indignation of job himself , to see how much like an old <unk> he behaved to us two poor wretched little mice .
in his heart he wished for nothing more ardently than our union .
he had made up his mind to this all along .
in fact , he would have given ten thousand pounds from his own pocket ( <name> 's plum was her own ) if he could have invented any thing like an excuse for complying with our very natural wishes .
but then we had been so imprudent as to <unk> the subject ourselves .
not to oppose it under such circumstances , i sincerely believe , was not in his power .
i have said already that he had his weak points ; but in speaking of these , i must not be understood as referring to his obstinacy : which was one of his strong points  " <unk> ce n ' <unk> pas sa <unk> . "
when i mention his weakness i have allusion to a bizarre <unk> superstition which beset him .
he was great in dreams , <unk> , et <unk> genus <unk> of <unk> .
he was excessively <unk> , too , upon small points of honor , and , after his own fashion , was a man of his word , beyond doubt .
this was , in fact , one of his <unk> .
the spirit of his vows he made no scruple of setting at naught , but the letter was a bond inviolable .
now it was this latter peculiarity in his disposition , of which <unk> ingenuity enabled us one fine day , not long after our interview in the dining-room , to take a very unexpected advantage , and , having thus , in the fashion of all modern bards and orators , exhausted in <unk> , all the time at my command , and nearly all the room at my disposal , i <name> sum up in a few words what constitutes the whole pith of the story .
it happened then  so the fates ordered it  that among the naval acquaintances of my betrothed , were two gentlemen who had just set foot upon the shores of england , after a year 's absence , each , in foreign travel .
in company with these gentlemen , my cousin and i , <unk> paid uncle <unk> a visit on the afternoon of <name> , october the tenth ,  just three weeks after the memorable decision which had so cruelly defeated our hopes .
for about half an hour the conversation ran upon ordinary topics , but at last , we contrived , quite naturally , to give it the following turn : capt .
pratt .
" well i have been absent just one <unk>  just one year to-day , as i live  let me see !
yes !  this is october the tenth .
you remember , mr. <unk> , i called , this day year to bid you good-bye .
and by the way , it does seem something like a coincidence , does it not  that our friend , captain <unk> , here , has been absent exactly a year also  a year to-day ! "
<unk> .
" yes !
just one year to a fraction .
you <name> remember , mr. <unk> , that i called with capt .
<unk> on this very day , last year , to pay my parting respects . "
uncle .
" yes , yes , yes  i remember it very well  very queer indeed !
both of you gone just one year .
a very strange coincidence , indeed !
just what doctor <unk> l. <name> would <unk> an extraordinary concurrence of events .
doctor dub " <name> .
( interrupting . )
" to be sure , papa , it is something strange ; but then captain pratt and captain <unk> did n't go altogether the same route , and that makes a difference , you know . "
uncle .
" i do n't know any such thing , you <unk> !
how should i ?
i think it only makes the matter more remarkable , doctor <unk> l. <name>  " <name> .
" why , papa , captain pratt went round cape horn , and captain <unk> doubled the cape of good <name> . "
uncle .
" precisely !  the one went east and the other went west , you <name> , and they both have gone quite round the world .
by the by , doctor <unk> l. <name>  " myself .
( hurriedly . )
" captain pratt , you must come and spend the evening with us to-morrow  you and <unk>  you can tell us all about your voyage , and well have a game of whist and  " pratt .
" <unk> , my dear fellow  you forget .
to-morrow <name> be <name> .
some other evening  " <name> .
" oh , no , <unk> !  <name> 's not quite so bad as that .
<unk> <name> . "
pratt .
" i beg both your pardons  but i ca n't be so much mistaken .
i know to-morrow 's <name> , because " <unk> .
( much surprised . )
" what are you all thinking about ?
wasn't yesterday , <name> , i should like to know ? "
all .
" yesterday indeed !
you are out ! "
uncle .
" <unk> <name> , i say  do n't i know ? "
pratt .
" oh no !  to-morrow 's <name> . "
<unk> .
" you are all mad  every one of you .
i am as positive that yesterday was <name> as i am that i sit upon this chair . "
<name> .
( jumping up eagerly . )
" i see it  i see it all .
papa , this is a judgment upon you , about  about you know what .
let me alone , and i'll explain it all in a minute .
it 's a very simple thing , indeed .
captain <unk> says that yesterday was <name> : so it was ; he is right .
cousin <name> , and uncle and i say that to-day is <name> : so it is ; we are right .
captain pratt maintains that to-morrow <name> be <name> : so it <name> ; he is right , too .
the fact is , we are all right , and thus three sundays have come together in a week . "
<unk> .
( after a pause . )
" by the by , pratt , <name> has us completely .
what fools we two are !
mr. <unk> , the matter stands thus : the earth , you know , is twenty-four thousand miles in circumference .
now this globe of the earth turns upon its own axis  revolves  spins round  these twenty-four thousand miles of extent , going from west to east , in precisely twenty-four hours .
do you understand mr. <unk> ?  " uncle .
" to be sure  to be sure  doctor dub " <unk> .
( drowning his voice . )
" well , sir ; that is at the rate of one thousand miles per hour .
now , suppose that i sail from this position a thousand miles east .
of course i anticipate the rising of the sun here at london by just one hour .
i see the sun rise one hour before you do .
proceeding , in the same direction , yet another thousand miles , i anticipate the rising by two hours  another thousand , and i anticipate it by three hours , and so on , until i go entirely round the globe , and back to this spot , when , having gone twenty-four thousand miles east , i anticipate the rising of the london sun by no less than twenty-four hours ; that is to say , i am a day in advance of your time .
understand , eh ? "
uncle .
" but double l. <name> " <unk> .
( speaking very loud . )
" captain pratt , on the contrary , when he had sailed a thousand miles west of this position , was an hour , and when he had sailed twenty-four thousand miles west , was twenty-four hours , or one day , behind the time at london .
thus , with me , yesterday was <name>  thus , with you , to-day is <name>  and thus , with pratt , to-morrow <name> be <name> .
and what is more , mr. <unk> , it is positively clear that we are all right ; for there can be no philosophical reason assigned why the idea of one of us should have preference over that of the other . "
uncle .
" my eyes !  well , <name>  well , <name> !  this is a judgment upon me , as you say .
but i am a man of my word  <name> that !
you shall have her , boy , ( plum and all ) , when you please .
done up , by jove !
three sundays all in a row !
i 'll go , and take <unk> l. <name> 's opinion upon that . "

everybody knows , in a general way , that the finest place in the world is  or , alas , was  the dutch borough of <unk> .
yet as it lies some distance from any of the main roads , being in a somewhat out-of-the-way situation , there are perhaps very few of my readers who have ever paid it a visit .
for the benefit of those who have not , therefore , it <name> be only proper that i should enter into some account of it .
and this is indeed the more necessary , as with the <name> of <unk> public sympathy in behalf of the inhabitants , i design here to give a history of the <unk> events which have so lately occurred within its limits .
no one who knows me <name> doubt that the duty thus <unk> <name> be executed to the best of my ability , with all that rigid impartiality , all that cautious examination into facts , and diligent <unk> of authorities , which should ever distinguish him who <unk> to the title of historian .
by the united aid of medals , manuscripts , and inscriptions , i am enabled to say , positively , that the borough of <unk> has existed , from its origin , in precisely the same condition which it at present preserves .
of the date of this origin , however , i grieve that i can only speak with that species of indefinite <unk> which mathematicians are , at times , forced to put up with in certain <unk> <unk> .
the date , i may thus say , in regard to the remoteness of its antiquity , can not be less than any assignable quantity whatsoever .
touching the derivation of the name <unk> , i confess myself , with sorrow , equally at fault .
among a multitude of opinions upon this delicate point  some acute , some learned , some sufficiently the reverse  i am able to select nothing which ought to be considered satisfactory .
perhaps the idea of <unk>  nearly coincident with that of <unk>  is to be cautiously <unk>  it runs :  " <unk>  <unk> , <unk> <unk>  <unk> , <unk> und <unk>  <unk> <unk> :  pro blitzen . "
this <unk> , to say the truth , is still <unk> by some traces of the electric fluid evident on the summit of the steeple of the house of the <unk> .
i do not choose , however , to commit myself on a theme of such importance , and must refer the reader desirous of information to the " <unk> de <unk> <unk> , " of <unk> .
see , also , <unk> " de <unk> , " pp .
27 to <unk> , folio , gothic <unk> , red and black character , <unk> and no <unk> ; wherein consult , also , marginal notes in the autograph of <unk> , with the <unk> of <unk> .
notwithstanding the obscurity which thus <unk> the date of the foundation of <unk> , and the derivation of its name , there can be no doubt , as i said before , that it has always existed as we find it at this epoch .
the oldest man in the borough can remember not the slightest difference in the appearance of any portion of it ; and , indeed , the very suggestion of such a possibility is considered an insult .
the site of the village is in a perfectly circular valley , about a quarter of a mile in circumference , and entirely surrounded by gentle hills , over whose summit the people have never yet ventured to pass .
for this they assign the very good reason that they do not believe there is anything at all on the other side .
round the skirts of the valley ( which is quite level , and paved throughout with flat tiles ) , extends a continuous row of sixty little houses .
these , having their backs on the hills , must look , of course , to the centre of the plain , which is just sixty yards from the front door of each dwelling .
every house has a small garden before it , with a circular path , a <unk> , and twenty-four cabbages .
the buildings themselves are so precisely alike , that one can in no manner be distinguished from the other .
owing to the vast antiquity , the style of architecture is somewhat odd , but it is not for that reason the less strikingly picturesque .
they are fashioned of <unk> little bricks , red , with black ends , so that the walls look like a <unk> upon a great scale .
the <unk> are turned to the front , and there are cornices , as big as all the rest of the house , over the eaves and over the main doors .
the windows are narrow and deep , with very <name> panes and a great deal of sash .
on the roof is a vast quantity of tiles with long curly ears .
the woodwork , throughout , is of a dark <name> and there is much carving about it , with but a trifling variety of pattern for , time out of mind , the <unk> of <unk> have never been able to carve more than two objects  a <unk> and a cabbage .
but these they do exceedingly well , and <unk> them , with singular ingenuity , wherever they find room for the chisel .
the dwellings are as much alike inside as out , and the furniture is all upon one plan .
the floors are of square tiles , the chairs and tables of <unk> wood with thin crooked legs and puppy feet .
the <unk> are wide and high , and have not only <unk> and cabbages sculptured over the front , but a real <unk> , which makes a prodigious ticking , on the top in the middle , with a flower-pot containing a cabbage standing on each extremity by way of <unk> .
between each cabbage and the <unk> , again , is a little <name> man having a large stomach with a great round hole in it , through which is seen the <unk> of a watch .
the <unk> are large and deep , with fierce <unk> <unk> .
there is constantly a rousing fire , and a huge pot over it , full of <unk> and pork , to which the good woman of the house is always busy in attending .
she is a little fat old <name> , with blue eyes and a red face , and wears a huge cap like a <unk> , ornamented with purple and yellow ribbons .
her dress is of <unk> <unk> , made very full behind and very short in the waist  and indeed very short in other respects , not reaching below the middle of her leg .
this is somewhat thick , and so are her ankles , but she has a fine pair of green stockings to cover them .
her shoes  of pink leather  are fastened each with a bunch of yellow ribbons puckered up in the shape of a cabbage .
in her left hand she has a little heavy dutch watch ; in her right she <unk> a <unk> for the sauerkraut and pork .
by her side there stands a fat <unk> cat , with a gilt <unk> tied to its tail , which " the boys " have there fastened by way of a <unk> .
the boys themselves are , all three of them , in the garden attending the pig .
they are each two feet in height .
they have three-cornered cocked hats , purple <unk> reaching down to their thighs , buckskin <unk> , red stockings , heavy shoes with big silver buckles , long <unk> coats with large buttons of <unk> .
each , too , has a pipe in his mouth , and a little <unk> watch in his right hand .
he takes a puff and a look , and then a look and a puff .
the pig  which is <unk> and lazy  is occupied now in picking up the stray leaves that fall from the cabbages , and now in giving a kick behind at the gilt <unk> , which the <unk> have also tied to his tail in order to make him look as handsome as the cat .
right at the front door , in a <unk> <unk> armed chair , with crooked legs and puppy feet like the tables , is seated the old man of the house himself .
he is an exceedingly puffy little old gentleman , with big circular eyes and a huge double <name> .
his dress resembles that of the boys  and i need say nothing farther about it .
all the difference is , that his pipe is somewhat bigger than theirs and he can make a greater smoke .
like them , he has a watch , but he carries his watch in his pocket .
to say the truth , he has something of more importance than a watch to attend to  and what that is , i shall presently explain .
he sits with his right leg upon his left knee , wears a grave countenance , and always keeps one of his eyes , at least , resolutely bent upon a certain remarkable object in the centre of the plain .
this object is situated in the steeple of the house of the town council .
the town council are all very little , round , oily , intelligent men , with big saucer eyes and fat double chins , and have their coats much longer and their <unk> much bigger than the ordinary inhabitants of <unk> .
since my sojourn in the borough , they have had several special meetings , and have adopted these three important resolutions : " that it is wrong to alter the good old course of things : " " that there is nothing tolerable out of <unk> : " and  " that we <name> stick by our clocks and our cabbages . "
above the <unk> of the council is the steeple , and in the steeple is the belfry , where exists , and has existed time out of mind , the pride and wonder of the village  the great clock of the borough of <unk> .
and this is the object to which the eyes of the old gentlemen are turned who sit in the <unk> <unk> .
the great clock has seven faces  one in each of the seven sides of the steeple  so that it can be readily seen from all quarters .
its faces are large and white , and its hands heavy and black .
there is a <unk> whose sole duty is to attend to it ; but this duty is the most perfect of <unk>  for the clock of <unk> was never yet known to have anything the matter with it .
until lately , the bare supposition of such a thing was considered <unk> .
from the remotest period of antiquity to which the archives have reference , the hours have been regularly struck by the big <name> .
and , indeed the case was just the same with all the other clocks and watches in the borough .
never was such a place for keeping the true time .
when the large clapper thought proper to say " twelve o'clock ! "
all its obedient followers opened their throats simultaneously , and responded like a very <name> .
in short , the good <unk> were fond of their <unk> , but then they were proud of their clocks .
all people who hold <unk> offices are held in more or less respect , and as the belfry  man of <unk> has the most perfect of <unk> , he is the most perfectly respected of any man in the world .
he is the chief dignitary of the borough , and the very pigs look up to him with a sentiment of reverence .
his <unk> is very far longer  his pipe , his shoe  buckles , his eyes , and his stomach , very far bigger  than those of any other old gentleman in the village ; and as to his <name> , it is not only double , but triple .
i have thus painted the happy estate of <unk> : alas , that so fair a picture should ever experience a reverse !
there has been long a saying among the wisest inhabitants , that " no good can come from over the hills " ; and it really seemed that the words had in them something of the spirit of prophecy .
it wanted five minutes of noon , on the day before yesterday , when there appeared a very <unk> object on the summit of the ridge of the eastward .
such an occurrence , of course , attracted universal attention , and every little old gentleman who sat in a <unk> arm-chair turned one of his eyes with a stare of dismay upon the phenomenon , still keeping the other upon the clock in the steeple .
by the time that it wanted only three minutes to noon , the droll object in question was perceived to be a very diminutive <unk> young man .
he descended the hills at a great rate , so that every body had soon a good look at him .
he was really the most <unk> little personage that had ever been seen in <unk> .
his countenance was of a dark <unk> , and he had a long hooked nose , pea eyes , a wide mouth , and an excellent set of teeth , which latter he seemed anxious of displaying , as he was grinning from ear to ear .
what with <unk> and whiskers , there was none of the rest of his face to be seen .
his head was uncovered , and his hair neatly done up in <unk> .
his dress was a <unk> <unk> black coat ( from one of whose pockets dangled a vast length of white handkerchief ) , black <unk> <unk> , black stockings , and <unk> pumps , with huge bunches of black satin ribbon for bows .
under one arm he carried a huge <unk> , and under the other a fiddle nearly five times as big as himself .
in his left hand was a gold <unk> , from which , as he capered down the hill , cutting all manner of fantastic steps , he took snuff incessantly with an air of the greatest possible <unk> .
god bless me !  here was a sight for the honest <unk> of <unk> !
to speak plainly , the fellow had , in spite of his grinning , an audacious and sinister kind of face ; and as he <unk> right into the village , the old stumpy appearance of his pumps excited no little suspicion ; and many a <unk> who beheld him that day would have given a trifle for a peep beneath the white <unk> handkerchief which <name> so <unk> from the pocket of his <unk> coat .
but what mainly occasioned a righteous indignation was , that the <unk> popinjay , while he cut a <unk> here , and a whirligig there , did not seem to have the remotest idea in the world of such a thing as keeping time in his steps .
the good people of the borough had scarcely a chance , however , to get their eyes thoroughly open , when , just as it wanted half a minute of noon , the rascal bounced , as i say , right into the midst of them ; gave a <unk> here , and a <unk> there ; and then , after a <unk> and a <unk> , <unk> himself right up into the belfry of the house of the town council , where the <unk> <unk> sat smoking in a state of dignity and dismay .
but the little chap seized him at once by the nose ; gave it a swing and a pull ; clapped the big <unk> <unk> upon his head ; knocked it down over his eyes and mouth ; and then , lifting up the big fiddle , beat him with it so long and so soundly , that what with the <unk> being so fat , and the fiddle being so hollow , you would have sworn that there was a regiment of <unk> drummers all beating the devil 's tattoo up in the belfry of the steeple of <unk> .
there is no knowing to what desperate act of vengeance this unprincipled attack might have aroused the inhabitants , but for the important fact that it now wanted only half a second of noon .
the <name> was about to strike , and it was a matter of absolute and <unk> necessity that every body should look well at his watch .
it was evident , however , that just at this moment the fellow in the steeple was doing something that he had no business to do with the clock .
but as it now began to strike , nobody had any time to attend to his manoeuvres , for they had all to count the strokes of the <name> as it sounded .
" one ! "
said the clock .
" <name> ! "
echoed every little old gentleman in every <unk> arm-chair in <unk> .
" <name> ! "
said his watch also ; " <name> ! "
said the watch of his <unk> ; and " <name> ! "
said the watches of the boys , and the little gilt <unk> on the tails of the cat and pig .
" two ! "
continued the big <name> ; and " <unk> ! "
repeated all the <unk> .
" three !
four !
five !
six !
seven !
eight !
nine !
ten ! "
said the <name> .
" <unk> !
<unk> !
<unk> !
<unk> !
<unk> !
<unk> !
<unk> !
den ! "
answered the others .
" eleven ! "
said the big one .
" <unk> ! "
assented the little ones .
" twelve ! "
said the <name> .
" <unk> ! "
they replied perfectly satisfied , and dropping their voices .
" und <unk> it is ! "
said all the little old gentlemen , putting up their watches .
but the big <name> had not done with them yet .
" thirteen ! "
said he .
" der <unk> ! "
gasped the little old gentlemen , turning pale , dropping their pipes , and putting down all their right legs from over their left knees .
" der <unk> ! "
groaned they , " <unk> !
<unk> !
!  mein gott , it is <unk> o'clock ! ! "
why attempt to describe the terrible scene which ensued ?
all <unk> flew at once into a lamentable state of uproar .
" vot is cum 'd to mein <unk> ? "
roared all the boys  " i 've been <unk> for dis hour ! "
" vot is <unk> 'd to mein <unk> ? "
screamed all the <unk> , " it has been done to rags for this hour ! "
" vot is cum 'd to mein pipe ? "
swore all the little old gentlemen , " <unk> and blitzen ; it has been smoked out for dis hour ! "
 and they filled them up again in a great rage , and sinking back in their <unk> , puffed away so fast and so fiercely that the whole valley was immediately filled with impenetrable smoke .
meantime the cabbages all turned very red in the face , and it seemed as if old <name> himself had taken possession of every thing in the shape of a timepiece .
the clocks carved upon the furniture took to dancing as if bewitched , while those upon the <unk> could scarcely contain themselves for fury , and kept such a continual striking of thirteen , and such a <unk> and wriggling of their <unk> as was really horrible to see .
but , worse than all , neither the cats nor the pigs could put up any longer with the behavior of the little <unk> tied to their tails , and resented it by scampering all over the place , scratching and poking , and squeaking and screeching , and <unk> and <unk> , and flying into the faces , and running under the petticoats of the people , and creating altogether the most abominable din and confusion which it is possible for a reasonable person to conceive .
and to make matters still more distressing , the rascally little <unk> in the steeple was evidently exerting himself to the utmost .
every now and then one might catch a glimpse of the scoundrel through the smoke .
there he sat in the belfry upon the <unk> , who was lying flat upon his back .
in his teeth the villain held the <unk> , which he kept jerking about with his head , raising such a clatter that my ears ring again even to think of it .
on his lap lay the big fiddle , at which he was scraping , out of all time and tune , with both hands , making a great show , the <unk> !
of playing " <name> <unk> and paddy <unk> . "
affairs being thus miserably situated , i left the place in disgust , and now appeal for aid to all lovers of correct time and fine <unk> .
let us proceed in a body to the borough , and restore the ancient order of things in <unk> by <unk> that little fellow from the steeple .
<unk>     all people went upon their ten toes in wild <unk> .
 bishop hall 's <unk> .
i am  that is to say i was  a great man ; but i am neither the author of junius nor the man in the mask ; for my name , i believe , is <name> jones , and i was born somewhere in the city of <unk> .
the first action of my life was the taking hold of my nose with both hands .
my mother saw this and called me a genius : my father wept for <name> and presented me with a treatise on <unk> .
this i mastered before i was <unk> .
i now began to feel my way in the science , and soon came to understand that , provided a man had a nose sufficiently conspicuous he might , by merely following it , arrive at a <unk> .
but my attention was not confined to theories alone .
every morning i gave my proboscis a couple of pulls and swallowed a half dozen of <unk> .
when i came of age my father asked me , one day , if i would step with him into his study .
" my son , " said he , when we were seated , " what is the chief end of your existence ? "
" my father , " i answered , " it is the study of <unk> . "
" and what , <name> , " he inquired , " is <unk> ? "
" sir , " i said , " it is the science of noses . "
" and can you tell me , " he demanded , " what is the meaning of a nose ? "
" a nose , my father ; " i replied , greatly softened , " has been variously defined by about a thousand different authors . "
[ here i pulled out my watch . ]
" it is now noon or thereabouts  we shall have time enough to get through with them all before midnight .
to commence then :  the nose , according to <unk> , is that protuberance  that bump  that <unk>  that  " " <name> do , <name> , " interrupted the good old gentleman .
" i am thunderstruck at the extent of your information  i am positively  upon my soul . "
[ here he closed his eyes and placed his hand upon his heart . ]
" come here ! "
[ here he took me by the arm . ]
" your education may now be considered as finished  it is high time you should scuffle for yourself  and you can not do a better thing than merely follow your nose  so  so  so  " [ here he kicked me down stairs and out of the door ]  " so get out of my house , and god bless you ! "
as i felt within me the divine <unk> , i considered this accident rather fortunate than otherwise .
i resolved to be guided by the paternal advice .
i determined to follow my nose .
i gave it a pull or two upon the spot , and wrote a pamphlet on <unk> forthwith .
all <unk> was in an uproar .
" wonderful genius ! "
said the quarterly .
" superb physiologist ! "
said the westminster .
" clever fellow ! "
said the foreign .
" fine writer ! "
said the edinburgh .
" profound thinker ! "
said the dublin .
" great man ! "
said bentley .
" divine soul ! "
said <unk> .
" one of us ! "
said blackwood .
" who can he be ? "
said mrs. <unk> .
" what can he be ? "
said big miss <unk> .
" where can he be ? "
said little miss <unk>  but i paid these people no attention whatever  i just stepped into the shop of an artist .
the duchess of <unk> was sitting for her portrait ; the <name> of so-and-so was holding the duchess ' poodle ; the <name> of <unk> was <unk> with her salts ; and his <name> highness of <unk> was leaning upon the back of her chair .
i approached the artist and turned up my nose .
" oh , beautiful ! "
sighed her <name> .
" oh my ! "
lisped the <name> .
" oh , shocking ! "
groaned the <name> .
" oh , abominable ! "
growled his <name> highness .
" what <name> you take for it ? "
asked the artist .
" for his nose ! "
shouted her <name> .
" a thousand pounds , " said i , sitting down .
" a thousand pounds ? "
inquired the artist , musingly .
" a thousand pounds , " said i .
" beautiful ! "
said he , entranced .
" a thousand pounds , " said i .
" do you warrant it ? "
he asked , turning the nose to the light .
" i do , " said i , blowing it well .
" is it quite original ? "
he inquired ; touching it with reverence .
" humph ! "
said i , twisting it to one side .
" has no copy been taken ? "
he demanded , surveying it through a microscope .
" none , " said i , turning it up .
" admirable ! "
he ejaculated , thrown quite off his guard by the beauty of the manoeuvre .
" a thousand pounds , " said i .
" a thousand pounds ? "
said he .
" precisely , " said i .
" a thousand pounds ? "
said he .
" just so , " said i .
" you shall have them , " said he .
" what a piece of <unk> ! "
so he <name> me a check upon the spot , and took a sketch of my nose .

there was myself .
i spoke of myself ;  of myself , of myself , of myself ;  of <unk> , of my pamphlet , and of myself .
i turned up my nose , and i spoke of myself .
" marvellous clever man ! "
said the <name> .
" superb ! "
said his guests :  and next morning her <name> of <unk> paid me a visit .
" <name> you go to <unk> 's , pretty creature ? "
she said , tapping me under the <name> .
" upon honor , " said i .
" nose and all ? "
she asked .
" as i live , " i replied .
" here then is a card , my life .
shall i say you <name> be there ? "
" dear duchess , with all my heart . "
" pshaw , no !  but with all your nose ? "
" every bit of it , my love , " said i : so i gave it a twist or two , and found myself at <unk> 's .
the rooms were crowded to suffocation .
" he is coming ! "
said somebody on the staircase .
" he is coming ! "
said somebody farther up .
" he is coming ! "
said somebody farther still .
" he is come ! "
exclaimed the duchess .
" he is come , the little love ! "
 and , seizing me firmly by both hands , she kissed me thrice upon the nose .
a marked sensation immediately ensued .
" <unk> ! "
cried count <unk> .
" <unk> <unk> ! "
muttered <name> <unk> .
" mille <unk> ! "
ejaculated the <name> de grenouille .
" <unk> <unk> ! "
growled the <unk> of <unk> .
it was not to be borne .
i grew angry .
i turned short upon <unk> .
" sir ! "
said i to him , " you are a baboon . "
" sir , " he replied , after a pause , " <unk> und blitzen ! "
this was all that could be desired .
we exchanged cards .
at <unk> , the next morning , i shot off his nose  and then called upon my friends .
" <unk> ! "
said the first .
" fool ! "
said the second .
" dolt ! "
said the third .
" ass ! "
said the fourth .
" <unk> ! "
said the fifth .
" <unk> ! "
said the sixth .
" be off ! "
said the seventh .
at all this i felt mortified , and so called upon my father .
" father , " i asked , " what is the chief end of my existence ? "
" my son , " he replied , " it is still the study of <unk> ; but in hitting the <unk> upon the nose you have <unk> your <name> .
you have a fine nose , it is true ; but then <unk> has none .
you are damned , and he has become the hero of the day .
i <name> you that in <unk> the greatness of a lion is in proportion to the size of his proboscis  but , good heavens !
there is no competing with a lion who has no proboscis at all . "
<unk> a paragraph as it is well known that the <unk> men ' came 'from the east , ' and as mr. <unk> bullet-head came from the east , it follows that mr. bullet-head was a wise man ; and if collateral proof of the matter be needed , here we have it  mr. b. was an editor .
<unk> was his sole <unk> , for in fact the obstinacy of which men accused him was anything but his <unk> , since he justly considered it his <unk> .
it was his strong point  his virtue ; and it would have required all the logic of a <unk> to convince him that it was <unk> else . '
i have shown that <unk> bullet-head was a wise man ; and the only occasion on which he did not prove infallible , was when , abandoning that legitimate home for all wise men , the east , he migrated to the city of <unk> , or some place of a similar title , out west .
i must do him the justice to say , however , that when he made up his mind finally to settle in that town , it was under the impression that no newspaper , and consequently no editor , existed in that particular section of the country .
in establishing 'the <unk> ' he expected to have the field all to himself .
i feel confident he never would have dreamed of taking up his residence in <unk> had he been aware that , in <unk> , there lived a gentleman named <name> smith ( if i rightly remember ) , who for many years had there quietly grown fat in <unk> and publishing the <unk> gazette . '
it was solely , therefore , on account of having been <unk> , that mr. bullet-head found himself in <unk> we call it <unk> , 'for short '  but , as he did find himself there , he determined to keep up his character for <unk>  for firmness , and remain .
so remain he did ; and he did more ; he unpacked his press , type , etc. , etc. , rented an office exactly opposite to that of the <unk> , ' and , on the third morning after his arrival , issued the first number of 'the <unk> '  that is to say , of 'the <unk> <unk> '  as nearly as i can recollect , this was the name of the new paper .
the leading article , i must admit , was brilliant  not to say severe .
it was especially bitter about things in general  and as for the editor of 'the gazette , ' he was torn all to pieces in particular .
some of <unk> 's remarks were really so fiery that i have always , since that time , been forced to look upon <name> smith , who is still alive , in the light of a salamander .
i can not pretend to give all the <unk> paragraphs verbatim , but one of them runs thus : 'oh , yes !  oh , we perceive !
oh , no doubt !
the editor over the way is a genius  o , my !
oh , goodness , gracious !  what is this world coming to ?
oh , <unk> !
oh , <name> ! '
a <unk> at once so caustic and so classical , alighted like a <unk> among the hitherto peaceful citizens of <unk> .
groups of excited individuals gathered at the corners of the streets .
every one awaited , with <unk> anxiety , the reply of the dignified smith .
next morning it appeared as follows : 'we quote from " the <unk> " of yesterday the <unk> paragraph : " oh , yes !
oh , we perceive !
oh , no doubt !
oh , my !
oh , goodness !
oh , <unk> !
oh , <name> ! "
why , the fellow is all o !
that accounts for his reasoning in a circle , and explains why there is neither beginning nor end to him , nor to anything he says .
we really do not believe the vagabond can write a word that has n't an o in it .
wonder if this <unk> is a habit of his ?
<unk> , he came away from <unk> in a great hurry .
wonder if he o 's as much there as he does here ?
" o !
it is pitiful . " '
the indignation of mr. bullet-head at these scandalous insinuations , i shall not attempt to describe .
on the <unk> principle , however , he did not seem to be so much incensed at the attack upon his integrity as one might have imagined .
it was the sneer at his style that drove him to desperation .
what !  he <unk> bullet-head !  not able to write a word without an o in it !
he would soon let the <unk> see that he was mistaken .
yes !
he would let him see how much he was mistaken , the puppy !
he , <unk> bullet-head , of <unk> , would let mr. <name> smith perceive that he , bullet-head , could <unk> , if it so pleased him , a whole paragraph  aye !
a whole article  in which that contemptible <unk> should not once  not even once  make its appearance .
but no ;  that would be yielding a point to the said <name> smith .
he , bullet-head , would make no alteration in his style , to suit the caprices of any mr. smith in christendom .
perish so vile a thought !
the o forever ; he would persist in the o .
he would be as <unk> as <unk> could be .
burning with the chivalry of this determination , the great <unk> , in the next <unk> , ' came out merely with this simple but resolute paragraph , in reference to this unhappy affair : 'the editor of the " <unk> " has the honor of advising the editor of the " gazette " that he ( the " <unk> " ) <name> take an opportunity in tomorrow morning 's paper , of convincing him ( the " gazette " ) that he ( the " <unk> " ) both can and <name> be his own master , as regards style ; he ( the " <unk> " ) intending to show him ( the " gazette " ) the supreme , and indeed the withering contempt with which the criticism of him ( the " gazette " ) inspires the independent bosom of him ( the " <unk> " ) by composing for the especial gratification ( ? )
of him ( the " gazette " ) a leading article , of some extent , in which the beautiful <unk>  the emblem of eternity  yet so offensive to the <unk> delicacy of him ( the " gazette " ) shall most certainly not be avoided by his ( the " gazette 's " ) most obedient , humble servant , the " <unk> . "
" so much for buckingham ! " '
in fulfilment of the awful threat thus darkly intimated rather than decidedly <unk> , the great bullet-head , turning a deaf ear to all entreaties for <unk> , ' and simply requesting his foreman to 'go to the d   l , ' when he ( the foreman ) assured him ( the <unk> ' ! )
that it was high time to 'go to press ' : turning a deaf ear to everything , i say , the great bullet-head sat up until <unk> , consuming the midnight oil , and absorbed in the composition of the really unparalleled paragraph , which follows :  'so ho , <name> !
how now ?
told you so , you know .
do n't crow , another time , before you 're out of the woods !
does your mother know you 're out ?
oh , no , no !  so go home at once , now , <name> , to your odious old woods of concord !
go home to your woods , old owl  go !
you wo n't !
oh , <unk> , <unk> , do n't do so !
you 've got to go , you know !
so go at once , and do n't go slow , for nobody owns you here , you know !
oh !
<name> , <name> , if you don't go you 're no <unk>  no !
you 're only a fowl , an owl , a cow , a sow ,  a doll , a poll ; a poor , old , <unk> , log , dog , hog , or frog , come out of a concord bog .
cool , now  cool !
do be cool , you fool !
none of your crowing , old cock !
do n't frown so  do n't !
do n't <unk> , nor howl nor growl , nor <unk> !
good lord , <name> , how you do look !
told you so , you know  but stop rolling your goose of an old poll about so , and go and drown your sorrows in a bowl ! '
exhausted , very naturally , by so stupendous an effort , the great <unk> could attend to nothing farther that night .
firmly , composedly , yet with an air of conscious power , he handed his ms. to the devil in waiting , and then , walking leisurely home , retired , with ineffable dignity to bed .
meantime the devil , to whom the copy was entrusted , ran up stairs to his <unk> , ' in an unutterable hurry , and forthwith made a commencement at <unk> ' the ms .
'up . '
in the first place , of course ,  as the opening word was 'so , '  he made a plunge into the capital s hole and came out in triumph with a capital s. elated by this success , he immediately threw himself upon the <unk> box with a blindfold impetuosity  but who shall describe his horror when his fingers came up without the anticipated letter in their clutch ?
who shall paint his astonishment and rage at perceiving , as he rubbed his knuckles , that he had been only thumping them to no purpose , against the bottom of an empty box .
not a single <unk> was in the <unk> hole ; and , glancing fearfully at the <unk> partition , he found that to his extreme terror , in a precisely similar predicament .
awe  stricken , his first impulse was to rush to the foreman .
'sir ! '
said he , gasping for breath , 'i ca n't never set up nothing without no o 's . '
'what do you mean by that ? '
growled the foreman , who was in a very ill humor at being kept so late .
'why , sir , there <unk> an o in the office , neither a big <name> nor a little <name> ! '
'what  what the <unk> has become of all that were in the case ? '
'i do n't know , sir , ' said the boy , 'but one of them ere " <unk> " devils is bin prowling 'bout here all night , and i <unk> he 's gone and <unk> 'em every one . '
<unk> rot him !
i have n't a doubt of it , ' replied the foreman , getting purple with rage 'but i tell you what you do , <name> , that 's a good boy  you go over the first chance you get and hook every one of their i 's and ( d   n them ! )
their <unk> . '
<unk> so , ' replied <name> , with a wink and a frown  'i 'll be into 'em , i'll let 'em know a thing or two ; but in de meantime , that ere <unk> ?
mus go in to-night , you know  else there 'll be the <unk> to pay , <unk> 'and not a bit of pitch hot , ' interrupted the foreman , with a deep sigh , and an emphasis on the <unk> . '
'is it a long paragraph , <name> ? '
'should n't call it a <unk> long <unk> , ' said <name> .
'ah , well , then !
do the best you can with it !
we must get to press , ' said the foreman , who was over head and ears in work ; 'just stick in some other letter for o ; nobody 's going to read the fellow 's trash anyhow . '
<unk> well , ' replied <name> , 'here goes it ! '
and off he hurried to his case , muttering as he went : <unk> vell , them ere expressions , <unk> for a man as does n't <unk> .
so i 's to <unk> out all their eyes , eh ?
and <unk> all their gizzards !
vell !
this here 's the chap as is just able for to do it . '
the fact is that although <name> was but twelve years old and four feet high , he was equal to any amount of fight , in a small way .
the <unk> here described is by no means of rare occurrence in <unk> ; and i can not tell how to account for it , but the fact is indisputable , that when the <unk> does occur , it almost always happens that x is adopted as a substitute for the letter deficient .
the true reason , perhaps , is that x is rather the most <unk> letter in the cases , or at least was so in the old times  long enough to render the <unk> in question an habitual thing with printers .
as for <name> , he would have considered it <unk> to employ any other character , in a case of this kind , than the x to which he had been accustomed .
'i shell have to x this ere <unk> , ' said he to himself , as he read it over in astonishment , 'but it 's jest about the <unk> <unk> <unk> i ever did see ' : so x it he did , <unk> , and to press it went <unk> .
next morning the population of <unk> were taken all aback by reading in 'the <unk> , ' the following extraordinary leader : <unk> <unk> , <unk> !
<unk> <unk> ?
<unk> yxu <unk> , yxu <unk> .
<unk> n't <unk> , <unk> time , <unk> yxu 're <unk> <unk> the <unk> !

<unk> yxu <unk> , yxu <unk> ,  but <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> an <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> ! '
the uproar occasioned by this <unk> and <unk> article , is not to be conceived .
the first definite idea entertained by the populace was , that some diabolical treason lay concealed in the hieroglyphics ; and there was a general rush to bullet-head 's residence , for the purpose of riding him on a rail ; but that gentleman was nowhere to be found .
he had vanished , no one could tell how ; and not even the ghost of him has ever been seen since .
unable to discover its legitimate object , the popular fury at length subsided ; leaving behind it , by way of sediment , quite a medley of opinion about this unhappy affair .
one gentleman thought the whole an <unk> joke .
another said that , indeed , bullet-head had shown much <unk> of fancy .
a third admitted him <unk> , but no more .
a fourth could only suppose it the yankee 's design to <unk> , in a general way , his <unk> .
'say , rather , to set an <unk> to posterity , ' suggested a fifth .
that bullet-head had been driven to an extremity , was clear to all ; and in fact , since that editor could not be found , there was some talk about <unk> the other one .
the more common conclusion , however , was that the affair was , simply , <unk> and <unk> .
even the town mathematician confessed that he could make nothing of so dark a problem .
x , every .
body knew , was an unknown quantity ; but in this case ( as he properly observed ) , there was an unknown quantity of x .
the opinion of <name> , the devil ( who kept dark about his having <unk> the <unk> ' ) , did not meet with so much attention as i think it deserved , although it was very openly and very fearlessly expressed .
he said that , for his part , he had no doubt about the matter at all , that it was a clear case , that mr. bullet-head 'never could be persuaded fur to drink like other folks , but vas continually <unk> o ' that ere blessed xxx ale , and as a <unk> <unk> , it just puffed him up savage , and made him x ( cross ) in the <unk> . '
metzengerstein <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
 <name> <name> horror and <unk> have been stalking abroad in all ages .
why then give a date to this story i have to tell ?
let it suffice to say , that at the period of which i speak , there existed , in the interior of hungary , a settled although hidden belief in the doctrines of the <unk> .
of the doctrines themselves  that is , of their <unk> , or of their probability  i say nothing .
i assert , however , that much of our incredulity  as la <unk> says of all our unhappiness  " <unk> de ne <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
{ *1 } but there are some points in the hungarian superstition which were fast <unk> to absurdity .
they  the <unk>  differed very essentially from their eastern authorities .
for example , " the soul , " said the former  i give the words of an acute and intelligent parisian  " ne <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> dans <name> corps sensible : au <unk>  <name> <unk> , <name> <unk> , <name> <unk> meme , <unk> que la <unk> <unk> tangible de ces <unk> " the families of <unk> and metzengerstein had been at variance for centuries .
never before were two houses so illustrious , mutually embittered by hostility so deadly .
the origin of this enmity seems to be found in the words of an ancient prophecy  " a lofty name shall have a fearful fall when , as the rider over his horse , the mortality of metzengerstein shall triumph over the immortality of <unk> . "
to be sure the words themselves had little or no meaning .
but more trivial causes have given rise  and that no long while ago  to consequences equally eventful .
besides , the estates , which were contiguous , had long exercised a rival influence in the affairs of a busy government .
moreover , near neighbors are seldom friends ; and the inhabitants of the castle <unk> might look , from their lofty buttresses , into the very windows of the palace metzengerstein .
least of all had the more than feudal magnificence , thus discovered , a tendency to allay the irritable feelings of the less ancient and less wealthy <unk> .
what wonder then , that the words , however silly , of that prediction , should have succeeded in setting and keeping at variance two families already <unk> to quarrel by every <unk> of hereditary jealousy ?
the prophecy seemed to imply  if it implied anything  a final triumph on the part of the already more powerful house ; and was of course remembered with the more bitter animosity by the weaker and less influential .
wilhelm , count <unk> , although loftily descended , was , at the epoch of this narrative , an infirm and <unk> old man , remarkable for nothing but an inordinate and inveterate personal antipathy to the family of his rival , and so passionate a love of horses , and of hunting , that neither bodily infirmity , great age , nor mental incapacity , prevented his daily participation in the dangers of the <name> .
<name> , baron metzengerstein , was , on the other hand , not yet of age .
his father , the minister g  , died young .
his mother , the <name> <name> , followed him quickly after .
<name> was , at that time , in his fifteenth year .
in a city , fifteen years are no long period  a child may be still a child in his third <unk> : but in a wilderness  in so magnificent a wilderness as that old principality , fifteen years have a far deeper meaning .
from some peculiar circumstances attending the administration of his father , the young baron , at the decease of the former , entered immediately upon his vast possessions .
such estates were seldom held before by a nobleman of hungary .
his castles were without number .
the chief in point of splendor and extent was the " chateau metzengerstein . "
the boundary line of his dominions was never clearly defined ; but his principal park embraced a circuit of fifty miles .
upon the succession of a proprietor so young , with a character so well known , to a fortune so unparalleled , little speculation was afloat in regard to his probable course of conduct .
and , indeed , for the space of three days , the behavior of the heir <unk> herod , and fairly surpassed the expectations of his most enthusiastic admirers .
shameful <unk>  flagrant treacheries  unheard-of atrocities  gave his trembling vassals quickly to understand that no servile submission on their part  no <unk> of conscience on his own  were thenceforward to prove any security against the remorseless fangs of a petty caligula .
on the night of the fourth day , the stables of the castle <unk> were discovered to be on fire ; and the unanimous opinion of the neighborhood added the crime of the incendiary to the already hideous list of the baron 's <unk> and <unk> .
but during the tumult occasioned by this occurrence , the young nobleman himself sat apparently buried in meditation , in a vast and desolate upper apartment of the family palace of metzengerstein .
the <name> although faded tapestry hangings which swung gloomily upon the walls , represented the shadowy and majestic forms of a thousand illustrious ancestors .
here , <unk> priests , and <unk> dignitaries , familiarly seated with the autocrat and the sovereign , put a <unk> on the wishes of a temporal king , or restrained with the <unk> of papal supremacy the rebellious sceptre of the <unk> .
there , the dark , tall <unk> of the princes metzengerstein  their muscular <unk> plunging over the carcasses of fallen foes  startled the <unk> nerves with their vigorous expression ; and here , again , the voluptuous and <unk> figures of the dames of days gone by , floated away in the mazes of an unreal dance to the strains of imaginary <name> .
but as the baron listened , or affected to listen , to the gradually increasing uproar in the stables of <unk>  or perhaps pondered upon some more novel , some more decided act of audacity  his eyes became unwittingly <unk> to the figure of an enormous , and unnaturally colored horse , represented in the tapestry as belonging to a <unk> ancestor of the family of his rival .
the horse itself , in the foreground of the design , stood motionless and <unk>  while farther back , its discomfited rider perished by the dagger of a metzengerstein .
on <name> 's lip arose a fiendish expression , as he became aware of the direction which his glance had , without his consciousness , assumed .
yet he did not remove it .
on the contrary , he could by no means account for the overwhelming anxiety which appeared falling like a pall upon his senses .
it was with difficulty that he reconciled his dreamy and incoherent feelings with the certainty of being awake .
the longer he gazed the more absorbing became the spell  the more impossible did it appear that he could ever withdraw his glance from the fascination of that tapestry .
but the tumult without becoming suddenly more violent , with a compulsory exertion he diverted his attention to the glare of ruddy light thrown full by the flaming stables upon the windows of the apartment .
the action , however , was but momentary , his gaze returned mechanically to the wall .
to his extreme horror and astonishment , the head of the gigantic steed had , in the meantime , altered its position .
the neck of the animal , before arched , as if in compassion , over the prostrate body of its lord , was now extended , at full length , in the direction of the baron .
the eyes , before invisible , now wore an energetic and human expression , while they gleamed with a fiery and unusual red ; and the distended lips of the apparently enraged horse left in full view his gigantic and disgusting teeth .
<unk> with terror , the young nobleman tottered to the door .
as he threw it open , a flash of red light , streaming far into the chamber , flung his shadow with a clear outline against the quivering tapestry , and he shuddered to perceive that shadow  as he staggered awhile upon the threshold  assuming the exact position , and precisely filling up the contour , of the relentless and triumphant murderer of the <unk> <unk> .
to lighten the depression of his spirits , the baron hurried into the open air .
at the principal gate of the palace he encountered three <unk> .
with much difficulty , and at the imminent peril of their lives , they were restraining the convulsive plunges of a gigantic and <unk> horse .
" whose horse ?
where did you get him ? "
demanded the youth , in a <unk> and husky tone of voice , as he became instantly aware that the mysterious steed in the <unk> chamber was the very counterpart of the furious animal before his eyes .
" he is your own property , sire , " replied one of the <unk> , " at least he is claimed by no other owner .
we caught him flying , all smoking and foaming with rage , from the burning stables of the castle <unk> .
supposing him to have belonged to the old count 's stud of foreign horses , we led him back as an <unk> .
but the grooms there <unk> any title to the creature ; which is strange , since he bears evident marks of having made a narrow escape from the flames .
" the letters w. v. b. are also branded very distinctly on his forehead , " interrupted a second <unk> , " i supposed them , of course , to be the initials of wilhelm <name> <unk>  but all at the castle are positive in denying any knowledge of the horse . "
" extremely singular ! "
said the young baron , with a musing air , and apparently unconscious of the meaning of his words .
" he is , as you say , a remarkable horse  a prodigious horse !
although , as you very justly observe , of a suspicious and <unk> character , let him be mine , however , " he added , after a pause , " perhaps a rider like <name> of metzengerstein , may tame even the devil from the stables of <unk> . "
" you are mistaken , my lord ; the horse , as i think we mentioned , is not from the stables of the count .
if such had been the case , we know our duty better than to bring him into the presence of a <name> of your family . "
" true ! "
observed the baron , dryly , and at that instant a <name> of the bedchamber came from the palace with a heightened color , and a precipitate step .
he whispered into his master 's ear an account of the sudden disappearance of a small portion of the tapestry , in an apartment which he designated ; entering , at the same time , into particulars of a minute and circumstantial character ; but from the low tone of voice in which these latter were communicated , nothing escaped to gratify the excited curiosity of the <unk> .
the young <name> , during the conference , seemed agitated by a variety of emotions .
he soon , however , recovered his composure , and an expression of determined <unk> settled upon his countenance , as he gave peremptory orders that a certain chamber should be immediately locked up , and the key placed in his own possession .
" have you heard of the unhappy death of the old <name> <unk> ? "
said one of his vassals to the baron , as , after the departure of the <name> , the huge steed which that nobleman had adopted as his own , plunged and <unk> , with redoubled fury , down the long avenue which extended from the chateau to the stables of metzengerstein .
" no ! "
said the baron , turning abruptly toward the speaker , " dead !
say you ? "
" it is indeed true , my lord ; and , to a <name> of your name , <name> be , i imagine , no unwelcome intelligence . "
a rapid smile shot over the countenance of the listener .
" how died he ? "
" in his rash exertions to rescue a favorite portion of his hunting stud , he has himself perished miserably in the flames . "
" <unk> ! "
ejaculated the baron , as if slowly and deliberately impressed with the truth of some exciting idea .
" indeed ; " repeated the <unk> .
" shocking ! "
said the youth , calmly , and turned quietly into the chateau .
from this date a marked alteration took place in the outward demeanor of the dissolute young baron <name> <name> metzengerstein .
indeed , his behavior disappointed every expectation , and proved little in accordance with the views of many a <unk> mamma ; while his habits and manner , still less than formerly , offered any thing congenial with those of the neighboring aristocracy .
he was never to be seen beyond the limits of his own domain , and , in this wide and social world , was utterly <unk>  unless , indeed , that unnatural , impetuous , and <unk> horse , which he henceforward continually <unk> , had any mysterious right to the title of his friend .
numerous invitations on the part of the neighborhood for a long time , however , periodically came in .
" <name> the baron honor our festivals with his presence ? "
" <name> the baron join us in a hunting of the boar ? "
 " metzengerstein does not hunt ; " " metzengerstein <name> not attend , " were the haughty and <unk> answers .
these repeated insults were not to be endured by an imperious nobility .
such invitations became less cordial  less frequent  in time they ceased altogether .
the widow of the unfortunate count <unk> was even heard to express a <name> " that the baron might be at home when he did not wish to be at home , since he <unk> the company of his equals ; and ride when he did not wish to ride , since he preferred the society of a horse . "
this to be sure was a very silly explosion of hereditary pique ; and merely proved how singularly unmeaning our sayings are apt to become , when we <name> to be unusually energetic .
the charitable , nevertheless , attributed the alteration in the conduct of the young nobleman to the natural sorrow of a son for the untimely loss of his parents  forgetting , however , his atrocious and reckless behavior during the short period immediately succeeding that bereavement .
some there were , indeed , who suggested a too haughty idea of <unk> and dignity .
others again ( among them may be mentioned the family physician ) did not hesitate in speaking of morbid melancholy , and hereditary <unk> ; while dark hints , of a more equivocal nature , were current among the multitude .
indeed , the baron 's perverse attachment to his <unk> charger  an attachment which seemed to attain new strength from every fresh example of the animal 's ferocious and <unk> propensities  at length became , in the eyes of all reasonable men , a hideous and unnatural fervor .
in the glare of noon  at the dead hour of night  in sickness or in health  in calm or in tempest  the young metzengerstein seemed <unk> to the saddle of that colossal horse , whose <unk> <unk> so well accorded with his own spirit .
there were circumstances , moreover , which coupled with late events , gave an unearthly and portentous character to the mania of the rider , and to the <unk> of the steed .
the space passed over in a single leap had been accurately measured , and was found to exceed , by an astounding difference , the wildest expectations of the most imaginative .
the baron , besides , had no particular name for the animal , although all the rest in his collection were distinguished by characteristic <unk> .
his stable , too , was appointed at a distance from the rest ; and with regard to <unk> and other necessary offices , none but the owner in person had ventured to <unk> , or even to enter the enclosure of that particular stall .
it was also to be observed , that although the three grooms , who had caught the steed as he fled from the conflagration at <unk> , had succeeded in arresting his course , by means of a <unk> and noose  yet no one of the three could with any certainty affirm that he had , during that dangerous struggle , or at any period thereafter , actually placed his hand upon the body of the beast .
instances of peculiar intelligence in the demeanor of a <name> and <unk> horse are not to be supposed capable of exciting unreasonable attention  especially among men who , daily trained to the labors of the <name> , might appear well acquainted with the sagacity of a horse  but there were certain circumstances which intruded themselves per force upon the most <unk> and <unk> ; and it is said there were times when the animal caused the gaping crowd who stood around to recoil in horror from the deep and impressive meaning of his terrible stamp  times when the young metzengerstein turned pale and shrunk away from the rapid and searching expression of his <name> and <unk> eye .
among all the retinue of the baron , however , none were found to doubt the ardor of that extraordinary affection which existed on the part of the young nobleman for the fiery qualities of his horse ; at least , none but an insignificant and <unk> little <name> , whose deformities were in everybody 's way , and whose opinions were of the least possible importance .
he  if his ideas are worth mentioning at all  had the effrontery to assert that his master never vaulted into the saddle without an unaccountable and almost imperceptible shudder , and that , upon his return from every long-continued and habitual ride , an expression of triumphant malignity distorted every muscle in his countenance .
one tempestuous night , metzengerstein , awaking from a heavy slumber , descended like a maniac from his chamber , and , mounting in hot haste , bounded away into the mazes of the forest .
an occurrence so common attracted no particular attention , but his return was looked for with intense anxiety on the part of his domestics , when , after some <unk> absence , the stupendous and magnificent battlements of the chateau metzengerstein , were discovered crackling and rocking to their very foundation , under the influence of a dense and livid mass of ungovernable fire .
as the flames , when first seen , had already made so terrible a progress that all efforts to save any portion of the building were evidently futile , the astonished neighborhood stood idly around in silent and pathetic wonder .
but a new and fearful object soon <unk> the attention of the multitude , and proved how much more intense is the excitement wrought in the feelings of a crowd by the contemplation of human agony , than that brought about by the most appalling spectacles of inanimate matter .
up the long avenue of aged oaks which led from the forest to the main entrance of the chateau metzengerstein , a steed , bearing an <unk> and disordered rider , was seen leaping with an impetuosity which <unk> the very demon of the tempest .
the career of the horseman was indisputably , on his own part , uncontrollable .
the agony of his countenance , the convulsive struggle of his frame , gave evidence of superhuman exertion : but no sound , save a solitary shriek , escaped from his <unk> lips , which were bitten through and through in the intensity of terror .
one instant , and the clattering of hoofs resounded sharply and shrilly above the roaring of the flames and the shrieking of the winds  another , and , clearing at a single plunge the <unk> and the moat , the steed bounded far up the tottering staircases of the palace , and , with its rider , disappeared amid the whirlwind of chaotic fire .
the fury of the tempest immediately died away , and a dead calm sullenly succeeded .
a white flame still enveloped the building like a shroud , and , streaming far away into the quiet atmosphere , shot forth a glare of <unk> light ; while a cloud of smoke settled heavily over the battlements in the distinct colossal figure of  a horse .
the system of doctor <unk> and professor <unk> during the autumn of 18  , while on a tour through the extreme southern provinces of <name> , my route led me within a few miles of a certain <unk> de <unk> or private <unk> , about which i had heard much in <name> from my medical friends .
as i had never visited a place of the kind , i thought the opportunity too good to be lost ; and so proposed to my travelling companion ( a gentleman with whom i had made casual acquaintance a few days before ) that we should turn aside , for an hour or so , and look through the establishment .
to this he objected  pleading haste in the first place , and , in the second , a very usual horror at the sight of a lunatic .
he begged me , however , not to let any mere courtesy towards himself interfere with the gratification of my curiosity , and said that he would ride on leisurely , so that i might overtake him during the day , or , at all events , during the next .
as he bade me good-bye , i bethought me that there might be some difficulty in obtaining access to the premises , and mentioned my fears on this point .
he replied that , in fact , unless i had personal knowledge of the superintendent , monsieur maillard , or some <unk> in the way of a letter , a difficulty might be found to exist , as the regulations of these private <unk> were more rigid than the public hospital laws .
for himself , he added , he had , some years since , made the acquaintance of maillard , and would so far assist me as to ride up to the door and introduce me ; although his feelings on the subject of lunacy would not permit of his entering the house .
i thanked him , and , turning from the main road , we entered a <unk> <unk> , which , in half an hour , nearly lost itself in a dense forest , clothing the base of a mountain .
through this dank and gloomy wood we rode some two miles , when the <unk> de <unk> came in view .
it was a fantastic chateau , much dilapidated , and indeed scarcely <unk> through age and neglect .
its aspect inspired me with absolute dread , and , checking my horse , i half resolved to turn back .
i soon , however , grew ashamed of my weakness , and proceeded .
as we rode up to the <unk> , i perceived it slightly open , and the visage of a man peering through .
in an instant afterward , this man came forth , accosted my companion by name , shook him cordially by the hand , and begged him to alight .
it was monsieur maillard himself .
he was a portly , fine-looking gentleman of the old school , with a polished manner , and a certain air of gravity , dignity , and authority which was very impressive .
my friend , having presented me , mentioned my <name> to inspect the establishment , and received monsieur maillard 's assurance that he would show me all attention , now took leave , and i saw him no more .
when he had gone , the superintendent ushered me into a small and exceedingly neat parlor , containing , among other indications of refined taste , many books , drawings , pots of flowers , and musical instruments .
a cheerful fire blazed upon the hearth .
at a piano , singing an <unk> from <unk> , sat a young and very beautiful woman , who , at my entrance , paused in her song , and received me with graceful courtesy .
her voice was low , and her whole manner subdued .
i thought , too , that i perceived the traces of sorrow in her countenance , which was excessively , although to my taste , not <unk> , pale .
she was attired in deep mourning , and excited in my bosom a feeling of mingled respect , interest , and admiration .
i had heard , at <name> , that the institution of monsieur maillard was managed upon what is <unk> termed the " system of soothing "  that all punishments were avoided  that even confinement was seldom resorted to  that the patients , while secretly watched , were left much apparent <name> , and that most of them were permitted to roam about the house and grounds in the ordinary apparel of persons in right mind .
keeping these impressions in view , i was cautious in what i said before the young <name> ; for i could not be sure that she was sane ; and , in fact , there was a certain restless brilliancy about her eyes which half led me to imagine she was not .
i confined my remarks , therefore , to general topics , and to such as i thought would not be <unk> or exciting even to a lunatic .
she replied in a perfectly rational manner to all that i said ; and even her original observations were marked with the soundest good sense , but a long acquaintance with the metaphysics of mania , had taught me to put no <name> in such evidence of sanity , and i continued to practise , throughout the interview , the caution with which i commenced it .
presently a smart footman in livery brought in a tray with fruit , wine , and other refreshments , of which i partook , the <name> soon afterward leaving the room .
as she departed i turned my eyes in an inquiring manner toward my host .
" no , " he said , " oh , no  a member of my family  my niece , and a most accomplished woman . "
" i beg a thousand pardons for the suspicion , " i replied , " but of course you <name> know how to excuse me .
the excellent administration of your affairs here is well understood in <name> , and i thought it just possible , you know  " yes , yes  say no more  or rather it is myself who should thank you for the commendable <name> you have displayed .
we seldom find so much of forethought in young men ; and , more than once , some unhappy <unk> has occurred in consequence of <unk> on the part of our visitors .
while my former system was in operation , and my patients were permitted the privilege of roaming to and fro at <name> , they were often aroused to a dangerous frenzy by <unk> persons who called to inspect the house .
hence i was obliged to enforce a rigid system of exclusion ; and none obtained access to the premises upon whose discretion i could not rely . "
" while your former system was in operation ! "
i said , repeating his words  " do i understand you , then , to say that the <unk> system ' of which i have heard so much is no longer in force ? "
" it is now , " he replied , " several weeks since we have concluded to renounce it forever . "
" indeed !
you astonish me ! "
" we found it , sir , " he said , with a sigh , " absolutely necessary to return to the old usages .
the danger of the soothing system was , at all times , appalling ; and its advantages have been much overrated .
i believe , sir , that in this house it has been given a fair trial , if ever in any .
we did every thing that rational humanity could suggest .
i am sorry that you could not have paid us a visit at an earlier period , that you might have judged for yourself .
but i presume you are conversant with the soothing practice  with its details . "
" not altogether .
what i have heard has been at third or fourth hand . "
" i may state the system , then , in general terms , as one in which the patients were <unk> .
we contradicted no fancies which entered the brains of the mad .
on the contrary , we not only indulged but encouraged them ; and many of our most permanent cures have been thus effected .
there is no argument which so touches the feeble reason of the madman as the <unk> ad <unk> .
we have had men , for example , who fancied themselves chickens .
the cure was , to insist upon the thing as a fact  to accuse the patient of stupidity in not sufficiently perceiving it to be a fact  and thus to refuse him any other diet for a week than that which properly <unk> to a chicken .
in this manner a little corn and gravel were made to perform wonders . "
" but was this species of acquiescence all ? "
" by no means .
we put much <name> in amusements of a simple kind , such as music , dancing , gymnastic exercises generally , cards , certain classes of books , and so forth .
we affected to treat each individual as if for some ordinary physical disorder , and the word <unk> ' was never employed .
a great point was to set each lunatic to guard the actions of all the others .
to repose confidence in the understanding or discretion of a madman , is to gain him body and soul .
in this way we were enabled to dispense with an expensive body of keepers . "
" and you had no punishments of any kind ? "
" none . "
" and you never confined your patients ? "
" very rarely .
now and then , the malady of some individual growing to a crisis , or taking a sudden turn of fury , we conveyed him to a secret cell , lest his disorder should <unk> the rest , and there kept him until we could dismiss him to his friends  for with the raging maniac we have nothing to do .
he is usually removed to the public hospitals . "
" and you have now changed all this  and you think for the better ? "
" decidedly .
the system had its disadvantages , and even its dangers .
it is now , happily , exploded throughout all the <unk> de <unk> of <name> . "
" i am very much surprised , " i said , " at what you tell me ; for i made sure that , at this moment , no other method of treatment for mania existed in any portion of the country . "
" you are young yet , my friend , " replied my host , " but the time <name> arrive when you <name> learn to judge for yourself of what is going on in the world , without trusting to the gossip of others .
believe nothing you hear , and only one-half that you see .
now about our <unk> de <unk> , it is clear that some <unk> has misled you .
after dinner , however , when you have sufficiently recovered from the fatigue of your ride , i <name> be happy to take you over the house , and introduce to you a system which , in my opinion , and in that of every one who has witnessed its operation , is incomparably the most effectual as yet devised . "
" your own ? "
i inquired  " one of your own invention ? "
" i am proud , " he replied , " to acknowledge that it is  at least in some measure . "
in this manner i conversed with monsieur maillard for an hour or two , during which he showed me the gardens and <unk> of the place .
" i can not let you see my patients , " he said , " just at present .
to a sensitive mind there is always more or less of the shocking in such exhibitions ; and i do not wish to spoil your appetite for dinner .
we <name> dine .
i can give you some <unk> a la <unk> , with <unk> in <unk> sauce  after that a glass of <unk> de <unk>  then your nerves <name> be sufficiently steadied . "
at six , dinner was announced ; and my host conducted me into a large salle a manger , where a very numerous company were assembled  twenty-five or thirty in all .
they were , apparently , people of <unk> of high breeding  although their <unk> , i thought , were extravagantly <name> , partaking somewhat too much of the ostentatious finery of the <unk> <unk> .
i noticed that at least two-thirds of these guests were ladies ; and some of the latter were by no means <unk> in what a parisian would consider good taste at the present day .
many females , for example , whose age could not have been less than seventy were <unk> with a profusion of jewelry , such as rings , bracelets , and earrings , and wore their bosoms and arms shamefully bare .
i observed , too , that very few of the dresses were well made  or , at least , that very few of them fitted the <unk> .
in looking about , i discovered the interesting girl to whom monsieur maillard had presented me in the little parlor ; but my surprise was great to see her wearing a hoop and <unk> , with <unk> shoes , and a dirty cap of brussels lace , so much too large for her that it gave her face a ridiculously diminutive expression .
when i had first seen her , she was attired , most <unk> , in deep mourning .
there was an air of oddity , in short , about the dress of the whole party , which , at first , caused me to recur to my original idea of the " soothing system , " and to fancy that monsieur maillard had been willing to deceive me until after dinner , that i might experience no uncomfortable feelings during the repast , at finding myself dining with lunatics ; but i remembered having been informed , in <name> , that the southern <unk> were a peculiarly eccentric people , with a vast number of <unk> notions ; and then , too , upon conversing with several members of the company , my apprehensions were immediately and fully dispelled .
the dining-room itself , although perhaps sufficiently comfortable and of good dimensions , had nothing too much of elegance about it .
for example , the floor was <unk> ; in <name> , however , a carpet is frequently dispensed with .
the windows , too , were without curtains ; the shutters , being shut , were securely fastened with iron bars , applied diagonally , after the fashion of our ordinary <unk> .
the apartment , i observed , formed , in itself , a wing of the chateau , and thus the windows were on three sides of the <unk> , the door being at the other .
there were no less than ten windows in all .
the table was superbly set out .
it was loaded with plate , and more than loaded with delicacies .
the profusion was absolutely barbaric .
there were meats enough to have feasted the <unk> .
never , in all my life , had i witnessed so lavish , so wasteful an expenditure of the good things of life .
there seemed very little taste , however , in the arrangements ; and my eyes , accustomed to quiet lights , were sadly offended by the prodigious glare of a multitude of wax candles , which , in silver <unk> , were deposited upon the table , and all about the room , wherever it was possible to find a place .
there were several active servants in attendance ; and , upon a large table , at the farther end of the apartment , were seated seven or eight people with <unk> , fifes , <unk> , and a drum .
these fellows annoyed me very much , at intervals , during the repast , by an infinite variety of noises , which were intended for music , and which appeared to afford much entertainment to all present , with the exception of myself .
upon the whole , i could not help thinking that there was much of the bizarre about every thing i saw  but then the world is made up of all kinds of persons , with all modes of thought , and all sorts of conventional customs .
i had travelled , too , so much , as to be quite an <unk> at the <unk> <unk> ; so i took my seat very coolly at the right hand of my host , and , having an excellent appetite , did justice to the good cheer set before me .
the conversation , in the meantime , was spirited and general .
the ladies , as usual , talked a great deal .
i soon found that nearly all the company were well educated ; and my host was a world of good-humored anecdote in himself .
he seemed quite willing to speak of his position as superintendent of a <unk> de <unk> ; and , indeed , the topic of lunacy was , much to my surprise , a favorite one with all present .
a great many amusing stories were told , having reference to the whims of the patients .
" we had a fellow here once , " said a fat little gentleman , who sat at my right ,  " a fellow that fancied himself a <unk> ; and by the way , is it not especially singular how often this particular <unk> has entered the <name> of the lunatic ?
there is scarcely an insane asylum in <name> which can not supply a human <unk> .
our gentleman was a <unk>  ware <unk> , and was careful to polish himself every morning with buckskin and whiting . "
" and then , " said a tall man just opposite , " we had here , not long ago , a person who had taken it into his head that he was a donkey  which <unk> speaking , you <name> say , was quite true .
he was a troublesome patient ; and we had much ado to keep him within bounds .
for a long time he would eat nothing but thistles ; but of this idea we soon cured him by insisting upon his eating nothing else .
then he was perpetually kicking out his <unk> " " mr. de <unk> !
i <name> thank you to behave yourself ! "
here interrupted an old <name> , who sat next to the speaker .
" please keep your feet to yourself !
you have spoiled my <unk> !
is it necessary , pray , to illustrate a remark in so practical a style ?
our friend here can surely comprehend you without all this .
upon my word , you are nearly as great a donkey as the poor unfortunate imagined himself .
your acting is very natural , as i live . "
" mille pardons !
<unk> ! "
replied monsieur de <unk> , thus addressed  " a thousand pardons !
i had no intention of offending .
<unk> laplace  monsieur de <unk> <name> do himself the honor of taking wine with you . "
here monsieur de <unk> bowed low , kissed his hand with much ceremony , and took wine with <unk> laplace .
" allow me , mon <name> , " now said monsieur maillard , addressing myself , " allow me to send you a morsel of this <unk> a la st. <unk>  you <name> find it particularly fine . "
at this instant three sturdy waiters had just succeeded in depositing safely upon the table an enormous dish , or <unk> , containing what i supposed to be the " <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> . "
a closer scrutiny assured me , however , that it was only a small calf roasted whole , and set upon its knees , with an apple in its mouth , as is the english fashion of dressing a hare .
" thank you , no , " i replied ; " to say the truth , i am not particularly partial to <unk> a la st.  what is it ?  for i do not find that it altogether agrees with me .
i <name> change my plate , however , and try some of the rabbit . "
there were several <unk> on the table , containing what appeared to be the ordinary french rabbit  a very delicious <unk> , which i can recommend .
" <name> , " cried the host , " change this gentleman 's plate , and give him a <unk> of this rabbit <unk> . "
" this what ? "
said i .
" this rabbit <unk> . "
" why , thank you  upon second thoughts , no .
i <name> just help myself to some of the ham . "
there is no knowing what one eats , thought i to myself , at the tables of these people of the province .
i <name> have none of their rabbit <unk>  and , for the matter of that , none of their <unk> either .
" and then , " said a <unk> looking personage , near the foot of the table , taking up the thread of the conversation where it had been broken off ,  " and then , among other oddities , we had a patient , once upon a time , who very pertinaciously maintained himself to be a <unk> cheese , and went about , with a knife in his hand , <unk> his friends to try a small slice from the middle of his leg . "
" he was a great fool , beyond doubt , " interposed some one , " but not to be compared with a certain individual whom we all know , with the exception of this strange gentleman .
i mean the man who took himself for a bottle of champagne , and always went off with a pop and a <unk> , in this fashion . "
here the speaker , very rudely , as i thought , put his right thumb in his left cheek , withdrew it with a sound resembling the popping of a cork , and then , by a dexterous movement of the tongue upon the teeth , created a sharp hissing and <unk> , which lasted for several minutes , in imitation of the frothing of champagne .
this behavior , i saw plainly , was not very pleasing to monsieur maillard ; but that gentleman said nothing , and the conversation was resumed by a very <name> little man in a big wig .
" and then there was an <unk> , " said he , " who mistook himself for a frog , which , by the way , he resembled in no little degree .
i wish you could have seen him , sir , "  here the speaker addressed myself  " it would have done your heart good to see the natural airs that he put on .
sir , if that man was not a frog , i can only observe that it is a pity he was not .
his croak thus  <unk>  <unk> !
was the finest note in the world  b flat ; and when he put his elbows upon the table thus  after taking a glass or two of wine  and distended his mouth , thus , and rolled up his eyes , thus , and winked them with excessive rapidity , thus , why then , sir , i take it upon myself to say , positively , that you would have been lost in admiration of the genius of the man . "
" i have no doubt of it , " i said .
" and then , " said somebody else , " then there was <unk> <unk> , who thought himself a pinch of snuff , and was truly distressed because he could not take himself between his own finger and thumb . "
" and then there was <name> <unk> , who was a very singular genius , indeed , and went mad with the idea that he was a pumpkin .
he persecuted the cook to make him up into pies  a thing which the cook indignantly refused to do .
for my part , i am by no means sure that a pumpkin pie a la <unk> would not have been very capital eating indeed ! "
" you astonish me ! "
said i ; and i looked <unk> at monsieur maillard .
" <name> !
<name> !
<name> ! "
said that gentleman  " he !
he !
he !  hi !
hi !
hi !  ho !
ho !
ho !  hu !
hu !
hu !
hu !  very good indeed !
you must not be astonished , mon <name> ; our friend here is a wit  a <unk>  you must not understand him to the letter . "
" and then , " said some other one of the party ,  " then there was <unk> <name> grand  another extraordinary personage in his way .
he grew deranged through love , and fancied himself possessed of two heads .
one of these he maintained to be the head of cicero ; the other he imagined a composite one , being demosthenes ' from the top of the forehead to the mouth , and lord brougham 's from the mouth to the <name> .
it is not impossible that he was wrong ; but he would have convinced you of his being in the right ; for he was a man of great eloquence .
he had an absolute passion for oratory , and could not refrain from display .
for example , he used to leap upon the dinner-table thus , and  and " here a friend , at the side of the speaker , put a hand upon his shoulder and whispered a few words in his ear , upon which he ceased talking with great suddenness , and sank back within his chair .
" and then , " said the friend who had whispered , " there was <unk> , the <unk> .
i call him the <unk> because , in fact , he was seized with the droll but not altogether irrational <unk> , that he had been converted into a <unk> .
you would have roared with laughter to see him spin .
he would turn round upon one heel by the hour , in this manner  so  " here the friend whom he had just interrupted by a whisper , performed an exactly similar office for himself .
" but then , " cried the old <name> , at the top of her voice , " your monsieur <unk> was a madman , and a very silly madman at best ; for who , allow me to ask you , ever heard of a human <unk> ?
the thing is absurd .
madame <unk> was a more sensible person , as you know .
she had a <unk> , but it was instinct with common sense , and gave pleasure to all who had the honor of her acquaintance .
she found , upon mature deliberation , that , by some accident , she had been turned into a <unk> ; but , as such , she behaved with propriety .
she flapped her wings with prodigious effect  so  so  and , as for her crow , it was delicious !
<unk> !  <unk> !  <unk> <unk> ! "
" madame <unk> , i <name> thank you to behave yourself ! "
here interrupted our host , very angrily .
" you can either conduct yourself as a <name> should do , or you can quit the table <unk> your choice . "
the <name> ( whom i was much astonished to hear addressed as madame <unk> , after the description of madame <unk> she had just given ) blushed up to the eyebrows , and seemed exceedingly abashed at the reproof .
she <name> down her head , and said not a syllable in reply .
but another and younger <name> resumed the theme .
it was my beautiful girl of the little parlor .
" oh , madame <unk> was a fool ! "
she exclaimed , " but there was really much sound sense , after all , in the opinion of <name> <unk> .
she was a very beautiful and painfully modest young <name> , who thought the ordinary mode of <unk> indecent , and wished to dress herself , always , by getting outside instead of inside of her clothes .
it is a thing very easily done , after all .
you have only to do so  and then so  so  so  and then so  so  so  and then so  so  and then  " mon dieu !
<unk> <unk> ! "
here cried a dozen voices at once .
" what are you about ?  forbear !  that is sufficient !  we see , very plainly , how it is done !  hold !
hold ! "
and several persons were already leaping from their seats to withhold <unk> <unk> from putting herself upon a par with the <unk> <name> , when the point was very effectually and suddenly accomplished by a series of loud screams , or yells , from some portion of the main body of the chateau .
my nerves were very much affected , indeed , by these yells ; but the rest of the company i really pitied .
i never saw any set of reasonable people so thoroughly frightened in my life .
they all grew as pale as so many corpses , and , shrinking within their seats , sat quivering and <unk> with terror , and listening for a repetition of the sound .
it came again  louder and seemingly nearer  and then a third time very loud , and then a fourth time with a vigor evidently diminished .
at this apparent dying away of the noise , the spirits of the company were immediately regained , and all was life and anecdote as before .
i now ventured to inquire the cause of the disturbance .
" a mere <unk> , " said monsieur maillard .
" we are used to these things , and care really very little about them .
the lunatics , every now and then , get up a howl in concert ; one starting another , as is sometimes the case with a <unk> of dogs at night .
it occasionally happens , however , that the <unk> yells are succeeded by a simultaneous effort at breaking loose , when , of course , some little danger is to be apprehended . "
" and how many have you in charge ? "
" at present we have not more than ten , altogether . "
" principally females , i presume ? "
" oh , no  every one of them men , and stout fellows , too , i can tell you . "
" indeed !
i have always understood that the majority of lunatics were of the gentler sex . "
" it is generally so , but not always .
some time ago , there were about twenty-seven patients here ; and , of that number , no less than eighteen were women ; but , lately , matters have changed very much , as you see . "
" yes  have changed very much , as you see , " here interrupted the gentleman who had broken the shins of <unk> laplace .
" yes  have changed very much , as you see ! "
chimed in the whole company at once .
" hold your tongues , every one of you ! "
said my host , in a great rage .
whereupon the whole company maintained a dead silence for nearly a minute .
as for one <name> , she obeyed monsieur maillard to the letter , and thrusting out her tongue , which was an excessively long one , held it very resignedly , with both hands , until the end of the entertainment .
" and this <unk> , " said i , to monsieur maillard , bending over and addressing him in a whisper  " this good <name> who has just spoken , and who gives us the <unk>  she , i presume , is harmless  quite harmless , eh ? "
" harmless ! "
ejaculated he , in <unk> surprise , " why  why , what can you mean ? "
" only slightly touched ? "
said i , touching my head .
" i take it for granted that she is not particularly not dangerously affected , eh ? "
" mon dieu !
what is it you imagine ?
this <name> , my particular old friend madame <unk> , is as absolutely sane as myself .
she has her little eccentricities , to be sure  but then , you know , all old women  all very old women  are more or less eccentric ! "
" to be sure , " said i ,  " to be sure  and then the rest of these ladies and gentlemen " " are my friends and keepers , " <unk> monsieur maillard , drawing himself up with <unk> ,  " my very good friends and assistants . "
" what !
all of them ? "
i asked ,  " the women and all ? "
" assuredly , " he said ,  " we could not do at all without the women ; they are the best lunatic nurses in the world ; they have a way of their own , you know ; their bright eyes have a marvellous effect ;  something like the fascination of the snake , you know . "
" to be sure , " said i ,  " to be sure !
they behave a little odd , eh ?  they are a little queer , eh ?  do n't you think so ? "
" odd !  queer !  why , do you really think so ?
we are not very <unk> , to be sure , here in the south  do pretty much as we please  enjoy life , and all that sort of thing , you know " " to be sure , " said i ,  " to be sure . "
" and then , perhaps , this <unk> de <unk> is a little <unk> , you know  a little strong  you understand , eh ? "
" to be sure , " said i ,  " to be sure .
by the bye , monsieur , did i understand you to say that the system you have adopted , in place of the celebrated soothing system , was one of very rigorous severity ? "
" by no means .
our confinement is necessarily close ; but the treatment  the medical treatment , i mean  is rather agreeable to the patients than otherwise . "
" and the new system is one of your own invention ? "
" not altogether .
some portions of it are referable to professor <unk> , of whom you have , necessarily , heard ; and , again , there are modifications in my plan which i am happy to acknowledge as belonging of right to the celebrated <unk> , with whom , if i mistake not , you have the honor of an intimate acquaintance . "
" i am quite ashamed to confess , " i replied , " that i have never even heard the names of either gentleman before . "
" good heavens ! "
ejaculated my host , drawing back his chair abruptly , and uplifting his hands .
" i surely do not hear you aright !
you did not intend to say , eh ?
that you had never heard either of the learned doctor <unk> , or of the celebrated professor <unk> ? "
" i am forced to acknowledge my ignorance , " i replied ; " but the truth should be held <unk> above all things .
nevertheless , i feel humbled to the dust , not to be acquainted with the works of these , no doubt , extraordinary men .
i <name> seek out their writings forthwith , and peruse them with deliberate care .
monsieur maillard , you have really  i must confess it  you have really  made me ashamed of myself ! "
and this was the fact .
" say no more , my good young friend , " he said kindly , pressing my hand ,  " join me now in a glass of <unk> . "
we drank .
the company followed our example without stint .
they chatted  they <unk>  they laughed  they perpetrated a thousand absurdities  the <unk> shrieked  the drum <unk>  the <unk> bellowed like so many brazen bulls of <unk>  and the whole scene , growing gradually worse and worse , as the wines gained the ascendancy , became at length a sort of pandemonium in <unk> .
in the meantime , monsieur maillard and myself , with some bottles of <unk> and <unk> between us , continued our conversation at the top of the voice .
a word spoken in an ordinary key stood no more chance of being heard than the voice of a fish from the bottom of niagara falls .
" and , sir , " said i , screaming in his ear , " you mentioned something before dinner about the danger incurred in the old system of soothing .
how is that ? "
" yes , " he replied , " there was , occasionally , very great danger indeed .
there is no accounting for the caprices of madmen ; and , in my opinion as well as in that of dr. <unk> and professor <unk> , it is never safe to permit them to run at large unattended .
a lunatic may be <unk> , ' as it is called , for a time , but , in the end , he is very apt to become <unk> .
his cunning , too , is proverbial and great .
if he has a project in view , he <unk> his design with a marvellous wisdom ; and the dexterity with which he <unk> sanity , presents , to the metaphysician , one of the most singular problems in the study of mind .
when a madman appears thoroughly sane , indeed , it is high time to put him in a <unk> . "
" but the danger , my dear sir , of which you were speaking , in your own experience  during your control of this house  have you had practical reason to think <name> hazardous in the case of a lunatic ? "
" here ?  in my own experience ?  why , i may say , yes .
for example :  no very long while ago , a singular circumstance occurred in this very house .
the <unk> system , ' you know , was then in operation , and the patients were at large .
they behaved remarkably <unk> so , any one of sense might have known that some devilish scheme was brewing from that particular fact , that the fellows behaved so remarkably well .
and , sure enough , one fine morning the keepers found themselves pinioned hand and foot , and thrown into the cells , where they were attended , as if they were the lunatics , by the lunatics themselves , who had usurped the offices of the keepers . "
" you do n't tell me so !
i never heard of any thing so absurd in my life ! "
" fact  it all came to pass by means of a stupid fellow  a lunatic  who , by some means , had taken it into his head that he had invented a better system of government than any ever heard of before  of lunatic government , i mean .
he wished to give his invention a trial , i suppose , and so he persuaded the rest of the patients to join him in a conspiracy for the overthrow of the reigning powers . "
" and he really succeeded ? "
" no doubt of it .
the keepers and kept were soon made to exchange places .
not that exactly either  for the madmen had been free , but the keepers were shut up in cells forthwith , and treated , i am sorry to say , in a very cavalier manner . "
" but i presume a <unk> was soon effected .
this condition of things could not have long existed .
the country people in the <unk> coming to see the establishment  would have given the alarm . "
" there you are out .
the head rebel was too cunning for that .
he admitted no visitors at all  with the exception , one day , of a very <unk> young gentleman of whom he had no reason to be afraid .
he let him in to see the place  just by way of variety ,  to have a little fun with him .
as soon as he had <unk> him sufficiently , he let him out , and sent him about his business . "
" and how long , then , did the madmen reign ? "
" oh , a very long time , indeed  a month certainly  how much longer i ca n't precisely say .
in the meantime , the lunatics had a jolly season of it  that you may swear .
they <unk> their own shabby clothes , and made free with the family wardrobe and jewels .
the cellars of the chateau were well stocked with wine ; and these madmen are just the devils that know how to drink it .
they lived well , i can tell you . "
" and the treatment  what was the particular species of treatment which the leader of the rebels put into operation ? "
" why , as for that , a madman is not necessarily a fool , as i have already observed ; and it is my honest opinion that his treatment was a much better treatment than that which it superseded .
it was a very capital system indeed  simple  neat  no trouble at all  in fact it was delicious it was . "
here my host 's observations were cut short by another series of yells , of the same character as those which had previously disconcerted us .
this time , however , they seemed to proceed from persons rapidly approaching .
" gracious heavens ! "
i ejaculated  " the lunatics have most undoubtedly broken loose . "
" i very much fear it is so , " replied monsieur maillard , now becoming excessively pale .
he had scarcely finished the sentence , before loud shouts and imprecations were heard beneath the windows ; and , immediately afterward , it became evident that some persons outside were endeavoring to gain entrance into the room .
the door was beaten with what appeared to be a <unk> , and the shutters were wrenched and shaken with prodigious violence .
a scene of the most terrible confusion ensued .
monsieur maillard , to my excessive astonishment threw himself under the <unk> .
i had expected more resolution at his hands .
the members of the orchestra , who , for the last fifteen minutes , had been seemingly too much intoxicated to do duty , now sprang all at once to their feet and to their instruments , and , scrambling upon their table , broke out , with one accord , into , " yankee <unk> , " which they performed , if not exactly in tune , at least with an energy superhuman , during the whole of the uproar .
meantime , upon the main <unk> , among the bottles and glasses , leaped the gentleman who , with such difficulty , had been restrained from leaping there before .
as soon as he fairly settled himself , he commenced an oration , which , no doubt , was a very capital one , if it could only have been heard .
at the same moment , the man with the <unk> <unk> , set himself to spinning around the apartment , with immense energy , and with arms outstretched at right angles with his body ; so that he had all the air of a <unk> in fact , and knocked everybody down that happened to get in his way .
and now , too , hearing an incredible popping and <unk> of champagne , i discovered at length , that it proceeded from the person who performed the bottle of that delicate drink during dinner .
and then , again , the <unk> croaked away as if the salvation of his soul depended upon every note that he uttered .
and , in the midst of all this , the continuous braying of a donkey arose over all .
as for my old friend , madame <unk> , i really could have wept for the poor <name> , she appeared so terribly perplexed .
all she did , however , was to stand up in a corner , by the fireplace , and sing out incessantly at the top of her voice , " <unk> ! "
and now came the climax  the catastrophe of the drama .
as no resistance , beyond whooping and yelling and <unk> , was offered to the encroachments of the party without , the ten windows were very speedily , and almost simultaneously , broken in .
but i shall never forget the emotions of wonder and horror with which i gazed , when , leaping through these windows , and down among us <unk> , fighting , stamping , scratching , and howling , there rushed a perfect army of what i took to be <unk> , <unk> , or big black baboons of the cape of good <name> .
i received a terrible beating  after which i rolled under a sofa and lay still .
after lying there some fifteen minutes , during which time i listened with all my ears to what was going on in the room , i came to same satisfactory <unk> of this tragedy .
monsieur maillard , it appeared , in giving me the account of the lunatic who had excited his fellows to rebellion , had been merely relating his own exploits .
this gentleman had , indeed , some two or three years before , been the superintendent of the establishment , but grew crazy himself , and so became a patient .
this fact was unknown to the travelling companion who introduced me .
the keepers , ten in number , having been suddenly overpowered , were first well tarred , then  carefully feathered , and then shut up in underground cells .
they had been so imprisoned for more than a month , during which period monsieur maillard had generously allowed them not only the tar and feathers ( which constituted his " system " ) , but some bread and abundance of water .
the latter was pumped on them daily .
at length , one escaping through a sewer , gave freedom to all the rest .
the " soothing system , " with important modifications , has been resumed at the chateau ; yet i can not help agreeing with monsieur maillard , that his own " treatment " was a very capital one of its kind .
as he justly observed , it was " simple  neat  and gave no trouble at all  not the least . "
i have only to add that , although i have searched every library in europe for the works of doctor <unk> and professor <unk> , i have , up to the present day , utterly failed in my endeavors at procuring an edition .
how to write a blackwood article .
" in the name of the prophet  figs ! ! "
cry of the turkish <unk> .
i presume everybody has heard of me .
my name is the <unk> psyche <name> .
this i know to be a fact .
nobody but my enemies ever calls me <unk> <unk> .
i have been assured that <unk> is but a vulgar corruption of psyche , which is good greek , and means " the soul " ( that 's me , i'm all soul ) and sometimes " a butterfly , " which latter meaning undoubtedly alludes to my appearance in my new crimson satin dress , with the sky-blue arabian <unk> , and the trimmings of green <unk> , and the seven <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
as for <unk>  any person who should look at me would be instantly aware that my name wasn't <unk> .
miss <name> turnip propagated that report through sheer envy .
<name> turnip indeed !
oh the little wretch !
but what can we expect from a turnip ?
wonder if she remembers the old <unk> about " blood out of a turnip , " & c. ?
[ mem .
put her in mind of it the first opportunity . ]
[ mem .
again  pull her nose . ]
where was i ?
ah !
i have been assured that <unk> is a mere corruption of <name> , and that <name> was a <name>  ( so am i. dr. <unk> always calls me the <name> of the hearts )  and that <name> , as well as psyche , is good greek , and that my father was " a greek , " and that consequently i have a right to our <unk> , which is <name> and not by any means <unk> .
nobody but <name> turnip calls me <unk> <unk> .
i am the <unk> psyche <name> .
as i said before , everybody has heard of me .
i am that very <unk> psyche <name> , so justly celebrated as corresponding secretary to the " philadelphia , regular , exchange , tea , total , young , <unk> , <unk> , universal , experimental , <unk> , association , to , <unk> , humanity . "
dr. <unk> made the title for us , and says he chose it because it sounded big like an empty <unk> .
( a vulgar man that sometimes  but he 's deep . )
we all sign the initials of the society after our names , in the fashion of the r. s. a. , <name> society of arts  the s. d. u. k. , society for the diffusion of useful knowledge , & c , & c. dr. <unk> says that s. stands for stale , and that d. u. k. spells duck , ( but it do n't , ) that s. d. u. k. stands for stale duck and not for lord brougham 's society  but then dr. <unk> is such a queer man that i am never sure when he is telling me the truth .
at any rate we always add to our names the initials p. r. e. t. t. y .
b. l. u. e. b .
a. t. c. h.  that is to say , philadelphia , regular , exchange , tea , total , young , <unk> , <unk> , universal , experimental , <unk> , association , to , <unk> , humanity  one letter for each word , which is a decided improvement upon lord brougham .
dr. <unk> <name> have it that our initials give our true character  but for my life i ca n't see what he means .
notwithstanding the good offices of the doctor , and the strenuous exertions of the association to get itself into notice , it met with no very great success until i joined it .
the truth is , the members indulged in too flippant a tone of discussion .
the papers read every saturday evening were characterized less by depth than <unk> .
they were all whipped <unk> .
there was no investigation of first causes , first principles .
there was no investigation of any thing at all .
there was no attention paid to that great point , the " fitness of things . "
in short there was no fine writing like this .
it was all low  very !
no profundity , no reading , no metaphysics  nothing which the learned call <unk> , and which the <unk> choose to <unk> as cant .
[ dr. m. says i ought to spell " cant " with a capital k  but i know better . ]
when i joined the society it was my endeavor to introduce a better style of thinking and writing , and all the world knows how well i have succeeded .
we get up as good papers now in the p. r. e. t. t. y .
b. l. u. e. b .
a. t. c. h. as any to be found even in blackwood .
i say , blackwood , because i have been assured that the finest writing , upon every subject , is to be discovered in the pages of that justly celebrated magazine .
we now take it for our model upon all themes , and are getting into rapid notice accordingly .
and , after all , it 's not so very difficult a matter to compose an article of the genuine blackwood stamp , if one only goes properly about it .
of course i do n't speak of the political articles .
everybody knows how they are managed , since dr. <unk> explained it .
mr. blackwood has a pair of <unk> , and three apprentices who stand by him for orders .
one hands him the " times , " another the " <unk> " and a third a " <unk> 's new <unk> of <unk> . "
mr. b. merely cuts out and <unk> .
it is soon done  nothing but " <unk> , " " <unk> , " and " times "  then " times , " " <unk> , " and " <unk> "  and then " times , " " <unk> , " and " <unk> . "
but the chief merit of the magazine lies in its miscellaneous articles ; and the best of these come under the head of what dr. <unk> calls the <unk> ( whatever that may mean ) and what everybody else calls the <unk> .
this is a species of writing which i have long known how to appreciate , although it is only since my late visit to mr. blackwood ( <unk> by the society ) that i have been made aware of the exact method of composition .
this method is very simple , but not so much so as the politics .
upon my calling at mr .
b .
's , and making known to him the wishes of the society , he received me with great civility , took me into his study , and gave me a clear explanation of the whole process .
" my dear madam , " said he , evidently struck with my majestic appearance , for i had on the crimson satin , with the green <unk> , and <unk> <unk> .
" my dear madam , " said he , " sit down .
the matter stands thus : in the first place your writer of <unk> must have very black ink , and a very big pen , with a very blunt <unk> .
and , <name> me , miss psyche <name> ! "
he continued , after a pause , with the most expressive energy and solemnity of manner , " <name> me !  that pen  must  never be mended !
herein , madam , lies the secret , the soul , of intensity .
i assume upon myself to say , that no individual , of however great genius ever wrote with a good pen  understand me ,  a good article .
you may take , it for granted , that when manuscript can be read it is never worth reading .
this is a leading principle in our <name> , to which if you can not readily assent , our conference is at an end . "
he paused .
but , of course , as i had no wish to put an end to the conference , i assented to a proposition so very obvious , and one , too , of whose truth i had all along been sufficiently aware .
he seemed pleased , and went on with his instructions .
" it may appear <unk> in me , miss psyche <name> , to refer you to any article , or set of articles , in the way of model or study , yet perhaps i may as well call your attention to a few cases .
let me see .
there was 'the dead alive , ' a capital thing !  the record of a <unk> sensations when entombed before the breath was out of his body  full of tastes , terror , sentiment , metaphysics , and erudition .
you would have sworn that the writer had been born and brought up in a coffin .
then we had the <unk> of an <unk> '  fine , very fine !  glorious imagination  deep philosophy acute speculation  plenty of fire and fury , and a good <unk> of the decidedly unintelligible .
that was a nice bit of <unk> , and went down the throats of the people delightfully .
they would have it that coleridge wrote the paper  but not so .
it was composed by my pet baboon , <unk> , over a <unk> of <unk> and water , <unk> , without sugar . ' "
[ this i could scarcely have believed had it been anybody but mr. blackwood , who assured me of it . ]
" then there was 'the involuntary <unk> , ' all about a gentleman who got baked in an oven , and came out alive and well , although certainly done to a turn .
and then there was 'the diary of a late physician , ' where the merit lay in good <unk> , and indifferent greek  both of them taking things with the public .
and then there was 'the man in the <name> , ' a paper <unk> , miss <name> , which i can not sufficiently recommend to your attention .
it is the history of a young person who goes to sleep under the clapper of a church <name> , and is awakened by its tolling for a funeral .
the sound drives him mad , and , accordingly , pulling out his tablets , he gives a record of his sensations .
sensations are the great things after all .
should you ever be drowned or <name> , be sure and make a note of your sensations  they <name> be worth to you ten guineas a sheet .
if you wish to write forcibly , miss <name> , pay minute attention to the sensations . "
" that i certainly <name> , mr. blackwood , " said i .
" good ! "
he replied .
" i see you are a pupil after my own heart .
but i must put you au fait to the details necessary in composing what may be <unk> a genuine blackwood article of the sensation stamp  the kind which you <name> understand me to say i consider the best for all purposes .
" the first thing requisite is to get yourself into such a scrape as no one ever got into before .
the oven , for instance ,  that was a good hit .
but if you have no oven or big <name> , at hand , and if you can not conveniently tumble out of a balloon , or be swallowed up in an earthquake , or get stuck fast in a chimney , you <name> have to be contented with simply imagining some similar <unk> .
i should prefer , however , that you have the actual fact to bear you out .
nothing so well <unk> the fancy , as an experimental knowledge of the matter in hand .
<unk> is strange , ' you know , <unk> than fiction '  besides being more to the purpose . "
here i assured him i had an excellent pair of <unk> , and would go and <name> myself forthwith .
" good ! "
he replied , " do so ;  although hanging is somewhat <unk> .
perhaps you might do better .
take a dose of <unk> 's pills , and then give us your sensations .
however , my instructions <name> apply equally well to any variety of <unk> , and in your way home you may easily get knocked in the head , or run over by an omnibus , or bitten by a mad dog , or drowned in a gutter .
but to proceed .
" having determined upon your subject , you must next consider the tone , or manner , of your narration .
there is the tone <unk> , the tone enthusiastic , the tone natural  all common  place enough .
but then there is the tone <unk> , or <name> , which has lately come much into use .
it consists in short sentences .
somehow thus : ca n't be too brief .
ca n't be too <unk> .
always a full stop .
and never a paragraph .
" then there is the tone elevated , <unk> , and <unk> .
some of our best novelists <unk> this tone .
the words must be all in a whirl , like a <unk> , and make a noise very similar , which answers remarkably well instead of meaning .
this is the best of all possible styles where the writer is in too great a hurry to think .
" the tone metaphysical is also a good one .
if you know any big words this is your chance for them .
talk of the <unk> and <unk> schools  of <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
say something about <unk> and <unk> .
be sure and abuse a man named locke .
turn up your nose at things in general , and when you let slip any thing a little too absurd , you need not be at the trouble of scratching it out , but just add a footnote and say that you are indebted for the above profound observation to the <unk> der <unk> <unk> , ' or to the <unk> <unk> der <unk> . '
this would look <unk> and  and  and <name> .
" there are various other tones of equal celebrity , but i shall mention only two more  the tone <unk> and the tone heterogeneous .
in the former the merit consists in seeing into the nature of affairs a very great deal farther than anybody else .
this second sight is very efficient when properly managed .
a little reading of the <unk> ' <name> <name> you a great way .
<unk> , in this case , big words ; get them as small as possible , and write them upside down .
look over <unk> poems and quote what he says about a <unk> little man with a <unk> show of can . '
put in something about the <unk> <unk> .
do n't say a syllable about the infernal <unk> .
above all , study <unk> .
hint everything  assert nothing .
if you feel inclined to say <unk> and butter , ' do not by any means say it outright .
you may say any thing and every thing approaching to <unk> and butter . '
you may hint at <unk> cake , or you may even go so far as to insinuate <unk> porridge , but if bread and butter be your real meaning , be cautious , my dear miss psyche , not on any account to say <unk> and butter ! ' "
i assured him that i should never say it again as long as i lived .
he kissed me and continued : " as for the tone heterogeneous , it is merely a judicious mixture , in equal proportions , of all the other tones in the world , and is consequently made up of every thing deep , great , odd , <unk> , pertinent , and pretty .
" let us suppose now you have determined upon your incidents and tone .
the most important portion  in fact , the soul of the whole business , is yet to be attended to  i allude to the filling up .
it is not to be supposed that a <name> , or gentleman either , has been leading the life of a book worm .
and yet above all things it is necessary that your article have an air of erudition , or at least afford evidence of extensive general reading .
now i 'll put you in the way of accomplishing this point .
see here ! "
( pulling down some three or four <unk> volumes , and opening them at random ) .
" by casting your eye down almost any <name> of any book in the world , you <name> be able to perceive at once a host of little scraps of either learning or <unk> , which are the very thing for the <unk> of a blackwood article .
you might as well note down a few while i read them to you .
i shall make two divisions : first , <unk> facts for the manufacture of <unk> , and , second , <unk> expressions to be introduced as occasion may require .
write now ! "
 and i wrote as he dictated .
" <unk> facts for <unk> .
'there were originally but three muses  <unk> , <unk> , <unk>  meditation , memory , and singing . '
you may make a good deal of that little fact if properly worked .
you see it is not generally known , and looks <unk> .
you must be careful and give the thing with a downright <unk> air .
" again .
'the river <unk> passed beneath the sea , and emerged without injury to the purity of its waters . '
rather stale that , to be sure , but , if properly dressed and <unk> up , <name> look quite as fresh as ever .
" here is something better .

fine that , and very delicate !
turn it about a little , and it <name> do wonders .
we 'll have some thing else in the botanical line .
there 's nothing goes down so well , especially with the help of a little latin .
write !
" 'the <unk> <unk> <unk> , of java , bears a very beautiful flower , and <name> live when pulled up by the roots .
the natives suspend it by a cord from the ceiling , and enjoy its fragrance for years . '
that 's capital !
that <name> do for the <unk> .
now for the <unk> expressions .
" <unk> expressions .
'the venerable chinese novel <unk> . '
good !
by introducing these few words with dexterity you <name> evince your intimate acquaintance with the language and literature of the chinese .
with the aid of this you may either get along without either arabic , or <unk> , or <unk> .
there is no passing muster , however , without spanish , italian , <name> , latin , and greek .
i must look you out a little specimen of each .
any scrap <name> answer , because you must depend upon your own ingenuity to make it fit into your article .
now write !
" <unk> <unk> que <unk> '  as tender as <unk> .
alludes to the frequent repetition of the phrase , la <unk> <unk> , in the french tragedy of that name .
properly introduced , <name> show not only your knowledge of the language , but your general reading and wit .
you can say , for instance , that the chicken you were eating ( write an article about being choked to death by a <unk> ) was not altogether <unk> <unk> que <unk> .
write !

" that 's spanish  from <name> de <unk> .
'come quickly , o death !
but be sure and do n't let me see you coming , lest the pleasure i shall feel at your appearance should unfortunately bring me back again to life . '
this you may slip in quite a <unk> when you are struggling in the last agonies with the <unk> .
write !

' " that 's italian , you perceive  from <unk> .
it means that a great hero , in the heat of combat , not perceiving that he had been fairly killed , continued to fight valiantly , dead as he was .
the application of this to your own case is obvious  for i trust , miss psyche , that you <name> not neglect to kick for at least an hour and a half after you have been choked to death by that <unk> .

<name> you be kind enough to write ?
" in greek we must have some thing pretty  from demosthenes , for example .
[ greek phrase ] [ <unk> o <unk> <name> <unk> <unk> ] there is a tolerably good translation of it in <unk> 'for he that flies may fight again , which he can never do that 's slain . '
" in a blackwood article nothing makes so fine a show as your greek .
the very letters have an air of profundity about them .
only observe , madam , the astute look of that <unk> !
that <unk> ought certainly to be a bishop !
was ever there a <unk> fellow than that <unk> ?
just twig that <unk> !
in short , there is nothing like greek for a genuine <unk> .
in the present case your application is the most obvious thing in the world .
rap out the sentence , with a huge oath , and by way of ultimatum at the good-for-nothing <unk> villain who could n't understand your plain english in relation to the <unk> .
he 'll take the hint and be off , you may depend upon it . "
these were all the instructions mr. b. could afford me upon the topic in question , but i felt they would be entirely sufficient .
i was , at length , able to write a genuine blackwood article , and determined to do it forthwith .
in taking leave of me , mr. b. made a proposition for the purchase of the paper when written ; but as he could offer me only fifty guineas a sheet , i thought it better to let our society have it , than sacrifice it for so paltry a sum .
notwithstanding this <unk> spirit , however , the gentleman showed his consideration for me in all other respects , and indeed treated me with the greatest civility .
his parting words made a deep impression upon my heart , and i <name> i shall always remember them with gratitude .
" my dear miss <name> , " he said , while the tears stood in his eyes , " is there anything else i can do to promote the success of your laudable undertaking ?
let me reflect !
it is just possible that you may not be able , so soon as convenient , to  to  get yourself drowned , or  choked with a <unk> , or  or <name> ,  or  bitten by a  but stay !
now i think me of it , there are a couple of very excellent <unk> in the yard  fine fellows , i assure you  savage , and all that  indeed just the thing for your money  they 'll have you eaten up , auricula and all , in less than five minutes ( here 's my watch ! )
 and then only think of the sensations !
here !
i say  <name> !  <name> !  <name> , you villain !  let out those "  but as i was really in a great hurry , and had not another moment to spare , i was reluctantly forced to <unk> my departure , and accordingly took leave at once  somewhat more abruptly , i admit , than strict courtesy would have otherwise allowed .
it was my primary object upon quitting mr. blackwood , to get into some immediate difficulty , <unk> to his advice , and with this view i spent the greater part of the day in wandering about edinburgh , seeking for desperate adventures  adventures adequate to the intensity of my feelings , and adapted to the vast character of the article i intended to write .
in this excursion i was attended by one negro  servant , pompey , and my little <unk> <name> , whom i had brought with me from philadelphia .
it was not , however , until late in the afternoon that i fully succeeded in my arduous undertaking .
an important event then happened of which the following blackwood article , in the tone heterogeneous , is the substance and result .
a predicament what chance , good <name> , hath bereft you thus ?
 <unk> .
it was a quiet and still afternoon when i strolled forth in the goodly city of <unk> .
the confusion and bustle in the streets were terrible .
men were talking .
women were screaming .
children were choking .
pigs were whistling .
carts they rattled .
bulls they bellowed .
cows they lowed .
horses they <unk> .
cats they <unk> .
dogs they danced .
danced !
could it then be possible ?
danced !
alas , thought i , my dancing days are over !
thus it is ever .
what a host of gloomy recollections <name> ever and anon be awakened in the mind of genius and imaginative contemplation , especially of a genius doomed to the everlasting and eternal , and continual , and , as one might say , the  continued  yes , the continued and continuous , bitter , harassing , disturbing , and , if i may be allowed the expression , the very disturbing influence of the serene , and godlike , and heavenly , and exalted , and elevated , and purifying effect of what may be rightly termed the most enviable , the most truly enviable  nay !
the most <unk> beautiful , the most deliciously ethereal , and , as it were , the most pretty ( if i may use so bold an expression ) thing ( pardon me , gentle reader ! )
in the world  but i am always led away by my feelings .
in such a mind , i repeat , what a host of recollections are stirred up by a trifle !
the dogs danced !
i  i could not !
they <unk>  i wept .
they capered  i sobbed aloud .
touching circumstances !
which can not fail to bring to the recollection of the classical reader that exquisite passage in relation to the fitness of things , which is to be found in the commencement of the third volume of that admirable and venerable chinese novel the <unk> .
in my solitary walk through , the city i had two humble but faithful companions .
<name> , my poodle !
sweetest of creatures !
she had a quantity of hair over her one eye , and a blue <unk> tied <unk> around her neck .
<name> was not more than five inches in height , but her head was somewhat bigger than her body , and her tail being cut off exceedingly close , gave an air of injured innocence to the interesting animal which rendered her a favorite with all .
and pompey , my negro !  sweet pompey !
how shall i ever forget thee ?
i had taken pompey 's arm .
he was three feet in height ( i like to be particular ) and about seventy , or perhaps eighty , years of age .
he had <unk> and was <unk> .
his mouth should not be called small , nor his ears short .
his teeth , however , were like <name> , and his large full eyes were deliciously white .
nature had endowed him with no neck , and had placed his ankles ( as usual with that race ) in the middle of the upper portion of the feet .
he was clad with a striking simplicity .
his sole garments were a stock of nine inches in height , and a nearly  new drab overcoat which had formerly been in the service of the tall , stately , and illustrious dr. <unk> .
it was a good overcoat .
it was well cut .
it was well made .
the coat was nearly new .
pompey held it up out of the dirt with both hands .
there were three persons in our party , and two of them have already been the subject of remark .
there was a third  that person was myself .
i am the <unk> psyche <name> .
i am not <unk> <unk> .
my appearance is commanding .
on the memorable occasion of which i speak i was <unk> in a crimson satin dress , with a sky-blue arabian <unk> .
and the dress had trimmings of green <unk> , and seven graceful <unk> of the <unk> auricula .
i thus formed the third of the party .
there was the poodle .
there was pompey .
there was myself .
we were three .
thus it is said there were originally but three furies  <unk> , <unk> , and <unk>  meditation , memory , and fiddling .
leaning upon the arm of the gallant pompey , and attended at a respectable distance by <name> , i proceeded down one of the populous and very pleasant streets of the now deserted <unk> .
on a sudden , there presented itself to view a church  a gothic cathedral  vast , venerable , and with a tall steeple , which towered into the sky .
what madness now possessed me ?
why did i rush upon my fate ?
i was seized with an uncontrollable <name> to ascend the giddy pinnacle , and then survey the immense extent of the city .
the door of the cathedral stood <unk> open .
my <name> prevailed .
i entered the ominous archway .
where then was my guardian <name> ?  if indeed such angels there be .
if !
distressing <unk> !
what world of mystery , and meaning , and doubt , and uncertainty is there involved in thy two letters !
i entered the ominous archway !
i entered ; and , without injury to my <unk> <unk> , i passed beneath the portal , and emerged within the vestibule .
thus it is said the immense river <name> passed , unscathed , and <unk> , beneath the sea .
i thought the staircase would never have an end .
round !
yes , they went round and up , and round and up and round and up , until i could not help <unk> , with the sagacious pompey , upon whose supporting arm i leaned in all the confidence of early affection  i could not help <unk> that the upper end of the continuous spiral ladder had been accidentally , or perhaps <unk> , removed .
i paused for breath ; and , in the meantime , an accident occurred of too momentous a nature in a moral , and also in a metaphysical point of view , to be passed over without notice .
it appeared to me  indeed i was quite confident of the fact  i could not be mistaken  no !
i had , for some moments , carefully and anxiously observed the motions of my <name>  i say that i could not be mistaken  <name> smelt a rat !
at once i called pompey 's attention to the subject , and he  he agreed with me .
there was then no longer any reasonable room for doubt .
the rat had been smelled  and by <name> .
heavens !
shall i ever forget the intense excitement of the moment ?
alas !
what is the boasted intellect of man ?
the rat !  it was there  that is to say , it was somewhere .
<name> smelled the rat .
i  i could not !
thus it is said the prussian <name> has , for some persons , a sweet and very powerful perfume , while to others it is perfectly <unk> .
the staircase had been surmounted , and there were now only three or four more upward steps intervening between us and the summit .
we still ascended , and now only one step remained .
one step !
one little , little step !
upon one such little step in the great staircase of human life how vast a sum of human happiness or misery depends !
i thought of myself , then of pompey , and then of the mysterious and inexplicable <name> which surrounded us .
i thought of pompey !  alas , i thought of love !
i thought of my many false steps which have been taken , and may be taken again .
i resolved to be more cautious , more reserved .
i abandoned the arm of pompey , and , without his assistance , surmounted the one remaining step , and gained the chamber of the belfry .
i was followed immediately afterward by my poodle .
pompey alone remained behind .
i stood at the head of the staircase , and encouraged him to ascend .
he stretched forth to me his hand , and unfortunately in so doing was forced to abandon his firm hold upon the overcoat .
<name> the gods never cease their persecution ?
the overcoat is dropped , and , with one of his feet , pompey stepped upon the long and trailing skirt of the overcoat .
he stumbled and fell  this consequence was inevitable .
he fell forward , and , with his accursed head , striking me full in the  in the breast , precipitated me headlong , together with himself , upon the hard , filthy , and detestable floor of the belfry .
but my revenge was sure , sudden , and complete .
seizing him furiously by the wool with both hands , i tore out a vast quantity of black , and crisp , and curling material , and tossed it from me with every manifestation of disdain .
it fell among the ropes of the belfry and remained .
pompey arose , and said no word .
but he regarded me piteously with his large eyes and  sighed .
ye gods  that sigh !
it sunk into my heart .
and the hair  the wool !
could i have reached that wool i would have bathed it with my tears , in testimony of regret .
but alas !
it was now far beyond my grasp .
as it dangled among the cordage of the <name> , i fancied it alive .
i fancied that it stood on end with indignation .
thus the <unk> <unk> <unk> of java bears , it is said , a beautiful flower , which <name> live when pulled up by the roots .
the natives suspend it by a cord from the ceiling and enjoy its fragrance for years .
our quarrel was now made up , and we looked about the room for an aperture through which to survey the city of <unk> .
windows there were none .
the sole light admitted into the gloomy chamber proceeded from a square opening , about a foot in diameter , at a height of about seven feet from the floor .
yet what <name> the energy of true genius not effect ?
i resolved to clamber up to this hole .
a vast quantity of wheels , pinions , and other <unk>  looking machinery stood opposite the hole , close to it ; and through the hole there passed an iron <name> from the machinery .
between the wheels and the wall where the hole lay there was barely room for my body  yet i was desperate , and determined to persevere .
i called pompey to my side .
" you perceive that aperture , pompey .
i wish to look through it .
you <name> stand here just beneath the hole  so .
now , hold out one of your hands , pompey , and let me step upon it  thus .
now , the other hand , pompey , and with its aid i <name> get upon your shoulders . "
he did every thing i wished , and i found , upon getting up , that i could easily pass my head and neck through the aperture .
the prospect was sublime .
nothing could be more magnificent .
i merely paused a moment to bid <name> behave herself , and assure pompey that i would be considerate and bear as lightly as possible upon his shoulders .
i told him i would be tender of his feelings  <unk> tender que beefsteak .
having done this justice to my faithful friend , i gave myself up with great zest and enthusiasm to the enjoyment of the scene which so <unk> spread itself out before my eyes .
upon this subject , however , i shall forbear to <unk> .
i <name> not describe the city of edinburgh .
every one has been to the city of edinburgh .
every one has been to edinburgh  the classic <unk> .
i <name> confine myself to the momentous details of my own lamentable adventure .
having , in some measure , satisfied my curiosity in regard to the extent , situation , and general appearance of the city , i had leisure to survey the church in which i was , and the delicate architecture of the steeple .
i observed that the aperture through which i had thrust my head was an opening in the <unk> of a gigantic clock , and must have appeared , from the street , as a large key-hole , such as we see in the face of the french watches .
no doubt the true object was to admit the arm of an attendant , to adjust , when necessary , the hands of the clock from within .
i observed also , with surprise , the immense size of these hands , the longest of which could not have been less than ten feet in length , and , where broadest , eight or nine inches in breadth .
they were of solid steel apparently , and their edges appeared to be sharp .
having noticed these particulars , and some others , i again turned my eyes upon the glorious prospect below , and soon became absorbed in contemplation .
from this , after some minutes , i was aroused by the voice of pompey , who declared that he could stand it no longer , and requested that i would be so kind as to come down .
this was unreasonable , and i told him so in a speech of some length .
he replied , but with an evident misunderstanding of my ideas upon the subject .
i accordingly grew angry , and told him in plain words , that he was a fool , that he had committed an <unk> <unk> , that his notions were mere <unk> <unk> , and his words little better than an <unk> .
with this he appeared satisfied , and i resumed my <unk> .
it might have been half an hour after this altercation when , as i was deeply absorbed in the heavenly scenery beneath me , i was startled by something very cold which pressed with a gentle pressure on the back of my neck .
it is needless to say that i felt inexpressibly alarmed .
i knew that pompey was beneath my feet , and that <name> was sitting , according to my explicit directions , upon her hind legs , in the farthest corner of the room .
what could it be ?
alas !
i but too soon discovered .
turning my head gently to one side , i perceived , to my extreme horror , that the huge , glittering , <unk> <unk> of the clock had , in the course of its hourly revolution , descended upon my neck .
there was , i knew , not a second to be lost .
i pulled back at once  but it was too late .
there was no chance of forcing my head through the mouth of that terrible trap in which it was so fairly caught , and which grew narrower and narrower with a rapidity too horrible to be conceived .
the agony of that moment is not to be imagined .
i threw up my hands and endeavored , with all my strength , to force upward the ponderous iron bar .
i might as well have tried to lift the cathedral itself .
down , down , down it came , closer and yet closer .
i screamed to pompey for aid ; but he said that i had hurt his feelings by calling him 'an ignorant old <unk> : ' i yelled to <name> ; but she only said <unk> , ' and that i had told her 'on no account to stir from the corner . '
thus i had no relief to expect from my associates .
meantime the ponderous and terrific scythe of time ( for i now discovered the literal import of that classical phrase ) had not stopped , nor was it likely to stop , in its career .
down and still down , it came .
it had already buried its sharp edge a full inch in my flesh , and my sensations grew indistinct and confused .
at one time i fancied myself in philadelphia with the stately dr. <unk> , at another in the back parlor of mr. blackwood receiving his invaluable instructions .
and then again the sweet recollection of better and earlier times came over me , and i thought of that happy period when the world was not all a desert , and pompey not altogether cruel .
the ticking of the machinery amused me .
amused me , i say , for my sensations now bordered upon perfect happiness , and the most trifling circumstances afforded me pleasure .
the eternal <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of the clock was the most melodious of music in my ears , and occasionally even put me in mind of the graceful <unk> <unk> of dr. <unk> .
then there were the great figures upon the <unk>  how intelligent how intellectual , they all looked !
and presently they took to dancing the <unk> , and i think it was the figure v. who performed the most to my satisfaction .
she was evidently a <name> of breeding .
none of your <unk> , and nothing at all indelicate in her motions .
she did the <unk> to admiration  whirling round upon her apex .
i made an endeavor to hand her a chair , for i saw that she appeared fatigued with her exertions  and it was not until then that i fully perceived my lamentable situation .
lamentable indeed !
the bar had buried itself two inches in my neck .
i was aroused to a sense of exquisite pain .
i prayed for death , and , in the agony of the moment , could not help repeating those exquisite verses of the poet <name> de <unk> : <unk> <unk> , tan <unk> query no te <unk> <unk> pork and pleasure , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , darry , widdy !
but now a new horror presented itself , and one indeed sufficient to startle the strongest nerves .
my eyes , from the cruel pressure of the machine , were absolutely starting from their sockets .
while i was thinking how i should possibly manage without them , one actually tumbled out of my head , and , rolling down the steep side of the steeple , lodged in the rain gutter which ran along the eaves of the main building .
the loss of the eye was not so much as the insolent air of independence and contempt with which it regarded me after it was out .
there it lay in the gutter just under my nose , and the airs it gave itself would have been ridiculous had they not been disgusting .
such a winking and blinking were never before seen .
this behavior on the part of my eye in the gutter was not only irritating on account of its manifest insolence and shameful ingratitude , but was also exceedingly inconvenient on account of the sympathy which always exists between two eyes of the same head , however far apart .
i was forced , in a manner , to wink and to blink , whether i would or not , in exact concert with the <unk> thing that lay just under my nose .
i was presently relieved , however , by the dropping out of the other eye .
in falling it took the same direction ( possibly a concerted plot ) as its fellow .
both rolled out of the gutter together , and in truth i was very glad to get rid of them .
the bar was now four inches and a half deep in my neck , and there was only a little bit of skin to cut through .
my sensations were those of entire happiness , for i felt that in a few minutes , at farthest , i should be relieved from my disagreeable situation .
and in this expectation i was not at all deceived .
at twenty-five minutes past five in the afternoon , precisely , the huge <unk> had proceeded sufficiently far on its terrible revolution to sever the small remainder of my neck .
i was not sorry to see the head which had occasioned me so much embarrassment at length make a final separation from my body .
it first rolled down the side of the steeple , then lodge , for a few seconds , in the gutter , and then made its way , with a plunge , into the middle of the street .
i <name> candidly confess that my feelings were now of the most singular  nay , of the most mysterious , the most perplexing and incomprehensible character .
my senses were here and there at one and the same moment .
with my head i imagined , at one time , that i , the head , was the real <unk> psyche <name>  at another i felt convinced that myself , the body , was the proper identity .
to clear my ideas on this topic i felt in my pocket for my <unk> , but , upon getting it , and endeavoring to apply a pinch of its grateful contents in the ordinary manner , i became immediately aware of my peculiar deficiency , and threw the box at once down to my head .
it took a pinch with great satisfaction , and smiled me an <unk> in return .
shortly afterward it made me a speech , which i could hear but indistinctly without ears .
i gathered enough , however , to know that it was astonished at my wishing to remain alive under such circumstances .
in the concluding sentences it quoted the <name> words of <unk>  il <unk> <unk> <unk> non <unk> <unk> and have a combat <unk> <unk> <unk> ; thus comparing me to the hero who , in the heat of the combat , not perceiving that he was dead , continued to contest the battle with <unk> valor .
there was nothing now to prevent my getting down from my elevation , and i did so .
what it was that pompey saw so very peculiar in my appearance i have never yet been able to find out .
the fellow opened his mouth from ear to ear , and shut his two eyes as if he were endeavoring to crack nuts between the lids .
finally , throwing off his overcoat , he made one spring for the staircase and disappeared .
i hurled after the scoundrel these vehement words of demosthenes  <name> <unk> , you really make haste to fly , and then turned to the darling of my heart , to the one-eyed !
the <unk> <name> .
alas !
what a horrible vision <unk> my eyes ?
was that a rat i saw skulking into his hole ?
are these the picked bones of the little <name> who has been cruelly devoured by the monster ?
ye gods !
and what do i behold  is that the departed spirit , the shade , the ghost , of my beloved puppy , which i perceive sitting with a <name> so melancholy , in the corner ?
hearken !
for she speaks , and , heavens !
it is in the <name> of <unk>  " <unk> stubby <unk> , so stubby dun <unk> she !
<unk> she ! "
alas !
and are not her words too true ?
" and if i died , at least i died for thee  for thee . "
sweet creature !
she too has sacrificed herself in my behalf .
<unk> , <unk> , headless , what now remains for the unhappy <unk> psyche <name> ?
alas  nothing !
i have done .
<unk> slid , if these be your " <unk> " and " <unk> , " i 'll have none o ' them .
 <name> <unk> .
the baron <unk> <name> <name> was a <name> hungarian family , every member of which ( at least as far back into antiquity as any certain records extend ) was more or less remarkable for talent of some description  the majority for that species of <unk> in <name> of which <unk> , a <unk> of the house , has given a vivid , although by no means the most vivid <unk> .
my acquaintance with <unk> commenced at the magnificent chateau <name> , into which a train of droll adventures , not to be made public , threw a place in his regard , and here , with somewhat more difficulty , a partial insight into his mental conformation .
in later days this insight grew more clear , as the intimacy which had at first permitted it became more close ; and when , after three years of the character of the baron <unk> <name> <name> .
i remember the buzz of curiosity which his advent excited within the college precincts on the night of the <unk> of <name> .
i remember still more distinctly , that while he was pronounced by all parties at first sight " the most remarkable man in the world , " no person made any attempt at accounting for his opinion .
that he was unique appeared so undeniable , that it was deemed impertinent to inquire wherein the <unk> consisted .
but , letting this matter pass for the present , i <name> merely observe that , from the first moment of his setting foot within the limits of the university , he began to exercise over the habits , manners , persons , purses , and propensities of the whole community which surrounded him , an influence the most extensive and despotic , yet at the same time the most indefinite and altogether unaccountable .
thus the brief period of his residence at the university forms an <name> in its annals , and is characterized by all classes of people <unk> to it or its <unk> as " that very extraordinary epoch forming the domination of the baron <unk> <name> <name> . "
then of no particular age , by which i mean that it was impossible to form a guess respecting his age by any data personally afforded .
he might have been fifteen or fifty , and was twenty-one years and seven months .
he was by no means a handsome man  perhaps the reverse .
the contour of his face was somewhat angular and harsh .
his forehead was lofty and very fair ; his nose a snub ; his eyes large , heavy , glassy , and meaningless .
about the mouth there was more to be observed .
the lips were gently protruded , and rested the one upon the other , after such a fashion that it is impossible to conceive any , even the most complex , combination of human features , conveying so entirely , and so singly , the idea of unmitigated gravity , solemnity and repose .
it <name> be perceived , no doubt , from what i have already said , that the baron was one of those human anomalies now and then to be found , who make the science of <unk> the study and the business of their lives .
for this science a peculiar turn of mind gave him instinctively the cue , while his physical appearance afforded him unusual facilities for carrying his prospects into effect .
i quaintly termed the domination of the baron <unk> <name> <name> , ever rightly entered into the mystery which overshadowed his character .
i truly think that no person at the university , with the exception of myself , ever suspected him to be capable of a joke , verbal or practical :  the old bull-dog at the <unk> would sooner have been accused ,  the ghost of <unk> ,  or the wig of the emeritus professor of theology .
this , too , when it was evident that the most <unk> and unpardonable of all conceivable tricks , <unk> and <unk> were brought about , if not directly by him , at least plainly through his intermediate agency or <unk> .
the beauty , if i may so call it , of his <name> <unk> , lay in that consummate ability ( resulting from an almost <unk> knowledge of human nature , and a most wonderful self-possession , ) by means of which he never failed to make it appear that the <unk> he was occupied in bringing to a point , arose partly in spite , and partly in consequence of the laudable efforts he was making for their prevention , and for the preservation of the good order and dignity of <name> <unk> .
the deep , the poignant , the overwhelming mortification , which upon each such failure of his praise worthy endeavors , would <unk> every <unk> of his countenance , left not the slightest room for doubt of his sincerity in the bosoms of even his most <unk> companions .
the adroitness , too , was no less worthy of observation by which he contrived to shift the sense of the grotesque from the creator to the created  from his own person to the absurdities to which he had given rise .
in no instance before that of which i speak , have i known the habitual <unk> escape the natural consequence of his <unk>  an attachment of the ludicrous to his own character and person .
continually enveloped in an atmosphere of whim , my friend appeared to live only for the <unk> of society ; and not even his own household have for a moment associated other ideas than those of the rigid and <name> with the memory of the baron <unk> <name> <name> , the demon of the <unk> far <unk> lay like an <unk> upon the university .
nothing , at least , was done beyond eating and drinking and making <name> .
the apartments of the students were converted into so many <unk> , and there was no <unk> of them all more famous or more frequented than that of the baron .
our <unk> here were many , and boisterous , and long , and never <unk> of events .
upon one occasion we had protracted our sitting until nearly daybreak , and an unusual quantity of wine had been drunk .
the company consisted of seven or eight individuals besides the baron and myself .
most of these were young men of wealth , of high connection , of great family pride , and all alive with an exaggerated sense of honor .
they abounded in the most <unk> <name> opinions respecting the <unk> .
to these quixotic notions some recent parisian publications , backed by three or four desperate and fatal conversation , during the greater part of the night , had run wild upon the all  <unk> topic of the times .
the baron , who had been unusually silent and abstracted in the earlier portion of the evening , at length seemed to be aroused from his apathy , took a leading part in the discourse , and dwelt upon the benefits , and more especially upon the beauties , of the received code of etiquette in passages of arms with an ardor , an eloquence , an impressiveness , and an <unk> of manner , which elicited the warmest enthusiasm from his hearers in general , and absolutely staggered even myself , who well knew him to be at heart a <unk> of those very points for which he contended , and especially to hold the entire <unk> of duelling etiquette in the sovereign contempt which it deserves .
looking around me during a pause in the baron 's discourse ( of which my readers may gather some faint idea when i say that it bore resemblance to the <unk> , chanting , monotonous , yet musical <unk> manner of coleridge ) , i perceived symptoms of even more than the general interest in the countenance of one of the party .
this gentleman , whom i shall call hermann , was an original in every respect  except , perhaps , in the single particular that he was a very great fool .
he contrived to bear , however , among a particular set at the university , a reputation for deep metaphysical thinking , and , i believe , for some logical talent .
as a <unk> he had acquired who had fallen at his hands ; but they were many .
he was a man of courage undoubtedly .
but it was upon his minute acquaintance with the etiquette of the <unk> , and the nicety of his sense of honor , that he most especially prided himself .
these things were a hobby which he rode to the death .
to <unk> , ever upon the lookout for the grotesque , his peculiarities had for a long time past afforded food for <unk> .
of this , however , i was not aware ; although , in the present instance , i saw clearly that something of a whimsical nature was upon the <unk> with my friend , and that hermann was its especial object .
as the former proceeded in his discourse , or rather <unk> i perceived the excitement of the latter momently increasing .
at length he spoke ; offering some objection to a point insisted upon by r. , and giving his reasons in detail .
to these the baron replied at length ( still maintaining his exaggerated tone of sentiment ) and concluding , in what i thought very bad taste , with a sarcasm and a sneer .
the hobby of hermann now took the bit in his teeth .
this i could discern by the studied <unk> <unk> of his rejoinder .
his last words i distinctly remember .
" your opinions , allow me to say , baron <name> <name> , although in the main correct , are , in many nice points , discreditable to yourself and to the university of which you are a member .
in a few respects they are even unworthy of serious refutation .
i would say more than this , sir , were it not for the fear of giving you offence ( here the speaker smiled blandly ) , i would say , sir , that your opinions are not the opinions to be expected from a gentleman . "
as hermann completed this equivocal sentence , all eyes were turned upon the baron .
he became pale , then excessively red ; then , dropping his pocket-handkerchief , stooped to recover it , when i caught a glimpse of his countenance , while it could be seen by no one else at the table .
it was radiant with the quizzical expression which was its natural character , but which i had never seen it assume except when we were alone together , and when he <unk> himself freely .
in an instant afterward he stood erect , confronting hermann ; and so total an alteration of countenance in so short a period i certainly never saw before .
for a moment i even fancied that i had <unk> him , and that he was in sober <name> .
he appeared to be stifling with passion , and his face was <unk> white .
for a short time he remained silent , apparently striving to master his emotion .
having at length seemingly succeeded , he reached a <unk> which stood near him , saying as he held it firmly clenched " the language you have thought proper to employ , <unk> hermann , in addressing yourself to me , is objectionable in so many particulars , that i have neither temper nor time for <unk> .
that my opinions , however , are not the opinions to be expected from a gentleman , is an observation so directly offensive as to allow me but one line of conduct .
some courtesy , nevertheless , is due to the presence of this company , and to yourself , at this moment , as my guest .
you <name> pardon me , therefore , if , upon this consideration , i deviate slightly from the general usage among gentlemen in similar cases of personal affront .
you <name> forgive me for the moderate tax i shall make upon your imagination , and endeavor to consider , for an instant , the reflection of your person in yonder mirror as the living <unk> hermann himself .
this being done , there <name> be no difficulty whatever .
i shall discharge this <unk> of wine at your image in yonder mirror , and thus fulfil all the spirit , if not the exact letter , of resentment for your insult , while the necessity of physical violence to your real person <name> be <unk> . "
with these words he hurled the <unk> , full of wine , against the mirror which <name> directly opposite hermann ; striking the reflection of his person with great precision , and of course shattering the glass into fragments .
the whole company at once started to their feet , and , with the exception of myself and <unk> , took their departure .
as hermann went out , the baron whispered me that i should follow him and make an offer of my services .
to this i agreed ; not knowing precisely what to make of so ridiculous a piece of business .
the <unk> accepted my aid with his stiff and <unk> <unk> air , and , taking my arm , led me to his apartment .
i could hardly forbear laughing in his face while he proceeded to discuss , with the profoundest gravity , what he termed " the <unk> peculiar character " of the insult he had received .
after a tiresome harangue in his ordinary style , he took down from his book shelves a number of musty volumes on the subject of the <unk> , and entertained me for a long time with their contents ; reading aloud , and commenting earnestly as he read .
i can just remember the titles of some of the works .
there were the " <unk> of <name> <name> <unk> on single combat " ; the " theatre of honor , " by <unk> , and a treatise " on the permission of duels , " by <unk> .
he displayed , also , with much <unk> , <unk> 's " memoirs of duels , "  published at cologne , <unk> , in the types of <unk>  a precious and unique <unk> volume , with a fine margin , and bound by <unk> .
but he requested my attention particularly , and with an air of mysterious sagacity , to a thick octavo , written in barbarous latin by one <unk> , a frenchman , and having the quaint title , " <unk> <unk> <unk> , et non ; <unk> . "
from this he read me one of the <unk> chapters in the world concerning " <unk> per <unk> , per <unk> , et per se , " about half of which , he <unk> , was strictly applicable to his own " <unk> peculiar " case , although not one syllable of the whole matter could i understand for the life of me .
having finished the chapter , he closed the book , and demanded what i thought necessary to be done .
i replied that i had entire confidence in his superior delicacy of feeling , and would abide by what he proposed .
with this answer he seemed flattered , and sat down to write a note to the baron .
it ran thus : sir ,  my friend , m. p. , <name> hand you this note .
i find it incumbent upon me to request , at your earliest convenience , an explanation of this evening 's occurrences at your chambers .
in the event of your declining this request , mr. p. <name> be happy to arrange , with any friend whom you may appoint , the steps preliminary to a meeting .
with sentiments of perfect respect , your most humble servant , <unk> <name> .
to the baron <unk> <name> <name> , not knowing what better to do , i called upon <unk> with this epistle .
he bowed as i presented it ; then , with a grave countenance , motioned me to a seat .
having perused the <unk> , he wrote the following reply , which i carried to hermann .
sir ,  through our common friend , mr. p. , i have received your note of this evening .
upon due reflection i frankly admit the propriety of the explanation you suggest .
this being admitted , i still find great difficulty , ( owing to the <unk> peculiar nature of our disagreement , and of the personal affront offered on my part , ) in so wording what i have to say by way of apology , as to meet all the minute exigencies , and all the variable shadows , of the case .
i have great reliance , however , on that extreme delicacy of discrimination , in matters <unk> to the rules of etiquette , for which you have been so long and so <unk> distinguished .
with perfect certainty , therefore , of being comprehended , i beg leave , in lieu of offering any sentiments of my own , to refer you to the opinions of sieur <unk> , as set forth in the ninth paragraph of the chapter of " <unk> per <unk> , per <unk> , et per se , " in his " <unk> <unk> <unk> , et non ; <unk> . "
the nicety of your discernment in all the matters here treated , <name> be sufficient , i am assured , to convince you that the mere circumstance of me referring you to this admirable passage , ought to satisfy your request , as a man of honor , for explanation .
with sentiments of profound respect , your most obedient servant , <name> <name> .
the herr <unk> hermann hermann commenced the perusal of this epistle with a scowl , which , however , was converted into a smile of the most ludicrous <unk> as he came to the <unk> about <unk> per <unk> , per <unk> , et per se .
having finished reading , he begged me , with the <unk> of all possible smiles , to be seated , while he made reference to the treatise in question .
turning to the passage specified , he read it with great care to himself , then closed the book , and desired me , in my character of confidential acquaintance , to express to the baron <name> <name> his exalted sense of his chivalrous behavior , and , in that of second , to assure him that the explanation offered was of the fullest , the most honorable , and the most unequivocally satisfactory nature .
somewhat amazed at all this , i made my retreat to the baron .
he seemed to receive hermann 's amicable letter as a matter of course , and after a few words of general conversation , went to an inner room and brought out the everlasting treatise " <unk> <unk> <unk> , et non ; <unk> . "
he handed me the volume and asked me to look over some portion of it .
i did so , but to little purpose , not being able to gather the least particle of meaning .
he then took the book himself , and read me a chapter aloud .
to my surprise , what he read proved to be a most horribly absurd account of a duel between two baboons .
he now explained the mystery ; showing that the volume , as it appeared <unk> <unk> , was written upon the plan of the nonsense verses of du <unk> ; that is to say , the language was ingeniously framed so as to present to the ear all the outward signs of <unk> , and even of profundity , while in fact not a shadow of meaning existed .
the key to the whole was found in leaving out every second and third word alternately , when there appeared a series of ludicrous <unk> upon a single combat as practised in modern times .
the baron afterwards informed me that he had purposely thrown the treatise in hermann 's way two or three weeks before the adventure , and that he was satisfied , from the general tenor of his conversation , that he had studied it with the deepest attention , and firmly believed it to be a work of unusual merit .
upon this hint he proceeded .
hermann would have died a thousand deaths rather than acknowledge his inability to understand anything and everything in the universe that had ever been written about the <unk> .
<unk> <name> .
<unk> considered as one of the exact sciences .
hey , diddle diddle the cat and the fiddle since the world began there have been two <unk> .
the one wrote a <unk> about <unk> , and was called <name> bentham .
he has been much admired by mr. <name> <name> , and was a great man in a small way .
the other gave name to the most important of the exact sciences , and was a great man in a great way  i may say , indeed , in the very greatest of ways .
<unk>  or the abstract idea conveyed by the verb to diddle  is sufficiently well understood .
yet the fact , the deed , the thing <unk> , is somewhat difficult to define .
we may get , however , at a tolerably distinct <name> of the matter in hand , by defining  not the thing , <unk> , in itself  but man , as an animal that <unk> .
had plato but hit upon this , he would have been spared the affront of the picked chicken .
very <unk> it was demanded of plato , why a picked chicken , which was clearly " a <unk> without feathers , " was not , according to his own definition , a man ?
but i am not to be bothered by any similar query .
man is an animal that <unk> , and there is no animal that <unk> but man .
it <name> take an entire <unk> of picked chickens to get over that .
what constitutes the essence , the <unk> , the principle of <unk> is , in fact , peculiar to the class of creatures that wear coats and pantaloons .
a crow thieves ; a fox <unk> ; a <unk> <unk> ; a man <unk> .
to diddle is his <name> .
" man was made to mourn , " says the poet .
but not so :  he was made to diddle .
this is his aim  his object  his end .
and for this reason when a man 's <unk> we say he 's " done . "
<unk> , rightly considered , is a compound , of which the ingredients are minuteness , interest , perseverance , ingenuity , audacity , nonchalance , originality , impertinence , and grin .
minuteness :  your diddler is minute .
his operations are upon a small scale .
his business is retail , for cash , or approved paper at sight .
should he ever be tempted into magnificent speculation , he then , at once , loses his distinctive features , and becomes what we term " financier . "
this latter word conveys the <unk> idea in every respect except that of magnitude .
a diddler may thus be regarded as a banker in <unk>  a " financial operation , " as a diddle at <unk> .
the one is to the other , as <name> to " <unk> "  as a mastodon to a mouse  as the tail of a comet to that of a pig .
interest :  your diddler is guided by self-interest .
he <unk> to diddle for the mere sake of the diddle .
he has an object in view  his pocket  and yours .
he regards always the main chance .
he looks to number one .
you are number two , and must look to yourself .
perseverance :  your diddler <unk> .
he is not readily discouraged .
should even the banks break , he cares nothing about it .
he steadily pursues his end , and <unk> canis a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , ' so he never lets go of his game .
ingenuity :  your diddler is ingenious .
he has <unk> large .
he understands plot .
he <unk> and <unk> .
were he not <name> he would be <unk> .
were he not a diddler , he would be a maker of patent <unk> or an <unk> for trout .
audacity :  your diddler is <unk>  he is a bold man .
he carries the war into africa .
he conquers all by assault .
he would not fear the daggers of <unk> <unk> .
with a little more <name> <name> <unk> would have made a good diddler ; with a trifle less <unk> , <name> <unk> ; with a pound or two more brains <name> the twelfth .
nonchalance :  your diddler is <unk> .
he is not at all nervous .
he never had any nerves .
he is never seduced into a flurry .
he is never put out  unless put out of doors .
he is cool  cool as a cucumber .
he is calm  " calm as a smile from <name> bury . "
he is easy  easy as an old glove , or the damsels of ancient <unk> .
originality :  your diddler is original  conscientiously so .
his thoughts are his own .
he would scorn to employ those of another .
a stale trick is his aversion .
he would return a purse , i am sure , upon discovering that he had obtained it by an <unk> diddle .
<unk>  your diddler is impertinent .
he <unk> .
he sets his arms <unk> .
he thrusts his hands in his <unk> ' pockets .
he <unk> in your face .
he <unk> on your <unk> .
he eats your dinner , he drinks your wine , he <unk> your money , he pulls your nose , he kicks your poodle , and he kisses your wife .
grin :  your true diddler winds up all with a grin .
but this nobody sees but himself .
he grins when his daily work is done  when his allotted labors are accomplished  at night in his own closet , and altogether for his own private entertainment .
he goes home .
he locks his door .
he <unk> himself of his clothes .
he puts out his candle .
he gets into bed .
he places his head upon the pillow .
all this done , and your diddler grins .
this is no hypothesis .
it is a matter of course .
i reason a priori , and a diddle would be no diddle without a grin .
the origin of the diddle is <unk> to the infancy of the human race .
perhaps the first diddler was <name> .
at all events , we can trace the science back to a very remote period of antiquity .
the <unk> , however , have brought it to a perfection never dreamed of by our <unk> progenitors .
without pausing to speak of the " old <unk> , " therefore , i shall content myself with a <unk> account of some of the more " modern instances . "
a very good diddle is this .
a housekeeper in want of a sofa , for instance , is seen to go in and out of several cabinet warehouses .
at length she arrives at one offering an excellent variety .
she is accosted , and invited to enter , by a polite and <unk> individual at the door .
she finds a sofa well adapted to her views , and upon inquiring the price , is surprised and delighted to hear a sum named at least twenty per cent .
lower than her expectations .
she <unk> to make the purchase , gets a <name> and receipt , leaves her address , with a request that the article be sent home as speedily as possible , and retires amid a profusion of bows from the shopkeeper .
the night arrives and no sofa .
a servant is sent to make inquiry about the delay .
the whole transaction is denied .
no sofa has been sold  no money received  except by the diddler , who played <unk> for the <unk> .
our cabinet warehouses are left entirely unattended , and thus afford every facility for a trick of this kind .
<unk> enter , look at furniture , and depart unheeded and unseen .
should any one wish to purchase , or to inquire the price of an article , a <name> is at hand , and this is considered amply sufficient .
again , quite a respectable diddle is this .
a well-dressed individual enters a shop , makes a purchase to the value of a dollar ; finds , much to his vexation , that he has left his pocket-book in another coat pocket ; and so says to the shopkeeper  " my dear sir , never mind ; just oblige me , <name> you , by sending the bundle home ?
but stay !
i really believe that i have nothing less than a five dollar <name> , even there .
however , you can send four dollars in change with the bundle , you know . "
" very good , sir , " replies the <unk> , who entertains , at once , a lofty opinion of the <unk> of his customer .
" i know fellows , " he says to himself , " who would just have put the goods under their arm , and walked off with a promise to call and pay the dollar as they came by in the afternoon . "
a boy is sent with the parcel and change .
on the route , quite accidentally , he is met by the purchaser , who exclaims : " ah !
this is my bundle , i see  i thought you had been home with it , long ago .
well , go on !
my wife , mrs. trotter , <name> give you the five dollars  i left instructions with her to that effect .
the change you might as well give to me  i shall want some silver for the post office .
very good !
one , two , is this a good quarter ?  three , four  quite right !
say to mrs. trotter that you met me , and be sure now and do not <unk> on the way . "
the boy does n't <unk> at all  but he is a very long time in getting back from his errand  for no <name> of the precise name of mrs. trotter is to be discovered .
he <unk> himself , however , that he has not been such a fool as to leave the goods without the money , and <unk> his shop with a <unk> air , feels sensibly hurt and indignant when his master asks him what has become of the change .
a very simple diddle , indeed , is this .
the captain of a ship , which is about to sail , is presented by an official looking person with an unusually moderate <name> of city charges .
glad to get off so easily , and confused by a hundred duties pressing upon him all at once , he discharges the claim forthwith .
in about fifteen minutes , another and less reasonable <name> is handed him by one who soon makes it evident that the first collector was a diddler , and the original collection a diddle .
and here , too , is a somewhat similar thing .
a steamboat is casting loose from the wharf .
a traveller , <unk> in hand , is discovered running toward the wharf , at full speed .
suddenly , he makes a dead halt , stoops , and picks up something from the ground in a very agitated manner .
it is a pocket-book , and  " has any gentleman lost a pocketbook ? "
he cries .
no one can say that he has exactly lost a pocket-book ; but a great excitement ensues , when the treasure <unk> is found to be of value .
the boat , however , must not be detained .
" time and tide wait for no man , " says the captain .
" for god 's sake , stay only a few minutes , " says the <unk> of the book  " the true claimant <name> presently appear . "
" ca n't wait ! "
replies the man in authority ; " cast off there , d 'ye hear ? "
" what am i to do ? "
asks the <unk> , in great <unk> .
" i am about to leave the country for some years , and i can not conscientiously retain this large amount in my possession .
i beg your pardon , sir , " [ here he addresses a gentleman on shore , ] " but you have the air of an honest man .
<name> you confer upon me the favor of taking charge of this pocket-book  i know i can trust you  and of advertising it ?
the notes , you see , amount to a very considerable sum .
the owner <name> , no doubt , insist upon <unk> you for your trouble  " me !  no , you !  it was you who found the book . "
" well , if you must have it so  i <name> take a small reward  just to satisfy your scruples .
let me see  why these notes are all hundreds  bless my soul !
a hundred is too much to take  fifty would be quite enough , i am sure  " cast off there ! "
says the captain .
" but then i have no change for a hundred , and upon the whole , you had better  " cast off there ! "
says the captain .
" never mind ! "
cries the gentleman on shore , who has been examining his own pocket-book for the last minute or so  " never mind !
i can fix it  here is a fifty on the bank of north <name>  throw the book . "
and the <unk> <unk> takes the fifty with marked reluctance , and throws the gentleman the book , as desired , while the steamboat fumes and <unk> on her way .
in about half an hour after her departure , the " large amount " is seen to be a " counterfeit <unk> , " and the whole thing a capital diddle .
a bold diddle is this .
a <unk> , or something similar , is to be held at a certain spot which is accessible only by means of a free bridge .
a diddler stations himself upon this bridge , respectfully informs all <unk> by of the new county law , which establishes a toll of one cent for foot passengers , two for horses and donkeys , and so forth , and so forth .
some grumble but all submit , and the diddler goes home a <unk> man by some fifty or sixty dollars well earned .
this taking a toll from a great crowd of people is an excessively troublesome thing .
a neat diddle is this .
a friend holds one of the diddler 's promises to pay , filled up and signed in due form , upon the ordinary blanks printed in red ink .
the diddler purchases one or two dozen of these blanks , and every day dips one of them in his soup , makes his dog jump for it , and finally gives it to him as a <unk> <unk> .
the note arriving at maturity , the diddler , with the diddler 's dog , calls upon the friend , and the promise to pay is made the topic of discussion .
the friend produces it from his <unk> , and is in the act of reaching it to the diddler , when up jumps the diddler 's dog and <unk> it forthwith .
the diddler is not only surprised but vexed and incensed at the absurd behavior of his dog , and expresses his entire readiness to <unk> the obligation at any moment when the evidence of the obligation shall be forthcoming .
a very mean diddle is this .
a <name> is insulted in the street by a diddler 's accomplice .
the diddler himself flies to her assistance , and , giving his friend a comfortable thrashing , insists upon attending the <name> to her own door .
he bows , with his hand upon his heart , and most respectfully bids her adieu .
she <unk> him , as her deliverer , to walk in and be introduced to her big brother and her papa .
with a sigh , he declines to do so .
" is there no way , then , sir , " she murmurs , " in which i may be permitted to testify my gratitude ? "
" why , yes , madam , there is .
<name> you be kind enough to lend me a couple of shillings ? "
in the first excitement of the moment the <name> decides upon fainting outright .
upon second thought , however , she opens her <unk> and delivers the <unk> .
now this , i say , is a diddle minute  for one entire <unk> of the sum borrowed has to be paid to the gentleman who had the trouble of performing the insult , and who had then to stand still and be thrashed for performing it .
rather a small but still a scientific diddle is this .
the diddler approaches the bar of a tavern , and demands a couple of twists of tobacco .
these are handed to him , when , having slightly examined them , he says : " i do n't much like this tobacco .
here , take it back , and give me a glass of <name> and water in its place . "
the <name> and water is furnished and imbibed , and the diddler makes his way to the door .
but the voice of the <unk> arrests him .
" i believe , sir , you have forgotten to pay for your <name> and water . "
" pay for my <name> and water !  did n't i give you the tobacco for the <name> and water ?
what more would you have ? "
" but , sir , if you please , i do n't remember that you paid me for the tobacco . "
" what do you mean by that , you scoundrel ?  did n't i give you back your tobacco ?
is n't that your tobacco lying there ?
do you expect me to pay for what i did not take ? "
" but , sir , " says the publican , now rather at a loss what to say , " but sir " " but me no <unk> , sir , " <unk> the diddler , apparently in very high <unk> , and slamming the door after him , as he makes his escape.  " but me no <unk> , sir , and none of your tricks upon travellers . "
here again is a very clever diddle , of which the simplicity is not its least recommendation .
a purse , or pocket-book , being really lost , the loser <unk> in one of the daily papers of a large city a fully descriptive advertisement .
whereupon our diddler copies the facts of this advertisement , with a change of heading , of general phraseology and address .
the original , for instance , is long , and <unk> , is headed " a pocket-book lost ! "
and requires the treasure , when found , to be left at no .
1 <name> street .
the copy is brief , and being headed with " lost " only , indicates no .
2 <name> , or no .
3 <name> street , as the locality at which the owner may be seen .
moreover , it is inserted in at least five or six of the daily papers of the day , while in point of time , it makes its appearance only a few hours after the original .
should it be read by the loser of the purse , he would hardly suspect it to have any reference to his own misfortune .
but , of course , the chances are five or six to one , that the <unk> <name> repair to the address given by the diddler , rather than to that pointed out by the rightful proprietor .
the former pays the reward , pockets the treasure and <unk> .
quite an analogous diddle is this .
a <name> of ton has dropped , some where in the street , a <name> ring of very unusual value .
for its recovery , she offers some forty or fifty dollars reward  giving , in her advertisement , a very minute description of the gem , and of its <unk> , and declaring that , on its restoration at no .
so and so , in such and such avenue , the reward would be paid <unk> , without a single question being asked .
during the <name> 's absence from home , a day or two afterwards , a ring is heard at the door of no .
so and so , in such and such avenue ; a servant appears ; the <name> of the house is asked for and is declared to be out , at which astounding information , the visitor expresses the most poignant regret .
his business is of importance and concerns the <name> herself .
in fact , he had the good fortune to find her <name> ring .
but perhaps it would be as well that he should call again .
" by no means ! "
says the servant ; and " by no means ! "
says the lady's sister and the <name> 's sister-in-law , who are summoned forthwith .
the ring is <unk> identified , the reward is paid , and the <unk> nearly thrust out of doors .
the <name> returns and expresses some little dissatisfaction with her sister and sister-in-law , because they happen to have paid forty or fifty dollars for a <unk> of her <name> ring  a <unk> made out of real <unk> and unquestionable paste .
but as there is really no end to <unk> , so there would be none to this essay , were i even to hint at half the variations , or <unk> , of which this science is susceptible .
i must bring this paper , perforce , to a conclusion , and this i can not do better than by a summary notice of a very decent , but rather elaborate diddle , of which our own city was made the theatre , not very long ago , and which was subsequently repeated with success , in other still more verdant localities of the union .
a middle-aged gentleman arrives in town from parts unknown .
he is remarkably precise , cautious , staid , and deliberate in his demeanor .
his dress is scrupulously neat , but plain , unostentatious .
he wears a white cravat , an ample waistcoat , made with an eye to comfort alone ; <unk> <unk> shoes , and pantaloons without straps .
he has the whole air , in fact , of your well-to-do , <unk> , exact , and respectable " man of business , " par excellence  one of the stern and outwardly hard , internally soft , sort of people that we see in the crack high comedies  fellows whose words are so many bonds , and who are noted for giving away guineas , in <name> , with the one hand , while , in the way of mere bargain , they exact the uttermost fraction of a farthing with the other .
he makes much ado before he can get suited with a boarding house .
he dislikes children .
he has been accustomed to quiet .
his habits are methodical  and then he would prefer getting into a private and respectable small family , piously inclined .
terms , however , are no object  only he must insist upon settling his <name> on the first of every month , ( it is now the second ) and begs his landlady , when he finally obtains one to his mind , not on any account to forget his instructions upon this point  but to send in a <name> , and receipt , precisely at ten o'clock , on the first day of every month , and under no circumstances to put it off to the second .
these arrangements made , our man of business rents an office in a reputable rather than a fashionable quarter of the town .
there is nothing he more despises than pretense .
" where there is much show , " he says , " there is seldom any thing very solid behind "  an observation which so profoundly impresses his landlady 's fancy , that she makes a pencil memorandum of it forthwith , in her great family bible , on the broad margin of the proverbs of <name> .
the next step is to advertise , after some such fashion as this , in the principal business <unk> of the city  the pennies are <unk> as not " respectable "  and as demanding payment for all advertisements in advance .
our man of business holds it as a point of his <name> that work should never be paid for until done .
" wanted  the <unk> , being about to commence extensive business operations in this city , <name> require the services of three or four intelligent and competent clerks , to whom a liberal salary <name> be paid .
the very best recommendations , not so much for capacity , as for integrity , <name> be expected .
indeed , as the duties to be performed involve high responsibilities , and large amounts of money must necessarily pass through the hands of those engaged , it is deemed advisable to demand a deposit of fifty dollars from each clerk employed .
no person need apply , therefore , who is not prepared to leave this sum in the possession of the <unk> , and who can not furnish the most satisfactory <unk> of morality .
young gentlemen piously inclined <name> be preferred .
application should be made between the hours of ten and eleven a. m. , and four and five p. m. , of messrs. " bogs , hogs logs , frogs & co. , " no .
110 dog street " by the <unk> day of the month , this advertisement has brought to the office of messrs. bogs , hogs , logs , frogs , and company , some fifteen or twenty young gentlemen piously inclined .
but our man of business is in no hurry to conclude a contract with any  no man of business is ever precipitate  and it is not until the most rigid catechism in respect to the piety of each young gentleman 's inclination , that his services are engaged and his fifty dollars <unk> for , just by way of proper precaution , on the part of the respectable firm of bogs , hogs , logs , frogs , and company .
on the morning of the first day of the next month , the landlady does not present her <name> , according to promise  a piece of neglect for which the comfortable head of the house ending in <unk> would no doubt have <unk> her severely , could he have been prevailed upon to remain in town a day or two for that purpose .
as it is , the constables have had a sad time of it , running hither and thither , and all they can do is to declare the man of business most emphatically , a " hen knee high "  by which some persons imagine them to imply that , in fact , he is n. e .
i.  by which again the very classical phrase non est <unk> , is supposed to be understood .
in the meantime the young gentlemen , one and all , are somewhat less piously inclined than before , while the landlady purchases a shilling 's worth of the indian rubber , and very carefully <unk> the pencil memorandum that some fool has made in her great family bible , on the broad margin of the proverbs of <name> .
the <name> of the odd an <unk> .
it was a chilly november afternoon .
i had just consummated an unusually hearty dinner , of which the <unk> <unk> formed not the least important item , and was sitting alone in the dining-room , with my feet upon the fender , and at my elbow a small table which i had rolled up to the fire , and upon which were some apologies for dessert , with some miscellaneous bottles of wine , spirit and <unk> .
in the morning i had been reading <unk> 's " leonidas , " <unk> 's " <unk> , " <unk> " pilgrimage , " barlow 's " <unk> , " <unk> 's " sicily , " and griswold 's " curiosities " ; i am willing to confess , therefore , that i now felt a little stupid .
i made effort to arouse myself by aid of frequent <unk> , and , all failing , i betook myself to a stray newspaper in despair .
having carefully perused the column of " houses to let , " and the column of " dogs lost , " and then the two columns of " wives and apprentices runaway , " i attacked with great resolution the editorial matter , and , reading it from beginning to end without understanding a syllable , conceived the possibility of its being chinese , and so <unk> it from the end to the beginning , but with no more satisfactory result .
i was about throwing away , in disgust , " this folio of four pages , happy work which not even critics criticise , " when i felt my attention somewhat aroused by the paragraph which follows : " the avenues to death are numerous and strange .
a london paper mentions the decease of a person from a singular cause .
he was playing at <unk> the dart , ' which is played with a long needle inserted in some worsted , and blown at a target through a tin tube .
he placed the needle at the wrong end of the tube , and drawing his breath strongly to puff the dart forward with force , <name> the needle into his throat .
it entered the lungs , and in a few days killed him . "
upon seeing this i fell into a great rage , without exactly knowing why .
" this thing , " i exclaimed , " is a contemptible falsehood  a poor hoax  the <unk> of the invention of some pitiable <unk>  of some wretched <unk> of accidents in <unk> .
these fellows , knowing the extravagant <unk> of the age , set their wits to work in the imagination of improbable possibilities  of odd accidents , as they term them ; but to a reflecting intellect ( like mine , " i added , in parenthesis , putting my forefinger unconsciously to the side of my nose , ) " to a contemplative understanding such as i myself possess , it seems evident at once that the marvelous increase of late in these <unk> accidents ' is by far the <unk> accident of all .
for my own part , i intend to believe nothing henceforward that has anything of the <unk> ' about it . "
" mein gott , den , vat a <unk> you bees for dat ! "
replied one of the most remarkable voices i ever heard .
at first i took it for a rumbling in my ears  such as a man sometimes experiences when getting very drunk  but , upon second thought , i considered the sound as more nearly resembling that which proceeds from an empty barrel beaten with a big stick ; and , in fact , this i should have concluded it to be , but for the articulation of the syllables and words .
i am by no means naturally nervous , and the very few glasses of <unk> which i had <unk> served to <unk> me no little , so that i felt nothing of trepidation , but merely uplifted my eyes with a leisurely movement , and looked carefully around the room for the intruder .
i could not , however , perceive any one at all .
" humph ! "
resumed the voice , as i continued my survey , " you mus pe so <unk> as de pig , den , for not <unk> me as i <unk> here at your <unk> . "
hereupon i bethought me of looking immediately before my nose , and there , sure enough , confronting me at the table sat a personage nondescript , although not altogether indescribable .
his body was a <unk> , or a <unk> , or something of that character , and had a truly <unk> air .
in its nether extremity were inserted two <unk> , which seemed to answer all the purposes of legs .
for arms there dangled from the upper portion of the carcass two tolerably long bottles , with the necks outward for hands .
all the head that i saw the monster possessed of was one of those <unk> <unk> which resemble a large <unk> with a hole in the middle of the lid .
this canteen ( with a funnel on its top , like a cavalier cap slouched over the eyes ) was set on edge upon the puncheon , with the hole toward myself ; and through this hole , which seemed puckered up like the mouth of a very precise old maid , the creature was emitting certain rumbling and grumbling noises which he evidently intended for intelligible talk .
" i <unk> , " said he , " you mos pe <unk> as de pig , <unk> <unk> dare and not <unk> me <unk> ere ; and i <unk> , <unk> , you mos pe <unk> <unk> as de goose , <unk> to <unk> vat <unk> print in de print .
<unk> de <unk>  dat it <unk>  <unk> <unk> ob it . "
" who are you , pray ? "
said i , with much dignity , although somewhat puzzled ; " how did you get here ?
and what is it you are talking about ? "
" <unk> <unk> ow i <unk> 'd ere , " replied the figure , " dat <unk> none of your <unk> ; and as <unk> vat i be talking apout , i be talk apout vat i <unk> proper ; and as <unk> who i be , vy dat is de very ting i <unk> 'd here for to let you <unk> for <unk> . "
" you are a drunken vagabond , " said i , " and i shall ring the <name> and order my footman to kick you into the street . "
" he !
he !
he ! "
said the fellow , " hu !
hu !
hu !
dat you ca n't do . "
" ca n't do ! "
said i , " what do you mean ?  i ca n't do what ? "
" ring de pell ; " he replied , attempting a grin with his little <unk> mouth .
upon this i made an effort to get up , in order to put my threat into execution ; but the ruffian just reached across the table very deliberately , and hitting me a tap on the forehead with the neck of one of the long bottles , knocked me back into the arm-chair from which i had half arisen .
i was utterly astounded ; and , for a moment , was quite at a loss what to do .
in the meantime , he continued his talk .
" you <unk> , " said he , " it <unk> te <name> <unk> <unk> still ; and now you shall know who i pe .
look at me !
<unk> !
i am te <name> <unk> te odd . "
" and odd enough , too , " i ventured to reply ; " but i was always under the impression that an <name> had wings . "
" te wing ! "
he cried , highly incensed , " vat i pe do mit te wing ?
mein gott !
do you take me <unk> a <unk> ? "
" no  oh no ! "
i replied , much alarmed , " you are no chicken  certainly not . "
" well , den , <unk> still and <unk> yourself , or i 'll rap you again mid me <unk> .
it <unk> te <unk> ab te wing , und te owl ab te wing , und te imp ab te wing , und te <unk> ab te wing .
te <name> ab not te wing , and i am te <name> <unk> te odd . "
" and your business with me at present is  is "  " my <unk> ! "
ejaculated the thing , " vy vat a low bred <unk> you mos pe <unk> to ask a gentleman und an <name> apout his <unk> ! "
this language was rather more than i could bear , even from an <name> ; so , plucking up courage , i seized a <unk> which lay within reach , and hurled it at the head of the intruder .
either he dodged , however , or my aim was inaccurate ; for all i accomplished was the <unk> of the <name> which protected the dial of the clock upon the <unk> .
as for the <name> , he evinced his sense of my assault by giving me two or three hard consecutive <unk> upon the forehead as before .
these reduced me at once to submission , and i am almost ashamed to confess that either through pain or vexation , there came a few tears into my eyes .
" mein gott ! "
said the <name> of the odd , apparently much softened at my distress ; " mein gott , te man is <unk> ferry <unk> or ferry <unk> .
you mos not <unk> it so strong  you mos put te water in te wine .
here , <unk> dis , like a goot <unk> , und do n't <unk> now  do n't ! "
hereupon the <name> of the odd <unk> my <unk> ( which was about a third full of port ) with a colorless fluid that he poured from one of his hand bottles .
i observed that these bottles had labels about their necks , and that these labels were inscribed " <unk> . "
the considerate kindness of the <name> <unk> me in no little measure ; and , aided by the water with which he diluted my port more than once , i at length regained sufficient temper to listen to his very extraordinary discourse .
i can not pretend to recount all that he told me , but i <unk> from what he said that he was the genius who presided over the <unk> of mankind , and whose business it was to bring about the odd accidents which are continually astonishing the <unk> .
once or twice , upon my venturing to express my total incredulity in respect to his pretensions , he grew very angry indeed , so that at length i considered it the wiser policy to say nothing at all , and let him have his own way .
he talked on , therefore , at great length , while i merely leaned back in my chair with my eyes shut , and amused myself with munching raisins and <unk> the stems about the room .
but , by-and-by , the <name> suddenly construed this behavior of mine into contempt .
he arose in a terrible passion , slouched his funnel down over his eyes , swore a vast oath , uttered a threat of some character which i did not precisely comprehend , and finally made me a low bow and departed , wishing me , in the language of the archbishop in <unk> , " <unk> de <unk> et <name> <unk> plus de bon <unk> . "
his departure afforded me relief .
the very few glasses of <unk> that i had <unk> had the effect of rendering me drowsy , and i felt inclined to take a nap of some fifteen or twenty minutes , as is my custom after dinner .
at six i had an appointment of consequence , which it was quite indispensable that i should keep .
the policy of insurance for my dwelling house had expired the day before ; and , some dispute having arisen , it was agreed that , at six , i should meet the board of directors of the company and settle the terms of a renewal .
glancing upward at the clock on the <unk> , ( for i felt too drowsy to take out my watch ) , i had the pleasure to find that i had still twenty-five minutes to spare .
it was half past five ; i could easily walk to the insurance office in five minutes ; and my usual <unk> had never been known to exceed five and twenty .
i felt sufficiently safe , therefore , and composed myself to my slumbers forthwith .
having completed them to my satisfaction , i again looked toward the <unk> and was half inclined to believe in the possibility of odd accidents when i found that , instead of my ordinary fifteen or twenty minutes , i had been dozing only three ; for it still wanted seven and twenty of the appointed hour .
i betook myself again to my nap , and at length a second time awoke , when , to my utter amazement , it still wanted twenty-seven minutes of six .
i jumped up to examine the clock , and found that it had ceased running .
my watch informed me that it was half past seven ; and , of course , having slept two hours , i was too late for my appointment .
" it <name> make no difference , " i said : " i can call at the office in the morning and apologize ; in the meantime what can be the matter with the clock ? "
upon examining it i discovered that one of the <unk> stems which i had been <unk> about the room during the discourse of the <name> of the odd , had flown through the fractured <name> , and lodging , singularly enough , in the key-hole , with an end projecting outward , had thus arrested the revolution of the minute hand .
" ah ! "
said i , " i see how it is .
this thing speaks for itself .
a natural accident , such as <name> happen now and then ! "
i gave the matter no further consideration , and at my usual hour retired to bed .
here , having placed a candle upon a reading stand at the bed head , and having made an attempt to peruse some pages of the " omnipresence of the deity , " i unfortunately fell asleep in less than twenty seconds , leaving the light burning as it was .
my dreams were <unk> disturbed by visions of the <name> of the odd .
methought he stood at the foot of the couch , <name> aside the curtains , and , in the hollow , detestable tones of a rum puncheon , <unk> me with the bitterest vengeance for the contempt with which i had treated him .
he concluded a long harangue by taking off his <unk> , inserting the tube into my gullet , and thus <unk> me with an ocean of <unk> , which he poured , in a continuous flood , from one of the long <unk> bottles that stood him instead of an arm .
my agony was at length insufferable , and i awoke just in time to perceive that a rat had ran off with the lighted candle from the stand , but not in season to prevent his making his escape with it through the hole .
very soon , a strong suffocating odor assailed my nostrils ; the house , i clearly perceived , was on fire .
in a few minutes the blaze broke forth with violence , and in an incredibly brief period the entire building was wrapped in flames .
all egress from my chamber , except through a window , was cut off .
the crowd , however , quickly procured and raised a long ladder .
by means of this i was descending rapidly , and in apparent safety , when a huge hog , about whose <unk> stomach , and indeed about whose whole air and physiognomy , there was something which reminded me of the <name> of the odd ,  when this hog , i say , which hitherto had been quietly slumbering in the mud , took it suddenly into his head that his left shoulder needed scratching , and could find no more convenient <unk> than that afforded by the foot of the ladder .
in an instant i was precipitated and had the misfortune to fracture my arm .
this accident , with the loss of my insurance , and with the more serious loss of my hair , the whole of which had been singed off by the fire , <unk> me to serious impressions , so that , finally , i made up my mind to take a wife .
there was a <name> widow disconsolate for the loss of her seventh husband , and to her wounded spirit i offered the balm of my vows .
she yielded a reluctant consent to my prayers .
i knelt at her feet in gratitude and adoration .
she blushed and bowed her luxuriant tresses into close contact with those supplied me , temporarily , by <unk> .
i know not how the <unk> took place , but so it was .
i arose with a shining <unk> , <unk> ; she in disdain and wrath , half buried in alien hair .
thus ended my hopes of the widow by an accident which could not have been anticipated , to be sure , but which the natural sequence of events had brought about .
without despairing , however , i undertook the siege of a less implacable heart .
the fates were again propitious for a brief period ; but again a trivial incident interfered .
meeting my betrothed in an avenue thronged with the <unk> of the city , i was hastening to greet her with one of my best considered bows , when a small particle of some foreign matter , lodging in the corner of my eye , rendered me , for the moment , completely blind .
before i could recover my sight , the <name> of my love had disappeared  <unk> <unk> at what she chose to consider my <unk> rudeness in passing her by <unk> .
while i stood bewildered at the suddenness of this accident , ( which might have happened , nevertheless , to any one under the sun ) , and while i still continued incapable of sight , i was accosted by the <name> of the odd , who proffered me his aid with a civility which i had no reason to expect .
he examined my disordered eye with much gentleness and skill , informed me that i had a drop in it , and ( whatever a " drop " was ) took it out , and afforded me relief .
i now considered it high time to die , ( since fortune had so determined to persecute me , ) and accordingly made my way to the nearest river .
here , <unk> myself of my clothes , ( for there is no reason why we can not die as we were born ) , i threw myself headlong into the current ; the sole witness of my fate being a solitary crow that had been seduced into the eating of <unk> corn , and so had staggered away from his fellows .
no sooner had i entered the water than this bird took it into its head to fly away with the most indispensable portion of my apparel .
<unk> , therefore , for the present , my <unk> design , i just slipped my nether extremities into the sleeves of my coat , and betook myself to a pursuit of the <unk> with all the <unk> which the case required and its circumstances would admit .
but my evil <name> attended me still .
as i ran at full speed , with my nose up in the atmosphere , and intent only upon the <unk> of my property , i suddenly perceived that my feet rested no longer upon <unk> ; the fact is , i had thrown myself over a precipice , and should inevitably have been dashed to pieces but for my good fortune in grasping the end of a long <unk> , which depended from a passing balloon .
as soon as i sufficiently recovered my senses to comprehend the terrific predicament in which i stood or rather <name> , i exerted all the power of my lungs to make that predicament known to the <unk> overhead .
but for a long time i exerted myself in vain .
either the fool could not , or the villain would not perceive me .
meantime the machine rapidly soared , while my strength even more rapidly failed .
i was soon upon the point of <unk> myself to my fate , and dropping quietly into the sea , when my spirits were suddenly revived by hearing a hollow voice from above , which seemed to be lazily humming an opera air .
looking up , i perceived the <name> of the odd .
he was leaning with his arms folded , over the rim of the car ; and with a pipe in his mouth , at which he puffed leisurely , seemed to be upon excellent terms with himself and the universe .
i was too much exhausted to speak , so i merely regarded him with an imploring air .
for several minutes , although he looked me full in the face , he said nothing .
at length removing carefully his <unk> from the right to the left corner of his mouth , he condescended to speak .
" who pe you , " he asked , " und what der <unk> you pe do dare ? "
to this piece of impudence , cruelty and affectation , i could reply only by <unk> the <unk> " help ! "
" <unk> ! "
echoed the ruffian  " not i. dare <unk> te <unk>  <unk> yourself , und pe <name> 'd ! "
with these words he let fall a heavy bottle of <unk> which , dropping precisely upon the crown of my head , caused me to imagine that my brains were entirely knocked out .
impressed with this idea , i was about to relinquish my hold and give up the ghost with a good <name> , when i was arrested by the cry of the <name> , who bade me hold on .
" old on ! "
he said ; " do n't pe in te <unk>  do n't .
<name> you pe take de <unk> <unk> , or <unk> you pe got <unk> yet and come to your <unk> ? "
i made haste , hereupon , to nod my head twice  once in the negative , meaning thereby that i would prefer not taking the other bottle at present  and once in the affirmative , intending thus to imply that i was sober and had positively come to my senses .
by these means i somewhat softened the <name> .
" und you <unk> , ten , " he inquired , " at te last ?
you <unk> , ten , in te <unk> of te odd ? "
i again nodded my head in assent .
" und you <unk> <unk> in me , te <name> of te odd ? "
i nodded again .
" und you acknowledge tat you pe te blind <unk> and te <unk> ? "
i nodded once more .
" put your right hand into your left hand <unk> pocket , ten , in token <unk> your <unk> <unk> unto te <name> <unk> te odd . "
this thing , for very obvious reasons , i found it quite impossible to do .
in the first place , my left arm had been broken in my fall from the ladder , and , therefore , had i let go my hold with the right hand , i must have let go altogether .
in the second place , i could have no breeches until i came across the crow .
i was therefore obliged , much to my regret , to shake my head in the negative  intending thus to give the <name> to understand that i found it inconvenient , just at that moment , to comply with his very reasonable demand !
no sooner , however , had i ceased shaking my head than  " go to der <unk> , ten ! "
roared the <name> of the odd .
in pronouncing these words , he <name> a sharp knife across the <unk> by which i was suspended , and as we then happened to be precisely over my own house , ( which , during my <unk> , had been handsomely rebuilt , ) it so occurred that i tumbled headlong down the ample chimney and <unk> upon the dining-room hearth .
upon coming to my senses , ( for the fall had very thoroughly stunned me , ) i found it about four o'clock in the morning .
i lay outstretched where i had fallen from the balloon .
my head <unk> in the ashes of an extinguished fire , while my feet reposed upon the wreck of a small table , overthrown , and amid the fragments of a miscellaneous dessert , intermingled with a newspaper , some broken glass and shattered bottles , and an empty jug of the <unk> <unk> .
thus revenged himself the <name> of the odd .
[ <unk> states that griswold " obviously had a revised form " for use in the 1856 volume of poe 's works .
<unk> does not <unk> this claim , but it is surely not unreasonable .
an editor , and even <unk> errors , may have produced nearly all of the very minor changes made in this version .
( indeed , two very necessary words were clearly dropped by accident . )
an editor might have corrected " <unk> 's <unk> ' " to " <unk> 's <unk> ' , " but is unlikely to have added " <unk> 's <unk> ' " to the list of books read by the <unk> .
griswold was not above forgery ( in poe 's letters ) when it suited his purpose , but would have too little to gain by such an effort in this instance . ]
<unk> <unk> to the editors of the <name> 's book : i have the honor of sending you , for your magazine , an article which i <name> you <name> be able to comprehend rather more distinctly than i do myself .
it is a translation , by my friend , <name> van <unk> <name> , ( sometimes called the " <unk> seer " ) of an <unk> ms. which i found , about a year ago , tightly <unk> up in a jug floating in the mare <unk>  a sea well described by the <unk> <unk> , but seldom visited <unk> , except for the <unk> and divers for <unk> .
truly yours , <name> a. poe { this paragraph not in the volume  <name> } on board balloon " <unk> " <name> , 1 , <unk> now , my dear friend  now , for your sins , you are to suffer the infliction of a long gossiping letter .
i tell you distinctly that i am going to punish you for all your <unk> by being as tedious , as <unk> , as incoherent and as unsatisfactory as possible .
besides , here i am , <unk> up in a dirty balloon , with some one or two hundred of the <unk> , all bound on a pleasure excursion , ( what a funny idea some people have of pleasure ! )
and i have no prospect of touching <name> <unk> for a month at least .
nobody to talk to .
nothing to do .
when one has nothing to do , then is the time to correspond with ones friends .
you perceive , then , why it is that i write you this letter  it is on account of my <unk> and your sins .
get ready your spectacles and make up your mind to be annoyed .
i mean to write at you every day during this odious voyage .
<unk> !
when <name> any invention visit the human <unk> ?
are we forever to be doomed to the thousand inconveniences of the balloon ?
<name> nobody contrive a more <unk> mode of progress ?
the <unk> movement , to my thinking , is little less than positive torture .
upon my word we have not made more than a hundred miles the hour since leaving home !
the very birds beat us  at least some of them .
i assure you that i do not exaggerate at all .
our motion , no doubt , seems slower than it actually is  this on account of our having no objects about us by which to estimate our velocity , and on account of our going with the wind .
to be sure , whenever we meet a balloon we have a chance of perceiving our rate , and then , i admit , things do not appear so very bad .
accustomed as i am to this mode of travelling , i can not get over a kind of <unk> whenever a balloon passes us in a current directly overhead .
it always seems to me like an immense bird of prey about to pounce upon us and <name> us off in its claws .
one went over us this morning about sunrise , and so nearly overhead that its <unk> actually brushed the network <unk> our car , and caused us very serious apprehension .
our captain said that if the material of the bag had been the trumpery varnished " silk " of five hundred or a thousand years ago , we should inevitably have been damaged .
this silk , as he explained it to me , was a fabric composed of the entrails of a species of <unk> .
the worm was carefully fed on <unk>  kind of fruit resembling a <unk>  and , when sufficiently fat , was crushed in a mill .
the paste thus arising was called <unk> in its primary state , and went through a variety of processes until it finally became " silk . "
singular to relate , it was once much admired as an article of female dress !
balloons were also very generally constructed from it .
a better kind of material , it appears , was subsequently found in the down surrounding the <unk> of a plant <unk> called <unk> , and at that time <unk> termed <unk> .
this latter kind of silk was designated as <unk> , on account of its superior <unk> , and was usually prepared for use by being varnished with a solution of gum <unk>  a substance which in some respects must have resembled the <unk> <unk> now in common use .
this <unk> was occasionally called indian rubber or rubber of twist , and was no doubt one of the numerous <unk> .
never tell me again that i am not at heart an <unk> .
talking of <unk>  our own , it seems , has this moment knocked a man overboard from one of the small magnetic propellers that swarm in ocean below us  a boat of about six thousand tons , and , from all accounts , shamefully crowded .
these diminutive <unk> should be prohibited from carrying more than a definite number of passengers .
the man , of course , was not permitted to get on board again , and was soon out of sight , he and his life-preserver .
i rejoice , my dear friend , that we live in an age so enlightened that no such a thing as an individual is supposed to exist .
it is the mass for which the true humanity cares .
<unk> , talking of humanity , do you know that our immortal <unk> is not so original in his views of the social condition and so forth , as his contemporaries are inclined to suppose ?
pundit assures me that the same ideas were put nearly in the same way , about a thousand years ago , by an <name> philosopher called <unk> , on account of his keeping a retail shop for cat <unk> and other furs .
pundit knows , you know ; there can be no mistake about it .
how very wonderfully do we see verified every day , the profound observation of the hindoo <unk> <unk> ( as quoted by pundit )  " thus must we say that , not once or twice , or a few times , but with almost infinite repetitions , the same opinions come round in a circle among men . "
<name> 2.  spoke to-day the magnetic cutter in charge of the middle section of floating telegraph wires .
i learn that when this species of telegraph was first put into operation by horse , it was considered quite impossible to convey the wires over sea , but now we are at a loss to comprehend where the difficulty lay !
so wags the world .
<unk> <unk>  excuse me for quoting the <unk> .
what would we do without the <unk> telegraph ?
( pundit says atlantic was the ancient adjective . )
we lay to a few minutes to ask the cutter some questions , and learned , among other glorious news , that civil war is raging in africa , while the plague is doing its good work beautifully both in <unk> and <unk> .
is it not truly remarkable that , before the magnificent light shed upon philosophy by humanity , the world was accustomed to regard war and pestilence as calamities ?
do you know that prayers were actually offered up in the ancient temples to the end that these evils ( ! )
might not be visited upon mankind ?
is it not really difficult to comprehend upon what principle of interest our forefathers acted ?
were they so blind as not to perceive that the destruction of a myriad of individuals is only so much positive advantage to the mass !
<name> 3.  it is really a very fine amusement to ascend the <unk> leading to the summit of the <unk> , and thence survey the surrounding world .
from the car below you know the prospect is not so comprehensive  you can see little vertically .
but seated here ( where i write this ) in the <unk> open piazza of the summit , one can see everything that is going on in all directions .
just now there is quite a crowd of balloons in sight , and they present a very animated appearance , while the air is <unk> with the hum of so many millions of human voices .
i have heard it asserted that when yellow or ( pundit <name> have it ) <name> , who is supposed to have been the first <unk> , maintained the <unk> of traversing the atmosphere in all directions , by merely ascending or descending until a favorable current was attained , he was scarcely <unk> to at all by his contemporaries , who looked upon him as merely an ingenious sort of madman , because the philosophers ( ? )
of the day declared the thing impossible .
really now it does seem to me quite unaccountable how any thing so obviously feasible could have escaped the sagacity of the ancient savans .
but in all ages the great obstacles to advancement in <name> have been opposed by the so-called men of science .
to be sure , our men of science are not quite so bigoted as those of old :  oh , i have something so queer to tell you on this topic .
do you know that it is not more than a thousand years ago since the <unk> consented to relieve the people of the singular fancy that there existed but two possible roads for the attainment of truth !
believe it if you can !
it appears that long , long ago , in the night of time , there lived a turkish philosopher ( or hindoo possibly ) called <unk> <unk> .
this person introduced , or at all events propagated what was termed the <unk> or a priori mode of investigation .
he started with what he maintained to be axioms or " self-evident truths , " and thence proceeded " logically " to results .
his greatest disciples were one <unk> , and one cant .
well , <unk> <unk> flourished supreme until advent of one hog , <unk> the " <unk> shepherd , " who preached an entirely different system , which he called the a <unk> or inductive .
his plan referred altogether to sensation .
he proceeded by observing , analyzing , and classifying <unk> <unk> , as they were <unk> called  into general laws .
<unk> <unk> 's mode , in a word , was based on <unk> ; hog 's on phenomena .
well , so great was the admiration excited by this latter system that , at its first introduction , <unk> <unk> fell into <unk> ; but finally he recovered ground and was permitted to divide the realm of truth with his more modern rival .
the savans now maintained the <unk> and baconian roads were the sole possible avenues to knowledge .
" baconian , " you must know , was an adjective invented as equivalent to <unk> and more <unk> and dignified .
now , my dear friend , i do assure you , most positively , that i represent this matter fairly , on the soundest authority and you can easily understand how a notion so absurd on its very face must have operated to retard the progress of all true knowledge  which makes its advances almost invariably by <unk> bounds .
the ancient idea confined investigations to crawling ; and for hundreds of years so great was the infatuation about hog especially , that a <unk> end was put to all thinking , properly so called .
no man dared utter a truth to which he felt himself indebted to his soul alone .
it mattered not whether the truth was even <unk> a truth , for the <unk> savans of the time regarded only the road by which he had attained it .
they would not even look at the end .
" let us see the means , " they cried , " the means ! "
if , upon investigation of the means , it was found to come under neither the category <unk> ( that is to say ram ) nor under the category hog , why then the savans went no farther , but pronounced the " <unk> " a fool , and would have nothing to do with him or his truth .
now , it can not be maintained , even , that by the crawling system the greatest amount of truth would be attained in any long series of ages , for the repression of imagination was an evil not to be compensated for by any superior certainty in the ancient modes of investigation .
the error of these <unk> , these <unk> , these <unk> , and these <unk> ( the latter , by the way , were our own immediate progenitors ) , was an error quite analogous with that of the <unk> who fancies that he must necessarily see an object the better the more closely he holds it to his eyes .
these people blinded themselves by details .
when they proceeded <unk> , their " facts " were by no means always facts  a matter of little consequence had it not been for assuming that they were facts and must be facts because they appeared to be such .
when they proceeded on the path of the ram , their course was scarcely as straight as a ram 's horn , for they never had an axiom which was an axiom at all .
they must have been very blind not to see this , even in their own day ; for even in their own day many of the long " established " axioms had been rejected .
for example  " ex <unk> <unk> fit " ; " a body can not act where it is not " ; " there can not exist <unk> " ; " darkness can not come out of light "  all these , and a dozen other similar propositions , formerly admitted without hesitation as axioms , were , even at the period of which i speak , seen to be untenable .
how absurd in these people , then , to persist in putting <name> in " axioms " as immutable bases of truth !
but even out of the mouths of their soundest <unk> it is easy to demonstrate the futility , the <unk> of their axioms in general .
who was the soundest of their logicians ?
let me see !
i <name> go and ask pundit and be back in a minute ... . ah , here we have it !
here is a book written nearly a thousand years ago and lately translated from the <unk>  which , by the way , appears to have been the rudiment of the <unk> .
pundit says it is decidedly the <unk> ancient work on its topic , logic .
the author ( who was much thought of in his day ) was one miller , or mill ; and we find it recorded of him , as a point of some importance , that he had a <unk> called bentham .
but let us glance at the treatise !
ah !  " ability or inability to conceive , " says mr. mill , very properly , " is in no case to be received as a criterion of <unk> truth . "
what modern in his senses would ever think of disputing this <unk> ?
the only wonder with us must be , how it happened that mr. mill conceived it necessary even to hint at any thing so obvious .
so far good  but let us turn over another paper .
what have we here ?  " <unk> can not both be true  that is , can not co-exist in nature . "
here mr. mill means , for example , that a tree must be either a tree or not a tree  that it can not be at the same time a tree and not a tree .
very well ; but i ask him why .
his reply is this  and never pretends to be any thing else than this  " because it is impossible to conceive that <unk> can both be true . "
but this is no answer at all , by his own showing , for has he not just admitted as a <unk> that " ability or inability to conceive is in no case to be received as a criterion of <unk> truth . "
now i do not complain of these ancients so much because their logic is , by their own showing , utterly <unk> , worthless and fantastic altogether , as because of their pompous and imbecile <unk> of all other roads of truth , of all other means for its attainment than the two preposterous paths  the one of creeping and the one of crawling  to which they have dared to confine the soul that loves nothing so well as to soar .
by the by , my dear friend , do you not think it would have puzzled these ancient <unk> to have determined by which of their two roads it was that the most important and most sublime of all their truths was , in effect , attained ?
i mean the truth of gravitation .
<name> owed it to kepler .
kepler admitted that his three laws were guessed at  these three laws of all laws which led the great <unk> mathematician to his principle , the basis of all physical principle  to go behind which we must enter the kingdom of metaphysics .
kepler guessed  that is to say imagined .
he was essentially a " <unk> "  that word now of so much sanctity , formerly an epithet of contempt .
would it not have puzzled these old moles too , to have explained by which of the two " roads " a <unk> <unk> a <unk> of more than usual secrecy , or by which of the two roads <unk> directed mankind to those enduring and almost innumerable truths which resulted from his <unk> the hieroglyphics .
one word more on this topic and i <name> be done boring you .
is it not passing strange that , with their eternal <unk> about roads to truth , these bigoted people missed what we now so clearly perceive to be the great highway  that of consistency ?
does it not seem singular how they should have failed to deduce from the works of god the vital fact that a perfect consistency must be an absolute truth !
how plain has been our progress since the late announcement of this proposition !
investigation has been taken out of the hands of the <unk> and given , as a task , to the true and only true thinkers , the men of ardent imagination .
these latter <unk> .
can you not fancy the shout of scorn with which my words would be received by our progenitors were it possible for them to be now looking over my shoulder ?
these men , i say , <unk> ; and their theories are simply corrected , reduced , <unk>  cleared , little by little , of their dross of inconsistency  until , finally , a perfect consistency stands apparent which even the most stolid admit , because it is a consistency , to be an absolute and an unquestionable truth .
<name> 4.  the new gas is doing wonders , in conjunction with the new improvement with <unk> <unk> .
how very safe , commodious , <unk> , and in every respect convenient are our modern balloons !
here is an immense one approaching us at the rate of at least a hundred and fifty miles an hour .
it seems to be crowded with people  perhaps there are three or four hundred passengers  and yet it <unk> to an elevation of nearly a mile , looking down upon poor us with sovereign contempt .
still a hundred or even two hundred miles an hour is slow travelling after all .
do you remember our flight on the railroad across the <unk> continent ?  fully three hundred miles the hour  that was travelling .
nothing to be seen though  nothing to be done but flirt , feast and dance in the magnificent saloons .
do you remember what an odd sensation was experienced when , by chance , we caught a glimpse of external objects while the cars were in full flight ?
every thing seemed unique  in one mass .
for my part , i can not say but that i preferred the travelling by the slow train of a hundred miles the hour .
here we were permitted to have glass windows  even to have them open  and something like a distinct view of the country was attainable ... . pundit says that the route for the great <unk> railroad must have been in some measure marked out about nine hundred years ago !
in fact , he goes so far as to assert that actual traces of a road are still discernible  traces referable to a period quite as remote as that mentioned .
the track , it appears was double only ; ours , you know , has twelve paths ; and three or four new ones are in preparation .
the ancient rails were very slight , and placed so close together as to be , according to modern notions , quite frivolous , if not dangerous in the extreme .
the present width of track  fifty feet  is considered , indeed , scarcely secure enough .
for my part , i make no doubt that a track of some sort must have existed in very remote times , as pundit asserts ; for nothing can be clearer , to my mind , than that , at some period  not less than seven centuries ago , certainly  the northern and southern <unk> continents were united ; the <unk> , then , would have been driven , by necessity , to a great railroad across the continent .
<name> 5.  i am almost devoured by <unk> .
pundit is the only <unk> person on board ; and he , poor soul !
can speak of nothing but antiquities .
he has been occupied all the day in the attempt to convince me that the ancient <unk> governed themselves !  did ever anybody hear of such an absurdity ?  that they existed in a sort of <unk> confederacy , after the fashion of the " prairie dogs " that we read of in fable .
he says that they started with the queerest idea conceivable , viz : that all men are born free and equal  this in the very teeth of the laws of gradation so visibly impressed upon all things both in the moral and physical universe .
every man " voted , " as they called it  that is to say meddled with public affairs  until at length , it was discovered that what is <unk> business is nobody 's , and that the " republic " ( so the absurd thing was called ) was without a government at all .
it is related , however , that the first circumstance which disturbed , very particularly , the <unk> of the philosophers who constructed this " republic , " was the startling discovery that universal suffrage gave opportunity for <unk> schemes , by means of which any desired number of votes might at any time be <unk> , without the possibility of prevention or even detection , by any party which should be merely villainous enough not to be ashamed of the fraud .
a little reflection upon this discovery sufficed to render evident the consequences , which were that rascality must <unk>  in a word , that a republican government could never be any thing but a rascally one .
while the philosophers , however , were busied in blushing at their stupidity in not having foreseen these inevitable evils , and intent upon the invention of new theories , the matter was put to an abrupt issue by a fellow of the name of mob , who took every thing into his own hands and set up a despotism , in comparison with which those of the fabulous <unk> and <unk> were respectable and delectable .
this mob ( a foreigner , <unk> ) , is said to have been the most odious of all men that ever encumbered the earth .
he was a giant in stature  insolent , <unk> , filthy , had the gall of a bullock with the heart of a hyena and the brains of a peacock .
he died , at length , by dint of his own energies , which exhausted him .
nevertheless , he had his uses , as every thing has , however vile , and taught mankind a lesson which to this day it is in no danger of forgetting  never to run directly contrary to the natural analogies .
as for <unk> , no analogy could be found for it upon the face of the earth  unless we except the case of the " prairie dogs , " an exception which seems to demonstrate , if anything , that democracy is a very admirable form of government  for dogs .
<name> <unk>  last night had a fine view of <name> <unk> , whose disk , through our captain 's spy-glass , <unk> an <name> of half a degree , looking very much as our sun does to the naked eye on a <name> day .
<name> <unk> , although so very much larger than our sun , by the by , resembles him closely as regards its spots , its atmosphere , and in many other particulars .
it is only within the last century , pundit tells me , that the <unk> relation existing between these two orbs began even to be suspected .
the evident motion of our system in the heavens was ( strange to say ! )
referred to an orbit about a prodigious <name> in the centre of the galaxy .
about this <name> , or at all events about a centre of gravity common to all the globes of the milky way and supposed to be near <unk> in the <unk> , every one of these globes was declared to be revolving , our own performing the circuit in a period of <unk> of years !
we , with our present lights , our vast <unk> improvements , and so forth , of course find it difficult to comprehend the ground of an idea such as this .
its first <unk> was one <unk> .
he was led , we must presume , to this wild hypothesis by mere analogy in the first instance ; but , this being the case , he should have at least adhered to analogy in its development .
a great central orb was , in fact , suggested ; so far <unk> was consistent .
this central orb , however , <unk> , should have been greater than all its surrounding orbs taken together .
the question might then have been asked  " why do we not see it ? "
 we , especially , who occupy the mid region of the cluster  the very locality near which , at least , must be situated this inconceivable central sun .
the astronomer , perhaps , at this point , took refuge in the suggestion of <unk> ; and here analogy was suddenly let fall .
but even admitting the central orb <unk> , how did he manage to explain its failure to be rendered visible by the incalculable host of glorious suns glaring in all directions about it ?
no doubt what he finally maintained was merely a centre of gravity common to all the revolving orbs  but here again analogy must have been let fall .
our system revolves , it is true , about a common centre of gravity , but it does this in connection with and in consequence of a material sun whose mass more than <unk> the rest of the system .
the mathematical circle is a curve composed of an infinity of straight lines ; but this idea of the circle  this idea of it which , in regard to all earthly geometry , we consider as merely the mathematical , in <unk> from the practical , idea  is , in sober fact , the practical <name> which alone we have any right to entertain in respect to those <unk> circles with which we have to deal , at least in fancy , when we suppose our system , with its fellows , revolving about a point in the centre of the galaxy .
let the most vigorous of human imaginations but attempt to take a single step toward the comprehension of a circuit so unutterable !
i would scarcely be paradoxical to say that a flash of lightning itself , travelling forever upon the circumference of this inconceivable circle , would still forever be travelling in a straight line .
that the path of our sun along such a circumference  that the direction of our system in such an orbit  would , to any human perception , deviate in the slightest degree from a straight line even in a million of years , is a proposition not to be entertained ; and yet these ancient astronomers were absolutely <unk> , it appears , into believing that a decisive curvature had become apparent during the brief period of their astronomical history  during the mere point  during the utter nothingness of two or three thousand years !
how incomprehensible , that considerations such as this did not at once indicate to them the true state of affairs  that of the <unk> revolution of our sun and <name> <unk> around a common centre of gravity !
<name> 7.  continued last night our astronomical amusements .
had a fine view of the five <unk> <unk> , and watched with much interest the putting up of a huge <unk> on a couple of <unk> in the new <name> at <unk> in the moon .
it was amusing to think that creatures so diminutive as the <unk> , and bearing so little resemblance to humanity , yet evinced a mechanical ingenuity so much superior to our own .
one finds it difficult , too , to conceive the vast masses which these people handle so easily , to be as light as our own reason tells us they actually are .
<name> 8.  eureka !
pundit is in his <name> .
a balloon from <unk> spoke us to-day and threw on board several late papers ; they contain some exceedingly curious information relative to <unk> or rather <unk> antiquities .
you know , i presume , that laborers have for some months been employed in preparing the ground for a new fountain at paradise , the emperor 's principal pleasure garden .
paradise , it appears , has been , literally speaking , an island time out of mind  that is to say , its northern boundary was always ( as far back as any record extends ) a rivulet , or rather a very narrow arm of the sea .
this arm was gradually widened until it attained its present breadth  a mile .
the whole length of the island is nine miles ; the breadth varies materially .
the entire area ( so pundit says ) was , about eight hundred years ago , densely packed with houses , some of them twenty stories high ; land ( for some most unaccountable reason ) being considered as especially precious just in this vicinity .
the disastrous earthquake , however , of the year <unk> , so totally <unk> and overwhelmed the town ( for it was almost too large to be called a village ) that the most indefatigable of our <unk> have never yet been able to obtain from the site any sufficient data ( in the shape of coins , medals or inscriptions ) wherewith to build up even the ghost of a theory concerning the manners , customs , & c. , & c. , & c. , of the aboriginal inhabitants .
nearly all that we have hitherto known of them is , that they were a portion of the <unk> tribe of savages <unk> the continent at its first discovery by <unk> <unk> , a knight of the golden fleece .
they were by no means <unk> , however , but cultivated various arts and even sciences after a fashion of their own .
it is related of them that they were acute in many respects , but were oddly afflicted with <unk> for building what , in the ancient <unk> , was <unk> " churches "  a kind of pagoda instituted for the worship of two idols that went by the names of wealth and fashion .
in the end , it is said , the island became , nine <unk> of it , church .
the women , too , it appears , were oddly deformed by a natural protuberance of the region just below the small of the back  although , most unaccountably , this deformity was looked upon altogether in the light of a beauty .
one or two pictures of these singular women have in fact , been miraculously preserved .
they look very odd , very  like something between a turkey-cock and a dromedary .
well , these few details are nearly all that have descended to us respecting the ancient <unk> .
it seems , however , that while digging in the centre of the emperors garden , ( which , you know , covers the whole island ) , some of the workmen unearthed a cubical and evidently <unk> block of granite , weighing several hundred pounds .
it was in good preservation , having received , apparently , little injury from the convulsion which entombed it .
on one of its surfaces was a marble slab with ( only think of it ! )
an inscription  a <unk> inscription .
pundit is in <unk> .
upon <unk> the slab , a cavity appeared , containing a leaden box filled with various coins , a long scroll of names , several documents which appear to resemble newspapers , with other matters of intense interest to the <unk> !
there can be no doubt that all these are genuine <unk> relics belonging to the tribe called <unk> .
the papers thrown on board our balloon are filled with <unk> of the coins , <unk> , <unk> , & c. , & c. i copy for your amusement the <unk> inscription on the marble slab :  this corner stone of a monument to the memory of <name> washington was laid with appropriate ceremonies on the 19th day of october , 1847 the anniversary of the surrender of lord <unk> to general washington at <unk> a. d. <unk> under the auspices of the washington monument association of the city of new york this , as i give it , is a verbatim translation done by pundit himself , so there can be no mistake about it .
from the few words thus preserved , we <unk> several important items of knowledge , not the least interesting of which is the fact that a thousand years ago actual monuments had fallen into disuse  as was all very proper  the people contenting themselves , as we do now , with a mere indication of the design to erect a monument at some future time ; a <unk> being cautiously laid by itself " solitary and alone " ( excuse me for quoting the great american poet <name> !
) , as a guarantee of the magnanimous intention .
we ascertain , too , very distinctly , from this admirable inscription , the how as well as the where and the what , of the great surrender in question .
as to the where , it was <unk> ( wherever that was ) , and as to the what , it was general <unk> ( no doubt some wealthy dealer in corn ) .
he was surrendered .
the inscription <unk> the surrender of  what ?
why , " of lord <unk> . "
the only question is what could the savages wish him surrendered for .
but when we remember that these savages were undoubtedly cannibals , we are led to the conclusion that they intended him for sausage .
as to the how of the surrender , no language can be more explicit .
lord <unk> was surrendered ( for sausage ) " under the auspices of the washington monument association "  no doubt a charitable institution for the depositing of <unk>  but , heaven bless me !
what is the matter ?
ah , i see  the balloon has collapsed , and we shall have a tumble into the sea .
i have , therefore , only time enough to add that , from a hasty inspection of the <unk> of newspapers , & c. , & c. , i find that the great men in those days among the <unk> , were one <name> , a smith , and one <unk> , a tailor .
good-bye , until i see you again .
whether you ever get this letter or not is point of little importance , as i write altogether for my own amusement .
i shall cork the ms. up in a bottle , however , and throw it into the sea .
yours <unk> , <unk> .
the duc de <unk> .
and stepped at once into a cooler <unk>  <unk> keats fell by a criticism .
who was it died of " the <unk> " ?
{ *1 } ignoble souls !  de <unk> perished of an <unk> .
<unk> en est <unk> .
assist me , spirit of <unk> !
a golden cage bore the little winged wanderer , <unk> , melting , indolent , to the <unk> <unk> , from its home in far peru .
from its queenly possessor la <unk> , to the duc de <unk> , six peers of the empire conveyed the happy bird .
that night the duc was to sup alone .
in the privacy of his bureau he <unk> languidly on that ottoman for which he sacrificed his loyalty in <unk> his king  the notorious ottoman of cadet .
he buries his face in the pillow .
the clock strikes !
unable to restrain his feelings , his <name> swallows an <name> .
at this moment the door gently opens to the sound of soft music , and lo !
the most delicate of birds is before the most <unk> of men !
but what inexpressible dismay now <unk> the countenance of the duc ?  " <unk> !  <unk> !
<unk> !  <unk> !
ah , bon dieu !
<unk> <unk> <unk> que <name> as <unk> de ses plumes , et que <name> as <unk> sans <unk> ! "
it is superfluous to say more :  the duc expired in a paroxysm of disgust .
" <name> !
<name> !
<name> ! "
said his <name> on the third day after his decease .
" he !
he !
he ! "
replied the devil faintly , drawing himself up with an air of <unk> .
" why , surely you are not serious , " retorted de <unk> .
" i have sinned  c'est <unk>  but , my good sir , consider !  you have no actual intention of putting such  such barbarous threats into execution . "
" no what ? "
said his majesty  " come , sir , strip ! "
" strip , indeed !
very pretty i ' <name> !
no , sir , i shall not strip .
who are you , pray , that i , duc de <unk> , <name> de <unk> , just come of age , author of the <unk> , ' and member of the academy , should divest myself at your bidding of the sweetest pantaloons ever made by <unk> , the daintiest <unk> ever put together by <unk>  to say nothing of the taking my hair out of paper  not to mention the trouble i should have in drawing off my gloves ? "
" who am i ?  ah , true !
i am <unk> , <name> of the fly .
i took thee , just now , from a <unk> coffin inlaid with <name> .
thou wast curiously scented , and labelled as per <unk> .
<unk> sent thee ,  my inspector of cemeteries .
the pantaloons , which thou sayest were made by <unk> , are an excellent pair of linen drawers , and thy <unk> is a shroud of no scanty dimensions . "
" sir ! "
replied the duc , " i am not to be insulted with impunity !  sir !
i shall take the earliest opportunity of avenging this insult !  sir !
you shall hear from me !
in the meantime au revoir ! "
 and the duc was bowing himself out of the <unk> presence , when he was interrupted and brought back by a gentleman in waiting .
hereupon his <name> rubbed his eyes , yawned , shrugged his shoulders , reflected .
having become satisfied of his identity , he took a bird 's eye view of his whereabouts .
the apartment was superb .
even de <unk> pronounced it bien comme il <unk> .
it was not its length nor its breadth ,  but its height  ah , that was appalling !  there was no ceiling  certainly none  but a dense whirling mass of <unk> clouds .
his <name> 's <name> reeled as he glanced upward .
from above , <name> a chain of an unknown blood-red metal  its upper end lost , like the city of boston , <unk> <name> <unk> .
from its nether extremity swung a large <unk> .
the duc knew it to be a <name> ; but from it there poured a light so intense , so still , so terrible , persia never worshipped such  <unk> never imagined such  mussulman never dreamed of such when , drugged with opium , he has tottered to a bed of poppies , his back to the flowers , and his face to the god apollo .
the duc muttered a slight oath , decidedly <unk> .
the corners of the room were rounded into <unk> .
three of these were filled with statues of gigantic proportions .
their beauty was grecian , their deformity egyptian , their tout <unk> french .
in the fourth niche the statue was veiled ; it was not colossal .
but then there was a taper ankle , a <unk> foot .
de <unk> pressed his hand upon his heart , closed his eyes , raised them , and caught his <unk> majesty  in a blush .
but the paintings !  <unk> !
<unk> !
<unk> !  a thousand and the same !
and <unk> has beheld them !
yes , <unk> has been here , for did he not paint the  ?
and was he not consequently damned ?
the paintings  the paintings !
o luxury !
o love !  who , gazing on those forbidden beauties , shall have eyes for the dainty devices of the golden frames that <unk> , like stars , the <name> and the porphyry walls ?
but the duc 's heart is fainting within him .
he is not , however , as you suppose , dizzy with magnificence , nor drunk with the ecstatic breath of those innumerable <unk> .
c'est <unk> que de toutes ces <unk> il a <unk> <unk>  mais !
the duc de <unk> is terror-stricken ; for , through the lurid vista which a single <unk> window is affording , lo !
gleams the most ghastly of all fires !
<name> <unk> duc !
he could not help imagining that the glorious , the voluptuous , the <unk> melodies which pervaded that hall , as they passed filtered and <unk> through the <unk> of the enchanted <unk> , were the <unk> and the howlings of the hopeless and the damned !
and there , too !  there !  upon the ottoman !  who could he be ?  he , the <unk>  no , the deity  who sat as if carved in marble , et qui <unk> , with his pale countenance , si <unk> ?
mais il <unk> <unk>  that is to say , a frenchman never <unk> outright .
besides , his <name> hated a scene  de <unk> is himself again .
there were some <unk> upon a table  some points also .
the duc <unk> .
he measures two points , and , with a <name> inimitable , offers his majesty the choice .
<unk> !
his majesty does not fence !
mais il <unk> !  how happy a thought !  but his <name> had always an excellent memory .
he had dipped in the " diable " of abbe <unk> .
therein it is said " que <name> diable <unk> pas <unk> <name> <unk> <unk> . "
but the chances  the chances !
true  desperate : but scarcely more desperate than the duc .
besides , was he not in the secret ?  had he not skimmed over pere <name> <unk> ?  was he not a member of the club <unk> ?
" si je <unk> , " said he , " je serai deux <unk> <unk>  i shall be doubly <unk>  <unk> tout !
( here his <name> shrugged his shoulders . )
si je <unk> , je <unk> a <unk> <unk>  que <name> <unk> <unk> <unk> ! "
his <name> was all care , all attention  his majesty all confidence .
a spectator would have thought of <name> and <name> .
his <name> thought of his game .
his majesty did not think ; he shuffled .
the duc cut .
the cards were dealt .
the trump is turned  it is  it is  the king !
no  it was the <name> .
his majesty cursed her masculine <unk> .
de <unk> placed his hand upon his heart .
they play .
the duc counts .
the hand is out .
his majesty counts heavily , smiles , and is taking wine .
the duc slips a card .
" c'est a vous a faire , " said his majesty , cutting .
his <name> bowed , dealt , and arose from the table en <unk> <name> roi .
his majesty looked chagrined .
had <name> not been <name> , he would have been <unk> ; and the duc assured his antagonist in taking leave , " que <unk> <unk> <unk> de <unk> il <unk> point <unk> <unk> <name> diable . "
the oblong box .
some years ago , i engaged passage from charleston , s. c , to the city of new york , in the fine <unk> " independence , " captain hardy .
we were to sail on the fifteenth of the month ( <name> ) , weather permitting ; and on the fourteenth , i went on board to arrange some matters in my state-room .
i found that we were to have a great many passengers , including a more than usual number of ladies .
on the list were several of my acquaintances , and among other names , i was rejoiced to see that of mr. <name> <name> , a young artist , for whom i entertained feelings of warm friendship .
he had been with me a <unk> at c  university , where we were very much together .
he had the ordinary temperament of genius , and was a compound of <unk> , sensibility , and enthusiasm .
to these qualities he united the warmest and truest heart which ever beat in a human bosom .
i observed that his name was <unk> upon three <unk> ; and , upon again referring to the list of passengers , i found that he had engaged passage for himself , wife , and two sisters  his own .
the <unk> were sufficiently roomy , and each had two berths , one above the other .
these berths , to be sure , were so exceedingly narrow as to be insufficient for more than one person ; still , i could not comprehend why there were three <unk> for these four persons .
i was , just at that epoch , in one of those moody frames of mind which make a man abnormally inquisitive about trifles : and i confess , with shame , that i busied myself in a variety of <unk> and preposterous conjectures about this matter of the supernumerary state-room .
it was no business of mine , to be sure , but with none the less pertinacity did i occupy myself in attempts to resolve the enigma .
at last i reached a conclusion which wrought in me great wonder why i had not arrived at it before .
" it is a servant of course , " i said ; " what a fool i am , not sooner to have thought of so obvious a solution ! "
and then i again repaired to the list  but here i saw distinctly that no servant was to come with the party , although , in fact , it had been the original design to bring one  for the words " and servant " had been first written and then <unk> .
" oh , extra baggage , to be sure , " i now said to myself  " something he wishes not to be put in the hold  something to be kept under his own eye  ah , i have it  a painting or so  and this is what he has been bargaining about with <unk> , the italian jew . "
this idea satisfied me , and i dismissed my curiosity for the <unk> .
<name> 's two sisters i knew very well , and most amiable and clever girls they were .
his wife he had newly married , and i had never yet seen her .
he had often talked about her in my presence , however , and in his usual style of enthusiasm .
he described her as of surpassing beauty , wit , and accomplishment .
i was , therefore , quite anxious to make her acquaintance .
on the day in which i visited the ship ( the fourteenth ) , <name> and party were also to visit it  so the captain informed me  and i waited on board an hour longer than i had designed , in <name> of being presented to the bride , but then an apology came .
" mrs. w. was a little <unk> , and would decline coming on board until to-morrow , at the hour of sailing . "
the morrow having arrived , i was going from my hotel to the wharf , when captain hardy met me and said that , " owing to circumstances " ( a stupid but convenient phrase ) , " he rather thought the <unk> ' would not sail for a day or two , and that when all was ready , he would send up and let me know . "
this i thought strange , for there was a stiff southerly breeze ; but as " the circumstances " were not forthcoming , although i pumped for them with much perseverance , i had nothing to do but to return home and digest my impatience at leisure .
i did not receive the expected message from the captain for nearly a week .
it came at length , however , and i immediately went on board .
the ship was crowded with passengers , and every thing was in the bustle attendant upon making sail .
<name> 's party arrived in about ten minutes after myself .
there were the two sisters , the bride , and the artist  the latter in one of his customary fits of moody <unk> .
i was too well used to these , however , to pay them any special attention .
he did not even introduce me to his wife  this courtesy <unk> , per force , upon his sister <name>  a very sweet and intelligent girl , who , in a few hurried words , made us acquainted .
mrs. <name> had been closely veiled ; and when she raised her veil , in acknowledging my bow , i confess that i was very profoundly astonished .
i should have been much more so , however , had not long experience advised me not to trust , with too implicit a reliance , the enthusiastic descriptions of my friend , the artist , when indulging in comments upon the loveliness of woman .
when beauty was the theme , i well knew with what facility he soared into the regions of the purely ideal .
the truth is , i could not help regarding mrs. <name> as a decidedly <unk> woman .
if not positively ugly , she was not , i think , very far from it .
she was dressed , however , in exquisite taste  and then i had no doubt that she had captivated my friend 's heart by the more enduring graces of the intellect and soul .
she said very few words , and passed at once into her state-room with mr. w. my old <unk> now returned .
there was no servant  that was a settled point .
i looked , therefore , for the extra baggage .
after some delay , a cart arrived at the wharf , with an oblong pine box , which was every thing that seemed to be expected .
immediately upon its arrival we made sail , and in a short time were safely over the bar and standing out to sea .
the box in question was , as i say , oblong .
it was about six feet in length by two and a half in breadth ; i observed it attentively , and like to be precise .
now this shape was peculiar ; and no sooner had i seen it , than i took credit to myself for the accuracy of my guessing .
i had reached the conclusion , it <name> be remembered , that the extra baggage of my friend , the artist , would prove to be pictures , or at least a picture ; for i knew he had been for several weeks in conference with <unk> :  and now here was a box , which , from its shape , could possibly contain nothing in the world but a copy of <name> 's " last supper ; " and a copy of this very " last supper , " done by <unk> the younger , at <name> , i had known , for some time , to be in the possession of <unk> .
this point , therefore , i considered as sufficiently settled .
i chuckled excessively when i thought of my <unk> .
it was the first time i had ever known <name> to keep from me any of his <unk> secrets ; but here he evidently intended to steal a march upon me , and smuggle a fine picture to new york , under my very nose ; expecting me to know nothing of the matter .
i resolved to <unk> him well , now and hereafter .
one thing , however , annoyed me not a little .
the box did not go into the extra state-room .
it was deposited in <name> 's own ; and there , too , it remained , occupying very nearly the whole of the floor  no doubt to the exceeding discomfort of the artist and his wife ;  this the more especially as the tar or paint with which it was lettered in sprawling capitals , emitted a strong , disagreeable , and , to my fancy , a peculiarly disgusting odor .
on the lid were painted the words  " mrs. <name> <name> , albany , new york .
charge of <name> <name> , esq .
this side up .
to be handled with care . "
now , i was aware that mrs. <name> <name> , of albany , was the artist 's wife 's mother ,  but then i looked upon the whole address as a <unk> , intended especially for myself .
i made up my mind , of course , that the box and contents would never get farther north than the studio of my <unk> friend , in chambers street , new york .
for the first three or four days we had fine weather , although the wind was dead ahead ; having chopped round to the northward , immediately upon our losing sight of the coast .
the passengers were , consequently , in high spirits and disposed to be social .
i must except , however , <name> and his sisters , who behaved stiffly , and , i could not help thinking , <unk> to the rest of the party .
<name> 's conduct i did not so much regard .
he was gloomy , even beyond his usual habit  in fact he was morose  but in him i was prepared for eccentricity .
for the sisters , however , i could make no excuse .
they secluded themselves in their staterooms during the greater part of the passage , and absolutely refused , although i repeatedly urged them , to hold communication with any person on board .
mrs. <name> herself was far more agreeable .
that is to say , she was <unk> ; and to be <unk> is no slight recommendation at sea .
she became excessively intimate with most of the ladies ; and , to my profound astonishment , evinced no equivocal disposition to <unk> with the men .
she amused us all very much .
i say " amused "  and scarcely know how to explain myself .
the truth is , i soon found that mrs. w. was far oftener laughed at than with .
the gentlemen said little about her ; but the ladies , in a little while , pronounced her " a good-hearted thing , rather indifferent looking , totally uneducated , and decidedly vulgar . "
the great wonder was , how <name> had been <unk> into such a match .
wealth was the general solution  but this i knew to be no solution at all ; for <name> had told me that she neither brought him a dollar nor had any expectations from any source whatever .
" he had married , " he said , " for love , and for love only ; and his bride was far more than worthy of his love . "
when i thought of these expressions , on the part of my friend , i confess that i felt <unk> puzzled .
could it be possible that he was taking leave of his senses ?
what else could i think ?
he , so refined , so intellectual , so fastidious , with so exquisite a perception of the <unk> , and so keen an appreciation of the beautiful !
to be sure , the <name> seemed especially fond of him  particularly so in his absence  when she made herself ridiculous by frequent quotations of what had been said by her " beloved husband , mr .
<name> . "
the word " husband " seemed forever  to use one of her own delicate expressions  forever " on the tip of her tongue . "
in the meantime , it was observed by all on board , that he avoided her in the most pointed manner , and , for the most part , shut himself up alone in his state-room , where , in fact , he might have been said to live altogether , leaving his wife at full <name> to amuse herself as she thought best , in the public society of the main cabin .
my conclusion , from what i saw and heard , was , that , the artist , by some unaccountable freak of fate , or perhaps in some fit of enthusiastic and fanciful passion , had been induced to unite himself with a person altogether beneath him , and that the natural result , entire and speedy disgust , had ensued .
i pitied him from the bottom of my heart  but could not , for that reason , quite forgive his <unk> in the matter of the " last supper . "
for this i resolved to have my revenge .
one day he came upon deck , and , taking his arm as had been my wont , i sauntered with him backward and forward .
his gloom , however ( which i considered quite natural under the circumstances ) , seemed entirely <unk> .
he said little , and that moodily , and with evident effort .
i ventured a jest or two , and he made a sickening attempt at a smile .
poor fellow !  as i thought of his wife , i wondered that he could have heart to put on even the semblance of mirth .
i determined to commence a series of covert insinuations , or <unk> , about the oblong box  just to let him perceive , gradually , that i was not altogether the butt , or victim , of his little bit of pleasant <unk> .
my first observation was by way of opening a masked battery .
i said something about the " peculiar shape of that box , " and , as i spoke the words , i smiled knowingly , winked , and touched him gently with my forefinger in the ribs .
the manner in which <name> received this harmless <unk> convinced me , at once , that he was mad .
at first he stared at me as if he found it impossible to comprehend the <unk> of my remark ; but as its point seemed slowly to make its way into his <name> , his eyes , in the same proportion , seemed protruding from their sockets .
then he grew very red  then hideously pale  then , as if highly amused with what i had <unk> , he began a loud and boisterous laugh , which , to my astonishment , he kept up , with gradually increasing vigor , for ten minutes or more .
in conclusion , he fell flat and heavily upon the deck .
when i ran to uplift him , to all appearance he was dead .
i called assistance , and , with much difficulty , we brought him to himself .
upon reviving he spoke <unk> for some time .
at length we bled him and put him to bed .
the next morning he was quite recovered , so far as regarded his mere bodily health .
of his mind i say nothing , of course .
i avoided him during the rest of the passage , by advice of the captain , who seemed to coincide with me altogether in my views of his insanity , but cautioned me to say nothing on this head to any person on board .
several circumstances occurred immediately after this fit of <name> which contributed to heighten the curiosity with which i was already possessed .
among other things , this : i had been nervous  drank too much strong green tea , and slept ill at night  in fact , for two nights i could not be properly said to sleep at all .
now , my state-room opened into the main cabin , or dining-room , as did those of all the single men on board .
<name> 's three rooms were in the <unk> , which was separated from the main one by a slight sliding door , never locked even at night .
as we were almost constantly on a wind , and the breeze was not a little stiff , the ship <unk> to leeward very considerably ; and whenever her starboard side was to leeward , the sliding door between the cabins slid open , and so remained , nobody taking the trouble to get up and shut it .
but my berth was in such a position , that when my own state-room door was open , as well as the sliding door in question ( and my own door was always open on account of the heat , ) i could see into the <unk> quite distinctly , and just at that portion of it , too , where were situated the <unk> of mr. <name> .
well , during two nights ( not consecutive ) while i lay awake , i clearly saw mrs. w. , about eleven o'clock upon each night , steal cautiously from the state-room of mr. w. , and enter the extra room , where she remained until daybreak , when she was called by her husband and went back .
that they were virtually separated was clear .
they had separate apartments  no doubt in contemplation of a more permanent divorce ; and here , after all i thought was the mystery of the extra state-room .
there was another circumstance , too , which interested me much .
during the two wakeful nights in question , and immediately after the disappearance of mrs. <name> into the extra state-room , i was attracted by certain singular cautious , subdued noises in that of her husband .
after listening to them for some time , with thoughtful attention , i at length succeeded perfectly in translating their import .
they were sounds occasioned by the artist in prying open the oblong box , by means of a chisel and mallet  the latter being apparently muffled , or <unk> , by some soft woollen or cotton substance in which its head was enveloped .
in this manner i fancied i could distinguish the precise moment when he fairly disengaged the lid  also , that i could determine when he removed it altogether , and when he deposited it upon the lower berth in his room ; this latter point i knew , for example , by certain slight taps which the lid made in striking against the wooden edges of the berth , as he endeavored to lay it down very gently  there being no room for it on the floor .
after this there was a dead stillness , and i heard nothing more , upon either occasion , until nearly daybreak ; unless , perhaps , i may mention a low sobbing , or murmuring sound , so very much suppressed as to be nearly inaudible  if , indeed , the whole of this latter noise were not rather produced by my own imagination .
i say it seemed to resemble sobbing or sighing  but , of course , it could not have been either .
i rather think it was a ringing in my own ears .
mr. <name> , no doubt , according to custom , was merely giving the rein to one of his <unk>  indulging in one of his fits of artistic enthusiasm .
he had opened his oblong box , in order to feast his eyes on the pictorial treasure within .
there was nothing in this , however , to make him sob .
i repeat , therefore , that it must have been simply a freak of my own fancy , <unk> by good captain hardy 's green tea .
just before <name> , on each of the two nights of which i speak , i distinctly heard mr. <name> replace the lid upon the oblong box , and force the nails into their old places by means of the muffled mallet .
having done this , he issued from his state-room , fully dressed , and proceeded to call mrs. w. from hers .
we had been at sea seven days , and were now off cape <unk> , when there came a tremendously heavy blow from the southwest .
we were , in a measure , prepared for it , however , as the weather had been holding out threats for some time .
every thing was made snug , <unk> and aloft ; and as the wind steadily freshened , we lay to , at length , under <unk> and <unk> , both <unk> .
in this trim we rode safely enough for forty-eight hours  the ship proving herself an excellent <unk> in many respects , and shipping no water of any consequence .
at the end of this period , however , the <name> had freshened into a hurricane , and our after  sail split into ribbons , bringing us so much in the trough of the water that we shipped several prodigious seas , one immediately after the other .
by this accident we lost three men overboard with the <unk> , and nearly the whole of the larboard bulwarks .
scarcely had we recovered our senses , before the <unk> went into shreds , when we got up a storm stay  sail and with this did pretty well for some hours , the ship heading the sea much more steadily than before .
the <name> still held on , however , and we saw no signs of its abating .
the rigging was found to be <unk> , and greatly strained ; and on the third day of the blow , about five in the afternoon , our <unk> , in a heavy lurch to windward , went by the board .
for an hour or more , we tried in vain to get rid of it , on account of the prodigious rolling of the ship ; and , before we had succeeded , the carpenter came aft and announced four feet of water in the hold .
to add to our dilemma , we found the pumps choked and nearly useless .
all was now confusion and despair  but an effort was made to lighten the ship by throwing overboard as much of her cargo as could be reached , and by cutting away the two masts that remained .
this we at last accomplished  but we were still unable to do any thing at the pumps ; and , in the meantime , the leak gained on us very fast .
at sundown , the <name> had sensibly diminished in violence , and as the sea went down with it , we still entertained faint hopes of saving ourselves in the boats .
at eight p. m. , the clouds broke away to windward , and we had the advantage of a full moon  a piece of good fortune which served wonderfully to cheer our drooping spirits .
after incredible labor we succeeded , at length , in getting the <unk> over the side without material accident , and into this we crowded the whole of the crew and most of the passengers .
this party made off immediately , and , after undergoing much suffering , finally arrived , in safety , at <unk> inlet , on the third day after the wreck .
fourteen passengers , with the captain , remained on board , resolving to trust their fortunes to the jolly-boat at the stern .
we lowered it without difficulty , although it was only by a miracle that we prevented it from <unk> as it touched the water .
it contained , when afloat , the captain and his wife , mr. <name> and party , a mexican officer , wife , four children , and myself , with a negro valet .
we had no room , of course , for any thing except a few positively necessary instruments , some provisions , and the clothes upon our backs .
no one had thought of even attempting to save any thing more .
what must have been the astonishment of all , then , when having proceeded a few fathoms from the ship , mr. <name> stood up in the <unk> , and coolly demanded of captain hardy that the boat should be put back for the purpose of taking in his oblong box !
" sit down , mr. <name> , " replied the captain , somewhat sternly , " you <name> <unk> us if you do not sit quite still .
our <unk> is almost in the water now . "
" the box ! "
<unk> mr. <name> , still standing  " the box , i say !
captain hardy , you can not , you <name> not refuse me .
its weight <name> be but a trifle  it is nothing  mere nothing .
by the mother who bore you  for the love of heaven  by your <name> of salvation , i implore you to put back for the box ! "
the captain , for a moment , seemed touched by the <name> appeal of the artist , but he regained his stern composure , and merely said : " mr. <name> , you are mad .
i can not listen to you .
sit down , i say , or you <name> swamp the boat .
stay  hold him  seize him !  he is about to spring overboard !
there  i knew it  he is over ! "
as the captain said this , mr. <name> , in fact , sprang from the boat , and , as we were yet in the <name> of the wreck , succeeded , by almost superhuman exertion , in getting hold of a rope which <name> from the <unk> .
in another moment he was on board , and rushing frantically down into the cabin .
in the meantime , we had been swept astern of the ship , and being quite out of her <name> , were at the <name> of the tremendous sea which was still running .
we made a determined effort to put back , but our little boat was like a feather in the breath of the tempest .
we saw at a glance that the doom of the unfortunate artist was sealed .
as our distance from the wreck rapidly increased , the madman ( for as such only could we regard him ) was seen to emerge from the companion  way , up which by dint of strength that appeared gigantic , he dragged , bodily , the oblong box .
while we gazed in the extremity of astonishment , he passed , rapidly , several turns of a <unk> rope , first around the box and then around his body .
in another instant both body and box were in the sea  disappearing suddenly , at once and forever .
we lingered awhile sadly upon our oars , with our eyes riveted upon the spot .
at length we pulled away .
the silence remained unbroken for an hour .
finally , i hazarded a remark .
" did you observe , captain , how suddenly they sank ?
was not that an exceedingly singular thing ?
i confess that i entertained some feeble <name> of his final deliverance , when i saw him lash himself to the box , and commit himself to the sea . "
" they sank as a matter of course , " replied the captain , " and that like a shot .
they <name> soon rise again , however  but not till the salt melts . "
" the salt ! "
i ejaculated .
" hush ! "
said the captain , pointing to the wife and sisters of the deceased .
" we must talk of these things at some more appropriate time . "
we suffered much , and made a narrow escape , but fortune befriended us , as well as our mates in the <unk> .
we landed , in fine , more dead than alive , after four days of intense distress , upon the beach opposite <unk> island .
we remained here a week , were not <unk> by the <unk> , and at length obtained a passage to new york .
about a month after the loss of the " independence , " i happened to meet captain hardy in broadway .
our conversation turned , naturally , upon the disaster , and especially upon the sad fate of poor <name> .
i thus learned the following particulars .
the artist had engaged passage for himself , wife , two sisters and a servant .
his wife was , indeed , as she had been represented , a most lovely , and most accomplished woman .
on the morning of the fourteenth of <name> ( the day in which i first visited the ship ) , the <name> suddenly sickened and died .
the young husband was frantic with grief  but circumstances imperatively forbade the <unk> his voyage to new york .
it was necessary to take to her mother the corpse of his adored wife , and , on the other hand , the universal prejudice which would prevent his doing so openly was well known .
nine-tenths of the passengers would have abandoned the ship rather than take passage with a dead body .
in this dilemma , captain hardy arranged that the corpse , being first partially embalmed , and packed , with a large quantity of salt , in a box of suitable dimensions , should be conveyed on board as merchandise .
nothing was to be said of the <name> 's decease ; and , as it was well understood that mr. <name> had engaged passage for his wife , it became necessary that some person should <unk> her during the voyage .
this the deceased <unk> was easily prevailed on to do .
the extra state-room , originally engaged for this girl during her mistress ' life , was now merely retained .
in this state-room the <unk> , slept , of course , every night .
in the daytime she performed , to the best of her ability , the part of her mistress  whose person , it had been carefully ascertained , was unknown to any of the passengers on board .
my own mistake arose , naturally enough , through too careless , too inquisitive , and too impulsive a temperament .
but of late , it is a rare thing that i sleep soundly at night .
there is a countenance which haunts me , turn as i <name> .
there is an hysterical laugh which <name> forever ring within my ears .
loss of breath o breathe not , etc .
 moore 's melodies the most notorious <unk> must in the end yield to the untiring courage of philosophy  as the most stubborn city to the ceaseless vigilance of an enemy .
<unk> , as we have it in holy writings , lay three years before samaria ; yet it fell .
<unk>  see <unk>  maintained himself seven in nineveh ; but to no purpose .
<name> expired at the close of the second <unk> ; and <unk> , as <unk> declares upon his honour as a gentleman , opened at last her gates to <unk> , after having barred them for the fifth part of a century ... . " thou wretch !  thou vixen !  thou <unk> ! "
said i to my wife on the morning after our wedding ; " thou witch !  thou <unk> !  thou <unk>  thou sink of iniquity !  thou <unk> <unk> of all that is abominable !  thou  thou " here standing upon tiptoe , seizing her by the throat , and placing my mouth close to her ear , i was preparing to launch forth a new and more decided epithet of <unk> , which should not fail , if ejaculated , to convince her of her insignificance , when to my extreme horror and astonishment i discovered that i had lost my breath .
the phrases " i am out of breath , " " i have lost my breath , " etc. , are often enough repeated in common conversation ; but it had never occurred to me that the terrible accident of which i speak could <unk> <unk> and actually happen !
imagine  that is if you have a fanciful turn  imagine , i say , my wonder  my consternation  my despair !
there is a good genius , however , which has never entirely deserted me .
in my most ungovernable moods i still retain a sense of propriety , et <name> <unk> des passions me <unk>  as lord <unk> in the " <name> " says it did him  a la <unk> veritable .
although i could not at first precisely ascertain to what degree the occurrence had affected me , i determined at all events to conceal the matter from my wife , until further experience should discover to me the extent of this my unheard of calamity .
altering my countenance , therefore , in a moment , from its <unk> and distorted appearance , to an expression of arch and <unk> <unk> , i gave my <name> a <name> on the one cheek , and a kiss on the other , and without saying one syllable ( furies !
i could not ) , left her astonished at my <unk> , as i <unk> out of the room in a pas de <unk> .
behold me then safely <unk> in my private boudoir , a fearful instance of the ill consequences attending upon <unk>  alive , with the qualifications of the dead  dead , with the propensities of the living  an anomaly on the face of the earth  being very calm , yet breathless .
yes !
breathless .
i am serious in asserting that my breath was entirely gone .
i could not have stirred with it a feather if my life had been at issue , or <unk> even the delicacy of a mirror .
hard fate !  yet there was some <unk> to the first overwhelming paroxysm of my sorrow .
i found , upon trial , that the powers of utterance which , upon my inability to proceed in the conversation with my wife , i then concluded to be totally destroyed , were in fact only partially impeded , and i discovered that had i , at that interesting crisis , dropped my voice to a singularly deep guttural , i might still have continued to her the communication of my sentiments ; this pitch of voice ( the guttural ) depending , i find , not upon the current of the breath , but upon a certain spasmodic action of the muscles of the throat .
throwing myself upon a chair , i remained for some time absorbed in meditation .
my reflections , be sure , were of no <unk> kind .
a thousand vague and <unk> fancies took possession of my soul  and even the idea of suicide flitted across my <name> ; but it is a trait in the perversity of human nature to reject the obvious and the ready , for the <unk> and equivocal .
thus i shuddered at <unk> as the most decided of atrocities while the <unk> cat purred strenuously upon the rug , and the very water dog <unk> <unk> under the table , each taking to itself much merit for the strength of its lungs , and all obviously done in derision of my own <unk> incapacity .
oppressed with a tumult of vague hopes and fears , i at length heard the footsteps of my wife descending the staircase .
being now assured of her absence , i returned with a palpitating heart to the scene of my disaster .
carefully locking the door on the inside , i commenced a vigorous search .
it was possible , i thought , that , concealed in some obscure corner , or lurking in some closet or drawer , might be found the lost object of my inquiry .
it might have a <unk>  it might even have a tangible form .
most philosophers , upon many points of philosophy , are still very <unk> .
<name> godwin , however , says in his " <unk> , " that " invisible things are the only realities , " and this , all <name> allow , is a case in point .
i would have the judicious reader pause before accusing such <unk> of an undue <unk> of absurdity .
<unk> , it <name> be remembered , maintained that snow is black , and this i have since found to be the case .
long and earnestly did i continue the investigation : but the contemptible reward of my industry and perseverance proved to be only a set of false teeth , two pair of hips , an eye , and a bundle of <unk> from mr. <unk> to my wife .
i might as well here observe that this confirmation of my <name> 's partiality for mr. w. occasioned me little uneasiness .
that mrs. <unk> should admire anything so dissimilar to myself was a natural and necessary evil .
i am , it is well known , of a robust and <unk> appearance , and at the same time somewhat diminutive in stature .
what wonder , then , that the <unk> tenuity of my acquaintance , and his altitude , which has grown into a proverb , should have met with all due estimation in the eyes of mrs. <unk> .
but to return .
my exertions , as i have before said , proved fruitless .
closet after closet  drawer after drawer  corner after corner  were scrutinized to no purpose .
at one time , however , i thought myself sure of my prize , having , in rummaging a <unk> , accidentally demolished a bottle of <unk> 's oil of archangels  which , as an agreeable perfume , i here take the <name> of recommending .
with a heavy heart i returned to my boudoir  there to ponder upon some method of <unk> my wife 's penetration , until i could make arrangements prior to my leaving the country , for to this i had already made up my mind .
in a foreign climate , being unknown , i might , with some probability of success , endeavor to conceal my unhappy calamity  a calamity calculated , even more than <unk> , to <unk> the affections of the multitude , and to draw down upon the wretch the <unk> indignation of the virtuous and the happy .
i was not long in hesitation .
being naturally quick , i committed to memory the entire tragedy of " <unk> . "
i had the good fortune to recollect that in the <unk> of this drama , or at least of such portion of it as is allotted to the hero , the tones of voice in which i found myself deficient were altogether unnecessary , and the deep guttural was expected to reign monotonously throughout .
i practised for some time by the borders of a well frequented marsh ;  herein , however , having no reference to a similar proceeding of demosthenes , but from a design peculiarly and conscientiously my own .
thus armed at all points , i determined to make my wife believe that i was suddenly smitten with a passion for the stage .
in this , i succeeded to a miracle ; and to every question or suggestion found myself at <name> to reply in my most <unk> and sepulchral tones with some passage from the tragedy  any portion of which , as i soon took great pleasure in observing , would apply equally well to any particular subject .
it is not to be supposed , however , that in the delivery of such passages i was found at all deficient in the looking <unk>  the showing my teeth  the working my knees  the shuffling my feet  or in any of those <unk> graces which are now justly considered the characteristics of a popular performer .
to be sure they spoke of confining me in a <unk>  but , good god !
they never suspected me of having lost my breath .
having at length put my affairs in order , i took my seat very early one morning in the mail stage for  , giving it to be understood , among my acquaintances , that business of the last importance required my immediate personal attendance in that city .
the coach was crammed to <unk> ; but in the uncertain twilight the features of my companions could not be distinguished .
without making any effectual resistance , i suffered myself to be placed between two gentlemen of colossal dimensions ; while a third , of a size larger , requesting pardon for the <name> he was about to take , threw himself upon my body at full length , and falling asleep in an instant , drowned all my guttural ejaculations for relief , in a snore which would have put to blush the <unk> of the bull of <unk> .
happily the state of my respiratory faculties rendered suffocation an accident entirely out of the question .
as , however , the day broke more distinctly in our approach to the outskirts of the city , my <unk> , arising and adjusting his <unk> , thanked me in a very friendly manner for my civility .
seeing that i remained motionless ( all my limbs were dislocated and my head twisted on one side ) , his apprehensions began to be excited ; and arousing the rest of the passengers , he communicated , in a very decided manner , his opinion that a dead man had been <unk> upon them during the night for a living and responsible <unk> ; here giving me a thump on the right eye , by way of demonstrating the truth of his suggestion .
hereupon all , one after another ( there were nine in company ) , believed it their duty to pull me by the ear .
a young practising physician , too , having applied a <unk> to my mouth , and found me without breath , the assertion of my <unk> was pronounced a true <name> ; and the whole party expressed a determination to endure <unk> no such <unk> for the future , and to proceed no farther with any such carcasses for the present .
i was here , accordingly , thrown out at the sign of the " crow " ( by which tavern the coach happened to be passing ) , without meeting with any farther accident than the breaking of both my arms , under the left hind wheel of the vehicle .
i must besides do the driver the justice to state that he did not forget to throw after me the largest of my trunks , which , unfortunately falling on my head , fractured my skull in a manner at once interesting and extraordinary .
the landlord of the " crow , " who is a hospitable man , finding that my trunk contained sufficient to <unk> him for any little trouble he might take in my behalf , sent forthwith for a surgeon of his acquaintance , and delivered me to his care with a <name> and receipt for ten dollars .
the purchaser took me to his apartments and commenced operations immediately .
having cut off my ears , however , he discovered signs of animation .
he now rang the <name> , and sent for a neighboring apothecary with whom to consult in the emergency .
in case of his suspicions with regard to my existence proving ultimately correct , he , in the meantime , made an <unk> in my stomach , and removed several of my viscera for private dissection .
the apothecary had an idea that i was actually dead .
this idea i endeavored to <unk> , kicking and plunging with all my might , and making the most furious <unk>  for the operations of the surgeon had , in a measure , restored me to the possession of my faculties .
all , however , was attributed to the effects of a new galvanic battery , wherewith the apothecary , who is really a man of information , performed several curious experiments , in which , from my personal share in their fulfillment , i could not help feeling deeply interested .
it was a course of mortification to me , nevertheless , that although i made several attempts at conversation , my powers of speech were so entirely in abeyance , that i could not even open my mouth ; much less , then , make reply to some ingenious but fanciful theories of which , under other circumstances , my minute acquaintance with the <unk> pathology would have afforded me a ready <unk> .
not being able to arrive at a conclusion , the <unk> <unk> me for farther examination .
i was taken up into a <name> ; and the <unk> <name> having accommodated me with drawers and stockings , the surgeon himself fastened my hands , and tied up my jaws with a pocket-handkerchief  then bolted the door on the outside as he hurried to his dinner , leaving me alone to silence and to meditation .
i now discovered to my extreme delight that i could have spoken had not my mouth been tied up with the pocket-handkerchief .
consoling myself with this reflection , i was mentally repeating some passages of the " omnipresence of the deity , " as is my custom before <unk> myself to sleep , when two cats , of a greedy and <unk> turn , entering at a hole in the wall , leaped up with a flourish a la <unk> , and alighting opposite one another on my visage , betook themselves to <unk> contention for the paltry consideration of my nose .
but , as the loss of his ears proved the means of elevating to the throne of <name> , the magian or <unk> of persia , and as the cutting off his nose gave zopyrus possession of babylon , so the loss of a few ounces of my countenance proved the salvation of my body .
aroused by the pain , and burning with indignation , i burst , at a single effort , the fastenings and the bandage .
stalking across the room i cast a glance of contempt at the <unk> , and throwing open the sash to their extreme horror and disappointment , precipitated myself , very <unk> , from the window .
this moment passing from the city jail to the scaffold erected for his execution in the suburbs .
his extreme infirmity and long continued ill health had obtained him the privilege of remaining <unk> ; and <unk> in his gallows costume  one very similar to my own ,  he lay at full length in the bottom of the <unk> 's cart ( which happened to be under the windows of the surgeon at the moment of my precipitation ) without any other guard than the driver , who was asleep , and two recruits of the sixth infantry , who were drunk .
as ill-luck would have it , i <unk> upon my feet within the vehicle .
immediately , he bolted out behind , and turning down an alley , was out of sight in the twinkling of an eye .
the recruits , aroused by the bustle , could not exactly comprehend the merits of the transaction .
seeing , however , a man , the precise counterpart of the <unk> , standing upright in the cart before their eyes , they were of ( so they expressed themselves , ) and , having communicated this opinion to one another , they took each a <unk> , and then knocked me down with the <unk> of their muskets .
it was not long ere we arrived at the place of destination .
of course nothing could be said in my defence .
hanging was my inevitable fate .
i resigned myself thereto with a feeling half stupid , half <unk> .
being little of a <unk> , i had all the sentiments of a dog .
the <unk> , however , adjusted the noose about my neck .
the drop fell .
i forbear to <unk> my sensations upon the gallows ; although here , undoubtedly , i could speak to the point , and it is a topic upon which nothing has been well said .
in fact , to write upon such a theme it is necessary to have been hanged .
every author should confine himself to matters of experience .
thus <name> <name> composed a treatise upon getting drunk .
i may just mention , however , that die i did not .
my body was , but i had no breath to be , suspended ; and but for the knot under my left ear ( which had the feel of a military stock ) i dare say that i should have experienced very little inconvenience .
as for the jerk given to my neck upon the falling of the drop , it merely proved a <unk> to the twist afforded me by the fat gentleman in the coach .
for good reasons , however , i did my best to give the crowd the worth of their trouble .
my convulsions were said to be extraordinary .
my spasms it would have been difficult to beat .
the populace <unk> .
several gentlemen swooned ; and a multitude of ladies were carried home in hysterics .
<unk> availed himself of the opportunity to <unk> , from a sketch taken upon the spot , his admirable painting of the " <unk> flayed alive . "
when i had afforded sufficient amusement , it was thought proper to remove my body from the gallows ;  this the more especially as the real culprit had in the meantime been <unk> and recognized , a fact which i was so unlucky as not to know .
much sympathy was , of course , exercised in my behalf , and as no one made claim to my corpse , it was ordered that i should be interred in a public vault .
here , after due interval , i was deposited .
the sexton departed , and i was left alone .
a line of <unk> 's " <unk> "  death 's a good fellow and keeps open house  struck me at that moment as a palpable lie .
i knocked off , however , the lid of my coffin , and stepped out .
the place was dreadfully dreary and damp , and i became troubled with <unk> .
by way of amusement , i felt my way among the numerous coffins ranged in order around .
i lifted them down , one by one , and breaking open their lids , busied myself in speculations about the mortality within .
" this , " i <unk> , tumbling over a carcass , puffy , bloated , and <unk>  " this has been , no doubt , in every sense of the word , an unhappy  an unfortunate man .
it has been his terrible lot not to walk but to <unk>  to pass through life not like a human being , but like an elephant  not like a man , but like a rhinoceros .
" his attempts at getting on have been mere <unk> , and his <unk> proceedings a palpable failure .
taking a step forward , it has been his misfortune to take two toward the right , and three toward the left .
his studies have been confined to the poetry of <unk> .
he can have no idea of the wonder of a <unk> .
to him a pas de <unk> has been an abstract <name> .
he has never ascended the summit of a hill .
he has never viewed from any steeple the glories of a metropolis .
heat has been his mortal enemy .
in the <unk> his days have been the days of a dog .
therein , he has dreamed of flames and suffocation  of mountains upon mountains  of <unk> upon <unk> .
he was short of breath  to say all in a word , he was short of breath .
he thought it extravagant to play upon wind instruments .
he was the inventor of <unk> fans , <unk> , and <unk> .
he patronized du <unk> the <unk> , and he died miserably in attempting to smoke a cigar .
his was a case in which i feel a deep interest  a lot in which i sincerely sympathize .
" but here , "  said i  " here "  and i dragged <unk> from its receptacle a gaunt , tall and <unk> form , whose remarkable appearance struck me with a sense of unwelcome familiarity  " here is a wretch entitled to no earthly commiseration . "
thus saying , in order to obtain a more distinct view of my subject , i applied my thumb and forefinger to its nose , and causing it to assume a sitting position upon the ground , held it thus , at the length of my arm , while i continued my soliloquy .
" entitled , " i repeated , " to no earthly commiseration .
who indeed would think of <unk> a shadow ?
besides , has he not had his full share of the blessings of mortality ?
he was the originator of tall monuments  <unk>  <unk>  <unk> <unk> .
his treatise upon " shades and shadows " has <unk> him .
he edited with distinguished ability the last edition of " south on the bones . "
he went early to college and studied <unk> .
he then came home , talked eternally , and played upon the <unk> .
he patronized the <unk> .
captain barclay , who walked against time , would not walk against him .
<unk> and <unk> were his favorite writers ,  his favorite artist , <unk> .
he died gloriously while <unk> gas  <unk> <unk> <unk> , like the <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
{ *1 } he was indubitably a "  " how can you ?  how  can  you ? "
 interrupted the object of my <unk> , gasping for breath , and tearing off , with a desperate exertion , the bandage around its jaws  " how can you , mr. <unk> , be so <unk> cruel as to pinch me in that manner by the nose ?
did you not see how they had fastened up my mouth  and you must know  if you know any thing  how vast a <unk> of breath i have to dispose of !
if you do not know , however , sit down and you shall see .
in my situation it is really a great relief to be able to open ones mouth  to be able to <unk>  to be able to communicate with a person like yourself , who do not think yourself called upon at every period to interrupt the thread of a gentleman 's discourse .
interruptions are annoying and should undoubtedly be abolished  do n't you think so ?  no reply , i beg you ,  one person is enough to be speaking at a <unk>  i shall be done by and by , and then you may <unk>  how the devil sir , did you get into this place ?  not a word i beseech you  been here some time myself  terrible accident !  heard of it , i suppose ?  awful calamity !  walking under your windows  some short while ago  about the time you were <unk>  horrible occurrence !  heard of " catching one 's breath , " eh ?  hold your tongue i tell you !  i caught somebody <unk> !  had always too much of my own  met <unk> at the corner of the street  would n't give me a chance for a word  could n't get in a syllable <unk>  attacked , consequently , with <unk>  <unk> made his escape  damn all fools !  they took me up for dead , and put me in this place  pretty doings all of them !  heard all you said about me  every word a lie  horrible !  wonderful  outrageous !  hideous !  incomprehensible !  et <unk>  et <unk>  et <unk>  et <unk> " it is impossible to conceive my astonishment at so unexpected a discourse , or the <name> with which i became gradually convinced that the breath so fortunately caught by the gentleman ( whom i soon recognized as my neighbor <unk> ) was , in fact , the identical expiration mislaid by myself in the conversation with my wife .
time , place , and circumstances rendered it a matter beyond question .
i did not at least during the long period in which the inventor of <unk> <unk> continued to favor me with his explanations .
in this respect i was actuated by that habitual <name> which has ever been my <unk> trait .
i reflected that many difficulties might still lie in the path of my preservation which only extreme exertion on my part would be able to <unk> .
many persons , i considered , are prone to estimate commodities in their possession  however valueless to the then proprietor  however troublesome , or distressing  in direct ratio with the advantages to be derived by others from their attainment , or by themselves from their abandonment .
might not this be the case with mr. <unk> ?
in displaying anxiety for the breath of which he was at present so willing to get rid , might i not lay myself open to the exactions of his avarice ?
there are scoundrels in this world , i remembered with a sigh , who <name> not scruple to take unfair opportunities with even a next door neighbor , and ( this remark is from <unk> ) it is precisely at that time when men are most anxious to throw off the burden of their own calamities that they feel the least desirous of relieving them in others .
upon considerations similar to these , and still retaining my grasp upon the nose of mr. w. , i accordingly thought proper to model my reply .
" monster ! "
i began in a tone of the deepest indignation  " monster and <unk> idiot !  dost thou , whom for thine <unk> it has pleased heaven to <unk> with a <unk> <unk>  dost thou , i say , presume to address me in the familiar language of an old acquaintance ?  'i lie , ' forsooth !
and 'hold my tongue , ' to be sure !  pretty conversation indeed , to a gentleman with a single breath !  all this , too , when i have it in my power to relieve the calamity under which thou dost so justly suffer  to curtail the <unk> of thine unhappy respiration . "
like brutus , i paused for a reply  with which , like a tornado , mr. <unk> immediately overwhelmed me .
<unk> followed upon <unk> , and apology upon apology .
there were no terms with which he was unwilling to comply , and there were none of which i failed to take the fullest advantage .
preliminaries being at length arranged , my acquaintance delivered me the respiration ; for which ( having carefully examined it ) i gave him afterward a receipt .
i am aware that by many i shall be held to blame for speaking in a manner so cursory , of a transaction so impalpable .
it <name> be thought that i should have entered more minutely , into the details of an occurrence by which  and this is very true  much new light might be thrown upon a highly interesting branch of physical philosophy .
to all this i am sorry that i can not reply .
a hint is the only answer which i am permitted to make .
there were circumstances  but i think it much safer upon consideration to say as little as possible about an affair so delicate  so delicate , i repeat , and at the time involving the interests of a third party whose sulphurous resentment i have not the least <name> , at this moment , of <unk> .
we were not long after this necessary arrangement in effecting an escape from the dungeons of the sepulchre .
the united strength of our <unk> voices was soon sufficiently apparent .
scissors , the whig editor , republished a treatise upon " the nature and origin of subterranean noises . "
a reply  rejoinder  <unk>  and justification  followed in the columns of a democratic gazette .
it was not until the opening of the vault to decide the controversy , that the appearance of mr. <unk> and myself proved both parties to have been decidedly in the wrong .
i can not conclude these details of some very singular passages in a life at all times sufficiently eventful , without again recalling to the attention of the reader the merits of that <unk> philosophy which is a sure and ready shield against those shafts of calamity which can neither be seen , felt nor fully understood .
it was in the spirit of this wisdom that , among the ancient <unk> , it was believed the gates of heaven would be inevitably opened to that sinner , or saint , who , with good lungs and implicit confidence , should <unk> the word " amen ! "
it was in the spirit of this wisdom that , when a great plague raged at athens , and every means had been in vain attempted for its removal , <unk> , as <unk> relates , in his second book , of that philosopher , advised the erection of a shrine and <name> " to the proper god . "
<unk> <name> .
the man that was used up .
a tale of the late <unk> and <unk> campaign .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , et <unk> vous en <unk> !  la <unk> ; de <name> vie a mis l ' <unk> au <unk> <unk> .
i can not just now remember when or where i first made the acquaintance of that truly fine-looking fellow , brevet brigadier general <name> a .
b. c. smith .
some one did introduce me to the gentleman , i am sure  at some public meeting , i know very well  held about something of great importance , no doubt  at some place or other , i feel convinced ,  whose name i have unaccountably forgotten .
the truth is  that the introduction was attended , upon my part , with a degree of anxious embarrassment which operated to prevent any definite impressions of either time or place .
i am <unk> nervous  this , with me , is a family failing , and i ca n't help it .
in especial , the slightest appearance of mystery  of any point i can not exactly comprehend  puts me at once into a pitiable state of agitation .
there was something , as it were , remarkable  yes , remarkable , although this is but a feeble term to express my full meaning  about the entire individuality of the personage in question .
he was , perhaps , six feet in height , and of a presence singularly commanding .
there was an air <unk> pervading the whole man , which spoke of high breeding , and hinted at high birth .
upon this topic  the topic of smith 's personal appearance  i have a kind of melancholy satisfaction in being minute .
his head of hair would have done honor to a brutus ;  nothing could be more richly flowing , or possess a brighter gloss .
it was of a <unk> black ;  which was also the color , or more properly the no color of his unimaginable whiskers .
you perceive i can not speak of these latter without enthusiasm ; it is not too much to say that they were the handsomest pair of whiskers under the sun .
at all events , they encircled , and at times partially overshadowed , a mouth utterly <unk> .
here were the most entirely even , and the most brilliantly white of all conceivable teeth .
from between them , upon every proper occasion , issued a voice of surpassing clearness , <name> , and strength .
in the matter of eyes , also , my acquaintance was <unk> endowed .
either one of such a pair was worth a couple of the ordinary <unk> organs .
they were of a deep <name> , exceedingly large and lustrous ; and there was perceptible about them , ever and anon , just that amount of interesting obliquity which gives <unk> to expression .
the bust of the general was unquestionably the finest bust i ever saw .
for your life you could not have found a fault with its wonderful proportion .
this rare peculiarity set off to great advantage a pair of shoulders which would have called up a blush of conscious inferiority into the countenance of the marble apollo .
i have a passion for fine shoulders , and may say that i never beheld them in perfection before .
the arms altogether were admirably modelled .
nor were the lower limbs less superb .
these were , indeed , the ne plus <unk> of good legs .
every <unk> in such matters admitted the legs to be good .
there was neither too much flesh , nor too little ,  neither rudeness nor <unk> .
i could not imagine a more graceful curve than that of the os <unk> , and there was just that due gentle prominence in the rear of the <unk> which goes to the conformation of a properly proportioned calf .
i wish to god my young and talented friend <unk> , the sculptor , had but seen the legs of brevet brigadier general <name> a .
b. c. smith .
but although men so absolutely fine-looking are neither as plenty as reasons or blackberries , still i could not bring myself to believe that the remarkable something to which i alluded just now ,  that the odd air of je ne sais <unk> which <name> about my new acquaintance ,  lay altogether , or indeed at all , in the supreme excellence of his bodily endowments .
perhaps it might be traced to the manner ;  yet here again i could not pretend to be positive .
there was a <unk> , not to say stiffness , in his carriage  a degree of measured , and , if i may so express it , of rectangular precision , attending his every movement , which , observed in a more diminutive figure , would have had the least little <unk> in the world , of affectation , <unk> or constraint , but which noticed in a gentleman of his undoubted dimensions , was readily placed to the account of reserve , <unk>  of a commendable sense , in short , of what is due to the dignity of colossal proportion .
the kind friend who presented me to general smith whispered in my ear some few words of comment upon the man .
he was a remarkable man  a very remarkable man  indeed one of the most remarkable men of the age .
he was an especial favorite , too , with the ladies  chiefly on account of his high reputation for courage .
" in that point he is <unk>  indeed he is a perfect desperado  a <unk> <unk> , and no mistake , " said my friend , here dropping his voice excessively low , and thrilling me with the mystery of his tone .
" a downright <unk> , and no mistake .
showed that , i should say , to some purpose , in the late tremendous <unk> away down south , with the <unk> and <unk> indians . "
[ here my friend opened his eyes to some extent . ]
" bless my soul !  blood and thunder , and all that !  prodigies of valor !  heard of him of course ?  you know he 's the man "  " man alive , how do you do ?
why , how are ye ?
very glad to see ye , indeed ! "
here interrupted the general himself , seizing my companion by the hand as he <name> near , and bowing stiffly , but profoundly , as i was presented .
i then thought , ( and i think so still , ) that i never heard a clearer nor a stronger voice , nor beheld a finer set of teeth : but i must say that i was sorry for the interruption just at that moment , as , owing to the whispers and insinuations aforesaid , my interest had been greatly excited in the hero of the <unk> and <unk> campaign .
however , the delightfully luminous conversation of brevet brigadier general <name> a .
b. c. smith soon completely dissipated this chagrin .
my friend leaving us immediately , we had quite a long <unk> , and i was not only pleased but really  instructed .
i never heard a more fluent talker , or a man of greater general information .
with becoming modesty , he <unk> , nevertheless , to touch upon the theme i had just then most at heart  i mean the mysterious circumstances attending the <unk> war  and , on my own part , what i conceive to be a proper sense of delicacy forbade me to <unk> the subject ; although , in truth , i was exceedingly tempted to do so .
i perceived , too , that the gallant soldier preferred topics of philosophical interest , and that he delighted , especially , in commenting upon the rapid march of mechanical invention .
indeed , lead him where i would , this was a point to which he invariably came back .
" there is nothing at all like it , " he would say ; " we are a wonderful people , and live in a wonderful age .
<unk> and <unk>  <unk> and <unk> !
our <unk> are upon every sea , and the nassau balloon packet is about to run regular trips ( fare either way only twenty pounds <name> ) between london and <unk> .
and who shall calculate the immense influence upon social life  upon arts  upon commerce  upon literature  which <name> be the immediate result of the great principles of <unk> <unk> !
nor , is this all , let me assure you !
there is really no end to the march of invention .
the most wonderful  the most ingenious  and let me add , mr.  mr.  thompson , i believe , is your name  let me add , i say , the most useful  the most truly useful mechanical contrivances , are daily springing up like mushrooms , if i may so express myself , or , more <unk> , like  ah  grasshoppers  like grasshoppers , mr. thompson  about us and ah  ah  ah  around us ! "
thompson , to be sure , is not my name ; but it is needless to say that i left general smith with a heightened interest in the man , with an exalted opinion of his conversational powers , and a deep sense of the valuable privileges we enjoy in living in this age of mechanical invention .
my curiosity , however , had not been altogether satisfied , and i resolved to prosecute immediate inquiry among my acquaintances touching the brevet brigadier general himself , and particularly respecting the tremendous events <unk> <unk> magna <unk> , during the <unk> and <unk> campaign .
the first opportunity which presented itself , and which ( <unk> <unk> ) i did not in the least scruple to seize , occurred at the church of the reverend doctor <unk> , where i found myself established , one <name> , just at sermon time , not only in the pew , but by the side , of that worthy and communicative little friend of mine , miss <name> t. thus seated , i congratulated myself , and with much reason , upon the very flattering state of affairs .
if any person knew anything about brevet brigadier general <name> a .
b. c. smith , that person , it was clear to me , was miss <name> t. we telegraphed a few signals , and then commenced , <unk> voce , a brisk <unk> .
" smith ! "
said she , in reply to my very <name> inquiry ; " smith !  why , not general <name> a .
b. c. ?
bless me , i thought you knew all about him !  this is a wonderfully inventive age !
horrid affair that !  a bloody set of wretches , those <unk> !  fought like a hero  prodigies of valor  immortal renown .
smith !  brevet brigadier general <name> a .
b. c. !
why , you know he 's the man "  " man , " here broke in doctor <unk> , at the top of his voice , and with a thump that came near knocking the pulpit about our ears ; " man that is born of a woman hath but a short time to live ; he cometh up and is cut down like a flower ! "
i started to the extremity of the pew , and perceived by the animated looks of the divine , that the wrath which had nearly proved fatal to the pulpit had been excited by the whispers of the <name> and myself .
there was no help for it ; so i submitted with a good <name> , and listened , in all the martyrdom of dignified silence , to the balance of that very capital discourse .
next evening found me a somewhat late visitor at the <unk> theatre , where i felt sure of satisfying my curiosity at once , by merely stepping into the box of those exquisite specimens of <unk> and <unk> , the misses arabella and <name> <unk> .
that fine <unk> , climax , was doing <unk> to a very crowded house , and i experienced some little difficulty in making my wishes understood ; especially , as our box was next the slips , and completely overlooked the stage .
" smith ? "
said miss arabella , as she at length comprehended the purport of my query ; " smith ?  why , not general <name> a .
b .
c. ? "
" smith ? "
inquired <name> , musingly .
" god bless me , did you ever behold a finer figure ? "
" never , madam , but do tell me "  " or so inimitable <name> ? "
" never , upon my word !  but pray inform me "  " or so just an appreciation of stage effect ? "
" madam ! "
" or a more delicate sense of the true beauties of shakespeare ?
be so good as to look at that leg ! "
" the devil ! "
and i turned again to her sister .
" smith ? "
said she , " why , not general <name> a .
b. c. ?
horrid affair that , was n't it ?  great wretches , those <unk>  savage and so on  but we live in a wonderfully inventive age !  smith !  o yes !
great man !  perfect desperado  immortal renown  prodigies of valor !
never heard !  " [ this was given in a scream . ]
" bless my soul !
why , he 's the man "  "   <unk> nor all the drowsy <unk> of the world shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep which thou <unk> yesterday ! "
here roared our climax just in my ear , and shaking his fist in my face all the time , in a way that i couldn't stand , and i wouldn't .
i left the misses <unk> immediately , went behind the scenes forthwith , and gave the <unk> scoundrel such a thrashing as i trust he <name> remember to the day of his death .
at the <unk> of the lovely widow , mrs. <name> <unk> , i was confident that i should meet with no similar disappointment .
accordingly , i was no sooner seated at the <unk> , with my pretty hostess for a <unk> , than i propounded those questions the solution of which had become a matter so essential to my peace .
" smith ? "
said my partner , " why , not general <name> a .
b. c. ?
horrid affair that , was n't it ?  diamonds , did you say ?  terrible wretches those <unk> !  we are playing whist , if you please , mr. <unk>  however , this is the age of invention , most certainly the age , one may say  the age par excellence  speak french ?  oh , quite a hero  perfect desperado !  no hearts , mr. <unk> ?
i do n't believe it !  immortal renown and all that !  prodigies of valor !
never heard !
!   why , bless me , he 's the man "  " mann ?  captain mann ? "
here screamed some little feminine <unk> from the farthest corner of the room .
" are you talking about captain mann and the duel ?  oh , i must hear  do tell  go on , mrs .
<unk> !  do now go on ! "
and go on mrs. <unk> did  all about a certain captain mann , who was either shot or <name> , or should have been both shot and <name> .
yes !
mrs. <unk> , she went on , and i  i went off .
there was no chance of hearing anything farther that evening in regard to brevet brigadier general <name> a .
b. c. smith .
still i consoled myself with the reflection that the tide of ill luck would not run against me forever , and so determined to make a bold push for information at the rout of that bewitching little <name> , the graceful mrs. <unk> .
" smith ? "
said mrs. p. , as we twirled about together in a pas de <unk> , " smith ?  why , not general <name> a .
b. c. ?
dreadful business that of the <unk> , was n't it ?  dreadful creatures , those indians !  do turn out your toes !
i really am ashamed of you  man of great courage , poor fellow !  but this is a wonderful age for invention  o dear me , i 'm out of breath  quite a desperado  prodigies of valor  never heard !
!   ca n't believe it  i shall have to sit down and enlighten you  smith !
why , he 's the man "  " <unk> , i tell you ! "
here bawled out miss <unk> , as i led mrs. <unk> to a seat .
" did ever anybody hear the like ?
it 's <unk> , i say , and not at all by any means <unk> . "
here miss <unk> beckoned to me in a very peremptory manner ; and i was obliged , <name> i <unk> i , to leave mrs. p. for the purpose of deciding a dispute touching the title of a certain poetical drama of lord <name> 's .
although i pronounced , with great promptness , that the true title was <unk> , and not by any means <unk> , yet when i returned to seek mrs. <unk> she was not to be discovered , and i made my retreat from the house in a very bitter spirit of animosity against the whole race of the <unk> .
matters had now assumed a really serious aspect , and i resolved to call at once upon my particular friend , mr. <name> <unk> ; for i knew that here at least i should get something like definite information .
" smith ? "
said he , in his well-known peculiar way of drawling out his syllables ; " smith ?  why , not general <name> a .
b. c. ?
savage affair that with the <unk> , was n't it ?
say !
do n't you think so ?  perfect <unk>  great pity , 'pon my honor !  wonderfully inventive age !  <unk> of valor !
by the by , did you ever hear about captain <unk> ? "
" captain mann be d  d ! "
said i ; " please to go on with your story . "
" hem !  oh well !  quite la <unk> <unk> , as we say in <name> .
smith , eh ?
<unk> <name> a .
b. c. ?
i say "  [ here mr. s. thought proper to put his finger to the side of his nose ]  " i say , you do n't mean to insinuate now , really and truly , and conscientiously , that you don't know all about that affair of smith 's , as well as i do , eh ?
smith ?
<name> <unk> ?
why , bless me , he 's the <unk> "  " mr .
<unk> , " said i , <unk> , " is he the man in the mask ? "
" <unk> ! "
said he , looking wise , " nor the man in the <unk> . "
this reply i considered a pointed and positive insult , and so left the house at once in high <unk> , with a firm resolve to call my friend , mr. <unk> , to a speedy account for his <unk> conduct and <unk> .
in the meantime , however , i had no notion of being thwarted touching the information i desired .
there was one resource left me yet .
i would go to the <unk> .
i would call forthwith upon the general himself , and demand , in explicit terms , a solution of this abominable piece of mystery .
here , at least , there should be no chance for <unk> .
i would be plain , positive , peremptory  as short as <unk>  as concise as <unk> or <unk> .
it was early when i called , and the general was dressing ; but i pleaded urgent business , and was shown at once into his <unk> by an old negro valet , who remained in attendance during my visit .
as i entered the chamber , i looked about , of course , for the occupant , but did not immediately perceive him .
there was a large and exceedingly <unk> bundle of something which lay close by my feet on the floor , and , as i was not in the best humor in the world , i gave it a kick out of the way .
" hem !
ahem !
rather civil that , i should say ! "
said the bundle , in one of the smallest , and altogether the funniest little voices , between a squeak and a whistle , that i ever heard in all the days of my existence .
" ahem !
rather civil that , i should observe . "
i fairly shouted with terror , and made off , at a <unk> , into the farthest extremity of the room .
" god bless me !
my dear fellow , " here again whistled the bundle , " what  what  what  why , what is the matter ?
i really believe you don't know me at all . "
what could i say to all this  what could i ?
i staggered into an arm-chair , and , with staring eyes and open mouth , awaited the solution of the wonder .
" strange you should n't know me though , is n't it ? "
presently <unk> the nondescript , which i now perceived was performing , upon the floor , some inexplicable evolution , very analogous to the drawing on of a stocking .
there was only a single leg , however , apparent .
" strange you should n't know me , though , is n't it ?
pompey , bring me that leg ! "
here pompey handed the bundle , a very capital cork leg , already dressed , which it screwed on in a trice ; and then it stood up before my eyes .
" and a bloody action it was , " continued the thing , as if in a soliloquy ; " but then one must n't fight with the <unk> and <unk> , and think of coming off with a mere scratch .
pompey , i 'll thank you now for that arm .
<name> " [ turning to me ] " is decidedly the best hand at a cork leg ; but if you should ever want an arm , my dear fellow , you must really let me recommend you to bishop . "
here pompey screwed on an arm .
" we had rather hot work of it , that you may say .
now , you dog , slip on my shoulders and bosom !
<unk> makes the best shoulders , but for a bosom you <name> have to go to <unk> . "
" bosom ! "
said i .
" pompey , <name> you never be ready with that wig ?
<unk> is a rough process after all ; but then you can procure such a capital scratch at de <unk> 's . "
" scratch ! "
" now , you nigger , my teeth !
for a good set of these you had better go to <unk> 's at once ; high prices , but excellent work .
i swallowed some very capital articles , though , when the big <unk> rammed me down with the butt end of his rifle . "
" butt end !
ram down ! !
my eye ! ! "
" o yes , <unk> , my eye  here , pompey , you scamp , screw it in !
those <unk> are not so very slow at a <unk> ; but he 's a belied man , that dr. <name> , after all ; you ca n't imagine how well i see with the eyes of his make . "
i now began very clearly to perceive that the object before me was nothing more nor less than my new acquaintance , brevet brigadier general <name> a .
b. c. smith .
the <unk> of pompey had made , i must confess , a very striking difference in the appearance of the personal man .
the voice , however , still puzzled me no little ; but even this apparent mystery was speedily cleared up .
" pompey , you black rascal , " squeaked the general , " i really do believe you would let me go out without my palate . "
hereupon , the negro , grumbling out an apology , went up to his master , opened his mouth with the knowing air of a <unk> , and adjusted therein a somewhat <unk> machine , in a very dexterous manner , that i could not altogether comprehend .
the alteration , however , in the entire expression of the general 's countenance was instantaneous and surprising .
when he again spoke , his voice had resumed all that <name> <name> and strength which i had noticed upon our original introduction .
" d  n the vagabonds ! "
said he , in so clear a tone that i positively started at the change , " d  n the vagabonds !
they not only knocked in the roof of my mouth , but took the trouble to cut off at least <unk> of my tongue .
there is n't <unk> 's equal , however , in <name> , for really good articles of this description .
i can recommend you to him with confidence , " [ here the general bowed , ] " and assure you that i have the greatest pleasure in so doing . "
i acknowledged his kindness in my best manner , and took leave of him at once , with a perfect understanding of the true state of affairs  with a full comprehension of the mystery which had troubled me so long .
it was evident .
it was a clear case .
brevet brigadier general <name> a .
b. c. smith was the man  was the man that was used up .
the business man method is the soul of <unk>  old saying .
i am a business man .
i am a methodical man .
method is the thing , after all .
but there are no people i more heartily despise than your eccentric fools who prate about method without understanding it ; attending strictly to its letter , and violating its spirit .
these fellows are always doing the most out-of-the-way things in what they call an orderly manner .
now here , i conceive , is a positive paradox .
true method <unk> to the ordinary and the obvious alone , and can not be applied to the <unk> .
what definite idea can a body attach to such expressions as " methodical <name> o ' dandy , " or " a <unk> <name> o ' the wisp " ?
